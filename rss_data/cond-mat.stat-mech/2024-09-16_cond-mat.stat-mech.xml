      <title>Fisher zeroes and dynamical quantum phase transitions for two- and three-dimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions are non-analyticities in a dynamical free energy (or return rate) which occur at critical times. Although extensively studied in one dimension, the exact nature of the non-analyticity in two and three dimensions has not yet been fully investigated. In two dimensions, results so far are known only for relatively simple two-band models. Here we study the general two- and three-dimensional cases. We establish the relation between the non-analyticities in different dimensions, and the functional form of the densities of Fisher zeroes. We show, in particular, that entering a critical region where the density of Fisher zeroes is non-zero at the boundary always leads to a cusp in the derivative of the return rate while the return rate itself is smooth. We illustrate our results by obtaining analytical results for exemplary two- and three-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Stretched-Exponential Melting of a Dynamically Frozen State Under Imprinted Phase Noise in the Ising Chain in a Transverse Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of dynamical freezing is a phenomenon where a suitable set of local observables freezes under a strong periodic drive in a quantum many-body system. This happens because of the emergence of approximate but perpetual conservation laws when the drive is strong enough. In this work, we probe the resilience of dynamical freezing to random perturbations added to the relative phases between the interfering states (elements of a natural basis) in the time-evolving wave function after each drive cycle. We study this in an integrable Ising chain in a time-periodic transverse field. Our key finding is, that the imprinted phase noise melts the dynamically frozen state, but the decay is "slow": a stretched-exponential decay rather than an exponential one. Stretched-exponential decays (also known as Kohlrausch relaxation) are usually expected in complex systems with time-scale hierarchies due to strong disorders or other inhomogeneities resulting in jamming, glassiness, or localization. Here we observe this in a simple translationally invariant system dynamically frozen under a periodic drive. Moreover, the melting here does not obliterate the entire memory of the initial state but leaves behind a steady remnant that depends on the initial conditions. This underscores the stability of dynamically frozen states.</description>

      <title>The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</description>

      <title>Competing random searchers under restarts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study independent searchers competing for a target under restarts and find that introduction of restarts tends to enhance the search efficiency of an already efficient searcher. As a result, the difference between the search probabilities of the individual searchers increases when the system is subject to restarts. This result holds true independent of the identity of individual searchers or the specific details of the distribution of restart times. However, when only one of a pair of searchers is subject to restarts while the other evolves in an unperturbed manner, a concept termed as subsystem restarts, we find that the search probability exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the restart rate. We also study the mean search time for a pair of run and tumble and Brownian searchers when only the run and tumble particle is subject to restarts. We find that, analogous to restarting the whole system, the mean search time exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on restart rates.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic thermalization by unitary time-evolution in the weakly perturbed two-dimensional Ising model --- An application of the Roos-Teufel-Tumulka-Vogel theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To demonstrate the implication of the recent important theorem by Roos, Teufel, Tumulka, and Vogel [1] in a simple but nontrivial example, we study thermalization in the two-dimensional Ising model in the low-temperature phase. We consider the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_L$ of the standard ferromagnetic Ising model with the plus boundary conditions and perturb it with a small self-adjoint operator $\lambda\hat{V}$ drawn randomly from the space of self-adjoint operators on the whole Hilbert space. Suppose that the system is initially in a classical spin configuration with a specified energy that may be very far from thermal equilibrium. It is proved that, for most choices of the random perturbation, the unitary time evolution $e^{-i(\hat{H}_L+\lambda\hat{V})t}$ brings the initial state into thermal equilibrium after a sufficiently long and typical time $t$, in the sense that the measurement result of the magnetization density at time $t$ almost certainly coincides with the spontaneous magnetization expected in the corresponding equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Steady States in the Weakly-Coupled XXZ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium steady states (NESSs) in the weakly-coupled XXZ model in contact with two heat baths at different temperatures. We show that the density matrix can be represented using only projection operators specified by the quantum numbers of the quantum group $U_q(sl_2)$ in a very good approximation. By using this property, we numerically calculate physical quantities such as temperature profile, energy current, and correlation functions, for the spin chain consisting of several hundred spins. We analytically derive the exact density matrix in the limit $q \rightarrow 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic response functions, namely the isothermal compressibility, the thermal pressure coefficient, and the thermal expansion coefficient, are calculated for a many-particle system interacting through a modified Morse potential. These calculations are based on an equation of state previously derived for a cell fluid model in the grand canonical ensemble. The calculated quantities are presented graphically as functions of density and the effective chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Geometric Control of Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter represents a class of non-equilibrium systems that constantly dissipate energy to produce directed motion. The thermodynamic control of active matter holds great potential for advancements in synthetic molecular motors, targeted drug delivery, and adaptive smart materials. However, the inherently non-equilibrium nature of active matter poses a significant challenge in achieving optimal control with minimal energy cost. In this work, we extend the concept of thermodynamic geometry, traditionally applied to passive systems, to active matter, proposing a systematic geometric framework for minimizing energy cost in non-equilibrium driving processes. We derive a cost metric that defines a Riemannian manifold for control parameters, enabling the use of powerful geometric tools to determine optimal control protocols. The geometric perspective reveals that, unlike in passive systems, minimizing energy cost in active systems involves a trade-off between intrinsic and external dissipation, leading to an optimal transportation speed that coincides with the self-propulsion speed of active matter. This insight enriches the broader concept of thermodynamic geometry. We demonstrate the application of this approach by optimizing the performance of an active monothermal engine within this geometric framework.</description>

      <title>Smart Resetting: An Energy-Efficient Strategy for Stochastic Search Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting, a method for accelerating target search in random processes, often incurs temporal and energetic costs. For a diffusing particle, a lower bound exists for the energetic cost of reaching the target, which is attained at low resetting rates and equals the direct linear transportation cost against fluid drag. Here, we study ``smart resetting," a strategy that aims to beat this lower bound. By strategically resetting the particle only when this benefits its progress toward the target, smart resetting leverages information to minimize energy consumption. We analytically calculate the energetic cost per mean first passage time and show that smart resetting consistently reduces the energetic cost compared to regular resetting. Surprisingly, smart resting achieves the minimum energy cost previously established for regular resetting, irrespective of the resetting rate. Yet, it fails to reduce this cost further. We extend our findings in two ways: first, by examining nonlinear energetic cost functions, and second, by considering smart resetting of drift-diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Specific heat of the driven Curie-Weiss model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying a time-periodic magnetic field to the standard ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss model brings the spin system in a steady out-of-equilibrium condition. We recall how the hysteresis gets influenced by the amplitude and the frequency of that field, and how an amplitude- and frequency-dependent (dynamical) critical temperature can be discerned. The dissipated power measures the area of the hysteresis loop and changes with temperature. The excess heat determines a nonequilibrium specific heat giving the quasistatic response. We compute that specific heat, which appears to diverge at the critical temperature, quite different from the equilibrium case.</description>

      <title>On interactive anisotropic walks in two dimensions generated from a three state opinion dynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of interacting walkers on a two-dimensional space where the dynamics of each walker are governed by the opinions of agents of a three-state opinion dynamics model are considered. Such walks, inspired by Ising-like models and opinions dynamics models, are usually considered in one-dimensional virtual spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along the $y$ axis while it can move either way along the $x$ axis. We explore the properties of such walks as the parameter representing the noise in the opinion dynamics model, responsible for a continuous phase transition, is varied. The walk features show marked differences as the system crosses the critical point. The bivariate distribution of the displacements below the critical point is a modified biased Gaussian function of x and y which is symmetric about the X axis.
  The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well as in the exponents.</description>

      <title>Full distribution of local observables in an exactly solvable current carrying steady states of a driven XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current carrying steady states of interacting spins chains exhibit rich structures generated through an interplay of current induced correlations and energetic constraints from the Hamiltonian. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to maximally polarizing Lindblad terms admits an exact solution in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations and distributions of simple local spin observables in the non equilibrium steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy per site, cumulant generating functions for distributions of local observables in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS solution in systems with $\Delta&gt;0$, to numerically exactly calculate the entropy, correlations, as well as distributions of spin observables in blocks as large as $n\sim 200$ sites allowing an estimation of the rate functions. The $z$ magnetization distribution is consistant with short range spin correlations in the $z$ direction while the $x$-magnetization shows a double peak structure at larger $\Delta$ suggesting short range ferromagnetic ordering. We find that the distribution of $z$-magnetization sharpens for parameters where the current is maximized.</description>

      <title>Universal thermalization dynamics in (1+1)d QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the universal mechanism behind the thermalization of (1+1)d QFTs at high and low temperatures. Viewing these theories as CFTs perturbed by relevant or irrelevant deformations, we show that conformal perturbation theory in the thermal state breaks down at late times allowing for the emergence of hydrodynamics. This breakdown occurs universally due to the unsuppressed exchange of stress tensors near the lightcone. Furthermore, for theories with central charge $c\rightarrow\infty$ we solve for the emergent hydrodynamic theory to all orders in the gradient expansion by arguing that all transport parameters appearing in two-point functions have universal expressions in terms of the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the perturbation. The radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic dispersion relations provides an early time cutoff for hydrodynamics, which agrees with the time scale at which conformal perturbation theory breaks down.</description>

      <title>Winding Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their ubiquity, systematic characterization of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold exceptional points (EP$n$s), remains a significant unsolved problem. In this article, we characterize Abelian topology of eigenvalues for generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s for arbitrary $n$. The former and the latter emerge in a $(2n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-dimensional parameter space, respectively. By introducing resultant winding numbers, we elucidate that these EP$n$s are stable due to topology of a map from a base space (momentum or parameter space) to a sphere defined by these resultants. Our framework implies fundamental doubling theorems of both generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s in $n$-band models.</description>

      <title>Symmetry operations and Critical Behaviour in Classical to Quantum Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Construction of quantum analogs starting from classical stochastic processes have been previously introduced. In this paper, we generate a large class of self contained quantum extensions by symmetry operations. We show that the relaxation processes for different quantum extensions are different and that is supported by the measure of coherence, the the probability of reaching the equilibrium, decay of the domain walls and purity. However, the coherence measure based on the L1-norm does not capture the speed of the relaxation process. We also show that the finite size scaling of coherence exists for both short and long times.</description>

      <title>Social Influence and Consensus Building: Introducing a q-Voter Model with Weighted Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a dynamical model of opinion formation in which an individual's opinion is influenced by interactions with a group of other agents. We introduce a bias towards one of the opinions in a manner not considered earlier to the best of our knowledge. When the bias is neutral, the model is reduced to a mean-field voter model. We analyze the behavior and steady states of the system, identifying three distinct regimes based on the bias level: one favoring negative opinions, one favoring positive opinions, and a neutral case. In large systems, the equilibrium properties become independent of the size of the group, indicating that only the bias influences the final outcome. However, for small groups, the time to reach equilibrium depends on the size of the group. Our results show that even a small initial bias leads to a consensus where all agents eventually share the same opinion when the bias is not neutral. The system exhibits universal behavior, with critical slowing down occurring near the neutral bias point, marking it as a critical dynamical threshold. The time required to reach consensus scales logarithmically when the bias is non-neutral and linearly when it is neutral. Although short-term dynamics depends on group size for small groups, long-term behavior is governed solely by the bias.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transition and underlying symmetry breaking via entanglement entropy scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of the novel phases and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter physics. Thanks to our newly developed bipartite-reweight-annealing algorithm, we can systematically study EE behaviors near both first and second-order phase transition points of two-dimensional strongly correlated systems by scanning the EE across a large parameter region, which was super difficult previously due to the huge computation resources demanded. Interestingly, we find that the EE or its derivative diverges at the critical point, which essentially reveals the phase transition involving discrete or continuous symmetry breaking. What's more, we observe that the peak of the EE curve can detect first-order phase transitions at high symmetry breaking points, separating phases with lower symmetry broken. This behavior also applies to the symmetry-enhanced first-order phase transition in the two-dimensional chequerboard $J-Q$ model, where the emergent higher symmetry arises from the related deconfined criticality beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. This work points to new phenomena and mechanisms that can help us better identify different phase transitions and the underlying symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changing some of its parameters over time is a paradigmatic way of driving an otherwise isolated many-body quantum system out of equilibrium, and a vital ingredient for building quantum computers and simulators. Here, we further develop a recently proposed nonlinear response theory which is based on typicality and random-matrix methods, and which is applicable to a wide variety of such parametrically perturbed systems in and out of equilibrium: We derive analytical approximations of the characteristic response function for the two limiting cases of fast driving and of strong and short-ranged-in-energy driving. Furthermore, we work out implications and predictions for common applications, including finite-time quenches and time-dependent forcing that breaks conservation laws of the underlying undriven system. Finally, we verify all predictions by numerical examples and discuss the theory's scope and limitations.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of first sound in a weakly interacting ultracold Fermi liquid: an exact calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At low temperature, a normal gas of unpaired spin-1/2 fermions is one of the cleanest realizations of a Fermi liquid. It is described by Landau's theory, where no phenomenological parameters are needed as the quasiparticle interaction function can be computed perturbatively in powers of the scattering length $a$, the sole parameter of the short-range interparticle interactions. Obtaining an accurate solution of the transport equation nevertheless requires a careful treatment of the collision kernel, as the uncontrolled error made by the relaxation time approximations increases when the temperature $T$ drops below the Fermi temperature. Here, we study sound waves in the hydrodynamic regime up to second order in the Chapman-Enskog's expansion. We find that the frequency $\omega_q$ of the sound wave is shifted above its linear depart as $\omega_q=c_1 q(1+\alpha q^2\tau^2)$ where $c_1$ and $q$ are the speed and wavenumber of the wave and the typical collision time $\tau$ scales as $1/a^2T^2$. Besides the shear viscosity, the coefficient $\alpha$ is described by a single second-order collision time which we compute exactly from an analytical solution of the transport equation, resulting in a positive dispersion $\alpha&gt;0$. Our results suggest that ultracold atomic Fermi gases are an ideal experimental system for quantitative tests of second order hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Molecular Dynamics through Informed Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a procedure for enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics simulations through informed stochastic resetting. Many phenomena, such as protein folding and crystal nucleation, occur over time scales that are inaccessible using standard simulation methods. We recently showed that stochastic resetting can accelerate molecular simulations that exhibit broad transition time distributions. However, standard stochastic resetting does not exploit any information about the reaction progress. Here, we demonstrate that an informed resetting protocol leads to greater accelerations than standard stochastic resetting, both for molecular dynamics and Metadynamics simulations. This is achieved by resetting only when a certain condition is met, e.g., when the distance from the target along the reaction coordinate is larger than some threshold. We then employ recently obtained theoretical results to identify the condition that leads to the greatest acceleration and to infer the unbiased mean transition time from accelerated simulations. Our work significantly extends the applicability of stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling of molecular simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a field theory for RNA-like polymers with periodic base sequence GCGCG..., where only single-strands aligned in the same direction form double strands. The field theory is derived from a lattice model that incorporates excluded volume effects, base sequence, and temperature dependent renaturation/denaturation.
  The artificial directionality leads to a novel universality class, not related to conventional branched polymers and Lee-Yang field theory. This universality class is unstable against natural pairing, where oppositely aligned single-strands form double strands. The denaturation/renaturation transition is a continuous crossover between two $\varphi_{n=0}^{4}$ critical points and the critical point of the new universality class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum chaos is of profound theoretical interest and carries significant implications for various applications, from condensed matter physics to quantum error correction. Recently, out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs) have emerged as a powerful tool to quantify quantum chaos. For a given quantum system, the OTOCs measure incompatibility between an operator evolved in the Heisenberg picture and an unevolved operator. In the first part of this thesis, we employ OTOCs to study the dynamical sensitivity of a perturbed non-Komogorov-Arnold-Moser (non-KAM) system in the quantum limit as the parameter that characterizes the $\textit{resonance}$ condition is slowly varied. For this purpose, we consider a quantized kicked harmonic oscillator (KHO) model that displays stochastic webs in the phase space. The OTOC analysis is followed by a study of quantum Fisher information (QFI) at the resonances and a comparison with the non-resonance cases. We shall show that scaling of the QFI in time is enhanced at the resonances, making the dynamics of the non-KAM systems good candidates for quantum sensing. In the following chapter, we study the OTOCs in a bipartite system of kicked coupled tops with a special focus on the mixed phase space OTOC dynamics. The last part of the thesis is devoted to the study of the emergence of quantum state designs as a signature of quantum chaos and the role of symmetries in this phenomenon. Recently proposed projected ensemble framework utilizes quantum chaos as a resource to construct approximate higher-order state designs. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetries on the emergence of quantum state designs remain under-explored. We thoroughly investigate this by demonstrating the interplay between symmetries and measurements in constructing approximate state designs. Finally, we outline a few open directions relevant to the current thesis.</description>

      <title>Tracking the variation of entanglement R\'enyi negativity: an efficient quantum Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) has achieved huge success in pure ground states of quantum many-body systems, numerical explorations on mixed states remain limited, despite the fact that most real-world systems are non-isolated. Meanwhile, entanglement negativity, as a rarely computable entanglement monotone for mixed states, is significant in characterizing mixed-state entanglement, such as in systems with two disconnected regions, dissipation or at finite temperature. However, efficient numerical approaches are scarce to calculate this quantity in large-scale and high-dimensional systems, especially when we need to access how it varies with certain parameters to study critical behaviors. Within the reweight-annealing frame, we present an accessible and efficient QMC algorithm, which is able to achieve the values as well as tracking the variation of the R\'enyi version of entanglement negativity on some specified parameter path. Our algorithm makes it feasible to directly study the role that entanglement plays at the critical point and in different phases for mixed states in high dimensions numerically. In addition, this method is accessible and easy to parallelize on computers. Through this method, different intrinsic mechanisms in quantum and thermal criticalities with the same universal class have been revealed clearly through the numerical calculations on R\'enyi negativity.</description>

Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral Luttinger liquid develops quantum chaos as soon as a -- however slight -- nonlinear dispersion is introduced for the microscopic electronic degrees of freedom. For this nonlinear version of the model, we identify an infinite family of translation-invariant interaction potentials that display increasing degrees of Hilbert space fragmentation. We corroborate this result by studying entanglement entropy and level statistics. We also develop a systematic understanding of the unconventional symmetries giving rise to fragmentation and use them to classify the possible fragmentation patterns. In particular, this approach allows us to predict the analytic block sizes and derive asymptotic scaling laws in the limit of large total momentum.</description>

      <title>Role of kinematic constraints in the time reversal symmetry breaking of a model active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active-matter systems are inherently out-of-equilibrium and perform mechanical work by utilizing their internal energy sources. Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non-equilibrium dynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive, quantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in collision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised of battery-powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes of motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure characterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by kinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this measure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An energetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes from our demonstration of a non-trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a potentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a many-body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate the emergence of activity-induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.</description>

Abstract: Based on a synthesis of three main ingredients: (i) the Shannon information in nonequilibrium systems, (ii) the semiclassical energy-time quantization rule, and (iii) the quasistatic information-energy correspondence, a new general rule for the quantization of quasistatic information states supported by an environment away from equilibrium is introduced if the history of the environment is known as a function of time in terms of its thermodynamic potential for information $T(t)\Delta S(t)$ that is a free energy measuring the distance from equilibrium $\Delta S(t)$, and $T(t)$ is the mean temperature of the environment at time $t$. This all new quasistatic information-time quantization rule is applied to the expanding universe using a phenomenological thermodynamic potential for information in the matter dominated era in order to find the eigen-informations of the persistent structures that are supported by the universe (or the local environments therein) at any given epoch, thus providing an information-theoretic foundation for formation of structures and rise of complexity with time that embodies the cosmic evolution as epitomized by the late Wheeler's famous conjecture ``{\it it from bit}". This theoretical procedure must also open new avenues for further research into the quantum theory of information and complexity in nonequilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Universal phenomenology at critical exceptional points of nonequilibrium $O(N)$ models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In thermal equilibrium the dynamics of phase transitions is largely controlled by fluctuation-dissipation relations: On the one hand, friction suppresses fluctuations, while on the other hand the thermal noise is proportional to friction constants. Out of equilibrium, this balance dissolves and one can have situations where friction vanishes due to antidamping in the presence of a finite noise level. We study a wide class of $O(N)$ field theories where this situation is realized at a phase transition, which we identify as a critical exceptional point. In the ordered phase, antidamping induces a continuous limit cycle rotation of the order parameter with an enhanced number of $2N-3$ Goldstone modes. Close to the critical exceptional point, however, fluctuations diverge so strongly due to the suppression of friction that in dimensions $d&lt;4$ they universally either destroy a preexisting static order, or give rise to a fluctuation-induced first order transition. This is demonstrated within a non-perturbative approach based on Dyson-Schwinger equations for $N=2$, and a generalization for arbitrary $N$, which can be solved exactly in the long wavelength limit. We show that in order to realize this physics it is not necessary to drive a system far out of equilibrium: Using the peculiar protection of Goldstone modes, the transition from an $xy$ magnet to a ferrimagnet is governed by an exceptional critical point once weakly perturbed away from thermal equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: The equipartition theorem is a fundamental law of classical statistical physics, which states that every degree of freedom contributes $k_{B}T/2$ to the energy, where $T$ is the temperature and $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. Recent studies have revealed the existence of a quantum version of the equipartition theorem. In the present work,we focus on how to obtain the quantum counterpart of the generalized equipartition theorem for arbitrary quadratic systems in which the multimode Brownian ocillators interact with multiple reservoirs at the same temperature. An alternative method of deriving the energy of the system is also discussed and compared with the result of the the quantum version of the equipartition theorem, after which we conclude that the latter is more reasonable. Our results can be viewed as an indispensable generalization of rencent works on a quantum version of the equipartition theorem.</description>

      <title>Quantum Counterpart of Equipartition Theorem: A M\"obius Inversion Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equipartition theorem is crucial in classical statistical physics, and recent studies have revealed its quantum counterpart for specific systems. This raises the question: does a quantum counterpart of the equipartition theorem exist for any given system, and if so, what is its concrete form? In this Letter, we employ the M\"obius inversion approach to address these questions, providing a criterion to determine whether a system adheres to the quantum counterpart of the equipartition theorem. If it does, the corresponding distribution function can be readily derived. Furthermore, we construct the fermionic version of the criterion in a manner analogous to the bosonic case.</description>

Abstract: We propose a statistical physics model of a neutral community, where each agent can represent identical plant species growing in the vertical direction with sunlight in the form of rich-get-richer competition. Disturbance added to this ecosystem, which makes an agent restart from the lowest growth level, is realized as a stochastic resetting. We show that in this model for sufficiently strong competition, vertical diversity characterized by a family of Hill numbers robustly emerges as a local maximum at intermediate disturbance.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamic Integration: Free Energies from Energy-based Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic integration (TI) offers a rigorous method for estimating free-energy differences by integrating over a sequence of interpolating conformational ensembles. However, TI calculations are computationally expensive and typically limited to coupling a small number of degrees of freedom due to the need to sample numerous intermediate ensembles with sufficient conformational-space overlap. In this work, we propose to perform TI along an alchemical pathway represented by a trainable neural network, which we term Neural TI. Critically, we parametrize a time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between the interacting and non-interacting systems, and optimize its gradient using a score matching objective. The ability of the resulting energy-based diffusion model to sample all intermediate ensembles allows us to perform TI from a single reference calculation. We apply our method to Lennard-Jones fluids, where we report accurate calculations of the excess chemical potential, demonstrating that Neural TI reproduces the underlying changes in free energy without the need for simulations at interpolating Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-preserving deformations of integrable spin chains with open boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The remaining parts of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for the ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

      <title>Forces from coarse-graining nonequilibrium degrees of freedom: exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study paradigmatic examples of a tracer trapped in a harmonic potential and coupled to a bath particle of various types. Restricting to linear couplings between tracer and bath allows for analytical treatment. We discuss the resulting stochastic Langevin equation for the tracer and its relaxation function, for which this equation is averaged under an initial tracer position. For equilibrium, the tracer-bath force on average vanishes, a well known consequence of Boltzmann statistics. If tracer and bath are subject to different temperatures, the conditioned tracer-bath force is finite, and can be as large in magnitude as the force between tracer and trapping potential. For a bath particle with intrinsic memory, e.g., an active particle, even the noise felt by the bath particle takes a finite average under conditioning of the tracer. If the noise of the bath particle is non-Gaussian, the relaxation function of the tracer can be non-monotonic as a function of time. We display how these phenomena are reflected in the Langevin equation of the tracer.</description>

      <title>Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</description>

      <title>What will be the Euclidean dimension of an Ising ferromagnetic cubic shell?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of an Ising ferromagnetic cubic shell have been extensively studied by Monte Carlo simulation using Metropolis single spin flip algorithm. Although, geometrically the Euclidean dimension of the cubical shell is three, interestingly, the Ising ferromagnetic cubic shell undergoes ferromagnetic phase transition at a temperature which is very close to that for two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. Surprisingly, the Ising ferromagnetic cubic shell shows a strange (neither exponential nor stretched exponential) kind of relaxation behaviour, instead of exponential relaxation as usually observed in the two dimensional Ising ferromagnet. The metastable lifetime of a ferromagnetic Ising cubical shell is studied as a function of the applied magnetic field. Here also, the cubic shell behaves more likely a two-dimensional object as found from statistical analysis and comparison with Becker-D\"oring prediction of classical nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants set the observability and operation of phase and other transitions and increase entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approaching the problem of understanding fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with discussing the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. In this Perspective, we discuss a wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss second-order phase transitions including structural and superconducting transitions and first-order transitions including melting and boiling. We also discuss metastable states, transitions between them, chemical reactions and their products. An interesting byproduct of this discussion is that the order of magnitude of the transition temperature can be calculated from FPCs. We show that the new states emerging as a result of various transitions increase the phase space and entropy. Were FPCs to take different values, these transitions would become inoperative at our environmental conditions and the new states due to these transitions would not emerge. This suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling various transitions and reactions which give rise to new states, promote entropy increase. We propose that this is a general effect that applies to different levels of structure in the Universe.</description>

It consists in optimizing a linear combination of the costs for all the possible $N$'s, while fixing a certain linear combination of the corresponding marginals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Shannon entropy of the total system and its subsystems, as well as the subsystem Shannon mutual information, in quasiparticle excited states of free bosonic and fermionic chains and the ferromagnetic phase of the spin-1/2 XXX chain. For single-particle and double-particle states, we derive various analytical formulas for free bosonic and fermionic chains in the scaling limit. These formulas are also applicable to certain magnon excited states in the XXX chain in the scaling limit. We also calculate numerically the Shannon entropy and mutual information for triple-particle and quadruple-particle states in bosonic, fermionic, and XXX chains. We discover that Shannon entropy, unlike entanglement entropy, typically does not separate for quasiparticles with large momentum differences. Moreover, in the limit of large momentum difference, we obtain universal quantum bosonic and fermionic results that are generally distinct and cannot be explained by a semiclassical picture.</description>

      <title>Emergent generalized symmetries in ordered phases and applications to quantum disordering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05730v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the rich landscape of higher-form and non-invertible symmetries that emerge at low energies in generic ordered phases. Using that their charge is carried by homotopy defects (i.e., domain walls, vortices, hedgehogs, etc.), in the absence of domain walls we find that their symmetry defects in ${D}$-dimensional spacetime are described by ${(D-1)}$-representations of a ${(D-1)}$-group that depends only on the spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) pattern of the ordered phase. These emergent symmetries are not spontaneously broken in the ordered phase. We show that spontaneously breaking them induces a phase transition into a nontrivial disordered phase that can have symmetry-enriched (non-)abelian topological orders, photons, and even more emergent symmetries. This SSB transition is between two distinct SSB phases$\unicode{x2013}$an ordinary and a generalized one$\unicode{x2013}$making it a possible generalized deconfined quantum critical point. We also investigate the 't Hooft anomalies of these emergent symmetries and conjecture that there is always a mixed anomaly between them and the microscopic symmetry spontaneously broken in the ordered phase. One way this anomaly can manifest is through the fractionalization of the microscopic symmetry's quantum numbers. Our results demonstrate that even the most exotic generalized symmetries emerge in ordinary phases and provide a valuable framework for characterizing them and their transitions.</description>

      <title>Multiple quantum Mpemba effect: exceptional points and oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01347v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of exceptional points and complex eigenvalues on the occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect. To this end, we study a two-level driven dissipative system subjected to an oscillatory electric field and dissipative coupling with the environment. We find that both exceptional points and complex eigenvalues can lead to $multiple$ quantum Mpemba effect. It occurs in an observable when time evolved copies corresponding to two different initial conditions, one initially having higher observable value compared to the other and both relaxing towards the same steady state, intersect each other more than once during their relaxation process. Each of the intersections denotes a quantum Mpemba effect and marks the reversal of identities between the two copies i.e. the copy with higher observable value before the intersection becomes the lower valued copy (and vice versa) after the intersection. Such multiple intersections originate from additional algebraic time dependence at the exceptional points and due to oscillatory relaxation in the case of complex eigenvalues. We provide analytical results for quantum Mpemba effect in the density matrix in presence of coherence. Depending on the control parameters (drive and dissipation), observables such as energy, von Neumann entropy, temperature etc. exhibit either single or multiple quantum Mpemba effect. However, the distance from steady state measured in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence shows only single quantum Mpemba effect although the corresponding speed gives rise to either single or multiple quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawking's discovery that black holes can evaporate through radiation emission has posed a number of questions that with time became fundamental hallmarks for a quantum theory of gravity. The most famous one is likely the information paradox, which finds an elegant explanation in the Page argument suggesting that a black hole and its radiation can be effectively represented by a random state of qubits. Leveraging the same assumption, we ponder the extent to which a black hole may display emergent symmetries, employing the entanglement asymmetry as a modern, information-based indicator of symmetry breaking. We find that for a random state devoid of any symmetry, a $U(1)$ symmetry emerges and it is exact in the thermodynamic limit before the Page time. At the Page time, the entanglement asymmetry shows a finite jump to a large value. Our findings imply that the emitted radiation is symmetric up to the Page time and then undergoes a sharp transition. Conversely the black hole is symmetric only after the Page time.</description>

Abstract: We discover an instability mechanism in suspensions of self-propelled particles that does not involve active stress. Instead, it is driven by a subtle interplay of inertia, swimmer motility, and concentration fluctuations, through a crucial time lag between the velocity and the concentration field. The resulting time-persistent state seen in our high-resolution numerical simulations consists of self-sustained waves of concentration and orientation, transiting from regular oscillations to wave turbulence. We analyze the statistical features of this active turbulence, including an intriguing connection to the Batchelor spectrum of passive scalars.</description>

      <title>Queued quantum collision models</title>

Abstract: Collision models describe the sequential interactions of a system with independent ancillas. Motivated by recent advances in neutral atom arrays, in this Letter we investigate a model where the ancillas are governed by a classical controller that allows them to queue up while they wait for their turn to interact with the system. The ancillas can undergo individual open dynamics while they wait, which could cause them to, e.g., decohere. The system, which plays the role of the server in the queue, can also undergo its own open dynamics whenever it is idle. We show that this framework greatly generalizes existing approaches for quantum collision models, recovering the deterministic and stochastic formulations in the appropriate limits. Next, we show how the combination of queueing dynamics with quantum collisions introduces rich dynamical phenomena, including phase transitions and a sharp dependence on the queue statistics.</description>

      <title>Dispersionless Flat Mode and Vibrational Anomaly in Active Brownian Vibrators Induced by String-like Dynamical Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, active Brownian particles have emerged as a prominent model system for comprehending the behaviors of active matter, wherein particles demonstrate self-propelled motion by harnessing energy from the surrounding environment. A fundamental objective of studying active matter is to elucidate the physical mechanisms underlying its collective behaviors. Drawing inspiration from advancements in molecular glasses, our study unveils a low-energy ``flat mode" within the transverse spectrum of active Brownian vibrators -- a nearly two-dimensional, bi-disperse granular assembly. We demonstrate that this collective excitation induces an anomalous excess in the vibrational density of states (VDOS) beyond the phononic Debye contribution. We characterize the properties of this flat mode by exploring the parameter space of our experimental system and tuning the packing fraction, the vibrational frequency, the particle size ratio and the mixture ratio. Additionally, we establish through empirical evidence that string-like dynamical defects, discerned via the spatial distribution of each particle's contribution to the reduced transverse VDOS, serve as the microscopic origin of the flat mode and its associated anomalies.</description>

      <title>Modulating Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems and Crystalline Topological Phases Protected by Generalized Magnetic Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

      <title>Bipartite OTOC in open quantum systems: information scrambling and irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of information scrambling has seen significant growth over the last decade, where the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has emerged as a prominent tool to probe it. In this work, we use bipartite OTOC, a particular form of OTOC, to study information scrambling in the atom-field interaction models and the model of the Ising spin chain interacting with a tilted magnetic field. This is done considering the effects of open quantum systems. A relationship between information scrambling, using bipartite OTOC, and irreversibility, using entropy production, is probed under unitary dynamics. The equivalence of bipartite OTOC with operator entanglement is explicitly shown for the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Power-Law-Exponential Interaction Induced Quantum Spiral Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict a kind of power-law-exponential (PLE) dipole-dipole interaction between quantum emitters in a 1D waveguide QED system. This unconventional long-range interaction is the combination of power-law growth and exponential decay couplings. Applying PLE interaction to a spin model, we uncover the rich many-body phases. Most remarkably, we find that PLE interaction can induce the ordered and critical spiral phases. These spiral phases emerge from the strong frustration generated by the power-law factor of PLE interaction, hence they are absent for other types of long-range interaction, e.g., pure exponential and power-law decay interactions. Our work is also applicable for the higher dimensional systems. It fundamentally broadens the realm of many-body physics and has the significant applications in quantum simulation of strong correlated matters.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise on quantum circuit realization of non-Hermitian time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum dynamics lie in an intermediate regime between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and trace-preserving non-unitary open quantum system dynamics. Given differences in the noise tolerance of unitary and non-unitary dynamics, it is interesting to consider implementing non-Hermitian dynamics on a noisy quantum computer. In this paper, we do so for a non-Hermitian Ising Floquet model whose many-body dynamics gives rise to persistent temporal oscillations, a form of time crystallinity. In the simplest two qubit case that we consider, there is an infinitely long-lived periodic steady state at certain fine-tuned points. These oscillations remain reasonably long-lived over a range of parameters in the ideal non-Hermitean dynamics and for the levels of noise and imperfection expected of modern day quantum devices. Using a generalized Floquet analysis, we show that infinitely long-lived oscillations are generically lost for arbitrarily weak values of common types of noise and compute corresponding damping rate. We perform simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform to confirm our findings; however, experiments on a real device (ibmq-lima) do not show remnants of these oscillations.</description>
