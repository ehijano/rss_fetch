      <title>The HST Ultraviolet Spectrum of V723 Mon: Additional Evidence of a Stellar Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V723 Mon is a high mass function (f=1.7Msun) single lined spectroscopic binary with a red giant primary that Jayasinghe et al. (2021) suggested had a black hole as its massive companion. Unfortunately, el-Badry et al. (2022) demonstrated that it had a hotter stellar companion whose detectability in optical spectra was difficult due to its rapid rotation. Here we confirm the presence of the stellar companion with a Hubble Space Telescope STIS ultraviolet spectrum.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Dust Evolution and Vertical Transport in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial is an introduction to observational studies of dust transport and evolution in protoplanetary disks. Spatially resolved observations of disks at multiple wavelengths can allow to infer the distribution of various dust grains and gas species. Combining these observations offers a more complete understanding of dust structure and properties across different disk locations. For example, by better characterizing the disk vertical structure, observations help to constrain the level of vertical settling and identify regions of high dust density, which are favorable for grain growth and planet formation. This tutorial describes various methodologies for inferring dust properties and vertical height of different tracers, as an introduction for beginners.</description>

      <title>Central-star extinctions towards planetary nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae trace the hottest and most luminous phase of evolution of solar-type stars. We use these hot, bright stars to investigate extinctions towards a complete sample of 262 confirmed PNe with large angular diameters, which have the most reliable photometry and hottest central stars. For 162 of these PNe, we identify central stars, produce spectral energy distributions from survey data using PySSED, then fit reddened model spectra to the observed photometry to obtain extinctions accurate down to $E(B-V)$ of $\pm 0.02$ mag. The fitting is performed by Nelder-Mead $\chi^2$ minimisation, with uncertainties evaluated through MCMC. The catalogue of stellar temperatures is updated for our sample for the calculation of luminosities. The extinctions agree well with interstellar extinction. We find evidence of circumnebular extinction for one PN, and evaluate its effect on the planetary nebulae luminosity function. Four new close binaries are identified from the spectral energy distributions. The binary fraction in the full sample is between 23% and 36%. We use our compiled data to evaluate the quality of the central star identifications in the literature. Three objects in our sample have previously been classified as post-RGB systems but we find that their parameters may also be consistent with post-AGB evolution.</description>

      <title>A candidate to the long sought optical counterpart to the Rapid Burster in the bulge fossil fragment Liller 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the possible identification of the optical counterpart of the Rapid Burster MXB 1730-335 in the stellar system Liller 1. The identification was performed by taking advantage of a set of images acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys in the optical band, and with the Gemini South Telescope in the near-infrared. The analysis of these images revealed the presence of a star with a position possibly compatible with the X-ray and radio band coordinates of the Rapid Burster, and showing significant optical variability. According to its location in the color-magnitude diagram, the candidate companion appears to belong to the young (~ 1-2 Gyr old) super-solar metallicity ([M/H]= +0.3) sub-population recently discovered in Liller 1. We discuss the main characteristics of the candidate counterpart and the Rapid Burster binary system as derived from the available data, also highlighting the need for further coordinated observations to solidly confirm their association and better clarify their physical properties.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Magnetic Patches in Solar Active Regions Using the Complex Network Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying solar active regions (ARs), which consist of one or more pairs of magnetic patches with opposite polarities, is essential due to their significant role in dynamic solar atmospheric phenomena. In this study, we analyze ARs during their emergence and evolution on the solar surface using a complex network-based method known as Identifying Solar Magnetic Patches (ISMP). To examine the magnetic characteristics, we selected a subregion of 125 $\times$ 125 pixels centered on AR NOAA No., 1158, observed in 2011. Line-of-sight magnetogram data were obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our statistical analysis reveals that the distributions of patch area, lifetime, and magnetic flux follow power-law behavior, with exponents approximately equal to $\alpha$ = 2.14, 2.5, and 1.42, respectively. Furthermore, a Hurst exponent of 0.57 indicates the presence of long-range temporal correlations in the emergence of new magnetic patches.</description>

      <title>The M- and X-class White-light Flares in Super Active Region NOAA 13664/13697 Observed by ASO-S/LST/WST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar white-light flares (WLFs) have been observed since 1859, but their occurrence rate is not yet fully understood. The physical properties of WLFs in super active regions (SARs) are also well worth investigating. With full-disk images at 3600 {\AA} (in the Balmer continuum) from the White-light Solar Telescope (WST) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, we here study the M- and X-class WLFs occurring in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 (a same region in two solar Carrington rotations) during May/June 2024. 48 WLFs at 3600 {\AA} are identified from 89 available samples with an occurrence rate of 53.9%, which is much higher than that (23.9%) of a longterm-continuous data set from October 2022 to May 2023 in our previous work (Jing et al. 2024). In particular, with an additional sample of over 730 M- and X-class flares from October 2022 to June 2024, we find that the occurrence rate of WLFs shows a good correlation with the solar cycle represented by sunspot counts. As regards the properties of the emission at 3600 {\AA}, the WLFs in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 have some different characteristics, say, a longer duration but a weaker relative enhancement and a smaller brightening area compared with the previous long-term-continuous sample. We also find that for WLFs in NOAA 13664/13697 the relation between the duration and energy at 3600 {\AA} is described by a power-law with index of 0.35, which is similar to the results found for superflares in Sun-like stars (Kowalski 2024). All these help us understand the solar WLFs in SARs and also provide important insights into the superflares on Sun-like stars.</description>

      <title>Decomposing wave activity in the solar atmosphere: Shocks, jets and swirls in the quiet Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. There remains much mystery about how or if wave-energy in the photosphere can be transferred sufficiently upwards through the solar atmosphere to contribute to coronal heating. In light of a plethora of theoretical and idealised studies, we must complement our understanding with realistic and self-driven simulations in order to confidently quantify such contributions. Aims. In this study we aim to connect the various environments from the photosphere to low corona and identify wave drivers, transitions and dissipation mechanisms. We will analyse the effects of the presence of twisted magnetic features and vortical flows on the transport of such wave modes as the structures evolve. Methods. We adopt the most significant frequency (MSF) decomposition method to trace wave activity through a 3D realistic quiet Sun simulation. We focus on vertical and temporal evolution, identifying wave sources and shifts in the dominant modes. Results. We identify two frequencies, at 3.5 and 5 mHz, that connect oscillations in the upper convection zone to the dynamics in the solar atmosphere. We see distinct differences in the absence and presence of swirling structures on the upwards propagation of these oscillations. Furthermore, we validate the use of the highest frequency MSFs as a proxy for the location of shocks in the chromosphere, and use the results to understand the connection between shocks and the propagation of oscillations in the upper atmosphere. We discuss the relation of energy transfer via shocks, mode conversion, and jets. Finally, we find the contribution of 3.5 and 5 mHz signals to the overall wave power in the domain to be significant, up to 50%.</description>

      <title>Investigating Phosphorus Abundances in a Sample of APOGEE-2 Bulge Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorus enhanced (P-rich; [P/Fe] &gt; 0.8) giants have been found among mildly metal-poor fiels stars, but in only one star in a globular cluster (GC), M4 (NGC 6121). Also, in a sample of bulge spheroid stars, some of them showed a moderate P-enhancement in the range +0.5 &lt; [P/Fe] &lt; +1.0. In this paper we derive the P abundance of moderately metal-poor ([Fe/H] ~-1) GC stars, aiming to check if the phenomenon could be related to the unusual multiple stellar populations found in most GCs. Here we present the detection of P-moderately enhanced stars among two out of seven bulge GCs (Tonantzintla 1, and NGC 6316_, with metallicities similar to those of the bulge field P-rich stars. Using H-band high-resolution (R~22,500) spectra from the APOGEE-2 survey, we present the first high-resolution abundance analysis of [P/Fe] from the PI 16482.932 A line in a sample of selected bulge GCs. We find that all P-rich stars tend to also be N-rich, that hints at the origin of P-rich stars as second-generation stars in GCs. However no other correlations of P and other elements are found, that are usually indicators of second-generation stars. Further studies with larger samples and comparisons with field stars will be needed before any firm conclusions are drawn.</description>

      <title>Solar Eruption Onset and Particle Acceleration in Nested-Null Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic breakout model explains a variety of solar eruptions, ranging from small-scale jets to large-scale coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Most of our previous studies are focused on jets and CMEs in single null-point topologies. Here, we investigate the initiation of CMEs and associated particle acceleration in a double null-point (or nested fan-spine) topology during multiple homologous M- and X-class flares from an active region. The initiation of the flare and associated eruption begins with inflow structures moving towards the inner null of the closed fan-spine topology. The first explosive breakout reconnection of the flux rope at the inner null produced a circular and remote ribbons along with successful eruption of the flux rope and associated fast EUV (shock) wave. Simultaneous flare reconnection beneath the erupting flux rope produced a typical two-ribbon flare along with two hard X-ray footpoint sources. When the flux rope (with shock) reaches the outer null, the second explosive breakout reconnection produces another large-scale remote ribbon. The radio observations reveal quasiperiodic Type III bursts (period=100-s) and a Type II burst during the breakout reconnection near the inner and outer nulls, along with gradual solar energetic particles (SEPs) observed at 1 AU for magnetically connected events. This study highlight the importance of two successive breakout reconnection in the initiation of CMEs in nested-null topologies and associated particle acceleration/release into the interplanetary medium. The particles are accelerated by the shock ahead of the flux rope, which formed during the inner breakout reconnection. These findings have significant implications for particle acceleration and escape processes in multi-scale null-point topologies that produce jets and CMEs.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic shear distribution on the formation of eruptive flux ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erupting flux ropes play crucial role in powering a wide range of solar transients, including flares, jets, and coronal mass ejections. These events are driven by the release of stored magnetic energy, facilitated by the shear in the complex magnetic topologies. However, the mechanisms governing the formation and eruption of flux ropes, particularly the role of magnetic shear distribution in coronal arcades are not fully understood. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating nonadiabatic effects of optically thin radiative losses, magnetic field-aligned thermal conduction, and spatially varying (steady) background heating, to realistically model the coronal environment. A stratified solar atmosphere under gravity is initialized with a non-force-free field comprising sheared arcades. We study two different cases by varying the initial shear to analyze their resulting dynamics, and the possibility of flux rope formation and eruptions. Our results show that strong initial magnetic shear leads to spontaneous flux rope formation and eruption via magnetic reconnection, driven by Lorentz force. The shear distribution infers the non-potentiality distributed along arcades and demonstrates its relevance in identifying sites prone to eruptive activity. The evolution of mean shear and the relative strength between guide to reconnection fields during the pre- and post-eruption phases are explored, with implications of bulk heating for the ``hot onset'' phenomena in flares, and particle acceleration. On the other hand, the weaker shear case does not lead to formation of any flux ropes. Our findings highlight the limitations of relying solely on foot point shear and underscore the need for coronal scale diagnostics. These results are relevant for understanding eruptive onset conditions and can promote a better interpretation of coronal observations from current and future missions.</description>

      <title>Three binary-source binary-lens microlensing events from the 2024 microlensing campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated microlensing events detected by the OGLE and KMTNet surveys during the 2024 observing season, focusing on those that exhibit very complex anomaly features. Through this analysis, we found that the light curves of three events including OGLE-2024-BLG-0657, KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and KMT-2024-BLG-2480 cannot be readily interpreted using standard three-body lensing models such as a binary lens with a single source (2L1S) or a single lens with a binary source (1L2S). In this work we present detailed analyses of these events to uncover the nature of their anomalous features. An initial analysis using 2L1S modeling of the light curves showed that while it was difficult to simultaneously explain all of the multiple anomaly features, the main anomaly feature could be accounted for. Based on this model, we conducted four-body modeling that includes an additional lens or source. Through this approach, we found that the complex anomalies observed in the three events could be explained by a 2L2S model, in which both the lens and the source are binaries. Analysis of the color and magnitude revealed that the source is a binary system consisting of G- and K-type main sequence stars for OGLE-2024-BLG-0657, two K-type main sequence stars for KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and a K-type star with an early G-type main sequence companion for KMT-2024-BLG-2480. A Bayesian analysis incorporating constraints from the lensing observables indicates that the lenses in KMT-2024-BLG-2017 and KMT-2024-BLG-2480 are likely binary systems of low-mass stars located in the Galactic bulge, whereas the lens system OGLE-2024-BLG-0657L is likely a binary composed of two stellar remnants situated in the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Compression, Impact and Hot Rebound Flows from Coronal Rain Downflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the processes associated with coronal rain due to the thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) and thermal instability (TI) scenario can help us understand coronal heating. We aim to study the properties of a quiescent coronal rain event and its effect on the solar atmosphere. We utilise space-based data from the \textit{High-Resolution Imager in Extreme Ultraviolet} of Solar Orbiter, the \textit{Atmospheric Imaging Assembly} of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and the Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) from the \textit{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph} from November 1st, 2023. During the coronal rain shower, the coronal loop exhibits large EUV variability and drastic changes in sub-structure. Coronal rain clumps with total velocities between 72~km~s$^{-1}$ and 87~km~s$^{-1}$ and cool EUV absorbing core sizes of $\approx$600~km and densities of $\approx5\times10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$ are seen to fall with a strong compression ahead. During the compression we measure a low polytropic index with $\gamma=1.085$, suggesting the presence of molecules. The rain shower carries a total of $3.09\times10^{26}$~erg, and the clumps produce impacts seen in all EUV channels and in SJI~1400~\AA. The impacts generate hot rebound flows with temperatures of $10^{6.2}-10^{6.3}~$K and velocities of $85-87$ km~s$^{-1}$, which refill and reheat the loop but carry less than $20\%$ of the clumps' kinetic energies. We find signatures of a steady footpoint heating, in agreement with the TNE-TI scenario, with an estimated amplitude of $2.56\times10^{-2}~$erg~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$ in agreement with active region estimates. Coronal rain may therefore be a good proxy for the total integrated heating that gives birth to TNE-TI.</description>

      <title>The Curious Case of V CVn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decades of observations on the star V Canum Venaticorum (V CVn) have revealed an unusual inverse relationship between its linear polarization and light curves (sometimes with a lead/lag time between them) and an almost constant polarization position angle. One theory proposed to explain this behaviour is the existence of a bow shock driven by a spherically symmetric time-varying dusty wind from the star, which is assumed to vary due to radial pulsations. To test this hypothesis, this study uses a new framework developed in \textsc{ZEUS3D}, a multiphysics magnetohydrodynamics code. The results of this work show that when a time-varying stellar wind is at its maximum brightness, the polarization signal is at a minimum due to the wind structure and a dense, symmetric shell that forms around the star. Conversely, when the brightness is at a minimum, the symmetric shell around the star is much less dense, and the polarization is instead dominated by the asymmetric bow shock structure, causing the polarization signal to attain a maximum value. Numerically reproducing the observed inverse relationship between the polarization and light curve provides a strong theoretical argument that a variable stellar wind bow shock is the solution to the curious case of V CVn.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection sustains the mass budget of the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind originates from regions of open magnetic fields on the Sun, but the relevant processes remain unsolved. We present a self-consistent numerical model of the source region of the wind, in which jets similar to those observed on the Sun naturally emerge due to magnetic reconnection between closed and open magnetic fields. In this process material is transferred from closed to open field lines and fed into the solar wind.We quantify the mass flux through the magnetic field connected to the heliosphere and find that it greatly exceeds the amount required to sustain the wind. This supports a decades-old suspicion based on spectroscopic observations and shows that magnetic reconnection in the low solar atmosphere could sustain the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances of M and G Dwarfs in the Hyades and Coma Berenices Open Clusters from APOGEE Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open clusters are one of the best astrophysical laboratories we have available for stellar astrophysics studies. This work presents metallicities and individual abundances for fourteen M dwarfs and six G dwarfs from two well-known open clusters: Hyades and Coma Berenices. Our analysis is based on near-infrared (1.51--1.69 $\mu$m), high-resolution ($R \sim 22,500$) spectra obtained from the SDSS IV/APOGEE Survey. Using one-dimensional, plane-parallel MARCS model atmospheres, the APOGEE line list, and the Turbospectrum radiative transfer code in local thermodynamic equilibrium, we derived spectroscopic stellar parameters for the M dwarfs, along with abundances of 13 elements (C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe) for both M and G dwarfs. We find a high degree of chemical homogeneity within each cluster when comparing abundances derived from M and G dwarfs: $\delta$[M/H] (M dwarfs -- G dwarfs) of 0.01$\pm$0.04, and 0.02$\pm$0.03 for the Hyades and Coma Berenices, respectively. The overall cluster metallicities derived from M dwarfs (Hyades: 0.16$\pm$0.03 and Coma Berenices: 0.02$\pm$0.06) are consistent with previous literature determinations. Finally, we demonstrate the value of M dwarfs as key tracers in galactic archaeology, emphasizing their potential for studying galactic metallicity gradients and chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Periodic Variations in Visible Light Brightness as Tracers of Fine Coronal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quiescent or dynamic nature of fine scale ray-like features in the sun corona, observed in visible light, is still an open question. Here, we show that most of daily and hourly periodic variations in visible light brightness of the high corona (up to 15 Rs) are aligned to the tip of streamers and are consistent with the periodicity of plasma release from simulations of tearing-induced magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet. The areas in which we detect periodicities can be used as tracers of non-quiescent fine coronal rays. This also allows their distinction from coronal rays more likely to be real quiescent features or associated with smaller and/or faster unresolved brightness variations. In the low- and middle-corona (down to 1.4 Rs) similar brightness variations are observed along loop-like and cusp-like features marking boundaries of streamers which then connect to radial features in the high corona. This suggests the presence of additional mechanisms in the low- and middle-corona periodically releasing density structures in the solar wind. The periodicity distributions show a solar cycle modulation with shorter periods (smaller structures) during solar maximum. Periodicities are observed within streamers during solar minimum, but are visible at all latitudes, even extending radially from the poles, during solar maximum.</description>

      <title>White Dwarfs with Infrared Excess in the HET Dark Energy Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs with infrared excess emission provide a window into the late stages of stellar evolution and the dynamics of circumstellar environments. Using data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we characterized 30 white dwarfs exhibiting infrared excess, including 29 DA and 1 DB stars. While an infrared excess can arise from dusty disks or cool (sub-)stellar companions, our sample is limited to stellar companions due to our selection based on SDSS photometry, which is sensitive to excess emission at wavelengths $\lambda &lt; 1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Our sample contains 22 newly identified excess sources not previously reported in the literature. Spectroscopic observations are available for 10 sources via SDSS, of which only 8 have prior spectroscopic classifications in the literature.
  In this paper, we present the determination of the effective temperature and surface gravity of these white dwarfs. We used the Balmer line profiles to compare with current atmospheric models to determine the photospheric parameters of the white dwarfs, minimizing contamination introduced by the infrared source. We used photometric data from the SDSS and the \textit{Gaia} mission to resolve the degeneracies between hot and cold solutions from spectroscopy, constraining the photospheric parameters. These results help refine our understanding of white dwarf evolution in binary systems, focusing on stellar companions that cause the infrared excess.
  This study contributes to identifying systems with potential substellar companions or unresolved stellar partners, adding to the growing effort to map out the fate of planetary systems after their host stars evolve beyond the main sequence.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical models of the $\beta$ Lyr A circumstellar disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamics of circumstellar discs, with a focus on the $\beta$ Lyrae A binary system. This system with ongoing mass transfer has been extensively observed, using photometry, spectroscopy and interferometry. All these observations were recently interpreted using a radiation-transfer kinematic model.
  We modified the analytical Shakura-Sunyaev models for a general opacity prescription, and derived radial profiles of various quantities.These profiles were computed for the fixed accretion rate, $\dot M = 2\times 10^{-5}\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, inferred from the observed rate of change of the binary period. More general models were computed numerically, using 1-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics, accounting for viscous, radiative as well as irradiation terms. The initial conditions were taken from the analytical models.
  To achieve the accretion rate, the surface density~$\Sigma$ must be much higher (of the order of $10^4\,{\rm kg}\,{\rm m}^{-2}$ for the viscosity parameter $\alpha = 0.1$) than in the kinematic model. Viscous dissipation and radiative cooling in the optically thick regime lead to a high midplane temperature~$T$ (up to $10^5\,{\rm K}$). The accretion disc is still gas pressure dominated with the opacity close to Kramers one.} To reconcile temperature profiles with observations, we had to distinguish three different temperatures: midplane, atmospheric and irradiation. The latter two are comparable to observations (30000 to 12000\,K). We demonstrate that the aspect ratio~$H$ of 0.08 can be achieved in a hydrostatic equilibrium, as opposed to previous works considering the disc to be vertically unstable.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Recoil and Suppression of Super Massive Black Hole Seeds in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming ~10^9 Msun SMBHs by z ~ 6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear ("wandering") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars.

Abstract: Gaia is a satellite mission of the European Space Agency which is creating a catalogue of extremely accurate positions, distances and space motions of two billion stars in our Galaxy, along with more than one hundred thousand solar system asteroids, and several million distant quasars, all on the same extragalactic reference system. Complementary information on each object's multi-epoch photometry and spectra provides a vast and unprecedented data base of (model-dependent) fundamental physical quantities, such as each star's mass, age, and chemical composition. I outline the field's historical context, and explain the key principles involved in these space measurements. This is followed by a broad review of the many areas of solar system science, stellar structure and evolution, and topics in Galactic structure, evolution, and dynamics, that are being derived from these data.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Random-Phase Sampling Noise in the Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation: A Cross-Filter Consistency Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Period-Luminosity (PL) relation is usually derived using time-averaged magnitudes, which require multiple-epoch observations to determine periods and adequately sample the light curves. Although single-epoch observations are more practical and require significantly less observational effort, they inherently introduce greater photometric scatter, leading to an increased dispersion in the derived Period-Luminosity relations. In this paper, we explore, in detail, a method that transforms single random-phase data to their mean-light values, using information obtained in other bands for the same Cepheid. This approach enables the accurate re-construction of mean-light PL relations for wavelengths observed with space-based facilities, for instance, where the number of epochs per star makes simple averaging or template fitting less than optimal, with the latter requiring very high-precision periods for predictive phasing. While applying this technique across multiple bands, from optical to mid-IR, we focus particularly on widely separated bands covering the mid-IR to the optical. We showcase this method using the J band (as being observed by JWST) as the random-phase component. Our results show that this correction reduces the scatter of the PL relation in the J band by a factor of approximately $0.7\times$, equivalent to increasing the number of random-phase observations by a factor of 10, needed to obtain the same increase in precision as delivered here.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRCam imaging of the Bipolar Planetary Nebula NGC 6537: the (Infra)red Spider, Revealed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near-infrared (NIRCam) Br$\alpha$, H$_2$, [Fe II], and PAH imaging of the molecule-rich, high-excitation bipolar planetary nebula (PN) NGC 6537 (the Red Spider), complemented by new ALMA and Chandra observations and archival HST images. The resulting multiwavelength view of the Red Spider establishes the detailed lobe/torus structure of the nebula and the mass-loss history of its progenitor star. The extinction-penetrating JWST/NIRCam Br$\alpha$ and PAH and ALMA 3 mm continuum imaging exposes the complexity of the ionized inner nebula. JWST/NIRCam H$_2$ imaging traces the full, $\sim$1.1 pc extent of the bubble-like lobes formed by fast ($\sim$300-400 km s$^{-1}$) polar outflows, while ALMA $^{13}$CO(1-0) mapping reveals a point-symmetric, slowly ($\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$) expanding equatorial torus of radius $\sim$0.13 pc. In striking contrast, the [Fe II] image displays an extended S-shaped emission morphology that traces collisions between an active, collimated wind and slower-moving material along the lobe rims. No X-rays are detected from the nebula or its central star in deep Chandra/HRC-I imaging. However, the combined HST and JWST imaging reveals a near-IR excess at the central star indicative of emission from hot ($\sim$1000 K) circumstellar dust. We propose that interactions between the nebular progenitor star and a close companion are responsible for the ejection of NGC 6537's molecular torus, the formation of a circumbinary dust disk, and the launching of fast, wandering, collimated outflows that have inflated the polar lobe bubbles traced by near-IR H$_2$ emission and are presently generating the [Fe II]-emitting shocks.</description>

      <title>Dense Molecular Ring-like structure in gaseous CO depletion region G34.74-0.12</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a dense molecular ring-like structure in a dense (10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$), cold (pc-scale CO depletion at a factor of 5), and young (10$^4$ year) star-forming region G34.74-0.12, revealed by C$^{18}$O (2-1), HNC (1-0), and N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ring-like structure is redshifted with respect to the clump, spanning from $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 0.9$ to $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$, with a total mass of 109 $M_{\odot}$. It is spatially coincident with 1.3 mm and 3.0 mm dust continuum emission from cores, and several protostellar outflows. However, no free-free emission or H\textsc{ii} region is detected in association with this structure. With a slow expansion speed indicated by the position-velocity diagram, this ring structure differs from rings previously identified in more evolved star-forming regions. Possible explanations for the ring-like structure include a relic wind-blown bubble produced by a deeply embedded young stellar object, a hollow cavity formed by cloud-cloud interactions, a gas ring resulting from a temperature gradient, or a line-of-sight superposition of multiple outflows or dense clouds. This discovery offers a rare observational glimpse into the earliest dynamical processes involved in massive star formation.</description>

      <title>Molecular Jets from an Evolved Protostar: Insights from JWST-ALMA Synergy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of ALMA submillimeter and JWST/MIRI mid-infrared observations offers a transformative view of protostellar jets and outflows by probing cold and warm gas components across diverse physical conditions. We present a detailed comparison of gas distribution in these regimes for the jet/outflow system associated with G205.46$-$14.56S3 (HOPS 315), focusing on the inner $\sim$800 AU along the jet. ALMA CO and SiO trace both lobes of the bipolar jet, revealing high-velocity collimated jets and wider outflow components. JWST/MIRI detects mainly the blueshifted lobe; the redshifted side is likely obscured by strong mid-infrared extinction. Shorter-wavelength MIRI H$_2$ rotational lines (S(7)-S(4)) trace compact jet structures resembling SiO emission, while longer-wavelength lines (S(3)-S(1)) reveal more extended emission akin to low-velocity CO. From H$_2$ rotational emission, we identify two molecular gas temperature components: warm $(\sim 773 \pm 44 K)$ and hot $(\sim 2499\pm720 K)$. Using the ortho-to-para ratio, we estimate visual extinction $A_V \approx 23.3 \pm 2.5$ mag. JWST/MIRI emission imply a jet mass-loss rate of $\dot{M}_{J, blue, jwst} \approx (0.27 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{-6}M_\odot {yr}^{-1}$. The combination of ALMA and JWST reveals stratified layers within the outflow and jet, as well as shock structures, providing a comprehensive view of their physical conditions. This multiwavelength study demonstrates that combining submillimeter observations from ALMA with infrared data from JWST is crucial for uncovering the full physical and chemical structure of protostellar jets and outflows.</description>

Abstract: We present a singularity-free relativistic interior solution for constructing stable quark stellar models in the framework of a linear $f(Q)$ gravity ($f(Q) = \alpha Q + \phi$) satisfying the pseudo-spheroidal geometry. The physical features and the stability of the stellar model is explored with strange star (SS) candidate EXO 1745-248 ($M = 1.7\, M_{\odot}$ and $R = 9\, km$). The Durgapal-Banerjee transformation is employed to obtain the relativistic interior solution using the MIT Bag model equation of state (EoS): $P = \frac{1}{3}(\rho - 4 B_{g})$. For a linear form of $f(Q)$ gravity, we obtain the exterior vacuum solution, which reduces to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) solution with the cosmological constant term, $\Lambda = \frac{\phi}{2\alpha}$. The stellar model is analyzed for the different values of the spheroidicity parameter ($\mu$). The value of $\alpha$ is constrained using a viable physical limit on the Bag parameter ($B_{g} \in [57.55,95.11]\,MeV\,fm^{-3}$). The constraints on Mass-Radius relation indicates that physically acceptable SS models are permitted for $\mu \geq 7$. The contribution of $\mu$ to the energy density, pressure profiles, and other physical features is studied for the SS candidate EXO 1745-248. The stability of the stellar model obtained here is also analyzed through causality condition, adiabatic index and other stability criteria. We also investigate the stellar model for other SS candidates to test its viability. The relativistic interior solution obtained here can be used to construct viable and physically acceptable strange star models with very high compactness ratio in the framework of linear $f(Q)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Disentangling disc and atmospheric signatures of young brown dwarfs with JWST/NIRSpec</title>

Abstract: Young brown dwarfs serve as analogues of giant planets and provide benchmarks for atmospheric and formation models. JWST has enabled access to near-infrared spectra of brown dwarfs with unprecedented sensitivity. We aim to constrain their chemical compositions, temperature structures, isotopic ratios, and disc emission. We perform retrievals and disc modelling on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution ($R \approx 2700$) spectra spanning 0.97--5.27 $\mu$m, combining radiative transfer, line-by-line opacities, parameterised temperature profiles, and flexible equilibrium chemistry. We include a disc ring with blackbody continuum and optically thin CO emission. We detect over twenty species, including $^{12}$CO, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, SiO, and hydrides. The CO band at 4.6 $\mu$m reveals $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O. Carbon isotope ratios are $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $79^{+14}_{-11}$ (TWA 27A) and $75^{+2}_{-2}$ (TWA 28); oxygen ratios are $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O = $645^{+80}_{-70}$ and $681^{+53}_{-50}$. Both objects show excess infrared emission, consistent with warm ($\approx 650$ K) blackbody rings, and optically thin CO from hot gas ($\geq 1600$ K) needed to match the red spectra. The atmospheric C/O ratios are $0.54 \pm 0.02$ (TWA 27A) and $0.59 \pm 0.02$ (TWA 28), consistent with solar values. We characterise the atmospheres and discs of two young brown dwarfs through joint constraints on temperature, composition, isotopes, and discs, demonstrating JWST/NIRSpec's ability to probe young objects and circumplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Understanding variations of galactic energetic particles in the heliosphere: modelling and radiation hazard assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intensity and energy spectrum of energetic charged radiation in the heliosphere are significantly influenced by solar activity. This phenomenon is known as solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays.
  As interplanetary travel becomes a reality, missions in low Earth orbit become longer and more frequent. In low Earth orbit we need to estimate the influence of Earth's magnetosphere accurately to assess the radiation hazard experienced by astronauts during space missions, there is an emergent need for accurately depicting the space radiation environment and predicting the cosmic-ray flux in the heliosphere.
  Here we present a new effective and predictive model of solar modulation which incorporates fundamental physics processes of particle transport such as diffusion, convection, and adiabatic cooling to compute the energy spectrum; and temporal evolution of cosmic radiation in the inner heliosphere.
  Empowered by this model and a time-dependent effective description of the geomagnetic field, we will show our estimates of the dose rates experienced by astronauts over time, as they orbit Earth onboard the International Space Station and while travelling through interplanetary space.</description>

      <title>Dust trapping in protoplanetary discs after stellar flybys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar flybys are likely to be common in young star-forming regions and could be responsible for substructures observed in protoplanetary discs. Using three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations, we study dust trapping in discs perturbed by parabolic coplanar flybys. We find that spiral structures are induced in the gas and dust discs for both prograde and retrograde encounters. By tracking individual dust particles within the flyby-induced substructures, we determine that they have a highly enhanced dust to gas ratio compared to particles in an unperturbed disc. We further find that the local dust to gas ratios in flyby-induced substructures are sufficiently high to trigger the streaming instability and hence facilitate planetesimal formation in young discs.</description>

      <title>Frequency evolution of pulsar emission: Further evidence for fan beam model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We explore frequency-dependent changes in pulsar radio emission by analyzing their profile widths and emission heights, assessing whether the simple radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) or the fan beam model can describe the data. Methods. Using wideband (704-4032 MHz) Murriyang (Parkes) observations of over 100 pulsars, we measured profile widths at multiple intensity levels, fit Gaussian components, and used aberration-retardation effects to estimate emission altitudes. We compared trends in width evolution and emission height with a fan beam model. Results. Similar to other recent studies, we find that while many pulsars show profiles narrowing with increasing frequency, a substantial fraction show the reverse. The Gaussian decomposition of the profiles reveals that the peak locations of the components vary little with frequency. However, the component widths do, in general, narrow with increasing frequency. This argues that propagation effects are responsible for the width evolution of the profiles rather than emission height. Overall, the evolution of the emission height with frequency is unclear, and clouded by the assumptions in the model. Spin-down luminosity correlates weakly with profile narrowing but not with emission height. Conclusions. The classic picture where pulsars emit at a single emission height which decreases with increasing observing frequency cannot explain the diversity in behavior observed here. Instead, pulsar beams likely originate from extended regions at multiple altitudes, with fan-beam or patchy structures dominating their frequency evolution. Future models must incorporate realistic plasma physics and multi-altitude emission to capture the range of pulsar behaviors.</description>

      <title>High-energy interstellar isomers: cis-N-methylformamide in the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isomerism in complex organic molecules provides key insights into the formation mechanisms and physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM). Among the C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers, only acetamide and trans-N-methylformamide (trans-NMF) have been detected in space. The recent detection of higher-energy isomers in other chemical families raises questions about the formation and abundance of less stable isomers. We used ultra-sensitive wide-band spectral surveys obtained with the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes to search for cis-NMF towards the Galactic Centre molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. We present the first detection of cis-NMF in the ISM, with 55 unblended or slightly blended transitions, 44 of which were new transitions identified based on extrapolated spectroscopic data. Due to the lack of collisional rate coefficients, a quasi-non-LTE analysis, which separated the transitions into different K$_a$ ladders, was used to determine the excitation conditions. The resulting trans/cis-NMF isomeric ratio of 2.9$\pm$0.6 deviates significantly from thermodynamic expectations, suggesting that kinetic non-equilibrium processes and stereospecific chemical pathways are responsible for the formation of cis-NMF in this environment. The detection of cis-NMF expands the known inventory of interstellar C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers and challenges the assumption that isomer abundances strictly correlate with thermodynamic stability. Laboratory and theoretical studies propose formation via CH$_3$NCO hydrogenation or spin-forbidden reactions involving CH$_2$ and NH$_2$CHO, though these may not reflect typical ISM conditions. This finding highlights the need for further investigation into isomerisation mechanisms and constrains astrochemical models of complex organic molecules.</description>

      <title>Spectral Energy Distribution Analysis of the Supersoft X-ray Source CAL 87: Multiwavelength Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the eclipsing supersoft X-ray source CAL 87 covering wavelengths from X-rays to the near-infrared. Our study incorporates 26 data points across ultraviolet to near-infrared, sourced from published literature, unpublished data, and new observations. In addition, archival XMM-Newton spectra were used to represent the X-ray emission. Care was taken to use out-of-eclipse flux measurements when the irradiated side of the companion faces the observer. The SED model includes contributions from a central source, a reprocessed accretion disk, and an irradiated companion star atmosphere, resulting in a good match to the observed fluxes. The revised and new parameters for the disk and the central source align with previous studies and match expectations for such systems. The temperature of the irradiated side of the companion star was estimated based on its B-V colour during the secondary eclipse. This work highlights the importance of broad wavelength coverage for understanding the properties of supersoft X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Anomalous electron heating in laboratory magnetized quasi-perpendicular collisionless shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present laboratory results from supercritical, magnetized collisionless shock experiments ($M_A \lesssim 10$, $\beta\sim 1$). We report the first observation of fully-developed shocks ($R=4$ compression ratio and a downstream region decoupled from the piston) after seven upstream ion gyration periods. A foot ahead of the shock exhibits super-adiabatic electron and ion heating. We measure the electron temperature $T_e = 115$ eV and ion temperature $T_i = 15$ eV upstream of the shock; whereas, downstream, we measure $T_e=390$ eV and infer $T_i=340$ eV, consistent with both Thomson scattering ion-acoustic wave spectral broadening and Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. The downstream electron temperature has a $30$-percent excess from adiabatic and collisional electron-ion heating, implying significant collisionless anomalous electron heating. Furthermore, downstream electrons and ions are in equipartition, with a unity electron-ion temperature ratio $T_e/T_i = 1.2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Magnetic Field Characteristics into EUV-Based Automated Segmentation of Coronal Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal holes (CHs) are magnetically open regions that allow hot coronal plasma to escape from the Sun and form the high-speed solar wind. This wind can interact with Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, developing an accurate understanding of CH regions is vital for understanding space weather and its effects on Earth. The process of identifying CH regions typically relies on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, leveraging the fact that CHs appear dark at these wavelengths. Accurate identification of CHs in EUV, however, can be difficult due to a variety of factors, including stray light from nearby regions, limb brightening, and the presence of filaments (which also appear dark, but are not sources of solar wind). In order to overcome these issues, this work incorporates photospheric magnetic field data into a classical EUV-based segmentation algorithm based on the active contours without edges (ACWE) segmentation method. In this work magnetic field data are incorporated directly into the segmentation process, serving both as a method for removing non-CH regions in advance, and as a method to constrain evolution of the segmented CH boundary. This reduces the presence of filaments while allowing the segmentation to include CH regions that may be difficult to identify due to inconsistent intensities.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Low FIP Abundance: A Catalyst for Coronal Condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiative losses play a critical role in the cooling of plasmas. When chromospheric plasma is sufficiently heated, it can flow into coronal loops which subsequently cool down due to radiation. From observations, we infer that this cooling does not occur uniformly, often resulting in coronal condensations such as coronal rain. To date, coronal condensations have only been found in simulations of steadily-heated loops, and never in impulsively-heated ones. We implement spatiotemporally variable elemental abundances in a radiative hydrodynamic code. Flows, including chromospheric evaporation, directly cause a shift in the local elemental abundances, which then affects the local radiative loss rate. As a consequence, we find that incorporating spatiotemporal low FIP elemental abundances into coronal loop simulations directly causes coronal condensations, which are otherwise absent in impulsively heated loop or flare models. We conclude that spatiotemporal variations in elemental abundances are a fundamental feature of the solar corona and are therefore necessary to accurately model radiation.</description>

      <title>Interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we use particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations to study interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet. We vary width of the Harris current sheet to investigate how this affects the quasi-linear relaxation, i.e. plateau formation of the bump-on-tail unstable electron beam. We find that when width of the Harris current sheet approaches and becomes smaller than the electron gyro-radius, quasi-linear relaxation becomes hampered and a positive slope in the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) persists. We explain this by the effects of non-conservation of electron magnetic moment, which, as recent works suggest, can maintain the positive slope of the VDF. In part, this can explain why some electron beams (the ones that interact with narrow magnetic holes with sharp boundaries, represented in our study by a Harris current sheet) in the solar wind travel much longer distances than predicted by the quasi-linear theory, at least in those cases when the electron beams slide along the current sheets that are abundant when the different-speed solar wind streams interact with each other.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XV. Updated calibrations of fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys combined with Gaia distances are enabling reliable estimates of fundamental parameters for hundreds of Galactic O-type stars and the full range of spectral types and luminosity classes. Here we provide updated, statistically robust empirical calibrations of the fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars, as well as of their absolute visual magnitudes (Mv) and bolometric corrections (BC), based on high-quality observational data. We perform a homogeneous analysis of a sample of 358 Galactic O-type stars, combining high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia distances. A subset of 234 stars meeting strict quality criteria involving parallax, extinction, and multi-band photometry was used to derive empirical calibrations of fundamental parameters. For those same stars, calibrated parameters were estimated from their measured Mv using the derived relations, allowing us to assess the internal consistency and predictive power of the calibrations. We present updated spectral-type-based calibrations of fundamental parameters for luminosity classes V, III, and I. Compared to previous works, we find systematic shifts, particularly in effective temperature for dwarfs and in Mv across all classes, which propagate into derived quantities. Applying the Mv calibrations to the full sample yields consistent estimates of radius and luminosity, while spectroscopic mass (Msp) shows significant scatter. We also evaluate the FW3414 parameter (from the Hbeta line) as a calibrator for Mv, useful in large surveys lacking reliable spectral classification. Excluding SB1 systems has a noticeable impact only on the Msp calibration for LC V. These updated empirical calibrations offer a robust reference for Galactic O-type stars and will support studies of massive star populations in both Galactic and extragalactic contexts, particularly in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Heating of the Magnetically Closed Solar Corona: Generation of Nanoflares, Thermodynamic Response of the Plasma and Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy that heats the magnetically closed solar corona originates in the complex motions of the massive photosphere. Turbulent photospheric convection slowly displaces the footpoints of coronal field lines, causing them to become twisted and tangled. Magnetic stresses gradually build until reaching a breaking point when the field reconnects and releases a sudden burst of energy. We simulate this basic picture of nanoflares using a high-fidelity, three-dimensional, multi-stranded magnetohydrodynamic simulation that starts with a fully stratified atmosphere. This simulation includes the effects of field-aligned thermal conduction and optically thin radiation and uses the state-of-the-art Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to capture the response of the plasma to the nanoflare heating. We find that our physical model supports a unified explanation for both the diffuse emission observed in active regions and the bright coronal loops. Specifically, our results suggest that the diffuse emission originates from spatially and temporally uncorrelated nanoflares, whereas coherent clusters of nanoflares - nanoflare storms - are responsible for the formation of bright coronal loops. Quantitative comparisons between the simulated emission and observed characteristics of coronal loops show that key observed properties - such as loop widths, lifetimes and cross sections - are reasonably well reproduced by the model. The idea that avalanche spread naturally leads to circular cross sections in coronal loops is strongly supported. Our results also suggest that phase differences in heating and cooling events across neighboring magnetic flux strands are a plausible explanation for the anomalous cross-field motions of coronal loops that were recently reported in high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>On the Encounter Rate of Open Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probable past and future close encounters of open clusters with known characteristics over 64 million years have been calculated by integrating the orbits of cluster centers in the Galactic potential using the _galpy_ package. It has been shown that in the Galactic neighborhood of the Sun, pairwise cluster encounters at distances comparable to or smaller than their sizes occur at a characteristic rate of 35 to 40 events per 1 Myr. Close encounters between open clusters with a significant age difference occur at a rate of 15 events per Myr. It can be expected that in the Galaxy as a whole, such events occur an order of magnitude more frequently per unit time. Thus, dynamical interactions between stellar ensembles of different ages may not be too rare and could influence the properties of stellar populations. A pair of clusters with similar ages: HSC 1428 and Gulliver 22 was identified as a likely physically bound binary cluster system. A forecast of expected close encounters over the next 32 Myr has been provided for 490 pairs of clusters. Currently, 29 pairs of clusters are at their closest approach.</description>

      <title>Stellar Obliquity Excitation via Disk Dispersal-Driven Resonances in Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stellar obliquity of a planetary system is often used to help constrain the system's formation and evolution. One of the mechanisms to reorient the stellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant ($\sim 300\;\mathrm{AU}$) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate broadly due to the $\sim 50\%$ binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an important role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any dynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for idealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting stellar obliquities are broadly distributed between $60^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ for most warm and cold planets. We further show that non-homologus disk dissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively-opened gap at $\sim 2\;\mathrm{AU}$, can help maintain orbital alignment of warm planets, in agreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial obliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also represent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if these companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of evolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven obliquity excitation.</description>

      <title>Luminis Stellarum et Machina: Applications of Machine Learning in Light Curve Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of observational capabilities in astronomy has led to an exponential growth in the volume of light curve (LC) data, creating both opportunities and challenges for time-domain astronomy. Traditional analytical methods often struggle to fully extract the scientific value of these large and complex datasets. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used for LC analysis, enabling classification, prediction, pattern discovery and anomaly detection. However, research in this area remains fragmented, with no comprehensive synthesis of how ML methods address the specific challenges of LC data. Key difficulties include class imbalance, noisy or sparse measurements, effective feature extraction, and limited interpretability of models. This lack of a unified overview makes it difficult for researchers to identify suitable approaches or recognize unresolved problems that require methodological advances. To address this gap, this survey systematically reviews ML techniques applied to LC analysis, outlining their principles and applications in tasks such as exoplanet detection, variable star classification and supernova identification. By clarifying the current state of the field and highlighting open challenges, this work provides guidance for future research and supports the effective integration of ML into astronomical big data studies.</description>

      <title>A two-phase model of galaxy formation: IV. Seeding and growing supermassive black holes in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $z \approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of 'little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.</description>

      <title>A fast machine learning tool to predict the composition of astronomical ices from infrared absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.</description>

      <title>Detection of a septuple stellar system in formation via disk fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar multiple systems play a pivotal role in cluster dynamics and stellar evolution, leading to intense astronomical phenomena like X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernova, and stellar mergers, which are prime sources of gravitational waves. However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC\,6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2--3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.</description>
