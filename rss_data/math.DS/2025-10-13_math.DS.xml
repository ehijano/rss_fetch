      <title>A Lipschitz Refinement of the Multidimensional Bebutov--Kakutani Dynamical Embedding Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a continuous action of $\mathbb{R}^n$ on a compact metrizable space equivariantly embeds into the shift action on the space of one-Lipschitz functions from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $[0,1]$ if and only if the set of fixed points topologically embeds in $[0,1]$. This is a Lipschitz refinement of classical dynamical embedding theorems of Bebutov, Kakutani, Jaworski and Chen.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of multiply connected Fatou components. A unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the boundaries of multiply connected Fatou components of transcendental maps by means of universal covering maps and associated inner functions. A unified approach is presented, which includes invariant Fatou components (of any type) as well as wandering domains. We prove that any Fatou component admits a harmonic measure on its boundary whose support is the whole boundary. Consequently, we relate, in a successful way, the geometric structure of such Fatou components (in terms of the limit sets of their universal covering maps), the dynamics induced on their boundary from an ergodic point of view, and analytic properties of the associated inner function.</description>

      <title>On Dynamics of the Bungee set and the Filled Julia set of a Transcendental Semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have introduced the notion of the bungee set and the filled Julia set of a transcendental semigroup using Fatou-Julia theory. Numerous results of the bungee set of a single transcendental entire function have been generalized to a transcendental semigroup. For a transcendental semigroup having no oscillatory wandering domain, we provide some conditions for the containment of the bungee set inside the Julia set. The filled Julia set has also been explored in the context of a transcendental semigroup, and some of its properties are discussed. We have also explored some new features of the escaping set of a transcendental semigroup. The bungee set of a conjugate semigroup and an abelian transcendental semigroup has also been investigated.</description>

      <title>Architecture Induces Structural Invariant Manifolds of Neural Network Training Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While architecture is recognized as key to the performance of deep neural networks, its precise effect on training dynamics has been unclear due to the confounding influence of data and loss functions. This paper proposed an analytic framework based on the geometric control theory to characterize the dynamical properties intrinsic to a model's parameterization. We prove that the Structural Invariant Manifolds (SIMs) of an analytic model $F(\mathbf{\theta})(\mathbf{x})$--submanifolds that confine gradient flow trajectories independent of data and loss--are unions of orbits of the vector field family $\{\nabla_{\mathbf{\theta}} F(\cdot)(\mathbf{x})\mid\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^d\}$. We then prove that a model's symmetry, e.g., permutation symmetry for neural networks, induces SIMs. Applying this, we characterize the hierarchy of symmetry-induced SIMs in fully-connected networks, where dynamics exhibit neuron condensation and equivalence to reduced-width networks. For two-layer networks, we prove all SIMs are symmetry-induced, closing the gap between known symmetries and all possible invariants. Overall, by establishing the framework for analyzing SIMs induced by architecture, our work paves the way for a deeper analysis of neural network training dynamics and generalization in the near future.</description>

      <title>Modeling Predator-Prey Dynamics with Stochastic Differential Equations: Patterns of Collective Hunting and Nonlinear Predation Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate predator-prey school interactions in aquatic environments using a stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based, particle-level model that incorporates attraction, repulsion, alignment, and environmental noise. Two predation strategies-center attack and nearest attack-are examined to assess their effects on prey survival, predator efficiency, and group dynamics. Simulations reveal diverse emergent behaviors such as prey dispersal and regrouping, oscillatory predation with collective defense, and predator encirclement. Results show that collective hunting enhances capture efficiency compared to solitary attacks, but benefits diminish beyond a critical predator group size due to intra-predator competition. This work provides new insights into cooperative predation and introduces a generalizable SDE framework for analyzing predator-prey interactions.</description>

      <title>Convergence of optimizers implies eigenvalues filtering at equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption. From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions, without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on feed-forward neural networks.</description>

      <title>On the approximation of finite-time Lyapunov exponents for the stochastic Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with quadratic nonlinearities close to a change of stability. To this aim we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs), observing a change of sign based on the interplay between the distance towards the bifurcation and the noise intensity. A technical challenge is to provide a suitable control of the nonlinear terms coupling the dominant and stable modes of the SPDE and of the corresponding linearization. In order to illustrate our results we apply them to the stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop Pesin theory for the boundary map of some Fatou components of transcendental functions, under certain hyptothesis on the singular values and the Lyapunov exponent. That is, we prove that generic inverse branches for such maps are well-defined and conformal. In particular, we study in depth the Lyapunov exponents with respect to harmonic measure, providing results which are of independent interest. As an application of our results, we describe in detail generic inverse branches for centered inner functions, and we prove density of periodic boundary points for a large class of Fatou components. Our proofs use techniques from measure theory, ergodic theory, conformal analysis, and inner functions, as well as estimates on harmonic measure.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we estimate the Hausdorff dimension of dynamical coverings with respect to mixing ergodic systems. More precisely, if the ergodic measure is exact-dimensionnal, we establish a formula provided that the system is polynomially fast mixing and if the measure is not exact-dimensionnal, we establish a similar result under super-polynomial speed of mix assumpetion. As an application of our result, we extend the result of Fan-Shmeling-Troubetzkoy for the doubling map on the circle to the case of the times 2, times 3 map on the two dimensional torus.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the Laplacian and the Jacobi operator on Generalized rotational minimal hypersurfaces of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M\subset S^{n+1}$ be the hypersurface generated by rotating a hypersurface $M_0$ contained in the interior of the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^{n-k+1}$. More precisely, $M=\{(\sqrt{1-|m|^2}\, y, m):y\in S^k, m\in M_0\}$. We derive the equation for the mean curvature of $M$ in terms of the principal curvatures of $M_0$. For the particular case when $M_0$ is a surface of revolution in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we provide a method for finding the eigenvalues of the Laplace and stability operators. To illustrate this method, we consider an example of a minimal embedded hypersurface in $S^6$ and numerically compute all the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator less than 12, as well as all non-positive eigenvalues of the stability operators. For this example, we show that the stability index (the number of negative eigenvalues of the stability operator, counted with multiplicity) is 77, and the nullity (the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\lambda=0$ of the stability operator) is 14. Similar results are found in the case where $M_0$ is a hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{l+2}$ of the form $(f_2(u)z, f_1(u))$, with $z$ in the $l$-dimensional unit sphere $S^l$. Carlotto and Schulz have found examples of embedded minimal hypersurfaces in the case where $M_0=S^k\times S^1$.</description>

      <title>Some ergodic theorems over squarefree numbers and squarefull numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2022, Bergelson and Richter gave a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem by establishing an ergodic theorem along the number of prime factors of integers. They also showed that this generalization holds as well if the integers are restricted to be squarefree. In this paper, we present the concept of invariant averages under multiplications for arithmetic functions. Utilizing the properties of these invariant averages, we derive several ergodic theorems over squarefree numbers and squarefull numbers. These theorems have significant connections to the Erd\H{o}s-Kac Theorem, the Bergelson-Richter Theorem, and the Loyd Theorem.</description>

Abstract: In 2022, Bergelson and Richter established a new dynamical generalization of the prime number theorem. Later, Loyd showed a disjoint form with the Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem. Recently, the author and his coauthors proved some ergodic theorems over squarefree numbers related to these results. In this paper, building on the previous work, we will derive the analogues of Bergelson-Richter's theorem, Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem and Loyd's theorem over $k$-full numbers for any integer $k\geq2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with time-fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations, which are characterized by the coexistence of stochastic noise and a fractional power of the Laplacian. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and approximate controllability of a unique mild solution to time-fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. Using a fixed point technique, we first demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to the equation under consideration. We then establish approximate controllability results by using the concepts of fractional calculus, semigroup theory, functional analysis and stochastic analysis.</description>

      <title>Safe and Optimal N-Spacecraft Swarm Reconfiguration in Non-Keplerian Cislunar Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fuel-optimal guidance and control methodology for spacecraft swarm reconfiguration in Restricted Multi-Body Problems (RMBPs) with a guarantee of passive safety, maintaining miss distance even under abrupt loss of control authority. A new set of constraints exploits a quasi-periodic structure of RMBPs to guarantee passive safety. Particularly, the condition for passive safety is expressed as simple geometric constraints by solving optimal control in Local Toroidal Coordinates, which is based on a local eigenspace of a quasi-periodic motion around the corresponding periodic orbit. The proposed formulation enables a significant simplification of problem structure, which is applicable to large-scale swarm reconfiguration in cislunar orbits. The method is demonstrated in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem, the Elliptic Restricted Three-Body Problem, and the Bi-Circular Restricted Four-Body Problem. Furthermore, the optimized control profiles are validated in the full-ephemeris dynamics model. By extending and generalizing well-known concepts of relative orbital elements within the restricted two-body problem to the three- and four-body problems, this paper lays the foundation for practical control schemes of relative motion in cislunar space.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the reduced group C*-algebras of infinite countable discrete groups having topologically-free extreme boundaries, or more generally groups that satisfy certain combinatorial property including all acylindrically hyperbolic groups with no nontrivial finite normal subgroups, are selfless in the sense of L. Robert. This generalizes the recent result of Amrutam, Gao, Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, and Patchell. We also prove that selflessness is stable under tensor product among exact C*-algebras and that a C*-probability space is selfless provided that it is either simple and purely infinite or simple, exact, Z-stable, and uniquely tracial.</description>
