      <title>A Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin Neural Network Method for Solving Hyperbolic Conservation Laws with Temporal Progressive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For hyperbolic conservation laws, traditional methods and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often encounter difficulties in capturing sharp discontinuities and maintaining temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid computational framework by coupling discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations with a temporally progressive neural network architecture. Our method incorporates a structure-preserving weak-form loss -- combining DG residuals and Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions -- with a causality-respecting progressive training strategy. The proposed framework trains neural networks sequentially across temporally decomposed subintervals, leveraging pseudo-label supervision to ensure temporal coherence and solution continuity. This approach mitigates error accumulation and enhances the model's capacity to resolve shock waves and steep gradients without explicit limiters. Besides, a theoretical analysis establishes error bounds for the proposed framework, demonstrating convergence toward the physical solution under mesh refinement and regularized training. Numerical experiments on Burgers and Euler equations show that our method consistently outperforms standard PINNs, PINNs-WE, and first-order DG schemes in both accuracy and robustness, particularly in capturing shocks and steep gradients. These results highlight the promise of combining classical discretization techniques with machine learning to develop robust and accurate solvers for nonlinear hyperbolic systems.</description>

      <title>Using the Immersed Penalized Boundary Method with Splines to Solve PDE's on Curved Domains in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order elliptic boundary-value problems defined on curved domains in 2D and 3D arise frequently in practice. A lot of work has gone into developing numerical methods for solving such problems. One of the newest and most promising methods is the $\textit{immersed penalized boundary method}$ (IPBM) introduced in [Schumaker, L. L., Solving elliptic PDE's on domains with curved boundaries with an immersed penalized boundary method, J. Sci. Comp. ${\bf 80(3)}$ (2019), 1369--1394]. For a comprehensive discussion of the use of these methods with various bivariate spline spaces, see the recent book [Schumaker, L. L.: $\textit{Spline Functions: More Computational Methods}$, SIAM (Philadelphia), 2024]. The purpose of this paper is to show how to use IPBM methods with trivariate spline spaces to solve boundary-value problems on curved domains in 3D.</description>

      <title>A kernel-free boundary integral method for elliptic interface problems on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a generalized boundary integral method for elliptic equations on surfaces, encompassing both boundary value and interface problems. The method is kernel-free, implying that the explicit analytical expression of the kernel function is not required when solving the boundary integral equations. The numerical integration of single- and double-layer potentials or volume integrals at the boundary is replaced by interpolation of the solution to an equivalent interface problem, which is then solved using a fast multigrid solver on Cartesian grids. This paper provides detailed implementation of the second-order version of the kernel-free boundary integral method for elliptic PDEs defined on an embedding surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and presents numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the method for both boundary value and interface problems.</description>

      <title>$\ell_{1}^{2}-\eta\ell_{2}^{2}$ sparsity regularization for nonlinear ill-posed problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the $\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{1}}^{2}-\eta\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{2}}^{2}$ sparsity regularization with $0&lt; \eta\leq 1$, in the context of nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems. We focus on the examination of the well-posedness associated with this regularization approach. Notably, the case where $\eta=1$ presents weaker theoretical outcomes than $0&lt; \eta&lt;1$, primarily due to the absence of coercivity and the Radon-Riesz property associated with the regularization term. Under specific conditions pertaining to the nonlinearity of the operator $F$, we establish that every minimizer of the $\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{1}}^{2}-\eta\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{2}}^{2}$ regularization exhibits sparsity. Moreover, for the case where $0&lt;\eta&lt;1$, we demonstrate convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left(\delta^{1/2}\right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left(\delta\right)$ for the regularized solution, concerning a sparse exact solution, under differing yet widely accepted conditions related to the nonlinearity of $F$. Additionally, we present the iterative half variation algorithm as an effective method for addressing the $\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{1}}^{2}-\eta\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\ell_{2}}^{2}$ regularization in the domain of nonlinear ill-posed equations. Numerical results provided corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of the time fractional nonlinear Fisher-KPP diffusion-reaction equation using the local domain boundary element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fisher-KPP partial differential equation has been employed in science to model various biological, chemical, and thermal phenomena. Time fractional extensions of Fisher's equation have also appeared in the literature, aiming to model systems with memory. The solution of the time fractional Fisher-KPP equation is challenging due to the interplay between the nonlinearity and the nonlocality imposed by the fractional derivatives. An accurate method that for the solution of time fractional diffusion problems is the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The conventional BEM has a high computational cost and memory requirements since it leads to dense coefficient matrices. For nonlinear transient problems, its efficiency is further reduced due to the appearance of volume integrals. In the present work an extension of the recently proposed Local Domain Boundary Element Method (LD-BEM) is presented for the solution of nonlinear time fractional Fisher-KPP problems. The implemented numerical method is used to examine various two-dimensional problems related to the Fisher-KPP equation using different definitions of the fractional derivative.</description>

      <title>A Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Method with Low-Rank Velocity Space Representation for the Multi-Scale BGK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel hybrid algorithm is presented for the Boltzmann-BGK equation, in which a low-rank decomposition is applied solely in the velocity subspace, while a full-rank representation is maintained in the physical (position) space. This approach establishes a foundation for extending modern low-rank techniques to solve the Boltzmann equation in realistic settings, particularly where structured representations -- such as conformal geometries -- may not be feasible in practical engineering applications. A nodal discontinuous Galerkin method is employed for spatial discretization, coupled with a low-rank decomposition over the velocity grid, as well as implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods for time integration. To handle the limit of vanishing collision time, a multiscale implicit integrator based on an auxiliary moment equation is utilized. The algorithm's order of accuracy, reduced computational complexity, and robustness are demonstrated on a suite of canonical gas kinetics problems with increasing complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Julia-based interface to the precompiled HALLaR and cuHALLaR binaries for large-scale semidefinite programs (SDPs). Both solvers are established as fast and numerically stable, and accept problem data in formats compatible with SDPA and a new enhanced data format taking advantage of Hybrid Sparse Low-Rank (HSLR) structure. The interface allows users to load custom data files, configure solver options, and execute experiments directly from Julia. A collection of example problems is included, including the SDP relaxations of the Matrix Completion and Maximum Stable Set problems.</description>

      <title>An $L^0$-approach to stochastic evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for studying pathwise time regularity and numerical approximation of $L^0$-valued stochastic evolution equations. At the core of our framework are two Burkholder--Davis--Gundy type inequalities accommodating It\^o integrals with respect to only stochastically integrable processes. The first of these inequalities is formulated in suitable metrics which metrize convergence in probability on the space of integrands and integrals. The second is a modified version, tailored for deriving pathwise properties of the integral. By combining it with a refined version of the Kolmogorov continuity test, we obtain a powerful method for deriving H\"older regularity of It\^o integrals in their most general form. Moreover, it provides a simple and powerful way of deriving rates of pathwise convergence of numerical approximations of stochastic evolution equations. Both applications are illustrated for a class of linear parabolic stochastic evolution equations with generalized Whittle--Mat\'ern type noise, and our findings are verified by numerical experiments from this setting.</description>

      <title>Underdamped Langevin MCMC with third order convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for the underdamped Langevin diffusion (ULD) and present a non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in the 2-Wasserstein distance when the $d$-dimensional target distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ is strongly log-concave and has varying degrees of smoothness. Precisely, under the assumptions that the gradient and Hessian of $f$ are Lipschitz continuous, our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps respectively. Therefore, our algorithm has a similar complexity as other popular Langevin MCMC algorithms under matching assumptions. However, if we additionally assume that the third derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous, then our algorithm achieves a 2-Wasserstein error of $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{3}})$ steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first gradient-only method for ULD with third order convergence. To support our theory, we perform Bayesian logistic regression across a range of real-world datasets, where our algorithm achieves competitive performance compared to an existing underdamped Langevin MCMC algorithm and the popular No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).</description>

      <title>Inaccuracy of Ensemble-Based Covariance Propagation, Beyond Sampling Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern data assimilation schemes typically use the same discrete dynamical model to evolve the state estimate in time also to approximate the evolution, or propagation, of the estimation error covariance. Ensemble-based methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, approximate the evolution of the covariance through the propagation of individual ensemble members. Thus, it is tacitly assumed that if the discrete state propagation and resulting mean state estimates are accurate, then the ensemble-based discrete covariance propagation will be accurate as well, apart from sampling errors due to limited ensemble size. Through a series of numerical experiments supported by analytical results, we demonstrate that this assumption is false when correlation length scales approach grid resolution. We show for states that satisfy advective dynamics, that while the discrete state propagation and ensemble mean state estimates are accurate, the corresponding ensemble covariances can be remarkably inaccurate, well beyond that expected from sampling errors or typical numerical discretization errors. The underlying problem is a fundamental discrepancy between discrete covariance propagation and the continuum covariance dynamics, which we can identify because the exact continuum covariance dynamics are known. Errors in the ensemble covariances, which can be at least one order of magnitude larger than those of the mean state when correlation lengths begin to approach grid scale, cannot be rectified by the usual methods, such as covariance inflation and localization. This work brings to light a fundamental problem for data assimilation schemes that propagate covariances using the same discrete dynamical model used to propagate the state.</description>

      <title>An adaptive space-time method for nonlinear poroviscoelastic flows with discontinuous porosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a space-time adaptive numerical method for instationary porous media flows with nonlinear interaction between porosity and pressure, with focus on problems with discontinuous initial porosities. A convergent method that yields computable error bounds is constructed by a combination of Picard iteration and a least-squares formulation. The adaptive scheme permits spatially variable time steps, which in numerical tests are shown to lead to efficient approximations of solutions with localized porosity waves. The method is also observed to exhibit optimal convergence with respect to the total number of spatio-temporal degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A deformation-based framework for learning solution mappings of PDEs defined on varying domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a deformation-based framework for learning solution mappings of PDEs defined on varying domains. The union of functions defined on varying domains can be identified as a metric space according to the deformation, then the solution mapping is regarded as a continuous metric-to-metric mapping, and subsequently can be represented by another continuous metric-to-Banach mapping using two different strategies, referred to as the D2D subframework and the D2E subframework, respectively. We point out that such a metric-to-Banach mapping can be learned by neural networks, hence the solution mapping is accordingly learned. With this framework, a rigorous convergence analysis is built for the problem of learning solution mappings of PDEs on varying domains. As the theoretical framework holds based on several pivotal assumptions which need to be verified for a given specific problem, we study the star domains as a typical example, and other situations could be similarly verified. There are three important features of this framework: (1) The domains under consideration are not required to be diffeomorphic, therefore a wide range of regions can be covered by one model provided they are homeomorphic. (2) The deformation mapping is unnecessary to be continuous, thus it can be flexibly established via combining a primary identity mapping and a local deformation mapping. This capability facilitates the resolution of large systems where only local parts of the geometry undergo change. (3) If a linearity-preserving neural operator such as MIONet is adopted, this framework still preserves the linearity of the surrogate solution mapping on its source term for linear PDEs, thus it can be applied to the hybrid iterative method. We finally present several numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Geometric low-rank approximation of the Zeitlin model of incompressible fluids on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the vorticity formulation of the Euler equations describing the flow of a two-dimensional incompressible ideal fluid on the sphere. Zeitlin's model provides a finite-dimensional approximation of the vorticity formulation that preserves the underlying geometric structure: it consists of an isospectral Lie--Poisson flow on the Lie algebra of skew-Hermitian matrices. We propose an approximation of Zeitlin's model based on a time-dependent low-rank factorization of the vorticity matrix and evolve a basis of eigenvectors according to the Euler equations. In particular, we show that the approximate flow remains isospectral and Lie--Poisson and that the error in the solution, in the approximation of the Hamiltonian and of the Casimir functions only depends on the approximation of the vorticity matrix at the initial time. The computational complexity of solving the approximate model is shown to scale quadratically with the order of the vorticity matrix and linearly if a further approximation of the stream function is introduced.</description>

      <title>A low-rank, high-order implicit-explicit integrator for three-dimensional convection-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a rank-adaptive implicit-explicit integrator for the tensor approximation of three-dimensional convection-diffusion equations. In particular, the recently developed Reduced Augmentation Implicit Low-rank (RAIL) integrator is extended from the two-dimensional matrix case to the three-dimensional tensor case. The solutions are approximated using a Tucker tensor decomposition. The RAIL integrator first discretizes the partial differential equation fully in space and time using traditional methods. Here, spectral methods are considered for spatial discretizations, and implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX RK) methods are used for time discretization. At each RK stage: the bases computed at the previous stages are augmented and reduced to construct projection subspaces. After updating the bases in a dimension-by-dimension manner, a Galerkin projection is performed to update the coefficients stored in the core tensor. As such, the algorithm balances high-order accuracy from spanning as many bases as possible from previous stages, with efficiency from leveraging low-rank structures in the solution. A post-processing step follows to maintain a low-rank solution while conserving mass, momentum, and energy. We validate the proposed method on a number of convection-diffusion problems, including a Fokker-Planck model, and a 3d viscous Burgers' equation.</description>

      <title>Semi-Lagrangian methods for a plasma hybrid model with multi-species kinetic ions and massless electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semi-Lagrangian methods with the improved number of one-dimensional advections are proposed for a plasma hybrid model with kinetic ions and mass-less electrons. Two subsystems with mass, momentum, and energy conservation are obtained by a Poisson bracket-based splitting method. For the subsystem in which the distribution functions and the fields are coupled, the second order and reversible modified implicit mid-point rule is used in time with the specially designed mean velocity. The distribution functions are not involved in the iterations and are solved by exact splittings with only one dimensional advections, which makes the proposed schemes efficient. The cancellation problem is overcome by the numerical schemes constructed. Moreover, for the case with a periodic boundary condition, the magnetic field obtained is divergence free, mass, momentum, and energy are conserved. The methods can be extended to cases with multiple ion species.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of BiCGSTAB by the generalized residual cutting method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The residual cutting (RC) method has been proposed as an outer-inner loop iteration for efficiently solving large and sparse linear systems of equations arising in solving numerically problems of elliptic partial differential equations. Then based on RC the generalized residual cutting (GRC) method has been introduced, which can be applied to more general sparse linear systems problems. In this paper, we show that GRC can stabilize the BiCGSTAB, which is also an iterative algorithm for solving large, sparse, and nonsymmetric linear systems, and widely used in scientific computing and engineering simulations, due to its robustness. BiCGSTAB converges faster and more smoothly than the original BiCG method, by reducing irregular convergence behavior by stabilizing residuals. However, it sometimes fails to converge due to stagnation or breakdown. We attempt to emphasize its robustness by further stabililizing it by GRC, avoiding such failures.</description>

      <title>Block Lanczos algorithm for lattice QCD spectroscopy and matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Superconvergent Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Scalar Teukolsky Equation on Hyperboloidal Domains: Efficient Waveform and Self-Force Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-time evolution of extreme mass-ratio inspiral systems requires minimal phase and dispersion errors to accurately compute far-field waveforms, while high accuracy is essential near the smaller black hole (modeled as a Dirac delta distribution) for self-force computations. Spectrally accurate methods, such as nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, are well suited for these tasks. Their numerical errors typically decrease as $\propto (\Delta x)^{N+1}$, where $\Delta x$ is the subdomain size and $N$ is the polynomial degree of the approximation. However, certain DG schemes exhibit superconvergence, where truncation, phase, and dispersion errors can decrease as fast as $\propto (\Delta x)^{2N+1}$. Superconvergent numerical solvers are, by construction, extremely efficient and accurate. We theoretically demonstrate that our DG scheme for the scalar Teukolsky equation with a distributional source is superconvergent, and this property is retained when combined with the hyperboloidal layer compactification technique. This ensures that waveforms, total energy and angular-momentum fluxes, and self-force computations benefit from superconvergence. We empirically verify this behavior across a family of hyperboloidal layer compactifications with varying degrees of smoothness. Additionally, we show that self-force quantities for circular orbits, computed at the point particle's location, also exhibit a certain degree of superconvergence. Our results underscore the potential benefits of numerical superconvergence for efficient and accurate gravitational waveform simulations based on DG methods.</description>

      <title>GRAFT: Gradient-Aware Fast MaxVol Technique for Dynamic Data Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches, GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.</description>
