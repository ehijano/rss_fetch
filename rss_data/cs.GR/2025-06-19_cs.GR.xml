      <title>You Only Render Once: Enhancing Energy and Computation Efficiency of Mobile Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Virtual Reality (VR) is essential to achieving convenient and immersive human-computer interaction and realizing emerging applications such as Metaverse. However, existing VR technologies require two separate renderings of binocular images, causing a significant bottleneck for mobile devices with limited computing capability and power supply. This paper proposes an approach to rendering optimization for mobile VR called EffVR. By utilizing the per-pixel attribute, EffVR can generate binocular VR images from the monocular image through genuinely one rendering, saving half the computation over conventional approaches. Our evaluation indicates that, compared with the state-of-art, EffVRcan save 27% power consumption on average while achieving high binocular image quality (0.9679 SSIM and 34.09 PSNR) in mobile VR applications. Additionally, EffVR can increase the frame rate by 115.2%. These results corroborate EffVRsuperior computation/energy-saving performance, paving the road to a sustainable mobile VR.

      <title>Human Motion Capture from Loose and Sparse Inertial Sensors with Garment-aware Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking. Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.</description>

      <title>One-shot Face Sketch Synthesis in the Wild via Generative Diffusion Prior and Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at: https://github.com/HanWu3125/OS-Sketch</description>

      <title>Nabla-R2D3: Effective and Efficient 3D Diffusion Alignment with 2D Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in 3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking, Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting within a few finetuning steps.</description>

      <title>MicroRicci: A Greedy and Local Ricci Flow Solver for Self-Tuning Mesh Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes, MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup), tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates, automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in graphics, simulation, and related fields.</description>

      <title>ImmerseGen: Agent-Guided Immersive World Generation with Alpha-Textured Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic creation of 3D scenes for immersive VR presence has been a significant research focus for decades. However, existing methods often rely on either high-poly mesh modeling with post-hoc simplification or massive 3D Gaussians, resulting in a complex pipeline or limited visual realism. In this paper, we demonstrate that such exhaustive modeling is unnecessary for achieving compelling immersive experience. We introduce ImmerseGen, a novel agent-guided framework for compact and photorealistic world modeling. ImmerseGen represents scenes as hierarchical compositions of lightweight geometric proxies, i.e., simplified terrain and billboard meshes, and generates photorealistic appearance by synthesizing RGBA textures onto these proxies. Specifically, we propose terrain-conditioned texturing for user-centric base world synthesis, and RGBA asset texturing for midground and foreground scenery. This reformulation offers several advantages: (i) it simplifies modeling by enabling agents to guide generative models in producing coherent textures that integrate seamlessly with the scene; (ii) it bypasses complex geometry creation and decimation by directly synthesizing photorealistic textures on proxies, preserving visual quality without degradation; (iii) it enables compact representations suitable for real-time rendering on mobile VR headsets. To automate scene creation from text prompts, we introduce VLM-based modeling agents enhanced with semantic grid-based analysis for improved spatial reasoning and accurate asset placement. ImmerseGen further enriches scenes with dynamic effects and ambient audio to support multisensory immersion. Experiments on scene generation and live VR showcases demonstrate that ImmerseGen achieves superior photorealism, spatial coherence and rendering efficiency compared to prior methods.
