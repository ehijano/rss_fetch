      <title>Universal quantum frequency comb measurements by spectral mode-matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency comb of a multimode interferometer offers exceptional scalability potential for field-encoded quantum information. However, the staple field detection method, homodyne detection, cannot access quantum information in the whole comb because some spectral quadratures (and their asymmetries with respect to the LO) are out of reach. We present here the first general approach to make arbitrary, one-shot measurements of a multimode quantum optical source, something that is required for photonic quantum computing and is not possible when using homodyne detection with a pulse-shaped LO. This approach uses spectral mode-matching, which can be understood as interferometry with a memory effect. We derive a complete formalism and propose an implementation by microcavity arrays.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature Rydberg arrays: quantum phases and entanglement characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the most prominent platforms for analog quantum simulators, Rydberg atom arrays are a promising tool for exploring quantum phases and transitions. While the ground state properties of one-dimensional Rydberg systems are already thoroughly examined, we extend the analysis towards the finite-temperature scenario. For this purpose, we develop a tensor network-based numerical toolbox for constructing the quantum many-body states at thermal equilibrium, which we exploit to probe classical correlations as well as entanglement monotones. We clearly observe ordered phases continuously shrinking due to thermal fluctuations at finite system sizes. Moreover, by examining the entanglement of formation and entanglement negativity of a half-system bipartition, we numerically confirm that a conformal scaling law of entanglement extends from the zero-temperature critical points into the low-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Collectively enhanced ground-state cooling in subwavelength atomic arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays in free space are becoming a leading platform for exploring emergent many-body quantum phenomena. These arrays feature strong light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, resulting in subradiant collective resonances characterized by narrowed linewidths. In this work, we present a sideband cooling scheme for atoms trapped in subwavelength arrays that utilizes these narrow collective resonances. We derive an effective master equation for the atomic motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms, and validate its prediction with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results demonstrate that subradiant resonances enable the cooling of ensembles of atoms to temperatures lower than those achievable without dipole interactions, provided the atoms have different trap frequencies. Remarkably, narrow collective resonances can be sideband-resolved even when the individual atomic transition is not. In such scenarios, ground state cooling becomes feasible solely due to light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. This approach could be utilized for future quantum technologies based on dense ensembles of emitters, and paves the way towards harnessing many-body cooperative decay for enhanced motional control.</description>

      <title>Predicting Ground State Properties: Constant Sample Complexity and Deep Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum many-body physics is that of finding ground states of local Hamiltonians. A number of recent works gave provably efficient machine learning (ML) algorithms for learning ground states. Specifically, [Huang et al. Science 2022], introduced an approach for learning properties of the ground state of an $n$-qubit gapped local Hamiltonian $H$ from only $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ data points sampled from Hamiltonians in the same phase of matter. This was subsequently improved by [Lewis et al. Nature Communications 2024], to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ samples when the geometry of the $n$-qubit system is known. In this work, we introduce two approaches that achieve a constant sample complexity, independent of system size $n$, for learning ground state properties. Our first algorithm consists of a simple modification of the ML model used by Lewis et al. and applies to a property of interest known beforehand. Our second algorithm, which applies even if a description of the property is not known, is a deep neural network model. While empirical results showing the performance of neural networks have been demonstrated, to our knowledge, this is the first rigorous sample complexity bound on a neural network model for predicting ground state properties. We also perform numerical experiments that confirm the improved scaling of our approach compared to earlier results.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protection Zeno phase transition in monitored lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurements profoundly influence system dynamics. They lead to complex nonequilibrium phenomena like the quantum Zeno effect, and they can be used for mitigating errors in quantum simulations.
  Such an ability is particularly valuable for lattice gauge theories (LGTs), which require the challenging preservation of an extensive number of local conservation laws.
  While it is known that tailored quantum measurements can soften violations of gauge symmetry, the nature of this protection, and in particular the possibility of a threshold behavior, is still unexplored.
  Here, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp transition, triggered by the measurement rate, between a protected gauge-theory regime resistant to simulation errors and an irregular regime.
  Our results are based on the paradigmatic example of a 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. We study in detail the protection through projective measurements of ancillary qubits coupled to the local symmetry generators, and compare this approach with analog (weak) measurement protocols.
  We show that, while the resulting ensemble averages in the continuous-time limit share the same Liouvillian dynamics, different physical implementations of the stochastic gauge protection protocol yield trajectory unravelings with vastly different statistics.
  Additionally, we design an on-chip feedback mechanism that corrects bit-flip errors and significantly enhances the discrete-time scheme. Our results shed light on the dissipative criticality of strongly-interacting, highly-constrained quantum systems, and they offer valuable insights into error mitigation and correction of gauge-theory quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of solid-state spin qubits: a computational perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usefulness of solid-state spins in quantum technologies depends on how long they can remain in a coherent superposition of quantum states. This Colloquium discusses how first-principles simulations can predict spin dynamics for different types of solid-state electron spins, helping design novel and improved platforms for quantum computing, networking, and sensing.
  We begin by outlining the necessary concepts of the noise affecting generic quantum systems. We then focus on recent advances in predicting spin-phonon relaxation of the spin-defect qubits. Next, we discuss cluster methods as a means of simulating quantum decoherence induced by spin-spin interactions, emphasizing the critical role of validation in ensuring the accuracy of these simulations. We highlight how validated cluster methods can be instrumental in interpreting recent experimental results and, more importantly, predicting the coherence properties of novel spin-based quantum platforms, guiding the development of next-generation quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exploring the transition between Quantum and Classical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transition from quantum to classical mechanics using a one-dimensional free particle model. In the classical analysis, we consider the initial positions and velocities of the particle drawn from Gaussian distributions. Since the final position of the particle depends on these initial conditions, convolving the Gaussian distributions associated with these initial conditions gives us the distribution of the final positions. In the quantum scenario, using an initial Gaussian wave packet, the temporal evolution provides the final wave function, and from it, the quantum probability density. We find that the quantum probability density coincides with the classical normal distribution of the particle's final position obtained from the convolution theorem. However, for superpositions of Gaussian distributions, the classical and quantum results deviate due to quantum interference. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to recover the classical distribution from the quantum one. This approach involves removing the quantum interference effects through truncated Fourier analysis. These results are consistent with modern quantum decoherence theory. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of the classical-quantum correspondence and the mechanisms underlying the emergence of classicality from quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Biclustering a dataset using photonic quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biclustering is a problem in machine learning and data mining that seeks to group together rows and columns of a dataset according to certain criteria. In this work, we highlight the natural relation that quantum computing models like boson and Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) have to this problem. We first explore the use of boson sampling to identify biclusters based on matrix permanents. We then propose a heuristic that finds clusters in a dataset using Gaussian boson sampling by (i) converting the dataset into a bipartite graph and then (ii) running GBS to find the densest sub-graph(s) within the larger bipartite graph. Our simulations for the above proposed heuristics show promising results for future exploration in this area.</description>

      <title>Fast characterization of optically detected magnetic resonance spectra via data clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) has become a well-established and powerful technique for measuring the spin state of solid-state quantum emitters, at room temperature. Relying on spin-dependent recombination processes involving the emitters ground, excited and metastable states, ODMR is enabling spin-based quantum sensing of nanoscale electric and magnetic fields, temperature, strain and pressure, as well as imaging of individual electron and nuclear spins. Central to many of these sensing applications is the ability to reliably analyze ODMR data, as the resonance frequencies in these spectra map directly onto target physical quantities acting on the spin sensor. However, this can be onerous, as relatively long integration times -- from milliseconds up to tens of seconds -- are often needed to reach a signal-to-noise level suitable to determine said resonances using traditional fitting methods. Here, we present an algorithm based on data clustering that overcome this limitation and allows determining the resonance frequencies of ODMR spectra with better accuracy (~1.3x factor), higher resolution (~4.7x factor) and/or overall fewer data points (~5x factor) than standard approaches based on statistical inference. The proposed clustering algorithm (CA) is thus a powerful tool for many ODMR-based quantum sensing applications, especially when dealing with noisy and scarce data sets.</description>

      <title>STIQ: Safeguarding Training and Inferencing of Quantum Neural Networks from Untrusted Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high expenses imposed by current quantum cloud providers, coupled with the escalating need for quantum resources, may incentivize the emergence of cheaper cloud-based quantum services from potentially untrusted providers. Deploying or hosting quantum models, such as Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), on these untrusted platforms introduces a myriad of security concerns, with the most critical one being model theft. This vulnerability stems from the cloud provider's full access to these circuits during training and/or inference. In this work, we introduce STIQ, a novel ensemble-based strategy designed to safeguard QNNs against such cloud-based adversaries. Our method innovatively trains two distinct QNNs concurrently, hosting them on same or different platforms, in a manner that each network yields obfuscated outputs rendering the individual QNNs ineffective for adversaries operating within cloud environments. However, when these outputs are combined locally (using an aggregate function), they reveal the correct result. Through extensive experiments across various QNNs and datasets, our technique has proven to effectively masks the accuracy and losses of the individually hosted models by upto 76\%, albeit at the expense of $\leq 2\times$ increase in the total computational overhead. This trade-off, however, is a small price to pay for the enhanced security and integrity of QNNs in a cloud-based environment prone to untrusted adversaries. We also demonstrated STIQ's practical application by evaluating it on real 127-qubit IBM\_Sherbrooke hardware, showing that STIQ achieves up to 60\% obfuscation, with combined performance comparable to an unobfuscated model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global optimization routine for the variational quantum algorithms, which utilizes the dynamic tunneling flow. Originally designed to leverage information gathered by a gradient-based optimizer around local minima, we adapt the conventional dynamic tunneling flow to exploit the distance measure of quantum states, resolving issues of extrinsic degeneracy arising from the parametrization of quantum states. Our global optimization algorithm is applied to the variational quantum eigensolver for the transverse-field Ising model to demonstrate the performance of our routine while comparing it with the conventional dynamic tunneling method, which is based on the Euclidean distance measure on the parameter space.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Adaptable Algorithm for Optimal Multi-Qubit Pathfinding in Quantum Circuit Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to significantly enhance our ability to simulate and solve complex, classically intractable problems across various fields of research and industry. However, we are currently in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where devices are relatively small and suffer from substantial noise levels, prohibiting large-scale computations. To achieve any quantum advantage in this regime and beyond, it is crucial to minimise the impact of noise from qubit decoherence and two-qubit gates. A direct approach is to improve the optimisation of quantum circuit compilation processes that map circuits onto physical devices, thereby reducing noisy gates and circuit execution times. This work focuses on multi-qubit pathfinding as a critical subroutine within the quantum circuit compilation mapping problem. We introduce an algorithm, modelled using binary integer linear programming, that navigates qubits on quantum hardware optimally with respect to circuit SWAP-gate depth, while also optimising for accumulated gate errors and can be flexibly adapted to various problem modifications. This multi-qubit pathfinding algorithm incorporates considerations for gate-error penalties, SWAP movement constraints, and configurable arrangements of source and target qubit locations and qubit teams. We have benchmarked the algorithm across a variety of quantum hardware layouts, assessing properties such as computational runtimes, solution SWAP depths, and accumulated SWAP-gate error rates. The results demonstrate the algorithm's practical runtimes on current quantum devices and compare its effectiveness across different hardware configurations, providing insights for future quantum hardware design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a null test of the two-level space of a qubit, which is both device independent and needs a minimal number of different experiments. We demonstrate its feasibility on IBM Quantum, with most qubits failing the test by more than 10 standard deviations. The robustness of the test against common technical imperfections, like decoherence and phase shifts, and supposedly negligible leakage, indicates that the origin of deviations is beyond known effects.</description>

      <title>Transformer for Parameterized Quantum Circuits Expressibility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the exponentially faster computation for certain problems, quantum computing has garnered significant attention in recent years. Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) is a crucial method to implement quantum computing, and an appropriate task-specific ansatz can effectively enhance the quantum advantage of VQAs. However, the vast search space makes it challenging to find the optimal task-specific ansatz. Expressibility, quantifying the diversity of quantum states to explore the Hilbert space effectively, can be used to evaluate whether one ansatz is superior than another. This study investigates the effectiveness of the Transformer model in predicting the expressibility of parameterized quantum circuits. We construct two datasets containing noiseless circuits generated by the gatewise method, varying in qubits, gate numbers and depths. The circuits are transformed into graphs, and then their expressibility are calculated using KL-divergence and Relative KL-divergence. A Transformer model is trained on these datasets to capture the intricate relationships between circuit characteristics and expressibility. Five evaluation metrics are calculated, and experimental results demonstrate that the trained model achieves high performance and robustness across various expressibility calculation methods. This research provides ideas for efficient quantum circuit design and can contribute to the advancement of quantum architecture search methods.</description>

Abstract: The oscillating magnetic field produced by unbalanced currents in radio-frequency ion traps induces transition frequency shifts and sideband transitions that can be harmful to precision spectroscopy experiments. Here, we describe a methodology, based on two-photon spectroscopy, for determining both the strength and direction of rf-induced magnetic fields without modifying any DC magnetic bias field or changing any trap RF power.

      <title>Chiral quantum heating and cooling with an optically controlled ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum heat engines and refrigerators are open quantum systems, whose dynamics can be well understood using a non-Hermitian formalism. A prominent feature of non-Hermiticity is the existence of exceptional points (EPs), which has no counterpart in closed quantum systems. It has been shown in classical systems that dynamical encirclement in the vicinity of an EP, whether the loop includes the EP or not, could lead to chiral mode conversion. Here, we show that this is valid also for quantum systems when dynamical encircling is performed in the vicinity of their Liouvillian EPs (LEPs) which include the effects of quantum jumps and associated noise - an important quantum feature not present in previous works. We demonstrate, using a Paul-trapped ultracold ion, the first chiral quantum heating and refrigeration by dynamically encircling a closed loop in the vicinity of an LEP. We witness the cycling direction to be associated with the chirality and heat release (absorption) of the quantum heat engine (quantum refrigerator). Our experiments have revealed that not only the adiabaticity-breakdown but also the Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg process play an essential role during dynamic encircling, resulting in chiral thermodynamic cycles. Our observations contributes to further understanding of chiral and topological features in non-Hermitian systems and pave a way to exploring the relation between chirality and quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm Scattering From Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Aharonov-Bohm effect is perhaps the first example in which the the interplay between classical topology and quantum theory was explored. This connection has continued to shed light on diverse areas of physics like quantum statistics, anomalies, condensed matter physics, and gauge theories. Several attempts were made to generalize the Aharonov-Bohm effect by modifying the simple solenoidal current distribution used by them to the case of multiple solenoids, and a toroidal solenoid, for example. A particularly ambitious task is to confine the magnetic flux to the interior of a knotted solenoid. While it is to be expected that a non-trivial phase factor will be picked up by the wave function of a charged particle travelling in the complement of the knot in three-dimensional space, the lack of symmetry defied attempts to explicitly solve the associated scattering problem. In this paper we report on a way to make progress towards this problem based on multipole expansions. The vector potential produced by a knot is obtained by making a multipole expansion, which is then used to calculate the S-matrix for the scattering of the charged particle, in the Born approximation. It is found that the S-matrix carries an imprint of the knottedness at the octopole order. For the case of a torus knot, a curious factorization property is seen to hold.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Switching with One-Way Repeaters in Star Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributing quantum states reliably among distant locations is a key challenge in the field of quantum networks. One-way quantum networks address this by using one-way communication and quantum error correction. Here, we analyze quantum circuit switching as a protocol to distribute quantum states in one-way quantum networks. In quantum circuit switching, pairs of users can request the delivery of multiple quantum states from one user to the other. After waiting for approval from the network, the states can be distributed either sequentially, forwarding one at a time along a path of quantum repeaters, or in parallel, sending batches of quantum states from repeater to repeater. Since repeaters can only forward a finite number of quantum states at a time, a pivotal question arises: is it advantageous to send them sequentially (allowing for multiple requests simultaneously) or in parallel (reducing processing time but handling only one request at a time)? We compare both approaches in a quantum network with a star topology. Using tools from queuing theory, we show that requests are met at a higher rate when packets are distributed in parallel, although sequential distribution can generally provide service to a larger number of users simultaneously. We also show that using a large number of quantum repeaters to combat channel losses limits the maximum distance between users, as each repeater introduces additional processing delays. These findings provide insight into the design of protocols for distributing quantum states in one-way quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Implementing arbitrary multi-mode continuous-variable quantum gates with fixed non-Gaussian states and adaptive linear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum gates are essential components for optical quantum information processing. However, the efficient implementation of practically important multi-mode higher-order non-Gaussian gates has not been comprehensively studied. We propose a measurement-based method to directly implement general, multi-mode, and higher-order non-Gaussian gates using only fixed non-Gaussian ancillary states and adaptive linear optics. Compared to existing methods, our method allows for a more resource-efficient and experimentally feasible implementation of multi-mode gates that are important for various applications in optical quantum technology, such as the two-mode cubic quantum non-demolition gate or the three-mode continuous-variable Toffoli gate, and their higher-order extensions. Our results will expedite the progress toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computing with light.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimal Control of Squeezing in Cavity Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezing is a non-classical feature of quantum states that is a useful resource, for example in quantum sensing of mechanical forces. Here, we show how to use optimal control theory to maximize squeezing in an optomechanical setup with two external drives and determine how fast the mechanical mode can be squeezed. For the autonomous drives considered here, we find the inverse cavity decay to lower-bound the protocol duration. At and above this limit, we identify a family of protocols leveraging a two-stage control strategy, where the mechanical mode is cooled before it is squeezed. Identification of the control strategy allows for two important insights - to determine the factors that limit squeezing and to simplify the time-dependence of the external drives, making our protocol readily applicable in experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient and operational quantifier of divisibility in terms of channel discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding of open quantum systems is crucial for the development of quantum technologies. Of particular relevance is the characterisation of divisible quantum dynamics, seen as a generalisation of Markovian processes to the quantum setting. Here, we propose a way to detect divisibility and quantify how non-divisible a quantum channel is through the concept of channel discrimination. We ask how well we can distinguish generic dynamics from divisible dynamics. We show that this question can be answered efficiently through semidefinite programming, which provides us with an operational and efficient way to quantify divisibility.</description>

      <title>A quantum implementation of high-order power method for estimating geometric entanglement of pure states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is one of the fundamental properties of a quantum state and is a crucial differentiator between classical and quantum computation. There are many ways to define entanglement and its measure, depending on the problem or application under consideration. Each of these measures may be computed or approximated by multiple methods. However, hardly any of these methods can be run on near-term quantum hardware. This work presents a quantum adaptation of the iterative higher-order power method for estimating the geometric measure of entanglement of multi-qubit pure states using rank-1 tensor approximation. This method is executable on current (hybrid) quantum hardware and does not depend on quantum memory. We study the effect of noise on the algorithm using a simple theoretical model based on the standard depolarising channel. This model allows us to post hoc mitigate the effects of noise on the results of the computation.</description>

      <title>Efficiency fluctuations of a heat engine with noise induced quantum coherences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the efficiency fluctuations of a coherent quantum heat engine coupled to a unimodal cavity using a standard full-counting statistics procedure. The engine's most likely efficiency obtained by computing the large-deviation function corresponds to the quantum efficiency obtained by defining a useful work obtainable from a steady-state fluctuation theorem. The most likely efficiency is independent of the noise induced coherences. The ratio between coherent and incoherent efficiency cumulants is found to be constant and independent of the stochastic efficiency, which we prove analytically. We also numerically demonstrate that treating the efficiency as a stochastic variable allows the enhancement of constancy only in the presence of coherences. At the engine's most likely efficiency, there is no suppression of the second efficiency cumulant leading to a robust constancy. We also report the existence of a lower bound on the second efficiency cumulant.</description>

      <title>Fate of non-Hermitian free fermions with Wannier-Stark ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) dynamically alters the entanglement behavior of non-Hermitian free fermions. Using the single-particle correlation matrix, we studied the effective Hamiltonian of these fermions with WSL. By examining the half-chain entanglement entropy (EE) under open boundary conditions (OBCs), we identified two different area law regions and an algebraic scaling region. Finite-size scaling revealed the critical scaling behavior of the half-chain EE. This system also shows distinct entanglement behavior under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs), differing from (1+1)D conformal field theory (CFT) under Anderson localizations scenarios. Our work paves the way for exploring the intriguing entanglement phases arising from the interplay between the non-Hermitian Skin effect (NHSE) and Wannier-Stark localization.</description>

      <title>Detection of entanglement by harnessing extracted work in an opto-magno-mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connections between thermodynamics and quantum information processing are of paramount importance. Here, we address a bipartite entanglement via extracted work in a cavity magnomechanical system contained inside an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere. The photons and magnons interact through an interaction between magnetic dipoles. A magnetostrictive interaction, analogous to radiation pressure, couple's phonons and magnons. The extracted work was obtained through a device similar to the Szil\'ard engine. This engine operates by manipulating the photon-magnon as a bipartite quantum state. We employ logarithmic negativity to measure the amount of entanglement between photon and magnon modes in steady and dynamical states. We explore the extracted work, separable work, and maximum work for squeezed thermal states. We investigate the amount of work extracted from a bipartite quantum state, which can potentially determine the degree of entanglement present in that state. Numerical studies show that entanglement, as detected by the extracted work and quantified by logarithmic negativity, is in good agreement. We show the reduction of extracted work by a second measurement compared to a single measurement. Also, the efficiency of the Szilard engine in steady and dynamical states is investigated. We hope this work is of paramount importance in quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal control problem for open quantum systems can be formulated as a time-dependent Lindbladian that is parameterized by a number of time-dependent control variables. Given an observable and an initial state, the goal is to tune the control variables so that the expected value of some observable with respect to the final state is maximized. In this paper, we present algorithms for solving this optimal control problem efficiently, i.e., having a poly-logarithmic dependency on the system dimension, which is exponentially faster than best-known classical algorithms. Our algorithms are hybrid, consisting of both quantum and classical components. The quantum procedure simulates time-dependent Lindblad evolution that drives the initial state to the final state, and it also provides access to the gradients of the objective function via quantum gradient estimation. The classical procedure uses the gradient information to update the control variables.
  At the technical level, we provide the first (to the best of our knowledge) simulation algorithm for time-dependent Lindbladians with an $\ell_1$-norm dependence. As an alternative, we also present a simulation algorithm in the interaction picture to improve the algorithm for the cases where the time-independent component of a Lindbladian dominates the time-dependent part. On the classical side, we heavily adapt the state-of-the-art classical optimization analysis to interface with the quantum part of our algorithms. Both the quantum simulation techniques and the classical optimization analyses might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell's theorem, a cornerstone of quantum theory, shows that quantum correlations are incompatible with a classical theory of cause and effect. Through the lens of causal inference, it can be understood as a particular case of causal compatibility, which delves into the alignment of observational data with a given causal structure. Here, we explore the problem of causal data fusion that aims to piece together data tables collected under heterogeneous conditions. We investigate the quantum non-classicality that emerges when integrating both passive observations and interventions within an experimental setup. Referred to as "non-classicality from data fusion," this phenomenon is identified and scrutinized across all latent exogenous causal structures involving three observed variables. Notably, we demonstrate the existence of quantum non-classicality resulting from data fusion, even in scenarios where achieving standard Bell non-classicality is impossible. Furthermore, we showcase the potential for attaining non-classicality across multiple interventions using quantum resources. This work extends a more compact parallel letter on the same subject and provides all the required technical proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the modern perspective of causal inference, Bell's theorem -- a fundamental signature of quantum theory -- is a particular case where quantum correlations are incompatible with the classical theory of causality, and the generalization of Bell's theorem to quantum networks has led to several breakthrough results and novel applications. Here, we consider the problem of causal data fusion, where we piece together multiple datasets collected under heterogeneous conditions. In particular, we show quantum experiments can generate observational and interventional data with a non-classical signature when pieced together that cannot be reproduced classically. We prove this quantum non-classicality emerges from the fusion of the datasets and is present in a plethora of scenarios, even where standard Bell non-classicality is impossible. Furthermore, we show that non-classicality genuine to the fusion of multiple data tables is achievable with quantum resources. Our work shows incorporating interventions -- a central tool in causal inference -- can be a powerful tool to detect non-classicality beyond the violation of a standard Bell inequality. In a companion article "Quantum Non-classicality from Causal Data Fusion", we extend our investigation considering all latent exogenous causal structures with 3 observable variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pauli matrices and Pauli strings are widely used in quantum computing. These mathematical objects are useful to describe or manipulate the quantum state of qubits. They offer a convenient basis to express operators and observables used in different problem instances such as molecular simulation and combinatorial optimization. Therefore, it is important to have a well-rounded, versatile and efficient tool to handle a large number of Pauli strings and operators expressed in this basis. This is the objective behind the development of the PauliArray library presented in this work. This library introduces data structures to represent arrays of Pauli strings and operators as well as various methods to modify and combine them. Built using NumPy, PauliArray offers fast operations and the ability to use broadcasting to easily carry out otherwise cumbersome manipulations. Applications to the fermion-to-qubit mapping, to the estimation of expectation values and to the computation of commutators are considered to illustrate how PauliArray can simplify some relevant tasks and accomplish them faster than current libraries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show in this paper that a strong and easy connection exists between quantum error correction and Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT) by using the Gauge symmetry to construct an efficient error-correcting code for Abelian LGTs. We identify the logical operations on this gauge covariant code and show that the corresponding Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of these logical operations while preserving the locality of the interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these substitutions actually give a new way of writing the LGT as an equivalent hardcore boson model. Finally we demonstrate a method to perform fault-tolerant time evolution of the Hamiltonian within the gauge covariant code using both product formulas and qubitization approaches. This opens up the possibility of inexpensive end to end dynamical simulations that save physical qubits by blurring the lines between simulation algorithms and quantum error correcting codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new optimal and heuristic algorithms for exact synthesis of multi-qubit unitaries and isometries. For example, our algorithms find Clifford and T circuits for unitaries with entries in $\mathbb{Z}[i,1/\sqrt{2}]$. The optimal algorithms are the A* search instantiated with a new data structure for graph vertices and new consistent heuristic functions. We also prove that for some gate sets, best-first search synthesis relying on the same heuristic is efficient. For example, for two-qubit Clifford and T circuits, our best-first search runtime is proportional to the T-count of the unitary. Our algorithms rely on Hermite and Smith Normal Forms of matrices with entries in a ring of integers of a number field, and we leverage the theory of and algorithms for Hermitian lattices over number fields to prove efficiency. These new techniques are of independent interest for future work on multi-qubit exact circuit synthesis and related questions.</description>

      <title>ACE: A general-purpose non-Markovian open quantum systems simulation toolkit based on process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a general-purpose computational toolkit for simulating open quantum systems, which provides numerically exact solutions for composites of zero-dimensional quantum systems that may be strongly coupled to multiple, quite general non-Markovian environments. It is based on process tensor matrix product operators (PT-MPOs), which efficiently encapsulate environment influences. The code features implementations of several PT-MPO algorithms, in particular, Automated Compression of Environments (ACE) for general environments comprised of independent modes as well as schemes for generalized spin boson models. The latter includes a divide-and-conquer scheme for periodic PT-MPOs, which enable million time step simulations for realistic models. PT-MPOs can be precalculated and reused for efficiently probing different time-dependent system Hamiltonians. They can also be stacked together and combined to provide numerically complete solutions of small networks of open quantum systems. The code is written in C++ and is fully controllable by configuration files, for which we have developed a versatile and compact human-readable format.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and complex-time correlations using minimally entangled typical thermal states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network states have enjoyed great success at capturing aspects of strong correlation physics. However, obtaining dynamical correlators at non-zero temperatures is generically hard even using these methods. Here, we introduce a practical approach to computing such correlators using minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS). While our primary method directly computes dynamical correlators of physical operators in real time, we propose extensions where correlations are evaluated in the complex-time plane. The imaginary time component bounds the rate of entanglement growth and strongly alleviates the computational difficulty allowing the study of larger system sizes. To extract the physical correlator one must take the limit of purely real-time evolution. We present two routes to obtaining this information (i) via an analytic correlation function in complex time combined with a stochastic analytic continuation method to obtain the real-time limit and (ii) a hermitian correlation function that asymptotically captures the desired correlation function quantitatively without requiring effort of numerical analytic continuation. We show that these numerical techniques capture the finite-temperature dynamics of the Shastry-Sutherland model - a model of interacting spin one-half in two dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We study the internal dynamics of a hypothetical spaceship traveling on a close timelike curve in a G\"{o}del-type universe. We choose the curve so that the generator of evolution in proper time is the angular momentum. Using Wigner's theorem, we prove that the energy levels internal to the spaceship must undergo spontaneous discretization. The level separation turns out to be finely tuned so that, after completing a roundtrip of the curve, all systems are back to their initial state. This implies, for example, that the memories of an observer inside the spaceship are necessarily erased by the end of the journey. More in general, if there is an increase in entropy, a Poincar\'{e} cycle will eventually reverse it by the end of the loop, forcing entropy to decrease back to its initial value. We show that such decrease in entropy is in agreement with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The non-existence of time-travel paradoxes follows as a rigorous corollary of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity signatures in gravitational wave detectors placed inside a harmonic trap potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a general gravitational wave detector of gravitational wave interacting with an incoming gravitational wave carrying plus polarization only placed inside a harmonic trap. This model can be well acquainted with the description of a resonant detector of gravitational wave as well. The well known detector-gravitational wave interaction scenario uses the method of a semi classical approach where the detector is treated quantum mechanically but the gravitational wave is considered at a classical level. In our analysis, we use a discrete mode decomposition of the gravitational wave perturbation which results in a Hamiltonian involving the position and momentum operators corresponding to the gravitational wave and the harmonic oscillator. We have then calculated the transition probability for the harmonic oscillator-gravitational wave tensor product state for going from an initial state to some unknown final state. Using the energy flux relation of the gravitational waves, we observe that if we consider the total energy as a combination of the number of gravitons in the initial state of the detector then the transition probability for the resonant absorption case scenario takes the analytical form which is exactly similar to the semi-classical absorption case. In case of the emission scenario, we observe a spontaneous emission of a single graviton which was completely absent in the semi-classical analouge of this model. This therefore gives a direct signature of linearized quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Exploring Frustration Effects of Strongly Interacting Bosons via the Hall Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Hall response of hardcore bosonic atoms on a triangular ladder in a magnetic field. We show that the behavior of the Hall polarization, both in its saturation value and in the short-time dynamics, correlates with the features of the underlying phase diagram. In particular, it exhibits a strong negative response at the Meissner to vortex phase transitions, while at large magnetic fluxes, after changing sign, it shows a strong positive response due to non-trivial vortex commensurability effects stemming from the interplay of interactions and geometric frustration. Thus, one can employ the Hall response as a sensitive probe of the many-body chiral quantum phases present in the system.</description>

      <title>Identification of defects and the origins of surface noise on hydrogen-terminated (100) diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-surface nitrogen-vacancy centres are critical to many diamond-based quantum technologies such as information processors and nanosensors. Surface defects play an important role in the design and performance of these devices. The targeted creation of defects is central to proposed bottom-up approaches to nanofabrication of quantum diamond processors, and uncontrolled surface defects may generate noise and charge trapping which degrade shallow NV device performance. Surface preparation protocols may be able to control the production of desired defects and eliminate unwanted defects, but only if their atomic structure can first be conclusively identified. This work uses a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) imaging and first-principles simulations to identify several surface defects on H:C(100)-2x1 surfaces prepared using chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The atomic structure of these defects is elucidated, from which the microscopic origins of magnetic noise and charge trapping is determined based on modelling of their paramagnetic properties and acceptor states. Rudimentary control of these deleterious properties is demonstrated through STM tip-induced manipulation of the defect structure. Furthermore, the results validate accepted models for CVD diamond growth by identifying key adsorbates responsible for nucleation of new layers.</description>

Abstract: Generalization is an important feature of neural network, and there have been many studies on it. Recently, with the development of quantum compu-ting, it brings new opportunities. In this paper, we studied a class of quantum neural network constructed by quantum gate. In this model, we mapped the feature data to a quantum state in Hilbert space firstly, and then implement unitary evolution on it, in the end, we can get the classification result by im-plement measurement on the quantum state. Since all the operations in quan-tum neural networks are unitary, the parameters constitute a hypersphere of Hilbert space. Compared with traditional neural network, the parameter space is flatter. Therefore, it is not easy to fall into local optimum, which means the quantum neural networks have better generalization. In order to validate our proposal, we evaluated our model on three public datasets, the results demonstrated that our model has better generalization than the classical neu-ral network with the same structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.00873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the initial and final exchange symmetries between the two-coin states influence the spatial entanglement dynamics between the two corresponding quantum walkers. Notably, when the initial state is anti-symmetric and the final measurement on the coins yields symmetric outcomes, all the initial entanglement will be transferred to the spatial degrees of freedom, regardless of when the coins are measured. Conversely, if the final outcomes are anti-symmetric, the spatial entanglement exhibits damped oscillation with a period ($T$) being inversely proportional to the coin operator parameter ($\theta$). These behaviours are reversed for symmetric initial states. Moreover, we also observe the same spatial entanglement damping regardless of the initial state when the post-selected results lack symmetry. Our findings reveal how symmetries affect the entanglement dynamics in quantum walks, offering potential insights for applications in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Efficient generation of entangled multi-photon graph states from a single atom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement is a powerful concept with an enormous potential for scientific and technological advances. A central focus in modern research is to extend the generation and control of entangled states from few to many qubits, and protect them against decoherence. Optical photons play a prominent role as these qubit carriers are naturally robust and easy to manipulate. However, the most successful technique to date for creating photonic entanglement is inherently probabilistic and therefore subject to severe scalability limitations. Here we avoid these by implementing a deterministic protocol with a single memory atom in a cavity. We interleave controlled single-photon emissions with tailored atomic qubit rotations to efficiently grow Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of up to 14 photons and linear cluster states of up to 12 photons with a fidelity lower bounded by 76(6)% and 56(4)%, respectively. Thanks to a source-to-detection efficiency of 43.18(7)% per photon we measure these large states about once every minute, orders of magnitude faster than in any previous experiment. In the future, this rate could be increased even further, the scheme could be extended to two atoms in a cavity, or several sources could be quantum mechanically coupled, to generate higher-dimensional cluster states. Overcoming the limitations encountered by probabilistic schemes for photonic entanglement generation, our results may offer a way towards scalable measurement-based quantum computation and communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unique properties of multimode non-Hermitian lattice dynamics can be utilized to construct exponentially sensitive sensors. However, the impact of noise remains unclear, which may severely degrade their sensitivity. We analytically characterize and highlight the impact of loss and gain on the sensitivity revival and stability of non-Hermitian sensors. Defying the general belief that the superiority of quantum sensing will vanish in the presence of loss, we find that by proactively tuning the loss, the exponential sensitivity can be surprisingly regained when the sensing dynamics is stable. Furthermore, we prove that gain is crucial to fully revive the ideally exponential sensitivity and to ensure the stability of non-Hermitian sensing by making a balanced loss and gain. Our paper opens a way to significantly enhance the sensitivity by proactively tuning the loss and gain, which may promote future quantum sensing and quantum engineering.</description>

Abstract: The long range spatial and temporal ordering displayed by discrete time crystals, can become advantageous properties when used for sensing extremely weak signals. Here, we investigate their performance as quantum sensors of weak AC-fields and demonstrate, using the quantum Fisher information measure, that they can overcome the shot noise limit while allowing long interrogation times. In such systems, collective interactions stabilize their dynamics against noise making them robust enough to protocol imperfections.</description>

      <title>Self-testing of semisymmetric informationally complete measurements in a qubit prepare-and-measure scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07248v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-testing is a powerful method for certifying quantum systems. Initially proposed in the device-independent (DI) setting, self-testing has since been relaxed to the semi-device-independent (semi-DI) setting. In this study, we focus on the self-testing of a specific type of non-projective qubit measurements belonging to a one-parameter family, using the semi-DI prepare-and-measure (PM) scenario. Remarkably, we identify the simplest PM scenario discovered so far, involving only four preparations and four measurements, for self-testing the fourth measurement. This particular measurement is a four-outcome non-projective positive operator-valued measure (POVM) and falls in the class of semisymmetric informationally complete (semi-SIC) POVMs introduced by Geng et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 100401 (2021)]. To achieve this, we develop analytical techniques for semi-DI self-testing in the PM scenario. Our results shall pave the way towards self-testing any extremal qubit POVM within a potentially minimal PM scenario.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic time evolution of highly excited states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic time evolution of quantum systems is a widely used tool with applications ranging from state preparation through simplifications of computations and topological transformations to optimization and quantum computing. Adiabatic time evolution generally works well for gapped ground states, but not for thermal states in the middle of the spectrum that lack a protecting energy gap. Here we show that quantum many-body scars -- a particular type of highly excited states -- are suitable for adiabatic time evolution despite the absence of a protecting energy gap. Considering two rather different models, namely a one-dimensional model constructed from tensor networks and a two-dimensional fractional quantum Hall model with anyons, we find that the quantum scars perform similarly to gapped ground states with respect to adiabatic dynamics when the required final adiabatic fidelity is around 0.99. The maximum speed at which the scar state of the one-dimensional model can be adiabatically transformed decreases as a power law with system size, as opposed to exponentially for both generic thermal and disorder-driven localized states. At constant and very low ramp speed, we find that the deviation of the fidelity from unity scales linearly with ramp speed for scar states, but quadratically for gapped ground states. The gapped ground states hence perform better when the required adiabatic fidelities are very high, such as 0.9999 and above. We identify two mechanisms for leakage out of the scar state and use them to explain our results. While manipulating a single, isolated ground state is common in quantum applications, adiabatic evolution of scar states provides the flexibility to manipulate an entire tower of ground-state-like states simultaneously in a single system.</description>

      <title>Noisy Quantum Trees: Infinite Protection Without Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum networks with tree structures, in which information propagates from a root to leaves. At each node in the network, the received qubit unitarily interacts with fresh ancilla qubits, after which each qubit is sent through a noisy channel to a different node in the next level. Therefore, as the tree depth grows, there is a competition between the irreversible effect of noise and the protection against such noise achieved by delocalization of information. In the classical setting, where each node simply copies the input bit into multiple output bits, this model has been studied as the broadcasting or reconstruction problem on trees, which has broad applications. In this work, we study the quantum version of this problem. We consider a Clifford encoder at each node that encodes the input qubit in a stabilizer code, along with a single qubit Pauli noise channel at each edge. Such noisy quantum trees describe a scenario in which one has access to a stream of fresh (low-entropy) ancilla qubits, but cannot perform error correction. Therefore, they provide a different perspective on quantum fault tolerance. Furthermore, they provide a useful model for describing the effect of noise within the encoders of concatenated codes. We prove that above certain noise thresholds, which depend on the properties of the code such as its distance, as well as the properties of the encoder, information decays exponentially with the depth of the tree. On the other hand, by studying certain efficient decoders, we prove that for codes with distance d&gt;=2 and for sufficiently small (but non-zero) noise, classical information and entanglement propagate over a noisy tree with infinite depth. Indeed, we find that this remains true even for binary trees with certain 2-qubit encoders at each node, which encode the received qubit in the binary repetition code with distance d=1.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that the action functional can be used to define classical, quantum, closed, and open dynamics in a generalization of the variational principle and in the path integral formalism in classical and quantum dynamics, respectively. These schemes are based on an unusual feature, a formal redoubling of the degrees of freedom. Several arguments to motivate the redoubling are put forward in classical and quantum mechanics to demonstrate that such a formalism is natural.</description>

      <title>Incentivising Demand Side Response through Discount Scheduling using Hybrid Quantum Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demand Side Response (DSR) is a strategy that enables consumers to actively participate in managing electricity demand. It aims to alleviate strain on the grid during high demand and promote a more balanced and efficient use of (renewable) electricity resources. We implement DSR through discount scheduling, which involves offering discrete price incentives to consumers to adjust their electricity consumption patterns to times when their local energy mix consists of more renewable energy. Since we tailor the discounts to individual customers' consumption, the Discount Scheduling Problem (DSP) becomes a large combinatorial optimization task. Consequently, we adopt a hybrid quantum computing approach, using D-Wave's Leap Hybrid Cloud. We benchmark Leap against Gurobi, a classical Mixed Integer optimizer in terms of solution quality at fixed runtime and fairness in terms of discount allocation. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale decomposition algorithm/heuristic for the DSP, applied with either quantum or classical computers running the subroutines, which significantly reduces the problem size while maintaining solution quality. Using synthetic data generated from real-world data, we observe that the classical decomposition method obtains the best overall \newp{solution quality for problem sizes up to 3200 consumers, however, the hybrid quantum approach provides more evenly distributed discounts across consumers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by their central role in fault-tolerant quantum computation, we study the sets of gates of the third-level of the Clifford hierarchy and their distinguished subsets of `nearly diagonal' semi-Clifford gates. The Clifford hierarchy gates can be implemented via gate teleportation given appropriate magic states. The vast quantity of these resource states required for achieving fault-tolerance is a significant bottleneck for the practical realisation of universal quantum computers. Semi-Clifford gates are important because they can be implemented with far more efficient use of these resource states.
  We prove that every third-level gate of up to two qudits is semi-Clifford. We thus generalise results of Zeng-Chen-Chuang (2008) in the qubit case and of the second author (2020) in the qutrit case to the case of qudits of arbitrary prime dimension $d$.
  Earlier results relied on exhaustive computations whereas our present work leverages tools of algebraic geometry. Specifically, we construct two schemes corresponding to the sets of third-level Clifford hierarchy gates and third-level semi-Clifford gates. We then show that the two algebraic sets resulting from reducing these schemes modulo $d$ share the same set of rational points.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Traditional No-Go Theorems: Quantum Advantage in Multiple Access Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extension of point-to-point communication model to the realm of multi-node configurations finds a plethora of applications in internet and telecommunication networks. Here, we establish a novel advantage of quantum communication in a commonly encountered network configuration known as the Multiple Access Channel (MAC). A MAC consists of multiple distant senders aiming to send their respective messages to a common receiver. Unlike the quantum superdense coding protocol, the advantage reported here is realized without invoking entanglement between the senders and the receiver. Notably, such an advantage is unattainable in traditional point-to-point communication involving one sender and one receiver, where the limitations imposed by the Holevo and Frankel Weiner no-go theorems come into play. Within the MAC setup, this distinctive advantage materializes through the receiver's unique ability to simultaneously decode the quantum systems received from multiple senders. Intriguingly, some of our MAC designs draw inspiration from various other constructs in quantum foundations, such as the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem and the concept of `nonlocality without entanglement', originally explored for entirely different purposes. Beyond its immediate applications in network communication, the presented quantum advantage hints at a profound connection with the concept of `quantum nonlocality without inputs' and holds the potential for semi-device-independent certification of entangled measurements.</description>

Abstract: We perform a comparative study of light storage in antirelaxation-coated and buffer-gas-filled alkali-vapor cells using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in warm rubidium vapor. The use of a buffer-gas-filled cell resulted in $\approx$10-fold improvement in storage time and efficiency compared to antirelaxation coated cells.

      <title>Complexity and order in approximate quantum error-correcting codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish rigorous connections between quantum circuit complexity and approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) properties, covering both all-to-all and geometric scenarios including lattice systems. To this end, we introduce a type of code parameter that we call subsystem variance, which is closely related to the optimal AQEC precision. Our key finding is that if the subsystem variance is below an $O(k/n)$ threshold then any state in the code subspace must obey certain circuit complexity lower bounds, which identify nontrivial ``phases'' of codes. Based on our results, we propose $O(k/n)$ as a boundary between subspaces that should and should not count as AQEC codes. This theory of AQEC provides a versatile framework for understanding the quantum complexity and order of many-body quantum systems, offering new insights for wide-ranging physical scenarios, in particular topological order and critical quantum systems which are of outstanding importance in many-body and high energy physics. We observe from various different perspectives that roughly $O(1/n)$ represents a common, physically significant ``scaling threshold'' of subsystem variance for features associated with nontrivial quantum order.</description>

Abstract: Second generation quantum technologies aim to outperform classical alternatives by utilizing engineered quantum systems. Maintaining the coherence required to enable any quantum advantage requires detailed knowledge and control over the noise the hosting system is subjected to. Characterizing noise processes via their power spectral density is routinely done throughout science and technology and can be a demanding task. Determining the phase noise power spectrum in leading quantum technology platforms, for example, can be either outside the reach of many phase noise analyzers, or be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we present and characterize a cost-effective optical phase noise analyzer for quantum technology applications. Using this setup we compare two $\approx1\ \rm{Hz}$ linewidth ultra-stable oscillators near $729\ \rm{nm}$, using them as references to determine and discuss the noise floor achieved in this measurement apparatus with a focus on limitations and their tradeoffs. The achieved noise floor in this implementation of a low-cost, all-stock component, low-complexity phase noise analyzer compares favourably to commercial offerings. This setup can find application in particular without a more stable reference or operational quantum system as sensor as would be the case for many component manufacturers.</description>

      <title>Phase Noise in Real-World Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of noise sources in real-world implementations of Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) protocols is investigated, focusing on phase noise from photon sources and connecting fibers. This work emphasizes the role of laser quality, network topology, fiber length, arm balance, and detector performance in determining key rates. Remarkably, it reveals that the leading TF-QKD protocols are similarly affected by phase noise despite different mechanisms. This study demonstrates duty cycle improvements of over a factor of two through narrow-linewidth lasers and phase-control techniques, highlighting the potential synergy with high-precision time/frequency distribution services. Ultrastable lasers, evolving toward integration and miniaturization, offer promise for agile TF-QKD implementations on existing networks. Properly addressing phase noise and practical constraints allows for consistent key rate predictions, protocol selection, and layout design, crucial for establishing secure long-haul links for the Quantum Communication Infrastructures under development in several countries.</description>

      <title>Light scattering properties beyond weak-field excitation in atomic ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of optical properties of large atomic system, a weak laser driving is often assumed to simplify the system dynamics by linearly coupled equations. Here, we investigate the light scattering properties of atomic ensembles beyond weak-field excitation through the cumulant expansion method. By progressively incorporating higher-order correlations into the steady-state equations, an enhanced accuracy can be achieved in comparison to the exact solutions from solving a full density matrix. Our analysis reveals that, in the regime of weak dipole-dipole interaction (DDI), the first-order expansion yields satisfactory predictions for optical depth, while denser atomic configurations necessitate consideration of higher-order correlations. As the intensity of incident light increases, atom saturation effects become noticeable, giving rise to significant changes in light transparency, energy shift, and decay rate. This saturation phenomenon extends to subradiant atom arrays even under weak driving conditions, leading to substantial deviations from the linear model. Our findings demonstrate the mean-field models as good extensions to linear models as it balances both accuracy and computational complexity. However, the crucial role of higher-order cumulants in large and dense atom systems remains unclear, since it is challenging theoretically owing to the exponentially increasing Hilbert space in such light-matter interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Realistic Cost to Execute Practical Quantum Circuits using Direct Clifford+T Lattice Surgery Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a resource estimation pipeline that explicitly compiles quantum circuits expressed using the Clifford+T gate set into a surface code lattice surgery instruction set. The cadence of magic state requests from the compiled circuit enables the optimization of magic state distillation and storage requirements in a post-hoc analysis. To compile logical circuits into lattice surgery operations, we build upon the open-source Lattice Surgery Compiler. The revised compiler operates in two stages: the first translates logical gates into an abstract, layout-independent instruction set; the second compiles these into local lattice surgery instructions that are allocated to hardware tiles according to a specified resource layout. The second stage retains logical parallelism while avoiding resource contention in the fault-tolerant layer, aiding realism. Additionally, users can specify dedicated tiles at which magic states are replenished, enabling resource costs from the logical computation to be considered independently from magic state distillation and storage. We demonstrate the applicability of our pipeline to large, practical quantum circuits by providing resource estimates for the ground state estimation of molecules. We find that variable magic state consumption rates in real circuits can cause the resource costs of magic state storage to dominate unless production is varied to suit.</description>

      <title>Local Purity Distillation in Quantum Systems: Exploring the Complementarity Between Purity and Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics and quantum entanglement represent two pivotal quantum resource theories with significant relevance in quantum information science. Despite their importance, the intricate relationship between these two theories is still not fully understood. Here, we delve into the interplay between entanglement and thermodynamics, particularly in the context of local cooling processes. We introduce and develop the framework of Gibbs-preserving local operations and classical communication. Within this framework, we explore strategies enabling remote parties to effectively cool their local systems to the ground state. Our analysis is centered on scenarios where only a single copy of a quantum state is accessible, with the ideal performance defined by the highest possible fidelity to the ground state achievable under these constraints. We focus on systems with fully degenerate local Hamiltonians, where local cooling aligns with the extraction of local purity. In this context, we establish a powerful link between the efficiency of local purity extraction and the degree of entanglement present in the system, a concept we define as purity-entanglement complementarity. Moreover, we demonstrate that in many pertinent scenarios, the optimal performance can be precisely determined through semidefinite programming techniques. Our findings open doors to various practical applications, including techniques for entanglement detection and estimation. We demonstrate this by evaluating the amount of entanglement for a class of bound entangled states.</description>

      <title>Analysis of spin-squeezing generation in cavity-coupled atomic ensembles with continuous measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the generation of spin-squeezed states via coupling of three-level atoms to an optical cavity and continuous quantum measurement of the transmitted cavity field in order to monitor the evolution of the atomic ensemble. Using analytical treatment and microscopic simulations of the dynamics, we show that one can achieve significant spin squeezing, favorably scaling with the number of atoms $N$. However, contrary to some previous literature, we clarify that it is not possible to obtain Heisenberg scaling without the continuous feedback that is proposed in optimal approaches. In fact, in the adiabatic cavity removal approximation and large $N$ limit, we find the scaling behavior $N^{-2/3}$ for spin squeezing and $N^{-1/3}$ for the corresponding protocol duration. These results can be obtained only by considering the curvature of the Bloch sphere, since linearizing the collective spin operators tangentially to its equator yields inaccurate predictions. With full simulations, we characterize how spin-squeezing generation depends on the system parameters and departs from the bad cavity regime, by gradually mixing with cavity-filling dynamics until metrological advantage is lost. Finally, we discuss the relevance of this spin-squeezing protocol to state-of-the-art optical clocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of black holes is expected to follow the Page curve. After an initial linear increase with time the entanglement entropy should reach a maximum at the Page time and then decrease. This paper introduces an exactly solvable model of free fermions that explicitly shows such a Page curve: The entanglement entropy vanishes asymptotically for late times instead of saturating at a volume law. The bending down of the Page curve is accompanied by a breakdown of the semiclassical connection between particle current and entanglement generation, a quantum phase transition in the entanglement Hamiltonian and non-analytic behavior of the $q\rightarrow\infty$ Renyi entropy. These observations are expected to hold for a larger class of systems beyond the exactly solvable model analyzed here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of existence of symmetric informationally-complete positive operator-valued measures (SICs for short) in every dimension is known as Zauner's conjecture and remains open to this day. Most of the known SIC examples are constructed as an orbit of the Weyl-Heisenberg group action. It appears that in these cases SICs are invariant under the so-called canonical order-three unitaries, which define automorphisms of the Weyl-Heisenberg group. In this note, we show that those order-three unitaries appear in projective unitary representations of the triangle group $(3,3,3)$. We give a full description of such representations and show how it can be used to obtain results about the structure of canonical order-three unitaries. In particular, we present an alternative way of proving the fact that any canonical order-three unitary is conjugate to Zauner's unitary if the dimension $d&gt;3$ is prime.</description>

Abstract: Rotation symmetric bosonic codes are an attractive encoding for qubits into oscillator degrees of freedom, particularly in superconducting qubit experiments. While these codes can tolerate considerable loss and dephasing, they will need to be combined with higher level codes to achieve large-scale devices. We investigate concatenating these codes with the planar code in a measurement-based scheme for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We focus on binomial codes as the base level encoding, and estimate break-even points for such encodings under loss for various types of measurement protocol. These codes are more resistant to photon loss errors, but require both higher mean photon numbers and higher phase resolution for gate operations and measurements. We find that it is necessary to implement adaptive phase measurements, maximum likelihood quantum state inference, and weighted minimum weight decoding to obtain good performance for a planar code using binomial code qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport in open quantum systems can be explored through various theoretical frameworks, including the quantum master equation, scattering matrix, and Heisenberg equation of motion. The choice of framework depends on factors such as the presence of interactions, the coupling strength between the system and environment, and whether the focus is on steady-state or transient regimes. Existing literature treats these frameworks independently, lacking a unified perspective. Our work addresses this gap by clarifying the role and status of these approaches using a minimal single-level quantum dot model in a two-terminal setup under voltage and temperature biases. We derive analytical expressions for particle and energy currents and their fluctuations in both steady-state and transient regimes. Exact results from the Heisenberg equation are shown to align with scattering matrix and master equation approaches within their respective validity regimes. Crucially, we establish a protocol for the weak-coupling limit, bridging the applicability of master equations at weak-coupling with Heisenberg or scattering matrix approaches at arbitrary coupling strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a two-dimensional (2D) quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We use the neighborhood tensor update to simulate the BB evolution with an infinite pair-entangled projected state (iPEPS). The alternating sequence is optimized with the final energy as a cost function. The energy is calculated with the tangent space methods for the sake of their stability.
  The method is benchmarked in the 2D transverse field quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point against a ground state obtained by variational optimization of the iPEPS. The optimal BB sequence differs non-perturbatively from a sequence simulating quantum annealing or adiabatic preparation (AP) of the ground state. The optimal BB energy converges with the number of bangs much faster than the optimal AP energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits have been extensively used as the basis for machine learning models in regression, classification, and generative tasks. For supervised learning, their expressivity has been thoroughly investigated and several universality properties have been proven. However, in the case of quantum generative modelling, much less is known, especially when the task is to model distributions over continuous variables. In this work, we elucidate expectation value sampling-based models. Such models output the expectation values of a set of fixed observables from a quantum circuit into which classical random data has been uploaded. We prove the universality of such variational quantum algorithms for the generation of multivariate distributions. We explore various architectures which allow universality and prove tight bounds connecting the minimal required qubit number, and the minimal required number of measurements needed. Our results may help guide the design of future quantum circuits in generative modelling tasks.</description>

      <title>Boundary Treatment for Variational Quantum Simulations of Partial Differential Equations on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents a variational quantum algorithm to solve initial-boundary value problems described by second-order partial differential equations. The approach uses hybrid classical/quantum hardware that is well suited for quantum computers of the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. The partial differential equation is initially translated into an optimal control problem with a modular control-to-state operator (ansatz). The objective function and its derivatives required by the optimizer can efficiently be evaluated on a quantum computer by measuring an ancilla qubit, while the optimization procedure employs classical hardware. The focal aspect of the study is the treatment of boundary conditions, which is tailored to the properties of the quantum hardware using a correction technique. For this purpose, the boundary conditions and the discretized terms of the partial differential equation are decomposed into a sequence of unitary operations and subsequently compiled into quantum gates. The accuracy and gate complexity of the approach are assessed for second-order partial differential equations by classically emulating the quantum hardware. The examples include steady and unsteady diffusive transport equations for a scalar property in combination with various Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin conditions. The results of this flexible approach display a robust behavior and a strong predictive accuracy in combination with a remarkable polylog complexity scaling in the number of qubits of the involved quantum circuits. Remaining challenges refer to adaptive ansatz strategies that speed up the optimization procedure.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD) offers higher information capacity and stronger resilience to noise compared to its binary counterpart. However, these advantages are often hindered by the difficulty of realizing the required high-dimensional measurements and transformations. Here, we implement a large-scale multi-plane light converter (MPLC) and program it as a high-dimensional mode sorter of spatial modes for QKD. Using the MPLC, we demonstrate five-dimensional QKD with six mutually unbiased bases and 25-dimensional QKD with two mutually unbiased bases in the same experimental setup. Furthermore, we propose a construction of pairs of mutually unbiased bases that are robust to experimental errors, with measurement complexity scaling only with the square root of the encoded dimension.

      <title>Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist quantum geometric tensor of finite-temperature mixed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) reveals local geometric properties and associated topological information of quantum states. Here a generalization of the QGT to mixed quantum states at finite temperatures based on the Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist distance is developed. The resulting Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist QGT is invariant under gauge transformations of individual spectrum levels of the density matrix. A Pythagorean-like relation connects the distances and gauge transformations, which clarifies the role of the parallel-transport condition. The real part of the QGT naturally decomposes into a sum of the Fisher-Rao metric and Fubini-Study metric, allowing a distinction between different contributions to the quantum distance. The imaginary part of the QGT is proportional to a weighted summation of the Berry curvatures, which leads to a geometric phase for mixed states under certain conditions. We present three examples of different dimensions to illustrate the temperature dependence of the QGT and a discussion on possible implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauging introduces gauge fields in order to localize an existing global symmetry, resulting in a dual global symmetry on the gauge fields that can be gauged again. By iterating the gauging process on spin chains with Abelian group symmetries and arranging the gauge fields in a 2D lattice, the local symmetries become the stabilizer of the $XZZX$-code for any Abelian group. By twisting the gauging map we obtain new codes that explicitly confine anyons, which violate an odd number of plaquette terms and whose fusion results in mobile dipole excitations. Our construction naturally realizes any gapped boundary by taking different quantum phases of the initial (1+1)D globally symmetric system. Our method establishes a new route to obtain higher dimensional topological codes from lower ones, to identify their gapped boundaries and their tensor network representations.</description>

Abstract: Using quantum information geometry, I derive quantum generalizations of the Onsager rate equations, which model the dynamics of an open system near a steady state. The generalized equations hold for a flexible definition of the forces as well as a large class of statistical divergence measures and quantum-Fisher-information metrics beyond the conventional definition of entropy production. I also derive quantum Onsager-Casimir relations for the transport tensors by proposing a general concept of time reversal and detailed balance for open quantum systems. The results establish a remarkable connection between statistical mechanics and parameter estimation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum trajectory techniques have been used in the theory of open systems as a starting point for numerical computations and to describe the monitoring of a quantum system in continuous time. Here we extend this technique and use it to develop a general approach to the dynamics of quantum/classical hybrid systems. By using two coupled stochastic differential equations, we can describe a classical component and a quantum one which have their own intrinsic dynamics and which interact with each other. A mathematically rigorous construction is given, under the restriction of having a Markovian joint dynamics and of involving only bounded operators on the Hilbert space of the quantum component. An important feature is that, if the interaction allows for a flow of information from the quantum component to the classical one, necessarily the dynamics is dissipative. We show also how this theory is connected to a suitable hybrid dynamical semigroup, which reduces to a quantum dynamical semigroup in the purely quantum case and includes Liouville and Kolmogorov-Fokker-Plank equations in the purely classical case. Moreover, this semigroup allows to compare the proposed stochastic dynamics with various other proposals based on hybrid master equations. Some simple examples are constructed in order to show the variety of physical behaviours which can be described; in particular, a model presenting hidden entanglement is introduced.</description>

Abstract: Multi-view Feature Extraction (MvFE) has wide applications in machine learning, image processing and other fields. When dealing with massive high-dimensional data, the performance of classical computer faces severe challenges due to MvFE involves expensive matrix calculation. To address this challenge, a quantum-accelerated cross-regression algorithm for MvFE is proposed. The main contributions are as follows:(1) a quantum version algorithm for MvFE is proposed for the first time, filling the gap of quantum computing in the field of MvFE;(2) a quantum algorithm is designed to construct the block-encoding of the target data matrix, so that the optimal Hamiltonian simulation technology based on the block-encoding framework can be used to efficiently realize the quantum simulation of the target data matrix. This approach reduces the dependence of the algorithm's on simulation errors to enhance algorithm performance;(3) compared with the classical counterpart algorithm, the proposed quantum algorithm has a polynomial acceleration in the number of data points, the dimension of data points and the number of view data.</description>

      <title>Stability of mixed-state quantum phases via finite Markov length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For quantum phases of Hamiltonian ground states, the energy gap plays a central role in ensuring the stability of the phase as long as the gap remains finite. We propose Markov length, the length scale at which the quantum conditional mutual information (CMI) decays exponentially, as an equally essential quantity characterizing mixed-state phases and transitions. For a state evolving under a local Lindbladian, we argue that if its Markov length remains finite along the evolution, then it remains in the same phase, meaning there exists another quasi-local Lindbladian evolution that can reverse the former one. We apply this diagnostic to toric code subject to decoherence and show that the Markov length is finite everywhere except at its decodability transition, at which it diverges. CMI in this case can be mapped to the free energy cost of point defects in the random bond Ising model. This implies that the mixed state phase transition coincides with the decodability transition and also suggests a quasi-local decoding channel.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>

Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>

Abstract: We construct the vector field associated with the GKLS generator for systems described by Gaussian states. This vector field is defined on the dual space of the algebra of operators, restricted to operators quadratic in position and momentum. It is shown that the GKLS dynamics accepts a decomposition principle, that is, this vector field can be decomposed in three parts, a conservative Hamiltonian component, a gradient-like and a Choi-Krauss vector field. The last two terms are considered a "perturbation" associated with dissipation. Examples are presented for a harmonic oscillator with different dissipation terms.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian way for the relaxation time approximation, application to Kibble-Zurek processes due to environment temperature quench, and to Lindbladian perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, a global Lindbladian ansatz is constructed which leads to thermalization at temperature $T$ to the Gibs state of the investigated system. This ansatz connects every two eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and leads to a simple master equation known in the literature as the relaxation time approximation (RTA). The main message of this paper is that RTA, being a Lindbladian approach itself, can be used as Lindbladian securing thermalization when modeling physical processes, and can be consequently combined with other types of Lindbladians which would drive the system of the equilibrium state. I demonstrate it with two applications. The first application is the slow cooling (or heating) of quantum systems by varying the environment temperature to a critical point. With this RTA-Lindblad ansatz, one can directly relate to the equilibrium behavior of the system, and if an order parameter has the exponent $\Psi$, the remaining value at the phase transition will decrease with $1/\tau^{\Psi}$, where $\tau$ is the overall time of the slow process. In the second application, I investigate the change in the expectation value of a conserved quantity (an operator commuting with the Hamiltonian) due to an extra Lindbladian term which would drive the system out from equilibrium, while the thermalizing RTA-Lindbladian term is also present. I give a closed perturbative expression in the first order for the expectation value in the new steady state using only expectation values calculated in the original thermal equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: We study the response of critical Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) spin liquids to doping with longer-range singlets, and more generally of U(1)-symmetric tensor networks to non-symmetric perturbations. Using a field theory description, we find that in the RVB, doping constitutes a relevant perturbation which immediately opens up a gap, contrary to previous observations. Our analysis predicts a very large correlation length even at significant doping, which we verify using high-accuracy numerical simulations. This emphasizes the need for careful analysis, but also justifies the use of such states as a variational ansatz for critical systems. Finally, we give an example of a PEPS where non-symmetric perturbations do not open up a gap and the U(1) symmetry re-emerges.</description>

      <title>Anyonic Topological Order in Twisted Equivariant Differential (TED) K-Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the classification of non-interacting crystalline topological insulator phases by equivariant K-theory has become widely accepted, its generalization to anyonic interacting phases -- hence to phases with topologically ordered ground states supporting topological braid quantum gates -- has remained wide open. On the contrary, the success of K-theory with classifying non-interacting phases seems to have tacitly been perceived as precluding a K-theoretic classification of interacting topological order; and instead a mix of other proposals has been explored. However, only K-theory connects closely to the actual physics of valence electrons; and self-consistency demands that any other proposal must connect to K-theory.
  Here we provide a detailed argument for the classification of symmetry protected/enhanced su(2)-anyonic topological order, specifically in interacting 2d semi-metals, by the twisted equivariant differential (TED) K-theory of configuration spaces of points in the complement of nodal points inside the crystal's Brillouin torus orbi-orientifold.
  We argue, in particular, that: (1) topological 2d semi-metal phases modulo global mass terms are classified by the flat differential twisted equivariant K-theory of the complement of the nodal points; (2) n-electron interacting phases are classified by the K-theory of configuration spaces of n points in the Brillouin torus; (3) the somewhat neglected twisting of equivariant K-theory by "inner local systems" reflects the effective "fictitious" gauge interaction of Chen, Wilczeck, Witten &amp; Halperin (1989), which turns fermions into anyonic quanta; (4) the induced su(2)-anyonic topological order is reflected in the twisted Chern classes of the interacting valence bundle over configuration space, constituting the hypergeometric integral construction of monodromy braid representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conserved-charge densities are very special observables in quantum many-body systems as, by construction, they encode information about the dynamics. Therefore, their evolution is expected to be of much simpler interpretation than that of generic observables and to return universal information on the state of the system at any given time. Here we study the dynamics of the fluctuations of conserved U(1) charges in systems that are prepared in charge-asymmetric initial states. We characterise the charge fluctuations in a given subsystem using the full-counting statistics of the truncated charge and the quantum entanglement between the subsystem and the rest resolved to the symmetry sectors of the charge. We show that, even though the initial states considered are homogeneous in space, the charge fluctuations generate an effective inhomogeneity due to the charge-asymmetric nature of the initial states. We use this observation to map the problem into that of charge fluctuations on inhomogeneous, charge-symmetric states and treat it using a recently developed space-time duality approach. Specialising the treatment to interacting integrable systems we combine the space-time duality approach with generalised hydrodynamics to find explicit predictions.</description>

      <title>Kinked linear response from non-Hermitian cold-atom pumping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that non-Hermitian, non-reciprocal systems may harbor exponentially localized skin modes. However, in this work, we find that, generically, non-Hermiticity gives rise to abrupt and prominent kinks in the semi-classical wave packet trajectories of quantum gases, despite the absence of sudden physical impulses. This physically stems from a hitherto underappreciated intrinsic non-locality from non-Hermitian pumping, even if all physical couplings are local, thereby resulting in enigmatic singularities in the band structure that lead to discontinuous band geometry and Berry curvature. Specifically, we focus on the realization of the kinked response in an ultracold atomic setup. For a concrete experimental demonstration, we propose an ultracold atomic setup in a two-dimensional optical lattice with laser-induced loss such that response kinks can be observed without fine-tuning in the physical atomic cloud dynamics. Our results showcase unique non-monotonic behavior from non-Hermitian pumping beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect and suggest new avenues for investigating non-Hermitian dynamics on ultracold atomic platforms.</description>

Abstract: The amplification of radiation by superradiance is a universal phenomenon observed in numerous physical systems. We demonstrate that superradiant scattering generates entanglement for different input states, including coherent states, thereby establishing the inherently quantum nature of this phenomenon. To put these concepts to the test, we propose a novel approach to create horizonless ergoregions, which are nonetheless dynamically stable thanks to the dissipative dynamics of a polaritonic fluid of light. We numerically simulate the system to demonstrate the creation of a stable ergoregion. Subsequently, we investigate rotational superradiance within this system, with a primary focus on entanglement generation and the possibilities for its enhancement using current techniques. Our methods permit the investigation of quantum emission by rotational superradiance in state-of-the-art experiments, in which the input state can be controlled at will.</description>

Abstract: Defining finite entanglement entropy for a subregion in quantum field theory requires the introduction of two logically independent scales: an IR scale that controls the size of the subregion, and a UV cut-off. In AdS/CFT, the IR scale is the AdS lengthscale, the UV cut-off is the bulk radial cut-off, and the subregion is specified by dimensionless angles. This is the data that determines Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces and their areas in AdS/CFT. We argue that in asymptotically flat space there exists the notion of a ``spi-subregion" that one can associate to spatial infinity (spi). Even though geometrically quite different from an AdS subregion, this angle data has the crucial feature that it allows an interpretation as a bi-partitioning of spi. Therefore, the area of the RT surface associated to the spi-subregion can be interpreted as the entanglement entropy of the reduced density matrix of the bulk state under this bi-partition, as in AdS/CFT. For symmetric spi-subregions, these RT surfaces are the waists of Asymptotic Causal Diamonds. In empty flat space they reduce to Rindler horizons, and are analogues of the AdS-Rindler horizons of Casini, Huerta \&amp; Myers. We connect these results to previous work on minimal surfaces anchored to screens in empty space, but also generalize the discussion to the case where there are black holes in the bulk. The phases of black hole RT surfaces as the spi-subregion is varied, naturally connect with those of black holes (small and large) in AdS. A key observation is that the radial cut-off is associated to an IR scale in flat space -- and in fact there are no UV divergences. We argue that this is consistent with previous suggestions that in sub-AdS scales the holographic duality is an IR/IR correspondence and that the degrees of freedom are {\em not} those of a local QFT, but those of long strings. Strings are of course, famously UV finite.</description>

      <title>Once-in-a-lifetime encounter models for neutrino media: From coherent oscillations to flavor equilibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino oscillations are typically studied using the lowest-order quantum kinetic equation, also known as the mean-field approximation. However, some recent quantum many-body simulations suggest that quantum entanglement among neutrinos may be important and may result in flavor equilibration of the neutrino gas. In this work, we develop new quantum models for neutrino gases in which any pair of neutrinos can interact at most once in their lifetimes. A key parameter of our models is $\gamma=\mu \Delta z$, where $\mu$ is the neutrino coupling strength, which is proportional to the neutrino density, and $\Delta z$ is the duration over which a pair of neutrinos can interact each time. Our models reduce to the mean-field approach in the limit $\gamma\to0$ and achieve flavor equilibration in time $t \gg (\gamma\mu)^{-1}$. These models demonstrate the emergence of coherent flavor oscillations from the particle perspective and may help elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in collective neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Exclusive-or encoded algebraic structure for efficient quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formalism that captures the algebraic structure of many-body two-level quantum systems, and directly motivates an efficient numerical method. This formalism is based on the binary representation of the enumeration-indices of the elements of the corresponding Lie algebra. The action of arbitrarily large elements of that algebra reduces to a few bit-wise exclusive-or operations. This formalism naturally produces sparse representations of many-body density operators, the size of which we control through a dynamic truncation method. We demonstrate how this formalism applies to real-time evolution, dissipative Lindblad action, imaginary-time evolution, and projective measurement processes. We find that this approach to calculating quantum dynamics scales close to linearly with the number of non-zero components in the density operator. We refer to this exclusive-or represented quantum algebra as ORQA. As a proof of concept, we provide a numerical demonstration of this formalism by simulating quantum annealing processes for the maximum independent set problem for up to 22 two-level systems.</description>

      <title>Two-level adiabatic transition probability for small avoided crossings generated by tangential intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the asymptotic behaviors of the transition probability for two-level avoided crossings are studied under the limit where two parameters (adiabatic parameter and energy gap parameter) tend to zero. This is a continuation of our previous works where avoided crossings are generated by tangential intersections and obey a non-adiabatic regime. The main results elucidate not only the asymptotic expansion of transition probability but also a quantum interference caused by several avoided crossings and a coexistence of two-parameter regimes arising from different vanishing orders.</description>

      <title>Spin Symmetry in Thermally-Assisted-Occupation Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For electronic systems with multi-reference (MR) character, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with the conventional exchange-correlation (xc) energy functionals can lead to incorrect spin densities and related properties. For example, for H2 dissociation, the spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted solutions obtained with the same xc energy functional in KS-DFT can be distinctly different, yielding the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking effects in the spin-unrestricted solutions. Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) has been shown to resolve the aforementioned spin-symmetry breaking, when the fictitious temperature is properly chosen. In this work, a response theory based on TAO-DFT is developed to demonstrate that TAO-DFT with a sufficiently large fictitious temperature can always resolve the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking in MR systems. To further support this, TAO-DFT calculations with various fictitious temperatures are performed for the dissociation of H2, N2, He2, and Ne2 as well as the twisted ethylene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that turning on the interaction of relativistic spinless particles with the vacuum of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) leads to the replacement of the Klein-Gordon equation with the Klein-Gordon oscillator equation. In this case, coordinate time becomes an operator and free relativistic particles go into a virtual state. We discuss geometry associated with classical and quantum Klein-Gordon oscillators, and its relation to the geometry underlying the description of free particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the fundamental principles of light-matter interaction are well-understood and drive countless technologies, the world of multiphoton processes remains a fascinating puzzle, holding the potential to drastically alter our understanding of how light interacts with matter at its most basic level. This rich interplay of light and matter unveils novel phenomena that can be harnessed for sensing with exceptional precision, as exemplified by multiphoton quantum sensing. This thesis delves into the applications of multiphoton quantum protocols, particularly in imaging, communication, and plasmonic sensing, to surpass classical limitations and achieve enhanced sensitivity. We explore the potential of multiphoton quantum processes, particularly in the nanoscale regime and within subsystems of macroscopic systems, where novel and ultra-sensitive sensing methodologies emerge. Subsequent chapters of this thesis demonstrate the transformative potential of multiphoton quantum sensing, elucidating the design, implementation, and experimental results of specific sensing protocols tailored to diverse applications. Our analysis combines experimental observations and theoretical predictions to assess the sensitivity and performance of these protocols. Additionally, the thesis discusses potential future directions and advancements in the field, envisioning applications in biomolecule detection, environmental monitoring, and fundamental studies of light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. Concluding reflections highlight the implications of multiphoton quantum sensing across scientific disciplines and lay the groundwork for future research endeavors.</description>
