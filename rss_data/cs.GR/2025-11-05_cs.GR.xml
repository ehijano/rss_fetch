      <title>LGCC: Enhancing Flow Matching Based Text-Guided Image Editing with Local Gaussian Coupling and Context Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have demonstrated the great potential of flow matching-based Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image editing. However, state-of-the-art works like BAGEL face limitations, including detail degradation, content inconsistency, and inefficiency due to their reliance on random noise initialization. To address these issues, we propose LGCC, a novel framework with two key components: Local Gaussian Noise Coupling (LGNC) and Content Consistency Loss (CCL). LGNC preserves spatial details by modeling target image embeddings and their locally perturbed counterparts as coupled pairs, while CCL ensures semantic alignment between edit instructions and image modifications, preventing unintended content removal. By integrating LGCC with the BAGEL pre-trained model via curriculum learning, we significantly reduce inference steps, improving local detail scores on I2EBench by 1.60% and overall scores by 0.53%. LGCC achieves 3x -- 5x speedup for lightweight editing and 2x for universal editing, requiring only 40% -- 50% of the inference time of BAGEL or Flux. These results demonstrate LGCC's ability to preserve detail, maintain contextual integrity, and enhance inference speed, offering a cost-efficient solution without compromising editing quality.</description>

      <title>OLATverse: A Large-scale Real-world Object Dataset with Precise Lighting Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of 765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking, which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations. Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects, spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35 DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data. The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.</description>

      <title>TAUE: Training-free Noise Transplant and Cultivation Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique, Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent representations from both foreground and composite generation processes, transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative workflows.</description>

      <title>GS-Verse: Mesh-based Gaussian Splatting for Physics-aware Interaction in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce GS-Verse (Gaussian Splatting for Virtual Environment Rendering and Scene Editing), a novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, GS-Verse facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow. Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Near Real-time Adaptive Isotropic and Anisotropic Image-to-mesh Conversion for Numerical Simulations Involving Cerebral Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Presented are two techniques that are designed to help streamline the discretization of complex vascular geometries within the numerical modeling process. The first method integrates multiple software tools into a single pipeline which can generate adaptive anisotropic meshes from segmented medical images. The pipeline is shown to satisfy quality, fidelity, smoothness, and robustness requirements while providing near real-time performance for medical image-to-mesh conversion. The second method approximates a user-defined sizing function to generate adaptive isotropic meshes of good quality and fidelity in real-time. Tested with two brain aneurysm cases and utilizing up to 96 CPU cores within a single, multicore node on Purdue University's Anvil supercomputer, the parallel adaptive anisotropic meshing method utilizes a hierarchical load balancing model (designed for large, cc-NUMA shared memory architectures) and contains an optimized local reconnection operation that performs three times faster than its original implementation from previous studies. The adaptive isotropic method is shown to generate a mesh of up to approximately 50 million elements in less than a minute while the adaptive anisotropic method is shown to generate approximately the same number of elements in about 5 minutes.</description>

      <title>Adv-BMT: Bidirectional Motion Transformer for Safety-Critical Traffic Scenario Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial traffic interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstructs the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20%. Demo and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/adv-bmt/.</description>

      <title>FreeArt3D: Training-Free Articulated Object Generation using 3D Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR, and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in both quality and versatility.
