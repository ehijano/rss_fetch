      <title>List Decoding and New Bicycle Code Constructions for Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new decoder, called the Multiple-Bases Belief-Propagation List Decoder (MBBP-LD), for Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes. It extends the Multiple-Bases Belief-Propagation (MBBP) framework, originally developed for classical cyclic LDPC codes. The proposed method preserves the linear-time complexity of standard BP decoder while improving the logical error rate. To further reduce the logical error rate, a new decision rule is introduced for the post-processing list decoder, outperforming the conventional least-metric selector (LMS) criterion. For the recently developed and implemented bivariate bicycle (BB) code with parameters \([[144,12,12]]\), our proposed MBBP-LD decoder achieves up to 40\% lower logical error rate compared to the state-of-the-art decoder for short QLDPC codes, i.e., BP with ordered-statistics decoding (BP-OSD), while retaining the linear-time complexity of the plain BP decoder. In addition, we explore a new subclass of BB codes, that we refer to as the univariate bicycle (UB) codes, specifically with lower-weight parity checks (\(w=6,8\)). This reduces the polynomial search space for the code compared to general BB codes, i.e., by reducing the search space over two polynomial components in BB codes to just a single polynomial component in UB codes. Simulations demonstrate the promising performance of these codes under various types of BP decoders.</description>

      <title>A Tsallis-Entropy Lens on Genetic Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an information-theoretic generalization of the fixation statistic, the Tsallis-order $q$ F-statistic, $F_q$, which measures the fraction of Tsallis $q$-entropy lost within subpopulations relative to the pooled population. The family nests the classical variance-based fixation index $F_{\textbf{ST}}$ at $q{=}2$ and a Shannon-entropy analogue at $q{=}1$, whose absolute form equals the mutual information between alleles and population labels. By varying $q$, $F_q$ acts as a spectral differentiator that up-weights rare variants at low $q$, while $q{&gt;}1$ increasingly emphasizes common variants, providing a more fine-grained view of differentiation than $F_{\textbf{ST}}$ when allele-frequency spectra are skewed. On real data (865 Oceanian genomes with 1,823,000 sites) and controlled genealogical simulations (seeded from 1,432 founders from HGDP and 1000 Genomes panels, with 322,216 sites), we show that $F_q$ in One-vs-Rest (OVR) and Leave-One-Out (LOO) modes provides clear attribution of which subpopulations drive regional structure, and sensitively timestamps isolation-migration events and founder effects. $F_q$ serves as finer-resolution complement for simulation audits and population-structure summaries.</description>

      <title>DRL-Based Robust Multi-Timescale Anti-Jamming Approaches under State Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the openness of wireless channels, wireless communication systems are highly susceptible to malicious jamming. Most existing anti-jamming methods rely on the assumption of accurate sensing and optimize parameters on a single timescale. However, such methods overlook two practical issues: mismatched execution latencies across heterogeneous actions and measurement errors caused by sensor imperfections. Especially for deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods, the inherent sensitivity of neural networks implies that even minor perturbations in the input can mislead the agent into choosing suboptimal actions, with potentially severe consequences. To ensure reliable wireless transmission, we establish a multi-timescale decision model that incorporates state uncertainty. Subsequently, we propose two robust schemes that sustain performance under bounded sensing errors. First, a Projected Gradient Descent-assisted Double Deep Q-Network (PGD-DDQN) algorithm is designed, which derives worst-case perturbations under a norm-bounded error model and applies PGD during training for robust optimization. Second, a Nonlinear Q-Compression DDQN (NQC-DDQN) algorithm introduces a nonlinear compression mechanism that adaptively contracts Q-value ranges to eliminate action aliasing. Simulation results indicate that, compared with the perfect-sensing baseline, the proposed algorithms show only minor degradation in anti-jamming performance while maintaining robustness under various perturbations, thereby validating their practicality in imperfect sensing conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct several infinite families of $q$-ary constacyclic codes over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with length $n$, dimension around $n/2$, and minimum distance at least $cn/\log_q n$ for some positive constant $c$. They contain many constacyclic codes with optimal, or almost-optimal, or best-known parameters. We also consider various forms of the length $n$.</description>

      <title>The (+)-(L, P)-TGRS code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of the non-Reed-Solomon (in short, non-RS) type linear code has been one of the research hotspots in recent years. In 2025, Hu et al. constructed some non-RS MDS codes by defining the (L, P)-twisted generalized Reed-Solomon code (in short, (L, P)-TGRS). In this paper, we focus on the (+)-(L, P)-TGRS code C. We firstly present a parity-check matrix. Secondly, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for C to be NMDS which partially answers two open problems proposed by Hu et al. in 2025, and prove that C is non-RS for 2k &gt; n which partially improves the corresponding result given by Hu et al. in 2025,. Thirdly, we give a sufficient condition for C not to be self-dual or self-orthogonal, respectively, furthermore, we construct two classes of self-orthogonal codes which is a promotion of the corresponding result given by Ding et al. in 2025. Finally, some examples are given.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Scaling Laws of Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer a promising paradigm for enhancing wireless communication by exploiting spatial diversity, yet a rigorous analytical framework for their error probability has been notably absent. To this end, this paper addresses this critical gap by unveiling the \textbf{fundamental scaling laws} that govern the symbol error rate (SER) of FAS in realistic, spatially correlated channels. To establish these laws, we derive a tight, closed-form asymptotic expression for the SER applicable to a general class of modulation schemes. This result is pivotal as it establishes the fundamental scaling law governing the relationship between SER and the channel's spatial correlation structure. Based on this framework, we provide a complete characterization of the diversity and coding gains. The analysis culminates in a definitive design directive: SER can be fundamentally improved by expanding the antenna's movement space to increase diversity, while merely increasing port density within a constrained space yields diminishing returns.</description>

      <title>Neural Beamforming with Doppler-Aware Sparse Attention for High Mobility Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamforming has significance for enhancing spectral efficiency and mitigating interference in multi-antenna wireless systems, facilitating spatial multiplexing and diversity in dense and high mobility scenarios. Traditional beamforming techniques such as zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming experience performance deterioration under adverse channel conditions. Deep learning-based beamforming offers an alternative with nonlinear mappings from channel state information (CSI) to beamforming weights by improving robustness against dynamic channel environments. Transformer-based models are particularly effective due to their ability to model long-range dependencies across time and frequency. However, their quadratic attention complexity limits scalability in large OFDM grids. Recent studies address this issue through sparse attention mechanisms that reduce complexity while maintaining expressiveness, yet often employ patterns that disregard channel dynamics, as they are not specifically designed for wireless communication scenarios. In this work, we propose a Doppler-aware Sparse Neural Network Beamforming (Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF) model that incorporates a channel-adaptive sparse attention mechanism in a multi-user single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) setting. The proposed sparsity structure is configurable along 2D time-frequency axes based on channel dynamics and is theoretically proven to ensure full connectivity within p hops, where p is the number of attention heads. Simulation results under urban macro (UMa) channel conditions show that Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF significantly outperforms both a fixed-pattern baseline, referred to as Standard Sparse NNBF, and conventional beamforming techniques ZFBF and MMSE beamforming in high mobility scenarios, while maintaining structured sparsity with a controlled number of attended keys per query.</description>

      <title>Unifying Information-Theoretic and Pair-Counting Clustering Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing clusterings is central to evaluating unsupervised models, yet the many existing similarity measures can produce widely divergent, sometimes contradictory, evaluations. Clustering similarity measures are typically organized into two principal families, pair-counting and information-theoretic, reflecting whether they quantify agreement through element pairs or aggregate information across full cluster contingency tables. Prior work has uncovered parallels between these families and applied empirical normalization or chance-correction schemes, but their deeper analytical connection remains only partially understood. Here, we develop an analytical framework that unifies these families through two complementary perspectives. First, both families are expressed as weighted expansions of observed versus expected co-occurrences, with pair-counting arising as a quadratic, low-order approximation and information-theoretic measures as higher-order, frequency-weighted extensions. Second, we generalize pair-counting to $k$-tuple agreement and show that information-theoretic measures can be viewed as systematically accumulating higher-order co-assignment structure beyond the pairwise level. We illustrate the approaches analytically for the Rand index and Mutual Information, and show how other indices in each family emerge as natural extensions. Together, these views clarify when and why the two regimes diverge, relating their sensitivities directly to weighting and approximation order, and provide a principled basis for selecting, interpreting, and extending clustering similarity measures across applications.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Classification Model for Cyber Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uprising of deep learning methodology and practice in recent years has brought about a severe consequence of increasing carbon footprint due to the insatiable demand for computational resources and power. The field of text analytics also experienced a massive transformation in this trend of monopolizing methodology. In this paper, the original TF-IDF algorithm has been modified, and Clement Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (CTF-IDF) has been proposed for data preprocessing. This paper primarily discusses the effectiveness of classical machine learning techniques in text analytics with CTF-IDF and a faster IRLBA algorithm for dimensionality reduction. The introduction of both of these techniques in the conventional text analytics pipeline ensures a more efficient, faster, and less computationally intensive application when compared with deep learning methodology regarding carbon footprint, with minor compromise in accuracy. The experimental results also exhibit a manifold of reduction in time complexity and improvement of model accuracy for the classical machine learning methods discussed further in this paper.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Entropy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy Minimization (EM) is beneficial to reducing class overlap, bridging domain gap, and restricting uncertainty for various tasks in machine learning, yet its potential is limited. To study the internal mechanism of EM, we reformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects: cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and prompts a peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC) penalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupled formulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certainty samples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignment between output distribution and label distribution. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM), which normalizes the reward brought from CADF and employs a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) to replace GMC. AdaDEM outperforms DEM*, an upper-bound variant of classical EM, and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Two thousand years of the oracle problem. Insights from Ancient Delphi on the future of blockchain oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oracle problem refers to the inability of an agent to know if the information coming from an oracle is authentic and unbiased. In ancient times, philosophers and historians debated on how to evaluate, increase, and secure the reliability of oracle predictions, particularly those from Delphi, which pertained to matters of state. Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic machines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles and the real world still represents a challenge. Despite numerous efforts, this problem remains mostly unsolved, and the recent advent of blockchain oracles has added a layer of complexity because of the decentralization of blockchains. This paper conceptually connects Delphic and modern blockchain oracles, developing a comparative framework. Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy, lexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the relationship between oracle answer quality and question type. The presented framework aims first at revealing commonalities between classical and computational oracles and then at enriching the oracle analysis within each field. This study contributes to the computer science literature by proposing strategies to improve the reliability of blockchain oracles based on insights from Delphi and to classical literature by introducing a framework that can also be applied to interpret and classify other ancient oracular mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive an expression for the expected number of runs in a trace of a binary sequence $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ obtained by passing $x$ through a deletion channel that independently deletes each bit with probability $q$. We use this expression to show that if $x$ is a codeword of a first-order Reed-Muller code, and the deletion probability $q$ is 1/2, then $x$ can be reconstructed, with high probability, from $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ many of its traces.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Copula-Based Outage Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Systems: Channel Coefficient- or Envelope-Level Correlation Matrix?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian copula has been employed to evaluate the outage performance of Fluid Antenna Systems (FAS), with the covariance matrix reflecting the dependence among multivariate normal random variables (RVs). While prior studies approximate this matrix using the channel coefficient correlation matrix from Jake's model, this work instead employs the channel envelope correlation matrix, motivated by the fact that the multivariate normal RVs are generated by transforming correlated channel envelopes. This raises an open question of whether using the coefficient- or envelope-level correlation matrix yields better accuracy in accessing FAS performance. Toward this end, this paper explores the benefits of using the envelope-level correlation matrix under fully correlated Nakagami-m fading, and develops a method for generating such fading channels for Monte Carlo simulations, which serve as a benchmark for validating the theoretical results. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed channel modeling approach and demonstrate the superior accuracy of using the envelope-level correlation matrix, particularly in sparse port deployment and low-outage regime.</description>

      <title>On the Computability of Finding Capacity-Achieving Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the problem of constructing capacity-achieving codes from an algorithmic perspective. Specifically, we prove that there exists a Turing machine which, given a discrete memoryless channel $p_{Y|X}$, a target rate $R$ less than the channel capacity $C(p_{Y|X})$, and an error tolerance $\epsilon &gt; 0$, outputs a block code $\mathcal{C}$ achieving a rate at least $R$ and a maximum block error probability below $\epsilon$. The machine operates in the general case where all transition probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$ are computable real numbers, and the parameters $R$ and $\epsilon$ are rational. The proof builds on Shannon's channel coding theorem and relies on an exhaustive search approach that systematically enumerates all codes of increasing block length until a valid code is found. This construction is formalized using the theory of recursive functions, yielding a $\mu$-recursive function $\mathrm{FindCode} : \mathbb{N}^3 \rightharpoonup \mathbb{N}$ that takes as input appropriate encodings of $p_{Y|X}$, $R$, and $\epsilon$, and, whenever $R &lt; C(p_{Y|X})$, outputs an encoding of a valid code. By Kleene's normal form theorem, which establishes the computational equivalence between Turing machines and $\mu$-recursive functions, we conclude that the problem is solvable by a Turing machine. This result can also be extended to the case where $\epsilon$ is a computable real number, while we further discuss an analogous generalization of our analysis when $R$ is computable as well. We note that the assumptions that the probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$, as well as $\epsilon$ and $R$, are computable real numbers cannot be further weakened, since computable reals constitute the largest subset of $\mathbb{R}$ representable by algorithmic means.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Private Quantum Channels and Private Quantum Hypothesis Testing</title>

Abstract: A quantum generalized divergence by definition satisfies the data-processing inequality; as such, the relative decrease in such a divergence under the action of a quantum channel is at most one. This relative decrease is formally known as the contraction coefficient of the channel and the divergence. Interestingly, there exist combinations of channels and divergences for which the contraction coefficient is strictly less than one. Furthermore, understanding the contraction coefficient is fundamental for the study of statistical tasks under privacy constraints. To this end, here we establish upper bounds on contraction coefficients for the hockey-stick divergence under privacy constraints, where privacy is quantified with respect to the quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) framework, and we fully characterize the contraction coefficient for the trace distance under privacy constraints. With the machinery developed, we also determine an upper bound on the contraction of both the Bures distance and quantum relative entropy relative to the normalized trace distance, under QLDP constraints. Next, we apply our findings to establish bounds on the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing under privacy constraints. Furthermore, we study various scenarios in which the sample complexity bounds are tight, while providing order-optimal quantum channels that achieve those bounds. Lastly, we show how private quantum channels provide fairness and Holevo information stability in quantum learning settings.</description>

      <title>Aerial Active STAR-RIS-assisted Satellite-Terrestrial Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16146</link>

Abstract: An integration of satellites and terrestrial networks is crucial for enhancing performance of next generation communication systems. However, the networks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in dense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial covert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to improve the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness. Specifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP) under the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information (CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert communication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair channel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert constraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the AASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional state-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic environments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG) algorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized as the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration process by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of denoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to accomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better state-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Intrinsic Dimension of Earth Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation, geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact, learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability, regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training. Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts, facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.</description>
