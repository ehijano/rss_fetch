      <title>GeoConformal prediction: a model-agnostic framework of measuring the uncertainty of spatial prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial prediction is a fundamental task in geography. In recent years, with advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), numerous models have been developed to improve the accuracy of geographic variable predictions. Beyond achieving higher accuracy, it is equally important to obtain predictions with uncertainty measures to enhance model credibility and support responsible spatial prediction. Although geostatistic methods like Kriging offer some level of uncertainty assessment, such as Kriging variance, these measurements are not always accurate and lack general applicability to other spatial models. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty assessment method called GeoConformal Prediction, which incorporates geographical weighting into conformal prediction. We applied it to two classic spatial prediction cases, spatial regression and spatial interpolation, to evaluate its reliability. First, in the spatial regression case, we used XGBoost to predict housing prices, followed by GeoConformal to calculate uncertainty. Our results show that GeoConformal achieved a coverage rate of 93.67%, while Bootstrap methods only reached a maximum coverage of 68.33% after 2000 runs. Next, we applied GeoConformal to spatial interpolation models. We found that the uncertainty obtained from GeoConformal aligned closely with the variance in Kriging. Finally, using GeoConformal, we analyzed the sources of uncertainty in spatial prediction. We found that explicitly including local features in AI models can significantly reduce prediction uncertainty, especially in areas with strong local dependence. Our findings suggest that GeoConformal holds potential not only for geographic knowledge discovery but also for guiding the design of future GeoAI models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable spatial prediction frameworks.</description>

      <title>On the Precise Asymptotics and Refined Regret of the Variance-Aware UCB Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the behavior of the Upper Confidence Bound-Variance (UCB-V) algorithm for Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems, a variant of the canonical Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm that incorporates variance estimates into its decision-making process. More precisely, we provide an asymptotic characterization of the arm-pulling rates of UCB-V, extending recent results for the canonical UCB in Kalvit and Zeevi (2021) and Khamaru and Zhang (2024). In an interesting contrast to the canonical UCB, we show that the behavior of UCB-V can exhibit instability, meaning that the arm-pulling rates may not always be asymptotically deterministic. Besides the asymptotic characterization, we also provide non-asymptotic bounds for arm-pulling rates in the high probability regime, offering insights into regret analysis. As an application of this high probability result, we show that UCB-V can achieve a refined regret bound, previously unknown even for more complicate and advanced variance-aware online decision-making algorithms.</description>

      <title>Belted and Ensembled Neural Network for Linear and Nonlinear Sufficient Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified, flexible, and easy-to-implement framework of sufficient dimension reduction that can accommodate both linear and nonlinear dimension reduction, and both the conditional distribution and the conditional mean as the targets of estimation. This unified framework is achieved by a specially structured neural network -- the Belted and Ensembled Neural Network (BENN) -- that consists of a narrow latent layer, which we call the belt, and a family of transformations of the response, which we call the ensemble. By strategically placing the belt at different layers of the neural network, we can achieve linear or nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction, and by choosing the appropriate transformation families, we can achieve dimension reduction for the conditional distribution or the conditional mean. Moreover, thanks to the advantage of the neural network, the method is very fast to compute, overcoming a computation bottleneck of the traditional sufficient dimension reduction estimators, which involves the inversion of a matrix of dimension either p or n. We develop the algorithm and convergence rate of our method, compare it with existing sufficient dimension reduction methods, and apply it to two data examples.</description>

      <title>$(\epsilon, \delta)$-Differentially Private Partial Least Squares Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As data-privacy requirements are becoming increasingly stringent and statistical models based on sensitive data are being deployed and used more routinely, protecting data-privacy becomes pivotal. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression is the premier tool for building such models in analytical chemistry, yet it does not inherently provide privacy guarantees, leaving sensitive (training) data vulnerable to privacy attacks. To address this gap, we propose an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private PLS (edPLS) algorithm, which integrates well-studied and theoretically motivated Gaussian noise-adding mechanisms into the PLS algorithm to ensure the privacy of the data underlying the model. Our approach involves adding carefully calibrated Gaussian noise to the outputs of four key functions in the PLS algorithm: the weights, scores, $X$-loadings, and $Y$-loadings. The noise variance is determined based on the global sensitivity of each function, ensuring that the privacy loss is controlled according to the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy framework. Specifically, we derive the sensitivity bounds for each function and use these bounds to calibrate the noise added to the model components. Experimental results demonstrate that edPLS effectively renders privacy attacks, aimed at recovering unique sources of variability in the training data, ineffective. Application of edPLS to the NIR corn benchmark dataset shows that the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) remains competitive even at strong privacy levels (i.e., $\epsilon=1$), given proper pre-processing of the corresponding spectra. These findings highlight the practical utility of edPLS in creating privacy-preserving multivariate calibrations and for the analysis of their privacy-utility trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Distribution free uncertainty quantification in neuroscience-inspired deep operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-efficient deep learning algorithms are essential for a sustainable future and feasible edge computing setups. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired from neuroscience, are a positive step in the direction of achieving the required energy efficiency. However, in a bid to lower the energy requirements, accuracy is marginally sacrificed. Hence, predictions of such deep learning algorithms require an uncertainty measure that can inform users regarding the bounds of a certain output. In this paper, we introduce the Conformalized Randomized Prior Operator (CRP-O) framework that leverages Randomized Prior (RP) networks and Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) to quantify uncertainty in both conventional and spiking neural operators. To further enable zero-shot super-resolution in UQ, we propose an extension incorporating Gaussian Process Regression. This enhanced super-resolution-enabled CRP-O framework is integrated with the recently developed Variable Spiking Wavelet Neural Operator (VSWNO). To test the performance of the obtained calibrated uncertainty bounds, we discuss four different examples covering both one-dimensional and two-dimensional partial differential equations. Results demonstrate that the uncertainty bounds produced by the conformalized RP-VSWNO significantly enhance UQ estimates compared to vanilla RP-VSWNO, Quantile WNO (Q-WNO), and Conformalized Quantile WNO (CQ-WNO). These findings underscore the potential of the proposed approach for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Wait-Less Offline Tuning and Re-solving for Online Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online linear programming (OLP) has found broad applications in revenue management and resource allocation. State-of-the-art OLP algorithms achieve low regret by repeatedly solving linear programming (LP) subproblems that incorporate updated resource information. However, LP-based methods are computationally expensive and often inefficient for large-scale applications. In contrast, recent first-order OLP algorithms are more computationally efficient but typically suffer from worse regret guarantees. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new algorithm that combines the strengths of LP-based and first-order OLP methods. The algorithm re-solves the LP subproblems periodically at a predefined frequency $f$ and uses the latest dual prices to guide online decision-making. In addition, a first-order method runs in parallel during each interval between LP re-solves, smoothing resource consumption. Our algorithm achieves $\mathscr{O}(\log (T/f) + \sqrt{f})$ regret, delivering a "wait-less" online decision-making process that balances the computational efficiency of first-order methods and the superior regret guarantee of LP-based methods.</description>

      <title>From MLP to NeoMLP: Leveraging Self-Attention for Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural fields (NeFs) have recently emerged as a state-of-the-art method for encoding spatio-temporal signals of various modalities. Despite the success of NeFs in reconstructing individual signals, their use as representations in downstream tasks, such as classification or segmentation, is hindered by the complexity of the parameter space and its underlying symmetries, in addition to the lack of powerful and scalable conditioning mechanisms. In this work, we draw inspiration from the principles of connectionism to design a new architecture based on MLPs, which we term NeoMLP. We start from an MLP, viewed as a graph, and transform it from a multi-partite graph to a complete graph of input, hidden, and output nodes, equipped with high-dimensional features. We perform message passing on this graph and employ weight-sharing via self-attention among all the nodes. NeoMLP has a built-in mechanism for conditioning through the hidden and output nodes, which function as a set of latent codes, and as such, NeoMLP can be used straightforwardly as a conditional neural field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by fitting high-resolution signals, including multi-modal audio-visual data. Furthermore, we fit datasets of neural representations, by learning instance-specific sets of latent codes using a single backbone architecture, and then use them for downstream tasks, outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>On improving generalization in a class of learning problems with the method of small parameters for weakly-controlled optimal gradient systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework for improving generalization in a class of learning problems which is related to point estimations for modeling of high-dimensional nonlinear functions. In particular, we consider a variational problem for a weakly-controlled gradient system, whose control input enters into the system dynamics as a coefficient to a nonlinear term which is scaled by a small parameter. Here, the optimization problem consists of a cost functional, which is associated with how to gauge the quality of the estimated model parameters at a certain fixed final time w.r.t. the model validating dataset, while the weakly-controlled gradient system, whose the time-evolution is guided by the model training dataset and its perturbed version with small random noise. Using the perturbation theory, we provide results that will allow us to solve a sequence of optimization problems, i.e., a set of decomposed optimization problems, so as to aggregate the corresponding approximate optimal solutions that are reasonably sufficient for improving generalization in such a class of learning problems. Moreover, we also provide an estimate for the rate of convergence for such approximate optimal solutions. Finally, we present some numerical results for a typical case of nonlinear regression problem.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimized deep ensemble for uncertainty quantification of deep neural networks: a system safety case study on sodium fast reactor thermal stratification modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate predictions and uncertainty quantification (UQ) are essential for decision-making in risk-sensitive fields such as system safety modeling. Deep ensembles (DEs) are efficient and scalable methods for UQ in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs); however, their performance is limited when constructed by simply retraining the same DNN multiple times with randomly sampled initializations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method that combines Bayesian optimization (BO) with DE, referred to as BODE, to enhance both predictive accuracy and UQ.
  We apply BODE to a case study involving a Densely connected Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data to predict eddy viscosity in sodium fast reactor thermal stratification modeling. Compared to a manually tuned baseline ensemble, BODE estimates total uncertainty approximately four times lower in a noise-free environment, primarily due to the baseline's overestimation of aleatoric uncertainty. Specifically, BODE estimates aleatoric uncertainty close to zero, while aleatoric uncertainty dominates the total uncertainty in the baseline ensemble. We also observe a reduction of more than 30% in epistemic uncertainty. When Gaussian noise with standard deviations of 5% and 10% is introduced into the data, BODE accurately fits the data and estimates uncertainty that aligns with the data noise. These results demonstrate that BODE effectively reduces uncertainty and enhances predictions in data-driven models, making it a flexible approach for various applications requiring accurate predictions and robust UQ.</description>

      <title>Latent Safety-Constrained Policy Approach for Safe Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In safe offline reinforcement learning (RL), the objective is to develop a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards while strictly adhering to safety constraints, utilizing only offline data. Traditional methods often face difficulties in balancing these constraints, leading to either diminished performance or increased safety risks. We address these issues with a novel approach that begins by learning a conservatively safe policy through the use of Conditional Variational Autoencoders, which model the latent safety constraints. Subsequently, we frame this as a Constrained Reward-Return Maximization problem, wherein the policy aims to optimize rewards while complying with the inferred latent safety constraints. This is achieved by training an encoder with a reward-Advantage Weighted Regression objective within the latent constraint space. Our methodology is supported by theoretical analysis, including bounds on policy performance and sample complexity. Extensive empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets, including challenging autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrates that our approach not only maintains safety compliance but also excels in cumulative reward optimization, surpassing existing methods. Additional visualizations provide further insights into the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of our approach.</description>

      <title>Disentangling impact of capacity, objective, batchsize, estimators, and step-size on flow VI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalizing flow-based variational inference (flow VI) is a promising approximate inference approach, but its performance remains inconsistent across studies. Numerous algorithmic choices influence flow VI's performance. We conduct a step-by-step analysis to disentangle the impact of some of the key factors: capacity, objectives, gradient estimators, number of gradient estimates (batchsize), and step-sizes. Each step examines one factor while neutralizing others using insights from the previous steps and/or using extensive parallel computation. To facilitate high-fidelity evaluation, we curate a benchmark of synthetic targets that represent common posterior pathologies and allow for exact sampling. We provide specific recommendations for different factors and propose a flow VI recipe that matches or surpasses leading turnkey Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Learning of Non-Conjugate Variational Posterior for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large scale Bayesian nonparametrics (BNP) learner such as stochastic variational inference (SVI) can handle datasets with large class number and large training size at fractional cost. Like its predecessor, SVI rely on the assumption of conjugate variational posterior to approximate the true posterior. A more challenging problem is to consider large scale learning on non-conjugate posterior. Recent works in this direction are mostly associated with using Monte Carlo methods for approximating the learner. However, these works are usually demonstrated on non-BNP related task and less complex models such as logistic regression, due to higher computational complexity. In order to overcome the issue faced by SVI, we develop a novel approach based on the recently proposed variational maximization-maximization (VMM) learner to allow large scale learning on non-conjugate posterior. Unlike SVI, our VMM learner does not require closed-form expression for the variational posterior expectatations. Our only requirement is that the variational posterior is differentiable. In order to ensure convergence in stochastic settings, SVI rely on decaying step-sizes to slow its learning. Inspired by SVI and Adam, we propose the novel use of decaying step-sizes on both gradient and ascent direction in our VMM to significantly improve its learning. We show that our proposed methods is compatible with ResNet features when applied to large class number datasets such as MIT67 and SUN397. Finally, we compare our proposed learner with several recent works such as deep clustering algorithms and showed we were able to produce on par or outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering measures.</description>

      <title>Safe Active Learning for Gaussian Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Process differential equations (GPODE) have recently gained momentum due to their ability to capture dynamics behavior of systems and also represent uncertainty in predictions. Prior work has described the process of training the hyperparameters and, thereby, calibrating GPODE to data. How to design efficient algorithms to collect data for training GPODE models is still an open field of research. Nevertheless high-quality training data is key for model performance. Furthermore, data collection leads to time-cost and financial-cost and might in some areas even be safety critical to the system under test. Therefore, algorithms for safe and efficient data collection are central for building high quality GPODE models. Our novel Safe Active Learning (SAL) for GPODE algorithm addresses this challenge by suggesting a mechanism to propose efficient and non-safety-critical data to collect. SAL GPODE does so by sequentially suggesting new data, measuring it and updating the GPODE model with the new data. In this way, subsequent data points are iteratively suggested. The core of our SAL GPODE algorithm is a constrained optimization problem maximizing information of new data for GPODE model training constrained by the safety of the underlying system. We demonstrate our novel SAL GPODE's superiority compared to a standard, non-active way of measuring new data on two relevant examples.</description>

MIMO detection poses considerable challenges due to the interference and noise introduced by the concurrent transmission of multiple streams. Efficient Uplink (UL) MIMO detection algorithms are crucial for decoding these signals accurately and ensuring robust communication. In this paper a MIMO detection algorithm is proposed which improves over the Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approximation for Belief Propagation (BP) and EP messages. The GMM messages better approximate the data prior when EP fails to do so and thus improve detection. This algorithm outperforms state of the art detection algorithms while maintaining low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>On the number of modes of Gaussian kernel density estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Gaussian kernel density estimator with bandwidth $\beta^{-\frac12}$ of $n$ iid Gaussian samples. Using the Kac-Rice formula and an Edgeworth expansion, we prove that the expected number of modes on the real line scales as $\Theta(\sqrt{\beta\log\beta})$ as $\beta,n\to\infty$ provided $n^c\lesssim \beta\lesssim n^{2-c}$ for some constant $c&gt;0$. An impetus behind this investigation is to determine the number of clusters to which Transformers are drawn in a metastable state.</description>

      <title>A semiconcavity approach to stability of entropic plans and exponential convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stability of optimizers and convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm in the framework of entropic optimal transport. We show entropic stability for optimal plans in terms of the Wasserstein distance between their marginals under a semiconcavity assumption on the sum of the cost and one of the two entropic potentials. When employed in the analysis of Sinkhorn's algorithm, this result gives a natural sufficient condition for its exponential convergence, which does not require the ground cost to be bounded. By controlling from above the Hessians of Sinkhorn potentials in examples of interest, we obtain new exponential convergence results. For instance, for the first time we obtain exponential convergence for log-concave marginals and quadratic costs for all values of the regularization parameter. Moreover, the convergence rate has a linear dependence on the regularization: this behavior is sharp and had only been previously obtained for compact distributions arXiv:2407.01202. Other interesting new applications include subspace elastic costs [Cuturi et al. PMLR 202(2023)], weakly log-concave marginals, marginals with light tails, where, under reinforced assumptions, we manage to improve the rates obtained in arXiv:2311.04041, the case of unbounded Lipschitz costs, and compact Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>GeLoRA: Geometric Adaptive Ranks For Efficient LoRA Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally intensive because it requires updating all parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) improves efficiency by modifying only a subset of weights but introduces a trade-off between expressivity and computational cost: lower ranks reduce resources but limit expressiveness, while higher ranks enhance expressivity at increased cost. Despite recent advances in adaptive LoRA techniques, existing methods fail to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We propose Geometric Low-Rank Adaptation (GeLoRA), a novel framework that computes the intrinsic dimensionality of hidden state representations to adaptively select LoRA ranks. We demonstrate that the intrinsic dimension provides a lower bound for the optimal rank of LoRA matrices, allowing for a principled selection that balances efficiency and expressivity. GeLoRA dynamically adjusts the rank for each layer based on the intrinsic dimensionality of its input and output representations, recognizing that not all model parameters equally impact fine-tuning. Empirical validation on multiple tasks shows that GeLoRA consistently outperforms recent baselines within the same parameter budget.</description>

      <title>Score and Distribution Matching Policy: Advanced Accelerated Visuomotor Policies via Matched Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual-motor policy learning has advanced with architectures like diffusion-based policies, known for modeling complex robotic trajectories. However, their prolonged inference times hinder high-frequency control tasks requiring real-time feedback. While consistency distillation (CD) accelerates inference, it introduces errors that compromise action quality. To address these limitations, we propose the Score and Distribution Matching Policy (SDM Policy), which transforms diffusion-based policies into single-step generators through a two-stage optimization process: score matching ensures alignment with true action distributions, and distribution matching minimizes KL divergence for consistency. A dual-teacher mechanism integrates a frozen teacher for stability and an unfrozen teacher for adversarial training, enhancing robustness and alignment with target distributions. Evaluated on a 57-task simulation benchmark, SDM Policy achieves a 6x inference speedup while having state-of-the-art action quality, providing an efficient and reliable framework for high-frequency robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization via Continual Variational Last Layer Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely seen as the state-of-the-art surrogate models for Bayesian optimization (BO) due to their ability to model uncertainty and their performance on tasks where correlations are easily captured (such as those defined by Euclidean metrics) and their ability to be efficiently updated online. However, the performance of GPs depends on the choice of kernel, and kernel selection for complex correlation structures is often difficult or must be made bespoke. While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are a promising direction for higher capacity surrogate models, they have so far seen limited use due to poor performance on some problem types. In this paper, we propose an approach which shows competitive performance on many problem types, including some that BNNs typically struggle with. We build on variational Bayesian last layers (VBLLs), and connect training of these models to exact conditioning in GPs. We exploit this connection to develop an efficient online training algorithm that interleaves conditioning and optimization. Our findings suggest that VBLL networks significantly outperform GPs and other BNN architectures on tasks with complex input correlations, and match the performance of well-tuned GPs on established benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent inference in empirical risk minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient descent is one of the most widely used iterative algorithms in modern statistical learning. However, its precise algorithmic dynamics in high-dimensional settings remain only partially understood, which has therefore limited its broader potential for statistical inference applications.
  This paper provides a precise, non-asymptotic distributional characterization of gradient descent iterates in a broad class of empirical risk minimization problems, in the so-called mean-field regime where the sample size is proportional to the signal dimension. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory holds for both general non-convex loss functions and non-Gaussian data, and reveals the central role of two Onsager correction matrices that precisely characterize the non-trivial dependence among all gradient descent iterates in the mean-field regime.
  Although the Onsager correction matrices are typically analytically intractable, our state evolution theory facilitates a generic gradient descent inference algorithm that consistently estimates these matrices across a broad class of models. Leveraging this algorithm, we show that the state evolution can be inverted to construct (i) data-driven estimators for the generalization error of gradient descent iterates and (ii) debiased gradient descent iterates for inference of the unknown signal. Detailed applications to two canonical models--linear regression and (generalized) logistic regression--are worked out to illustrate model-specific features of our general theory and inference methods.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Temporal Dependence of Training Data Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional data influence estimation methods, like influence function, assume that learning algorithms are permutation-invariant with respect to training data. However, modern training paradigms, especially for foundation models using stochastic algorithms and multi-stage curricula, are sensitive to data ordering, thus violating this assumption. This mismatch renders influence functions inadequate for answering a critical question in machine learning: How can we capture the dependence of data influence on the optimization trajectory during training? To address this gap, we formalize the concept of trajectory-specific leave-one-out (LOO) influence, which quantifies the impact of removing a data point from a specific iteration during training, accounting for the exact sequence of data encountered and the model's optimization trajectory. However, exactly evaluating the trajectory-specific LOO presents a significant computational challenge. To address this, we propose data value embedding, a novel technique enabling efficient approximation of trajectory-specific LOO. Specifically, we compute a training data embedding that encapsulates the cumulative interactions between data and the evolving model parameters. The LOO can then be efficiently approximated through a simple dot-product between the data value embedding and the gradient of the given test data. As data value embedding captures training data ordering, it offers valuable insights into model training dynamics. In particular, we uncover distinct phases of data influence, revealing that data points in the early and late stages of training exert a greater impact on the final model. These insights translate into actionable strategies for managing the computational overhead of data selection by strategically timing the selection process, potentially opening new avenues in data curation research.</description>

      <title>Sail into the Headwind: Alignment via Robust Rewards and Dynamic Labels against Reward Hacking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human preferences typically suffers from the infamous reward hacking problem, where optimization of an imperfect reward model leads to undesired behaviors. In this paper, we investigate reward hacking in offline preference optimization, which aims to improve an initial model using a preference dataset. We identify two types of reward hacking stemming from statistical fluctuations in the dataset: Type I Reward Hacking due to subpar choices appearing more favorable, and Type II Reward Hacking due to decent choices appearing less favorable. We prove that many (mainstream or theoretical) preference optimization methods suffer from both types of reward hacking. To mitigate Type I Reward Hacking, we propose POWER, a new preference optimization method that combines Guiasu's weighted entropy with a robust reward maximization objective. POWER enjoys finite-sample guarantees under general function approximation, competing with the best covered policy in the data. To mitigate Type II Reward Hacking, we analyze the learning dynamics of preference optimization and develop a novel technique that dynamically updates preference labels toward certain "stationary labels", resulting in diminishing gradients for untrustworthy samples. Empirically, POWER with dynamic labels (POWER-DL) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on alignment benchmarks, achieving improvements of up to 13.0 points on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 11.5 points on Arena-Hard over DPO, while also improving or maintaining performance on downstream tasks such as mathematical reasoning. Strong theoretical guarantees and empirical results demonstrate the promise of POWER-DL in mitigating reward hacking.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Convergence of Decentralized Gradient Tracking under the KL Property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decentralized multiagent optimization over networks, modeled as undirected graphs. The optimization problem consists of minimizing a nonconvex smooth function plus a convex extended-value function, which enforces constraints or extra structure on the solution (e.g., sparsity, low-rank). We further assume that the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property, with given exponent $\theta\in [0,1)$. The KL property is satisfied by several (nonconvex) functions of practical interest, e.g., arising from machine learning applications; in the centralized setting, it permits to achieve strong convergence guarantees. Here we establish convergence of the same type for the notorious decentralized gradient-tracking-based algorithm SONATA. Specifically, $\textbf{(i)}$ when $\theta\in (0,1/2]$, the sequence generated by SONATA converges to a stationary solution of the problem at R-linear rate;$ \textbf{(ii)} $when $\theta\in (1/2,1)$, sublinear rate is certified; and finally $\textbf{(iii)}$ when $\theta=0$, the iterates will either converge in a finite number of steps or converges at R-linear rate. This matches the convergence behavior of centralized proximal-gradient algorithms except when $\theta=0$. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.07382v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A critical decision point when training predictors using multiple studies is whether studies should be combined or treated separately. We compare two multi-study prediction approaches in the presence of potential heterogeneity in predictor-outcome relationships across datasets: 1) merging all of the datasets and training a single learner, and 2) multi-study ensembling, which involves training a separate learner on each dataset and combining the predictions resulting from each learner. For ridge regression, we show analytically and confirm via simulation that merging yields lower prediction error than ensembling when the predictor-outcome relationships are relatively homogeneous across studies. However, as cross-study heterogeneity increases, there exists a transition point beyond which ensembling outperforms merging. We provide analytic expressions for the transition point in various scenarios, study asymptotic properties, and illustrate how transition point theory can be used for deciding when studies should be combined with an application from metagenomics.</description>

      <title>Group &amp; Reweight: A Novel Cost-Sensitive Approach to Mitigating Class Imbalance in Network Traffic Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19214v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internet services have led to the eruption of network traffic, and machine learning on these Internet data has become an indispensable tool, especially when the application is risk-sensitive. This paper focuses on network traffic classification in the presence of severe class imbalance. Such a distributional trait mostly drifts the optimal decision boundary and results in an unsatisfactory solution. This raises safety concerns in the network traffic field when previous class imbalance methods hardly deal with numerous minority malicious classes. To alleviate these effects, we design a \textit{group \&amp; reweight} strategy for alleviating class imbalance. Inspired by the group distributionally optimization framework, our approach heuristically clusters classes into groups, iteratively updates the non-parametric weights for separate classes, and optimizes the learning model by minimizing reweighted losses. We theoretically interpret the optimization process from a Stackelberg game and perform extensive experiments on typical benchmarks. Results show that our approach can not only suppress the negative effect of class imbalance but also improve the comprehensive performance in prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling from high dimensional, multimodal distributions remains a fundamental challenge across domains such as statistical Bayesian inference and physics based machine learning. In this paper, we propose Annealing Flow, a continuous normalizing flow based approach designed to sample from high dimensional and multimodal distributions. The key idea is to learn a continuous normalizing flow based transport map, guided by annealing, to transition samples from an easy to sample distribution to the target distribution, facilitating effective exploration of modes in high dimensional spaces. Unlike many existing methods, AF training does not rely on samples from the target distribution. AF ensures effective and balanced mode exploration, achieves linear complexity in sample size and dimensions, and circumvents inefficient mixing times. We demonstrate the superior performance of AF compared to state of the art methods through extensive experiments on various challenging distributions and real world datasets, particularly in high-dimensional and multimodal settings. We also highlight the potential of AF for sampling the least favorable distributions.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Multi-Task Learning on ReLU Neural Network Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of solutions to multi-task shallow ReLU neural network learning problems, wherein the network is trained to fit a dataset with minimal sum of squared weights. Remarkably, the solutions learned for each individual task resemble those obtained by solving a kernel regression problem, revealing a novel connection between neural networks and kernel methods. It is known that single-task neural network learning problems are equivalent to a minimum norm interpolation problem in a non-Hilbertian Banach space, and that the solutions of such problems are generally non-unique. In contrast, we prove that the solutions to univariate-input, multi-task neural network interpolation problems are almost always unique, and coincide with the solution to a minimum-norm interpolation problem in a Sobolev (Reproducing Kernel) Hilbert Space. We also demonstrate a similar phenomenon in the multivariate-input case; specifically, we show that neural network learning problems with large numbers of tasks are approximately equivalent to an $\ell^2$ (Hilbert space) minimization problem over a fixed kernel determined by the optimal neurons.</description>

      <title>Generalized Least Squares Kernelized Tensor Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world datasets often contain missing or corrupted values. Completing multidimensional tensor-structured data with missing entries is essential for numerous applications. Smoothness-constrained low-rank factorization models have shown superior performance with reduced computational costs. While effective at capturing global and long-range correlations, these models struggle to reproduce short-scale, high-frequency variations in the data. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Least Squares Kernelized Tensor Factorization (GLSKF) framework for tensor completion. GLSKF integrates smoothness-constrained low-rank factorization with a locally correlated residual process; the resulting additive structure can effectively characterize both global dependencies and local variations. In particular, we define the covariance norm to enforce the smoothness of factor matrices in the global low-rank factorization, and use structured covariance/kernel functions to model the local processes. For model estimation, we develop an alternating least squares (ALS) procedure with closed-form solutions for each subproblem. To efficiently handle missing data, GLSKF utilizes projection matrices that preserve the Kronecker structure of covariances, facilitating fast computations through conjugate gradient (CG) and preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithms. The proposed framework is evaluated on four real-world datasets across diverse tasks: traffic speed imputation, color image inpainting, video completion, and MRI image reconstruction. Experimental results confirm that GLSKF delivers superior effectiveness and scalability, establishing it as a robust solution for multidimensional tensor completion.</description>

      <title>Injectivity of ReLU networks: perspectives from statistical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When can the input of a ReLU neural network be inferred from its output? In other words, when is the network injective? We consider a single layer, $x \mapsto \mathrm{ReLU}(Wx)$, with a random Gaussian $m \times n$ matrix $W$, in a high-dimensional setting where $n, m \to \infty$. Recent work connects this problem to spherical integral geometry giving rise to a conjectured sharp injectivity threshold for $\alpha = \frac{m}{n}$ by studying the expected Euler characteristic of a certain random set. We adopt a different perspective and show that injectivity is equivalent to a property of the ground state of the spherical perceptron, an important spin glass model in statistical physics. By leveraging the (non-rigorous) replica symmetry-breaking theory, we derive analytical equations for the threshold whose solution is at odds with that from the Euler characteristic. Furthermore, we use Gordon's min--max theorem to prove that a replica-symmetric upper bound refutes the Euler characteristic prediction. Along the way we aim to give a tutorial-style introduction to key ideas from statistical physics in an effort to make the exposition accessible to a broad audience. Our analysis establishes a connection between spin glasses and integral geometry but leaves open the problem of explaining the discrepancies.</description>

      <title>AdaStop: adaptive statistical testing for sound comparisons of Deep RL agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the scientific community has questioned the statistical reproducibility of many empirical results, especially in the field of machine learning. To contribute to the resolution of this reproducibility crisis, we propose a theoretically sound methodology for comparing the performance of a set of algorithms. We exemplify our methodology in Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL). The performance of one execution of a Deep RL algorithm is a random variable. Therefore, several independent executions are needed to evaluate its performance. When comparing algorithms with random performance, a major question concerns the number of executions to perform to ensure that the result of the comparison is theoretically sound. Researchers in Deep RL often use less than 5 independent executions to compare algorithms: we claim that this is not enough in general. Moreover, when comparing more than 2 algorithms at once, we have to use a multiple tests procedure to preserve low error guarantees. We introduce AdaStop, a new statistical test based on multiple group sequential tests. When used to compare algorithms, AdaStop adapts the number of executions to stop as early as possible while ensuring that enough information has been collected to distinguish algorithms that have different score distributions. We prove theoretically that AdaStop has a low probability of making a (family-wise) error. We illustrate the effectiveness of AdaStop in various use-cases, including toy examples and Deep RL algorithms on challenging Mujoco environments. AdaStop is the first statistical test fitted to this sort of comparisons: it is both a significant contribution to statistics, and an important contribution to computational studies performed in reinforcement learning and in other domains.</description>

      <title>A Double Machine Learning Approach for the Evaluation of COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness under the Test-Negative Design: Analysis of Qu\'ebec Administrative Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The test-negative design (TND), which is routinely used for monitoring seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness (VE), has recently become integral to COVID-19 vaccine surveillance, notably in Qu\'ebec, Canada. Some studies have addressed the identifiability and estimation of causal parameters under the TND, but efficiency bounds for nonparametric estimators of the target parameter under the unconfoundedness assumption have not yet been investigated. Motivated by the goal of improving adjustment for measured confounders when estimating COVID-19 VE among community-dwelling people aged $\geq 60$ years in Qu\'ebec, we propose a one-step doubly robust and locally efficient estimator called TNDDR (TND doubly robust), which utilizes cross-fitting (sample splitting) and can incorporate machine learning techniques to estimate the nuisance functions and thus improve control for measured confounders. We derive the efficient influence function (EIF) for the marginal expectation of the outcome under a vaccination intervention, explore the von Mises expansion, and establish the conditions for $\sqrt{n}-$consistency, asymptotic normality and double robustness of TNDDR. The proposed estimator is supported by both theoretical and empirical justifications.</description>

      <title>Nearly Minimax Optimal Submodular Maximization with Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider maximizing an unknown monotonic, submodular set function $f: 2^{[n]} \rightarrow [0,1]$ with cardinality constraint under stochastic bandit feedback. At each time $t=1,\dots,T$ the learner chooses a set $S_t \subset [n]$ with $|S_t| \leq k$ and receives reward $f(S_t) + \eta_t$ where $\eta_t$ is mean-zero sub-Gaussian noise. The objective is to minimize the learner's regret with respect to an approximation of the maximum $f(S_*)$ with $|S_*| = k$, obtained through robust greedy maximization of $f$. To date, the best regret bound in the literature scales as $k n^{1/3} T^{2/3}$. And by trivially treating every set as a unique arm one deduces that $\sqrt{ {n \choose k} T }$ is also achievable using standard multi-armed bandit algorithms. In this work, we establish the first minimax lower bound for this setting that scales like $\tilde{\Omega}(\min_{L \le k}(L^{1/3}n^{1/3}T^{2/3} + \sqrt{{n \choose k - L}T}))$. For a slightly restricted algorithm class, we prove a stronger regret lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(\min_{L \le k}(Ln^{1/3}T^{2/3} + \sqrt{{n \choose k - L}T}))$. Moreover, we propose an algorithm Sub-UCB that achieves regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\min_{L \le k}(Ln^{1/3}T^{2/3} + \sqrt{{n \choose k - L}T}))$ capable of matching the lower bound on regret for the restricted class up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Vanilla Bayesian Optimization Performs Great in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02229v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional problems have long been considered the Achilles' heel of Bayesian optimization algorithms. Spurred by the curse of dimensionality, a large collection of algorithms aim to make it more performant in this setting, commonly by imposing various simplifying assumptions on the objective. In this paper, we identify the degeneracies that make vanilla Bayesian optimization poorly suited to high-dimensional tasks, and further show how existing algorithms address these degeneracies through the lens of lowering the model complexity. Moreover, we propose an enhancement to the prior assumptions that are typical to vanilla Bayesian optimization algorithms, which reduces the complexity to manageable levels without imposing structural restrictions on the objective. Our modification - a simple scaling of the Gaussian process lengthscale prior with the dimensionality - reveals that standard Bayesian optimization works drastically better than previously thought in high dimensions, clearly outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms on multiple commonly considered real-world high-dimensional tasks.</description>

      <title>Biology-inspired joint distribution neurons based on Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction allowing for multidirectional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05097v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological neural networks seem qualitatively superior (e.g. in learning, flexibility, robustness) to current artificial like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Simultaneously, in contrast to them: biological have fundamentally multidirectional signal propagation \cite{axon}, also of probability distributions e.g. for uncertainty estimation, and are believed not being able to use standard backpropagation training \cite{backprop}. There are proposed novel artificial neurons based on HCR (Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction) allowing to remove the above low level differences: with neurons containing local joint distribution model (of its connections), representing joint density on normalized variables as just linear combination of $(f_\mathbf{j})$ orthonormal polynomials: $\rho(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{\mathbf{j}\in B} a_\mathbf{j} f_\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{x})$ for $\mathbf{x} \in [0,1]^d$ and $B\subset \mathbb{N}^d$ some chosen basis. By various index summations of such $(a_\mathbf{j})_{\mathbf{j}\in B}$ tensor as neuron parameters, we get simple formulas for e.g. conditional expected values for propagation in any direction, like $E[x|y,z]$, $E[y|x]$, which degenerate to KAN-like parametrization if restricting to pairwise dependencies. Such HCR network can also propagate probability distributions (also joint) like $\rho(y,z|x)$. It also allows for additional training approaches, like direct $(a_\mathbf{j})$ estimation, through tensor decomposition, or more biologically plausible information bottleneck training: layers directly influencing only neighbors, optimizing content to maximize information about the next layer, and minimizing about the previous to remove noise, extract crucial information.</description>

      <title>Towards Certified Unlearning for Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of machine unlearning, certified unlearning has been extensively studied in convex machine learning models due to its high efficiency and strong theoretical guarantees. However, its application to deep neural networks (DNNs), known for their highly nonconvex nature, still poses challenges. To bridge the gap between certified unlearning and DNNs, we propose several simple techniques to extend certified unlearning methods to nonconvex objectives. To reduce the time complexity, we develop an efficient computation method by inverse Hessian approximation without compromising certification guarantees. In addition, we extend our discussion of certification to nonconvergence training and sequential unlearning, considering that real-world users can send unlearning requests at different time points. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and the advantages of certified unlearning in DNNs.</description>

      <title>Model Developmental Safety: A Retention-Centric Method and Applications in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the real world, a learning-enabled system usually undergoes multiple cycles of model development to enhance the system's ability to handle difficult or emerging tasks. This continual model development process raises a significant issue that the model development for acquiring new or improving existing capabilities may inadvertently lose capabilities of the old model, also known as catastrophic forgetting. Existing continual learning studies focus on mitigating catastrophic forgetting by trading off performance on previous tasks and new tasks to ensure good average performance. However, they are inadequate for many applications especially in safety-critical domains, as failure to strictly preserve the good performance of the old model not only introduces safety risks and uncertainties but also imposes substantial expenses in the re-improving and re-validation of existing properties. To address this issue, we introduce model developmental safety as a guarantee of a learning system such that in the model development process the new model should strictly preserve the existing protected capabilities of the old model while improving its performance on target tasks. To ensure the model developmental safety, we present a retention-centric framework by formulating the model developmental safety as data-dependent constraints. Under this framework, we study how to develop a pretrained vision-language model, specifically the CLIP model, for acquiring new capabilities or improving existing capabilities of image classification. We propose an efficient constrained optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee and use its insights to finetune a CLIP model with task-dependent heads for promoting the model developmental safety. Our experiments on improving vision perception capabilities on autonomous driving and scene recognition datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Evolving Alignment via Asymmetric Self-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current RLHF frameworks for aligning large language models (LLMs) typically assume a fixed prompt distribution, which is sub-optimal and limits the scalability of alignment and generalizability of models. To address this, we introduce a general open-ended RLHF framework that casts alignment as an asymmetric game between two players: (i) a creator that generates increasingly informative prompt distributions using reward signals, and (ii) a solver that learns to produce more preferred responses on prompts produced by the creator. This framework of Evolving Alignment via Asymmetric Self-Play (eva), results in a simple and efficient approach that can utilize any existing RLHF algorithm for scalable alignment. eva outperforms state-of-the-art methods on widely-used benchmarks, without the need of any additional human crafted prompts. Specifically, eva improves the win rate of Gemma-2-9B-it on Arena-Hard from 51.6% to 60.1% with DPO, from 55.7% to 58.9% with SPPO, from 52.3% to 60.7% with SimPO, and from 54.8% to 60.3% with ORPO, surpassing its 27B version and matching claude-3-opus. This improvement is persistent even when new human crafted prompts are introduced. Finally, we show eva is effective and robust under various ablation settings.</description>

      <title>Modeling Latent Non-Linear Dynamical System over Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of modeling a non-linear dynamical system when given a time series by deriving equations directly from the data. Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</description>
