      <title>Insensitive edge solitons in non-Hermitian topological lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the synergetic interplay of topology, nonreciprocity and nonlinearity is capable of unprecedented effects. We focus on a nonreciprocal variant of the Su-Shrieffer-Heeger chain with local Kerr nonlinearity. We find a continuous family of non-reciprocal edge solitons (NESs) emerging from the topological edge mode, with near-zero energy, in great contrast from their reciprocal counterparts. Analytical results show that this energy decays exponentially towards zero when increasing the lattice size. Consequently, despite the absence of chiral symmetry within the system, we obtain zero-energy NESs, which are insensitive to growing Kerr nonlinearity. Even more surprising, these zero-energy NESs also persist in the strong nonlinear limit. Our work may enable new avenues for the control of nonlinear topological waves without requiring the addition of complex chiral-preserving nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical computation of spiral spectra with exponentially-weighted preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of nonlinear waves on spatially extended domains is commonly probed by computing the spectrum of the linearization of the underlying PDE about the wave profile. It is known that convective transport, whether driven by the nonlinear pattern itself or an underlying fluid flow, can cause exponential growth of the resolvent of the linearization as a function of the domain length. In particular, sparse eigenvalue algorithms may result in inaccurate and spurious spectra in the convective regime. In this work, we focus on spiral waves, which arise in many natural processes and which exhibit convective transport. We prove that exponential weights can serve as effective, inexpensive preconditioners that result in resolvents that are uniformly bounded in the domain size and that stabilize numerical spectral computations. We also show that the optimal exponential rates can be computed reliably from a simpler asymptotic problem posed in one space dimension.</description>

      <title>Statistics of extreme events in integrable turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the spectral kinetic theory of soliton gas to investigate the likelihood of extreme events in integrable turbulence described by the one-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (fNLSE). This is done by invoking a stochastic interpretation of the inverse scattering transform for fNLSE and analytically evaluating the kurtosis of the emerging random nonlinear wave field in terms of the spectral density of states of the corresponding soliton gas. We then apply the general result to two fundamental scenarios of the generation of integrable turbulence: (i) the asymptotic development of the spontaneous (noise induced) modulational instability of a plane wave, and (ii) the long-time evolution of strongly nonlinear, partially coherent waves. In both cases, involving the bound state soliton gas dynamics, the analytically obtained values of the kurtosis are in perfect agreement with those inferred from direct numerical simulations of the the fNLSE, providing the long-awaited theoretical explanation of the respective rogue wave statistics. Additionally, the evolution of a particular non-bound state gas is considered providing important insights related to the validity of the so-called virial theorem.</description>

      <title>Energy-based theory of autoresonance in chains of coupled damped-driven generic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An energy-based theory of autoresonance in driven dissipative chains of coupled generic oscillators is discussed on the basis of a variational principle concerning the energy functional. The theory is applied to chains of delayed Duffing-Ueda oscillators and the equations that together govern the autoresonance forces and solutions are derived and solved analytically for generic values of parameters and initial conditions, including the case of quenched time-delay disorder. Remarkably, the presence of retarded potentials with time-delayed feedback drastically modify the autoresonance scenario preventing the growth of the energy oscillation over specific regions of the parameter space. Additionally, effective harmonic forces with a slowly varying frequency are derived from the exact autoresonant excitations and the effectiveness of the theory is demonstrated at suppressing the chaos induced by homogeneous periodic excitations in such oscillator chains. Numerical experiments confirmed all the theoretical predictions.</description>
