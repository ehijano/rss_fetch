      <title>An Integrated Open Source Software System for the Generation and Analysis of Subject-Specific Blood Flow Simulation Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Objective: Hemodynamic analysis of blood flow through arteries and veins is critical for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, such as aneurysms and stenoses, and for investigating cardiovascular parameters, such as turbulence and wall shear stress. For subject-specific analyses, the anatomy and blood flow of the subject can be captured non-invasively using structural and 4D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), on the other hand, can be used to generate blood flow simulations by solving the Navier-Stokes equations. To generate and analyze subject-specific blood flow simulations, MRI and CFD have to be brought together.
  Methods: We present an interactive, customizable, and user-oriented visual analysis tool that assists researchers in both medicine and numerical analysis. Our open-source tool is applicable to domains such as CFD and MRI, and it facilitates the analysis of simulation results and medical data, especially in hemodynamic studies. It enables the creation of simulation ensembles with a high variety of parameters. Furthermore, it allows for the visual and analytical examination of simulations and measurements through 2D embeddings of the similarity space.
  Results: To demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool, we applied it to three real-world use cases, showcasing its ability to configure simulation ensembles and analyse blood flow dynamics. We evaluated our example cases together with MRI and CFD experts to further enhance features and increase the usability.
  Conclusions: By combining the strengths of both CFD and MRI, our tool provides a more comprehensive understanding of hemodynamic parameters, facilitating more accurate analysis of hemodynamic biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Accelerated Microstructure Imaging: A SHAP-Guided Protocol on the Connectome 2.0 scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion MRI Neurite Exchange Imaging model offers a promising framework for probing gray matter microstructure by estimating parameters such as compartment sizes, diffusivities, and inter-compartmental water exchange time. However, existing protocols require long scan times. This study proposes a reduced acquisition scheme for the Connectome 2.0 scanner that preserves model accuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast, and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes without loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader application of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in neuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for designing efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping.</description>

      <title>Mapping of discrete range modulated proton radiograph to water-equivalent path length using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. Proton beams enable localized dose delivery. Accurate range estimation is essential, but planning still relies on X-ray CT, which introduces uncertainty in stopping power and range. Proton CT measures water equivalent thickness directly but suffers resolution loss from multiple Coulomb scattering. We develop a data driven method that reconstructs water equivalent path length (WEPL) maps from energy resolved proton radiographs, bypassing intermediate reconstructions. Approach. We present a machine learning pipeline for WEPL from high dimensional radiographs. Data were generated with the TOPAS Monte Carlo toolkit, modeling a clinical nozzle and a patient CT. Proton energies spanned 70-230 MeV across 72 projection angles. Principal component analysis reduced input dimensionality while preserving signal. A conditional GAN with gradient penalty was trained for WEPL prediction using a composite loss (adversarial, MSE, SSIM, perceptual) to balance sharpness, accuracy, and stability. Main results. The model reached a mean relative WEPL deviation of 2.5 percent, an SSIM of 0.97, and a proton radiography gamma index passing rate of 97.1 percent (2 percent delta WEPL, 3 mm distance-to-agreement) on a simulated head phantom. Results indicate high spatial fidelity and strong structural agreement. Significance. WEPL can be mapped directly from proton radiographs with deep learning while avoiding intermediate steps. The method mitigates limits of analytic techniques and may improve treatment planning. Future work will tune the number of PCA components, include detector response, explore low dose settings, and extend multi angle data toward full proton CT reconstruction; it is compatible with clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>WarpPINN-fibers: improved cardiac strain estimation from cine-MR with physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contractile motion of the heart is strongly determined by the distribution of the fibers that constitute cardiac tissue. Strain analysis informed with the orientation of fibers allows to describe several pathologies that are typically associated with impaired mechanics of the myocardium, such as cardiovascular disease. Several methods have been developed to estimate strain-derived metrics from traditional imaging techniques. However, the physical models underlying these methods do not include fiber mechanics, restricting their capacity to accurately explain cardiac function. In this work, we introduce WarpPINN-fibers, a physics-informed neural network framework to accurately obtain cardiac motion and strains enhanced by fiber information. We train our neural network to satisfy a hyper-elastic model and promote fiber contraction with the goal to predict the deformation field of the heart from cine magnetic resonance images. For this purpose, we build a loss function composed of three terms: a data-similarity loss between the reference and the warped template images, a regularizer enforcing near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue and a fiber-stretch penalization that controls strain in the direction of synthetically produced fibers. We show that our neural network improves the former WarpPINN model and effectively controls fiber stretch in a synthetic phantom experiment. Then, we demonstrate that WarpPINN-fibers outperforms alternative methodologies in landmark-tracking and strain curve prediction for a cine-MRI benchmark with a cohort of 15 healthy volunteers. We expect that our method will enable a more precise quantification of cardiac strains through accurate deformation fields that are consistent with fiber physiology, without requiring imaging techniques more sophisticated than MRI.</description>

      <title>HitPix3 -- a new HV-CMOS active pixel sensor for ion beam therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle therapy is a well-established clinical treatment of tumors and so far, more than one hundred centers are in operation around the world. High accuracy on position and dose rate in beam monitoring are major cornerstones of clinical success in particle therapy. A high voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic active pixel sensor was developed for this beam monitoring system. The HV-CMOS technology has demonstrated many advantages over other technologies in dealing with radiation tolerance. This HV-CMOS sensor was produced with a 180 nm commercial technology on high-resistivity substrate. The HitPix sensor features several specific design details for operation in a high-intensity ion beam environment: hit-counting pixels, on-sensor projection calculation, radiation tolerant design and frame-based readout. It has a 9775 $\mu$m $\times$ 10110 $\mu$m sensor area with 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m pixel size. The new HitPix3 has a number of improvements, including a modified in-pixel amplifier, on-sensor calculation of beam profile projection in two dimensions, and in-pixel threshold tuning capacity. The functionality of these features was confirmed in laboratory tests of unirradiated HitPix3 sensors, making the HitPix3 an important step in developing a sensor for use in ion beam monitoring.</description>

      <title>A new theoretical Lorentzian Apodization function: A Simulations based Comparison with traditional Apodization functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard apodization methods suppress side lobes but increase FWHM, reducing lateral resolution. Grating lobes can interfere with the main lobe, introducing artifacts in ultrasound images. A simple mathematical apodization function is needed to reduce side lobes while decreasing FWHM, thereby improving lateral resolution. The advantage of the new apodization function is that it performs comparably to the Hanning function in suppressing the first grating lobe while also reducing FWHM. This leads to improved lateral resolution and fewer artifacts caused by interference between side lobes and the main beam. Simulations using the new inverse quadratic apodization and no apodization were conducted with a wave pressure model. The new method was implemented using a rectangular function convoluted with the Fourier transform of an inverse quadratic. FWHM and the first side lobe amplitudes were quantified and compared across apodization functions. The inverse quadratic apodization outperformed no apodization in FWHM, with values of 0.906 mm and 1.22 mm, respectively. For first grating lobe suppression, the inverse quadratic and Hanning apodizations yielded -31.47 dB and -31 dB, respectively. Simulated B-mode wire phantom scans showed CNR values of 1.06 (no apodization), 1.32 (Hanning), and 1.66 (inverse quadratic). Corresponding image sharpness values were 7.3398, 6.6009, and 7.0039. The proposed apodization improves FWHM over rectangular and better suppresses the first side lobe than Hanning. Lorentzian apodization at a= 8, a= 15, the method yields superior CNR compared to standard apodizations, with only a slight trade-off in sharpness.</description>
