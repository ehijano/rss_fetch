      <title>The VC-dimension and point configurations in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $X$ and a collection ${\mathcal H}$ of functions from $X$ to $\{0,1\}$, the VC-dimension measures the complexity of the hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ in the context of PAC learning. In recent years, this has been connected to geometric configuration problems in vector spaces over finite fields. In particular, it is easy to show that the VC-dimension of the set of spheres of a given radius in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ is equal to $d+1$, since this is how many points generically determine a sphere. It is known that for $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, $|E|\geq q^{d-\frac{1}{d-1}}$, the set of spheres centered at points in $E$, and intersected with the set $E$, has VC-dimension either $d$ or $d+1$.
  In this paper, we study a similar question over Euclidean space. We find an explicit dimensional threshold $s_d&lt;d$ so that whenever $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 3$, and the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is at least $s_d$, it follows that there exists an interval $I$ such that for any $t\in I$, the VC-dimension of the set of spheres of radius $t$ centered at points in $E$, and intersected with $E$, is at least $3$. In the process of proving this theorem, we also provide the first explicit dimensional threshold for a set $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ to contain a $4$-cycle, i.e. $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\in E$ satisfying $$ |x_1-x_2|=|x_2-x_3|=|x_3-x_4|=|x_4-x_1| $$</description>

      <title>Weighted Bounded Variation Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the theory of weighted functions of bounded variation (BV), as introduced by Baldi [Ba01]. Depending on the theorem, we impose lower semicontinuity and/or a pointwise A1 condition on the weight. Our motivation is twofold: to establish weighted Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev (GNS) inequalities for BV functions, and to clarify and extend earlier results on weighted BV spaces. Our main contributions include a structure theorem under minimal assumptions (lower semicontinuity), a smooth approximation result, an embedding theorem, a weighted GNS inequality for BV functions, and a corresponding weighted isoperimetric inequality.</description>

      <title>Failure of stability of a maximal operator bound for perturbed Nevo--Thangavelu means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a two-step nilpotent Lie group, identified via the exponential map with the Lie-algebra $\mathfrak g=\mathfrak g_1\oplus\mathfrak g_2$, where $[\mathfrak g,\mathfrak g]\subset \mathfrak g_2$. We consider maximal functions associated to spheres in a $d$-dimensional linear subspace $H$, dilated by the automorphic dilations. $L^p$ boundedness results for the case where $H=\mathfrak g_1$ are well understood. Here we consider the case of a tilted hyperplane $H\neq \mathfrak g_1$ which is not invariant under the automorphic dilations. In the case of M\'etivier groups it is known that the $L^p$-boundedness results are stable under a small linear tilt. We show that this is generally not the case for other two-step groups, and provide new necessary conditions for $L^p$ boundedness. We prove these results in a more general setting with tilted versions of submanifolds of $\mathfrak g_1$.</description>

      <title>Uniform Asymptotic approximation and numerical evaluation of the Reverse Generalized Bessel Polynomial zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform asymptotic expansions are derived for the zeros of the reverse generalized Bessel polynomials of large degree $n$ and real parameter $a$. It is assumed that $-\Delta_{1} n+\frac{3}{2} \leq a \leq \Delta_{2} n$ for fixed arbitrary $\Delta_{1} \in (0,1)$ and bounded positive $\Delta_{2}$. For this parameter range at most one of the zeros is real, with the rest being complex conjugates. The new expansions are uniformly valid for all the zeros, and are shown to be highly accurate for moderate or large values of $n$. They are consequently used as initial values in a very efficient numerical algorithm designed to obtain the remaining complex zeros using Taylor series.</description>

      <title>Bounds and asymptotic expansions for the radii of convexity and uniform convexity of normalized Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the asymptotic behaviour of the radii of convexity and uniform convexity for normalized Bessel functions with respect to large order. We provide detailed asymptotic expansions for these radii and establish recurrence relations for the associated coefficients. Additionally, we derive generalized bounds for the radii of convexity and uniform convexity by applying the Euler-Rayleigh inequality and potential polynomials. The asymptotic inversion method and Rayleigh sums are the main tools used in the proofs.</description>

      <title>Contractive Hardy--Littlewood inequalities in the Dirichlet range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The class $A_\alpha^p$ consists of those analytic functions $f$ in the unit disc such that \[\|f\|_{\alpha,p}^p := |f(0)|^p+\int_0^1 \left(\frac{d}{dr} M_p^p(r,f)\right) (1-r^2)^{\alpha-1} \,dr &lt; \infty,\] where $M_p^p(r,f)$ is the radial integral mean of $|f|^p$ and $0&lt;\alpha, p &lt;\infty$. For $\alpha&gt;1$, $A_\alpha^p$ is the standard weighted Bergman space, and $A_1^p=H^p$. We consider $A_\alpha^p$ for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and show that (weighted) isometric conformal invariance extends to this range, and we also clarify the relation between $A_{\alpha}^p$ and the classical Besov spaces. Our main result is the contractive inequality $\|f\|_{\beta,q} \leq \|f\|_{\alpha,p}$, valid when $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\beta&lt;\infty$ and $\alpha/p=\beta/q$. We also identify the functions for which equality is attained. We thus extend recent results of the second-named author ($1\leq \alpha&lt;\beta$) and Llinares ($\beta=1$ and $p=2$). The extension of results from the classical range $1\leq \alpha &lt; \infty$ to the Dirichlet range $0&lt;\alpha &lt;1$ uses arguments relying on analytic continuation.</description>

      <title>Bilinear and Fractional Leibniz Rules Beyond Euclidean Spaces: Weighted Besov and Triebel--Lizorkin Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish fractional Leibniz rules in weighted settings for nonnegative self-adjoint operators on spaces of homogeneous type. Using a unified method that avoids Fourier transforms, we prove bilinear estimates for spectral multiplier on weighted Hardy, Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. Our approach is flexible and applies beyond the Euclidean setting-covering, for instance, nilpotent Lie groups, Grushin operators, and Hermite expansions-thus extending classical Kato-Ponce inequalities. The framework also yields new weighted bilinear estimates including fractional Leibniz rules for Hermite, Laguerre, and Bessel operator, with applications to scattering formulas and related PDE models.</description>

      <title>From tug-of-war to Brownian Boost: explicit ODE solutions for player-funded stochastic-differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily;
  stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive.
  Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.</description>
