      <title>Gas Fire Power Plant Management Through Numerical Approximation of Spark Spread Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-commodity valuation approaches to value gas fire power plants are well studied in the literature. Hence, the value of the gas fire power plant is identical to the value of a spark spread option wherein the underlying are electricity and gas with a strike price assimilated to operating and maintenance costs. Power and fuels spot prices account for uncertain futures cash-flows for power-plant generator owners. For instance, for gas-fired turbine plant, spot prices of electricity and gas determine the random cash-flows of the power-plant. Other than the spot prices, the valuation of such plant involves among other deterministic cost the plant heat rate and operating costs. Recently, the cost of emissions is considered into the valuation to tackle environmental issues. Given some simplifications in the plant cash-flow modelling, the value of such plant can either be expressed as the price of i) a cross-commodity option or ii) the price of a real option. Here, we focus on cross-commodity option valuation approach where the value of the power plant is approached as the value of a spark spread option. When spot prices of the underlying commodities are log-normal, closed formulae or approximations can be obtained using Kirk's approximation. Naturally, the spot price of electricity and gas present spikes due to seasonality among other factors. However, in that case it is not possible to get a closed formula for the spark spread option. In this paper we explore possibilities to approximate spark spread options when spot prices fall into a class of jump diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Vehicle front steering control computation saving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For autonomous vehicles lane keeping purposes it is crucial to control the vehicle yaw rate. As it is known a vehicle yaw rate control can be achieved handling the steering angle. One option is to consider a robust controller and depending of the requirements the synthesis can drive to a high order controller. Nowadays this kind of vehicles needs a networked based control (IVN -Intelligent Vehicle Network-)with a considerable amount of control loops for different vehicle components. Therefore, in this environment the controllers computation saving could be a good option for unload the network and digital processors. That is the main target of this contribution; in order to accomplish this goal a interlacing implementation technique is considered. Results in a real path tracking illustrates viability of this procedure.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Policy Gradient Methods for the Linear Quadratic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods are a powerful family of reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous control that optimize a policy directly. However, standard first-order methods often converge slowly. Second-order methods can accelerate learning by using curvature information, but they are typically expensive to compute. The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is a practical setting in which key quantities, such as the policy gradient, admit closed-form expressions. In this work, we develop second-order policy gradient algorithms for LQR by deriving explicit formulas for both the approximate and exact Hessians used in Gauss--Newton and Newton methods, respectively. Numerical experiments show a faster convergence rate for the proposed second-order approach over the standard first-order policy gradient baseline.</description>

      <title>Hopfield Neural Networks for Online Constrained Parameter Estimation with Time-Varying Dynamics and Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two projector-based Hopfield neural network (HNN) estimators for online, constrained parameter estimation under time-varying data, additive disturbances, and slowly drifting physical parameters. The first is a constraint-aware HNN that enforces linear equalities and inequalities (via slack neurons) and continuously tracks the constrained least-squares target. The second augments the state with compensation neurons and a concatenated regressor to absorb bias-like disturbance components within the same energy function. For both estimators we establish global uniform ultimate boundedness with explicit convergence rate and ultimate bound, and we derive practical tuning rules that link the three design gains to closed-loop bandwidth and steady-state accuracy. We also introduce an online identifiability monitor that adapts the constraint weight and time step, and, when needed, projects updates onto identifiable subspaces to prevent drift in poorly excited directions...</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control with Multiple Constraint Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation that splits constraints in two different types. Motivated by safety considerations, the first type of constraint enforces a control-invariant set, while the second type could represent a less restrictive constraint on the system state. This distinction enables closed-loop sub- optimality results for nonlinear MPC with heterogeneous state constraints (distinct constraints across open loop predicted states), and no terminal elements. Removing the non-invariant constraint recovers the partially constrained case. Beyond its theoretical interest, heterogeneous constrained MPC shows how constraint choices shape the system's closed loop. In the partially constrained case, adjusting the constraint horizon (how many predicted- state constraints are enforced) trades estimation accuracy for computational cost. Our analysis yields first, a sub- optimality upper-bound accounting for distinct constraint sets, their horizons and decay rates, that is tighter for short horizons than prior work. Second, to our knowledge, we give the first lower bound (beyond open-loop cost) on closed-loop sub-optimality. Together these bounds provide a powerful analysis framework, allowing designers to evaluate the effect of horizons in MPC sub-optimality. We demonstrate our results via simulations on nonlinear and linear safety-critical systems.</description>

      <title>Online Distributed Zeroth-Order Optimization With Non-Zero-Mean Adverse Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of online distributed zeroth-order optimization subject to a set constraint is studied via a multi-agent network, where each agent can communicate with its immediate neighbors via a time-varying directed graph. Different from the existing works on online distributed zeroth- order optimization, we consider the case where the estimate on the gradients are influenced by some non-zero-mean adverse noises. To handle this problem, we propose a new online dis- tributed zeroth-order mirror descent algorithm involving a kernel function-based estimator and a clipped strategy. Particularly, in the estimator, the kernel function-based strategy is provided to deal with the adverse noises, and eliminate the low-order terms in the Taylor expansions of the objective functions. Furthermore, the performance of the presented algorithm is measured by employing the dynamic regrets, where the offline benchmarks are to find the optimal point at each time. Under the mild assumptions on the graph and the objective functions, we prove that if the variation in the optimal point sequence grows at a certain rate, then the high probability bound of the dynamic regrets increases sublinearly. Finally, a simulation experiment is worked out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Reliability-Cost Optimization Framework for EV and DER Integration in Standard and Reconfigurable Distribution Network Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) adoption poses operational and economic challenges for power distribution systems, including increased line loading levels and network congestions. This may require potential infrastructure reinforcement and expansion. As a fast inexpensive alternative solution, network topology reconfiguration (NTR) offers a practical means to redistribute power flows, reduce operational costs, and defer infrastructure upgrades. This paper presents a linear programming framework to evaluate the impact of varying EV penetration on operational costs under four configurations: standard distribution network (SDN), SDN with NTR (SDNTR), SDN with distributed energy resources (SDN-DER), and SDNTR with DERs (SDNTR-DER). Numerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 33-bus system. The analysis demonstrates that integrating DERs reduces operational costs, while NTR further enhances system flexibility, enabling higher EV penetration levels without compromising feasibility. The combined SDNTR-DER approach offers the most cost-effective and reliable pathway for accommodating future EV growth while mitigating the need for immediate infrastructure upgrades.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of NOMA-Assisted Optical OFDM ISAC Systems with Clipping Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Due to their inherent high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), OFDM waveforms are clipped to fit the limited dynamic range of the optical transmitters (e.g., light-emitting diodes (LEDs)), resulting in clipping distortion. To alleviate the impact of the distortion, we propose a novel transmitter architecture where the clipping processes are performed before NOMA superposition coding. We then analyze the performance of the proposed optical ISAC systems considering the effects of power allocation and clipping distortion. For the communication subsystem, we analyze the effect of NOMA on the achievable sum rate and bit error rate (BER). For the sensing subsystem, the root mean square error (RMSE) and Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) of estimating the transmission distance accuracy are obtained. Simulation results reveal that allocating more power to the strong user yields a higher sum rate, lower BER, and better sensing performance, whereas a more balanced power allocation among users results in degraded BER and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Constrained Performance Boosting Control for Nonlinear Systems via ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Performance Boosting (ADMM-PB), an approach to design performance boosting controllers for stable or pre-stabilized nonlinear systems, while explicitly seeking input and state constraint satisfaction. Rooted on a recently proposed approach for designing neural-network controllers that guarantees closed-loop stability by design while minimizing generic cost functions, our strategy integrates it within an alternating direction method of multipliers routine to seek constraint handling without modifying the controller structure of the aforementioned seminal strategy. Our numerical results showcase the advantages of the proposed approach over a baseline penalizing constraint violation through barrier-like terms in the cost, indicating that ADMM-PB can lead to considerably lower constraint violations at the price of inducing slightly more cautious closed-loop behaviors.</description>

      <title>Explicit MPC for the constrained zonotope case with low-rank matrix updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem requires enumerating all critical regions and their associated feedback laws, a task that scales exponentially with the system dimension and the prediction horizon, as well. When the problem's constraints are boxes or zonotopes, the feasible domain admits a compact constrained-zonotope representation. Building on this insight, we exploit the geometric properties of the equivalent constrained-zonotope reformulation to accelerate the computation of the explicit solution. Specifically, we formulate the multi-parametric problem in the lifted generator space and solve it using second-order optimality conditions, employ low-rank matrix updates to reduce computation time, and introduce an analytic enumeration of candidate active sets that yields the explicit solution in tree form.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Voltage Control of AC Microgrids with Constant Power Loads using Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel nonlinear decentralized voltage controller for constrained regulation of meshed AC Microgrid networks with high penetration of constant power loads. Perceiving the load demand as an unknown disturbance, the network model is reformulated in a cascaded structure composed of a nominal, i.e. uncertainty-free, and an error subsystem. The latter captures the distance between the true and the nominal state trajectories, for which we prove boundedness via a suitable control barrier function. Under sufficient conditions, we prove asymptotic stability of the cascaded dynamics with respect to an equilibrium set and also provide an estimate of the region of attraction. In addition, it is rigorously shown that the proposed nonlinear control law also enforces constrained regulation around a rated voltage value, without the need of saturation devices. The operation of the closed-loop system is illustrated in a simulation scenario, demonstrating bounded operation and convergence to a neighbourhood of the desired reference vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control framework designed for Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), denoted as Generalized Swing Control (GSC). The proposed GSC framework generalizes the definition of Grid-Forming (GFM) control schemes and exploits the coupling between active and reactive power dynamics. To validate the proposed scheme, we conduct extensive time-domain simulations and small-signal analysis using a modified version of the WSCC 9-bus system and a 1479-bus dynamic model of the all-island Irish transmission system. The case studies focus on evaluating the dynamic performance of the proposed framework under different configurations, including Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM), coupled-VSM and dual-VSM schemes. To address the nonlinear nature of power system dynamics, sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo methods are employed to improve parameter tuning and assess the stability of GSC configurations in the studied systems.</description>

      <title>Using ensemble learning with hybrid graph neural networks and transformers to predict traffic in cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) still have a hard time accurately predicting traffic in cities, especially in big, multimodal settings with complicated spatiotemporal dynamics. This paper presents HybridST, a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), multi-head temporal Transformers, and supervised ensemble learning methods (XGBoost or Random Forest) to collectively capture spatial dependencies, long-range temporal patterns, and exogenous signals, including weather, calendar, or control states. We test our model on the METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and Seattle Loop tree public benchmark datasets. These datasets include situations ranging from freeway sensor networks to vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. Experimental results show that HybridST consistently beats classical baselines (LSTM, GCN, DCRNN, PDFormer) on important metrics like MAE and RMSE, while still being very scalable and easy to understand. The proposed framework presents a promising avenue for real-time urban mobility planning, energy optimization, and congestion alleviation strategies, especially within the framework of smart cities and significant events such as the 2030 FIFA World Cup.</description>

      <title>Coherency among Power System Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a novel general definition of coherency among power system devices of any type. The proposed approach is thus not limited to synchronous machines. With this aim, the paper shows that coherency can be formally based on the difference in the complex frequency of the current injections of any two devices electrically connected to the same grid. The proposed definition is model-agnostic, making it general and suitable for modern power systems composed of a heterogeneous mix of technologies. The paper also provides a systematic analytical procedure to study the properties that specific device models must satisfy to be coherent. Time-domain simulations are conducted in three case studies whose results illustrate the ability of our definition to evaluate coherency among any type of device.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Approach to Detect and Eliminate Flapping Phenomena due to Flexible Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized methodology for detecting and mitigating flapping phenomena in power systems, primarily caused by the operation of discrete devices. The proposed approach applies moving-window autocorrelation to local measurements, enabling each device to autonomously identify sustained oscillations. Upon detection, a probabilistic, device-specific mitigation strategy is executed. Flexible demand resources (DFRs), under-load tap changers (ULTCs), and automatic voltage regulators (AVRs) are utilised to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach to both discrete and continuous-operation devices. Results show that the proposed method is robust and properly distinguishes damped oscillations from persistent flapping, allowing devices to independently recognize problematic operating scenarios and implement corrective actions accordingly.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to many-vs-many missile guidance using virtual targets (VTs) generated by a Normalizing Flows-based trajectory predictor. Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets through conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a centralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing probabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is guided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse flight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal interception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as many-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n &gt; m) by distributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than pursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across various target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors) demonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line prediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to 5.8-14.4% when n &gt; m. The results confirm that probabilistic VTs enable effective exploitation of numerical superiority, significantly increasing interception probability in many-vs-many scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reliability entails input-selective contraction and regulation in excitable networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The animal nervous system offers a model of computation combining digital reliability and analog efficiency. Understanding how this sweet spot can be realized is a core question of neuromorphic engineering. To this aim, this paper explores the connection between reliability, contraction, and regulation in excitable systems. Using the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of excitable behavior as a proof-of-concept, it is shown that neuronal reliability can be formalized as an average trajectory contraction property induced by the input. In excitable networks, reliability is shown to enable regulation of the network to a robustly stable steady state. It is thus posited that regulation provides a notion of dynamical analog computation, and that stability makes such a computation model robust.</description>

      <title>Analytical Framework for Assessing Effective Regional Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel formulation of effective regional inertia that explicitly accounts for both system topology and the spatial distribution of inertia. Unlike traditional approaches that model a region as an aggregated machine with an equivalent inertia, the proposed metric provides a topology-aware representation. The methodology builds on an analytical framework that extends classical slow coherency theory to address network partitioning and regional frequency stability. Based on these partitions, we develop a systematic procedure to evaluate the effective inertia of each region, enabling a more accurate interpretation of local inertial contributions, including those from virtual inertia provided by inverter-based resources (IBRs). Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus systems demonstrate that the integration of inertial devices does not uniformly improve system frequency response, underscoring the importance of the proposed metric for effective regional inertia assessment.</description>

      <title>ISAC Empowered Air-Sea Collaborative System: A UAV-USV Joint Inspection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an air-sea collaborative system framework based on the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) techniques, where the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) jointly inspect targets of interest while keeping communication with each other simultaneously. First, we demonstrate the unique challenges encountered in this collaborative system, i.e., the coupling and heterogeneity of the UAV/USV's trajectories. Then, we formulate a total energy consumption minimization problem to jointly optimize the trajectories, flying and hovering times, target scheduling, and beamformers under the constraints of water currents, collision avoidance, and Sensing and Communication (S\&amp;C) requirements. To address the strong coupling of the variables, we divide the original problem into two subproblems, namely, the hover point selection and the joint trajectory planning and beamforming design. In the first subproblem, we propose a three-step hierarchical method including: (1) a virtual base station coverage (VBSC) and clustering algorithm to obtain the target scheduling and rough position of hover points; (2) a Bi-traveling salesman problem with neighborhood (Bi-TSPN)-based algorithm to determine the visiting order sequence of the hover points; (3) a hover point refinement and time allocation algorithm to further optimize the time allocation. In the latter subproblem, we complete the remaining trajectory planning and beamforming design in each flying and hovering stage by developing a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Finally, we conduct a series of simulations to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing sequential access and leader-follower strategies.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient Methods for Information-Theoretic Opacity in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opacity, or non-interference, is a property ensuring that an external observer cannot infer confidential information (the "secret") from system observations. We introduce an information-theoretic measure of opacity, which quantifies information leakage using the conditional entropy of the secret given the observer's partial observations in a system modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). Our objective is to find a control policy that maximizes opacity while satisfying task performance constraints, assuming that an informed observer is aware of the control policy and system dynamics. Specifically, we consider a class of opacity called state-based opacity, where the secret is a propositional formula about the past or current state of the system, and a special case of state-based opacity called language-based opacity, where the secret is defined by a temporal logic formula (LTL) or a regular language recognized by a finite-state automaton. First, we prove that finite-memory policies can outperform Markov policies in optimizing information-theoretic opacity. Second, we develop an algorithm to compute a maximally opaque Markov policy using a primal-dual gradient-based algorithm, and prove its convergence. Since opacity cannot be expressed as a cumulative cost, we develop a novel method to compute the gradient of conditional entropy with respect to policy parameters using observable operators in hidden Markov models. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and optimality of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Instabilities in Computer Network Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies two types of computer networking models. The primary focus is to understand the different dynamical phenomena observed in practice due to the presence of severe nonlinearities, delays and widely varying operating conditions. The first models considered are of senders running TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and traffic passing through RED (Random Early Detection) gateways. Building on earlier work, a first order nonlinear discrete-time model is developed for the interaction scenario between transport protocols like TCP and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and Active Queuing Management schemes like RED. It is shown that the dynamics resulting from the interaction with TCP is consistent with various dynamical behaviors and parameter sensitivities observed in practice. Using bifurcation-theoretic ideas it is shown that TCP-RED type networks may lose their stability through a period doubling bifurcation followed by border collision bifurcations. The nonlinear dependence of the throughput function of TCP-type flows on drop probability is found to be responsible for the period doubling bifurcation, whereas limited buffer space and lack of sufficient damping results in border collision bifurcations. A second class of models studied in this work deals with optimal rate control in networks and are based on the rate-control framework proposed by Kelly. Using the results on delay-differential equation stability, the stability and its lack thereof is studied through an underlying map which arises naturally in time delay systems. An invariance property of this map is used to prove delay-independent stability and to compute bounds on periodic oscillations.</description>

      <title>ABIDES-MARL: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Environment for Endogenous Price Formation and Execution in a Limit Order Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ABIDES-MARL, a framework that combines a new multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methodology with a new realistic limit-order-book (LOB) simulation system to study equilibrium behavior in complex financial market games. The system extends ABIDES-Gym by decoupling state collection from kernel interruption, enabling synchronized learning and decision-making for multiple adaptive agents while maintaining compatibility with standard RL libraries. It preserves key market features such as price-time priority and discrete tick sizes. Methodologically, we use MARL to approximate equilibrium-like behavior in multi-period trading games with a finite number of heterogeneous agents-an informed trader, a liquidity trader, noise traders, and competing market makers-all with individual price impacts. This setting bridges optimal execution and market microstructure by embedding the liquidity trader's optimization problem within a strategic trading environment. We validate the approach by solving an extended Kyle model within the simulation system, recovering the gradual price discovery phenomenon. We then extend the analysis to a liquidity trader's problem where market liquidity arises endogenously and show that, at equilibrium, execution strategies shape market-maker behavior and price dynamics. ABIDES-MARL provides a reproducible foundation for analyzing equilibrium and strategic adaptation in realistic markets and contributes toward building economically interpretable agentic AI systems for finance.</description>

      <title>Census-Based Population Autonomy For Distributed Robotic Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborating teams of robots show promise due in their ability to complete missions more efficiently and with improved robustness, attributes that are particularly useful for systems operating in marine environments. A key issue is how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the full benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of multi-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This paper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the principle of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for collective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior optimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component is expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective behavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model can be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization and control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors that are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new method for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where robots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost functions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states from neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group can collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the total global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in three categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface vehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario, and a competitive game of capture the flag.</description>

      <title>Near Optimal Convergence to Coarse Correlated Equilibrium in General-Sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: No-regret learning dynamics play a central role in game theory, enabling decentralized convergence to equilibrium for concepts such as Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) or Correlated Equilibrium (CE). In this work, we improve the convergence rate to CCE in general-sum Markov games, reducing it from the previously best-known rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log^5 T / T)$ to a sharper $\mathcal{O}(\log T / T)$. This matches the best known convergence rate for CE in terms of $T$, number of iterations, while also improving the dependence on the action set size from polynomial to polylogarithmic-yielding exponential gains in high-dimensional settings. Our approach builds on recent advances in adaptive step-size techniques for no-regret algorithms in normal-form games, and extends them to the Markovian setting via a stage-wise scheme that adjusts learning rates based on real-time feedback. We frame policy updates as an instance of Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL), customized for value-iteration-based learning. The resulting self-play algorithm achieves, to our knowledge, the fastest known convergence rate to CCE in Markov games.</description>

      <title>H-Infinity Filter Enhanced CNN-LSTM for Arrhythmia Detection from Heart Sound Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization. Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.</description>

      <title>A Kullback-Leibler divergence method for input-system-state identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence method is examined herein within the Kalman filter framework to select the input-parameter-state estimation execution with the most plausible results. This identification suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining different results from different initial parameter set guesses, and the examined approach uses the information gained from the data in going from the prior to the posterior distribution to address the issue. Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most plausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information applications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring.</description>

      <title>Natural-gas storage modelling by deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices. Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks. For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more often if a threshold is in place.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a discrete-event stochastic model for the redistribution of indistinguishable personal items, exemplified by socks, among multiple cohabitants sharing a communal laundry system. Drawing on concepts from ecological population dynamics, diffusion processes, and stochastic exchange theory, the model captures the probabilistic mechanisms underlying item mixing, recovery, and loss. Each cohabitant is represented as an autonomous agent whose belongings interact through iterative cycles of collective washing, sorting, and partial correction. The system's evolution is characterized by random mixing events, selective recollection, and attrition over time. Implemented using the SimPy discrete-event simulation framework, the model demonstrates that even minimal exchange probabilities can generate emergent asymmetries, quasi-equilibrium distributions, and long-term disorder. The findings illustrate how stochastic processes inherent to shared domestic systems can produce persistent imbalances, offering a quantitative perspective on an everyday social phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Feedback dynamics in Politics: The interplay between sentiment and engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate feedback mechanisms in political communication by testing whether politicians adapt the sentiment of their messages in response to public engagement. Using over 1.5 million tweets from Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom, Spain, and Greece during 2021, we identify sentiment dynamics through a simple yet interpretable linear model. The analysis reveals a closed-loop behavior: engagement with positive and negative messages influences the sentiment of subsequent posts. Moreover, the learned coefficients highlight systematic differences across political roles: opposition members are more reactive to negative engagement, whereas government officials respond more to positive signals. These results provide a quantitative, control-oriented view of behavioral adaptation in online politics, showing how feedback principles can explain the self-reinforcing dynamics that emerge in social media discourse.</description>

      <title>An unscented Kalman filter method for real time input-parameter-state estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The input-parameter-state estimation capabilities of a novel unscented Kalman filter is examined herein on both linear and nonlinear systems. The unknown input is estimated in two stages within each time step. Firstly, the predicted dynamic states and the system parameters provide an estimation of the input. Secondly, the corrected with measurements states and parameters provide a final estimation. Importantly, it is demonstrated using the perturbation analysis that, a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially be uniquely identified. This output-only methodology allows for a better understanding of the system compared to classical output-only parameter identification strategies, given that all the dynamic states, the parameters, and the input are estimated jointly and in real-time.</description>

      <title>Adjustable Low-Cost Highly Sensitive Microwave Oscillator Sensor for Liquid Level Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the implementation of a low-cost high-precision microwave oscillator sensor with an adjustable input resistance to enhance its limit of detection (LoD). To achieve this, we introduce a \textit{Z$_{2}$} branch in the input network, comprising a transmission line, a capacitor (\textit{C$_{B}$}) and a resistor (\textit{R$_{V}$}). The sensor is tested with eight different liquids with different dielectric constants, including water, IV fluid, milk, ethanol, acetone, petrol, olive oil, and Vaseline. By fine-tuning the \textit{Z$_{2}$} branch, a clear relationship is found between $\varepsilon_{r}$ of materials and R$_{V}$.Our experimental results demonstrate outstanding characteristics, including remarkable linearity (nonlinearity &lt; 2.44\%), high accuracy with an average sensitivity of 21 kHz/$\mu$m, and an excellent limit of detection (LoD &lt; 0.05 mm). The sensor also exhibits good stability across a range of liquid temperatures and shows robust and repeatable behavior. Considering the strong absorption of microwave energy in liquids with high dielectric constants, this oscillator sensor is a superior choice over capacitive sensors for such applications. We validate the performance of the oscillator sensor using water as a representative liquid. Additionally, we substantiate the sensor's improvement through both experimental results and theoretical analysis. Its advantages, including affordability, compatibility with CMOS and MEMS technologies, and ease of fabrication, make it an excellent choice for small-scale liquid detection applications.</description>

      <title>LLM-Supported Formal Knowledge Representation for Enhancing Control Engineering Content with an Interactive Semantic Layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering calls for new approaches to structure and formalize domain knowledge. This paper briefly describes an LLM-supported method for semi-automated generation of formal knowledge representations that combine human readability with machine interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an ``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for the control engineering domain.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-assisted Dynamics-Constrained Day-Ahead Energy Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TThe rapid expansion of inverter-based resources, such as wind and solar power plants, will significantly diminish the presence of conventional synchronous generators in fu-ture power grids with rich renewable energy sources. This transition introduces in-creased complexity and reduces dynamic stability in system operation and control, with low inertia being a widely recognized challenge. However, the literature has not thoroughly explored grid dynamic performance associated with energy scheduling so-lutions that traditionally only consider grid steady-state constraints. This paper will bridge the gap by enforcing grid dynamic constraints when conducting optimal energy scheduling; particularly, this paper explores locational post-contingency rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) requirements to accommodate substantial inertia reductions. This paper introduces a machine learning-assisted RoCoF-constrained unit commit-ment (ML-RCUC) model designed to ensure RoCoF stability after the most severe generator outage while maintaining operational efficiency. A graph-informed NN (GINN)-based RoCoF predictor is first trained on a high-fidelity simulation dataset to track the highest locational RoCoF, which is then reformulated as mixed-integer linear programming constraints that are integrated into the unit commitment model. Case studies, by solving the optimization problem ML-RCUC and validating its solutions with time-domain simulations, demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure loca-tional RoCoF stability with minimum conservativeness.</description>

      <title>Guided Bayesian Optimization: Data-Efficient Controller Tuning with Digital Twin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents the guided Bayesian optimization algorithm as an efficient data-driven method for iteratively tuning closed-loop controller parameters using an event-triggered digital twin of the system based on available closed-loop data. We define a controller tuning framework independent of the controller or the plant structure. Our proposed methodology is model-free, making it suitable for nonlinear and unmodelled plants with measurement noise. The objective function consists of performance metrics modeled by Gaussian processes. We utilize the available information in the closed-loop system to identify and progressively maintain a digital twin that guides the optimizer, improving the data efficiency of our method. Switching the digital twin on and off is triggered by data-driven criteria related to the digital twin's uncertainty estimations in the BO tuning framework. Effectively, it replaces much of the exploration of the real system with exploration performed on the digital twin. We analyze the properties of our method in simulation and demonstrate its performance on two real closed-loop systems with different plant and controller structures. The experimental results show that our method requires fewer experiments on the physical plant than Bayesian optimization to find the optimal controller parameters.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Control Nodes in Boolean Networks with Degree Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the minimum control node set problem for Boolean networks (BNs) with degree constraints. The main contribution is to derive the nontrivial lower and upper bounds on the size of the minimum control node set through combinatorial analysis of four types of BNs (i.e., $k$-$k$-XOR-BNs, simple $k$-$k$-AND-BNs, $k$-$k$-AND-BNs with negation and $k$-$k$-NC-BNs, where the $k$-$k$-AND-BN with negation is an extension of the simple $k$-$k$-AND-BN that considers the occurrence of negation and NC means nested canalyzing). More specifically, four bounds for the size of the minimum control node set: general lower bound, best case upper bound, worst case lower bound, and general upper bound are studied. By dividing nodes into three disjoint sets, extending the time to reach the target state, and utilizing necessary conditions for controllability, these bounds are obtained, and further meaningful results and phenomena are discovered. Notably, all of the above results involving the AND function also apply to the OR function.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Neural MPC under Uncontrollable Agents via Sequential Convex Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the challenge of ensuring safety guarantees under uncontrollable agents whose behaviors are stochastic and depend on both their own and the system's states. We present a neural model predictive control (MPC) framework that predicts the trajectory of the uncontrollable agent using a predictor learned from offline data. To provide probabilistic guarantees on prediction errors, we employ split conformal prediction to construct region-specific, time-dependent uncertainty bounds, which are integrated into the MPC formulation. To solve the resulting non-convex, discontinuous optimization problem, we propose a two-loop iterative sequential convex programming algorithm. The inner loop solves convexified subproblems with fixed error bounds, while the outer loop refines these bounds based on updated control sequences. We establish convergence guarantees under mild regularity conditions and demonstrate the optimality of the algorithm. We illustrate our method with an autonomous driving scenario involving interactive pedestrians. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior safety and efficiency compared to baseline methods, with success rates exceeding 99.5\% while maintaining higher average speeds in multi-pedestrian scenarios.</description>

      <title>A moving horizon estimator for aquifer thermal energy storages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aquifer thermal energy storages (ATES) represent groundwater saturated aquifers that store thermal energy in the form of heated or cooled groundwater. Combining two ATES, one can harness excess thermal energy from summer (heat) and winter (cold) to support the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) technology. In general, a dynamic operation of ATES throughout the year is beneficial to avoid using fossil fuel-based HVAC technology and maximize the ``green use'' of ATES. Model predictive control (MPC) with an appropriate system model may become a crucial control approach for ATES systems. Consequently, the MPC model should reflect spatial temperature profiles around ATES' boreholes to predict extracted groundwater temperatures accurately. However, meaningful predictions require the estimation of the current state of the system, as measurements are usually only at the borehole of the ATES. In control, this is often realized by model-based observers. Still, observing the state of an ATES system is non-trivial, since the model is typically hybrid. We show how to exploit the specific structure of the hybrid ATES model and design an easy-to-solve moving horizon estimator based on a quadratic program.</description>

      <title>Joint Scheduling of DER under Demand Charges: Structure and Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the joint scheduling of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs), including flexible loads, renewable generation, and battery energy storage systems, under net energy metering tariffs with demand charges. The problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program aimed at maximizing expected operational surplus while accounting for renewable generation uncertainty. We analytically characterize the optimal control policy and show that it admits a threshold-based structure. However, due to the strong temporal coupling of the storage and demand charge constraints, the number of conditional branches in the policy scales combinatorially with the scheduling horizon, as it requires a look-ahead over future states. To overcome the high computational complexity in the general formulation, an efficient approximation algorithm is proposed, which searches for the peak demand under a mildly relaxed problem. We show that the algorithm scales linearly with the scheduling horizon. Extensive simulations using two open-source datasets validate the proposed algorithm and compare its performance against different DER control strategies, including a reinforcement learning-based one. Under varying storage and tariff parameters, the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms various benchmarks in achieving a relatively small solution gap compared to a theoretical upper bound.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems are viewed as the most complicated systems with continuous and event-based behaviors. Since traditional controllers cannot handle these systems, some newly-developed controllers have been published in recent decades to deal with them. This paper presents a novel implementable constrained final-state controller based on partitioning the system's state-space, computational simulations, and graph theory. Experimental results and a comparison with Model Predictive Controller on the three tank benchmark and swing-up control of a pendulum show the effectiveness of the proposed Computational Hybrid Controller(CHC).</description>

      <title>Expertise and confidence explain how social influence evolves along intellective tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.07168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering the antecedents of individuals' influence in collaborative environments is an important, practical, and challenging problem. In this paper, we study interpersonal influence in small groups of individuals who collectively execute a sequence of intellective tasks. We observe that along an issue sequence with feedback, individuals with higher expertise and social confidence are accorded higher interpersonal influence. We also observe that low-performing individuals tend to underestimate their high-performing teammate's expertise. Based on these observations, we introduce three hypotheses and present empirical and theoretical support for their validity. We report empirical evidence on longstanding theories of transactive memory systems, social comparison, and confidence heuristics on the origins of social influence. We propose a cognitive dynamical model inspired by these theories to describe the process by which individuals adjust interpersonal influences over time. We demonstrate the model's accuracy in predicting individuals' influence and provide analytical results on its asymptotic behavior for the case with identically performing individuals. Lastly, we propose a novel approach using deep neural networks on a pre-trained text embedding model for predicting the influence of individuals. Using message contents, message times, and individual correctness collected during tasks, we are able to accurately predict individuals' self-reported influence over time. Extensive experiments verify the accuracy of the proposed models compared to baselines such as structural balance and reflected appraisal model. While the neural networks model is the most accurate, the dynamical model is the most interpretable for influence prediction.</description>

      <title>Constrained Optimal Fuel Consumption of HEVs under Observational Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our prior work, we investigated the minimum fuel consumption of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) under a state-of-charge (SOC) balance constraint, assuming perfect SOC measurements and accurate reference speed profiles. The constrained optimal fuel consumption (COFC) problem was addressed using a constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) framework. However, in real-world scenarios, SOC readings are often corrupted by sensor noise, and reference speeds may deviate from actual driving conditions. To account for these imperfections, this study reformulates the COFC problem by explicitly incorporating observational noise in both SOC and reference speed. We adopt a robust CRL approach, where the noise is modeled as a uniform distribution, and employ a structured training procedure to ensure stability. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations on the Toyota Prius hybrid system (THS), using both the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). Results show that fuel consumption and SOC constraint satisfaction remain robust across varying noise levels. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that observational noise in SOC and speed can impact fuel consumption to different extents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly examine how observational noise -- commonly encountered in dynamometer testing and predictive energy control (PEC) applications -- affects constrained optimal fuel consumption in HEVs.</description>

Abstract: Conventional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are designed for stationary environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more accurately modeled as being non-stationary. In this work, piecewise stationary MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection have been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of such Detection Augmented Bandit (DAB) procedures. To this end, we first provide novel, improved performance lower bounds for PS-MABs. Then, we identify the requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a DAB procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of the change-points, we show that the analysis of DAB procedures can indeed be modularized, so that the regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this analysis, we develop new modular DAB procedures that are order-optimal. Finally, we showcase the practical effectiveness of our modular DAB approach in our experiments, studying its regret performance compared to other methods and investigating its detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Planning with Contextual Lexicographic Reward Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents are often required to plan under multiple objectives whose preference ordering varies based on context. The agent may encounter multiple contexts during its course of operation, each imposing a distinct lexicographic ordering over the objectives, with potentially different reward functions associated with each context. Existing approaches to multi-objective planning typically consider a single preference ordering over the objectives, across the state space, and do not support planning under multiple objective orderings within an environment. We present Contextual Lexicographic Markov Decision Process (CLMDP), a framework that enables planning under varying lexicographic objective orderings, depending on the context. In a CLMDP, both the objective ordering at a state and the associated reward functions are determined by the context. We employ a Bayesian approach to infer a state-context mapping from expert trajectories. Our algorithm to solve a CLMDP first computes a policy for each objective ordering and then combines them into a single context-aware policy that is valid and cycle-free. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in simulation and using a mobile robot.</description>

      <title>Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction of aerial vehicles is a key requirement in applications ranging from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. While most prediction methods assume deterministic target motion, real-world targets often exhibit stochastic behaviors such as evasive maneuvers or random gliding patterns. This paper introduces a probabilistic framework based on Conditional Normalizing Flows (CNFs) to model and predict such stochastic dynamics directly from trajectory data. The learned model generates probability distributions of future target positions conditioned on initial states and dynamic parameters, enabling efficient sampling and exact density evaluation. To provide deterministic surrogates compatible with existing guidance and planning algorithms, sampled trajectories are clustered using a time series k-means approach, yielding a set of representative "virtual target" trajectories. The method is target-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only trajectory data for training, making it suitable as a drop-in replacement for deterministic predictors. Simulated scenarios with maneuvering and ballistic targets demonstrate that the proposed approach bridges the gap between deterministic assumptions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Aided Kalman Filtering with Model Predictive Control Enables Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering a drone on a disturbed water surface remains a significant challenge in maritime robotics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for robot-assisted drone recovery on a wavy surface that addresses two major tasks: Firstly, accurate prediction of a moving drone's position under wave-induced disturbances using KalmanNet Plus Plus (KalmanNet++), a Neural Network Aided Kalman Filtering we proposed. Secondly, effective motion planning using the desired position we got for a manipulator via Receding Horizon Model Predictive Control (RHMPC). Specifically, we compared multiple prediction methods and proposed KalmanNet Plus Plus to predict the position of the UAV, thereby obtaining the desired position. The KalmanNet++ predicts the drone's future position 0.1\,s ahead, while the manipulator plans a capture trajectory in real time, thus overcoming not only wave-induced base motions but also limited constraints such as torque constraints and joint constraints. For the system design, we provide a collaborative system, comprising a manipulator subsystem and a UAV subsystem, enables drone lifting and drone recovery. Simulation and real-world experiments using wave-disturbed motion data demonstrate that our approach achieves a high success rate - above 95\% and outperforms conventional baseline methods by up to 10\% in efficiency and 20\% in precision. The results underscore the feasibility and robustness of our system, which achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers a practical solution for maritime drone operations.</description>

      <title>The Difference between the Left and Right Invariant Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state estimation problems over the past sixty years. The Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) is a recent development of the EKF for the class of group-affine systems on Lie groups that has shown superior performance for inertial navigation problems. The IEKF comes in two versions, left- and right- handed respectively, and there is a perception in the robotics community that these filters are different and one should choose the handedness of the IEKF to match handedness of the measurement model for a given filtering problem. In this paper, we revisit these algorithms and demonstrate that the left- and right- IEKF algorithms (with reset step) are identical, that is, the choice of the handedness does not affect the IEKF's performance when the reset step is properly implemented. The reset step was not originally proposed as part of the IEKF, however, we provide simulations to show that the reset step improves asymptotic performance of all versions of the the filter, and should be included in all high performance algorithms. The GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (INS) is used as a motivating example to demonstrate the equivalence of the two filters.</description>

      <title>Action Chunking and Exploratory Data Collection Yield Exponential Improvements in Behavior Cloning for Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two of the most impactful interventions in modern learning from demonstration in robotics and continuous control: the practice of action-chunking (predicting sequences of actions in open-loop) and exploratory augmentation of expert demonstrations. Though recent results show that learning from demonstration, also known as imitation learning (IL), can suffer errors that compound exponentially with task horizon in continuous settings, we demonstrate that action chunking and exploratory data collection circumvent exponential compounding errors in different regimes. Our results identify control-theoretic stability as the key mechanism underlying the benefits of these interventions. On the empirical side, we validate our predictions and the role of control-theoretic stability through experimentation on popular robot learning benchmarks. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the control-theoretic lens provides fine-grained insights into how compounding error arises, leading to tighter statistical guarantees on imitation learning error when these interventions are applied than previous techniques based on information-theoretic considerations alone.</description>

      <title>Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</description>

      <title>Drift Plus Optimistic Penalty: A Learning Framework for Stochastic Network Optimization with Improved Regret Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint routing and scheduling in queueing networks, where the edge transmission costs are unknown. At each time-slot, the network controller receives noisy observations of transmission costs only for those edges it selects for transmission. The network controller's objective is to make routing and scheduling decisions so that the total expected cost is minimized. This problem exhibits an exploration-exploitation trade-off, however, previous bandit-style solutions cannot be directly applied to this problem due to the queueing dynamics. In order to ensure network stability, the network controller needs to optimize throughput and cost simultaneously. We show that the best achievable cost is lower bounded by the solution to a static optimization problem, and develop a network control policy using techniques from Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization and multi-arm bandits. We show that the policy achieves a sub-linear regret of order $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$, as compared to the best policy that has complete knowledge of arrivals and costs. Finally, we evaluate the proposed policy using simulations and show that its regret is indeed sub-linear.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Mapping of the Douro River Plume with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.</description>
