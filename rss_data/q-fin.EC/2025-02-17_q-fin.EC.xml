      <title>Quality thinning and value development of boreal trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, quality distribution of trees is introduced in a tree growth model. Consequently, the effects of quality thinning on stand development can be investigated. Quality thinning improves the financial return in all cases studied, but the effect is small. Rotation ages, timber stocks and maturity diameters are not much affected by quality thinning. Bare land valuation neither changes the contribution of the quality thinning. The reason for the small effect apparently lies in the value development of individual trees. The relative value development of small pulpwood trunks is large, since the harvesting expense per volume unit is reduced along with size increment. Such trees are not feasible objects for quality thinning, unless quality correlates with growth rate. Another enhanced stage of value development is when pulpwood trunks turn to sawlog trunks. For large pulpwood trunks, quality thinning is feasible. Existing sawlog content in trees dilutes the effect of quality thinning on the financial return. The results change if the growth rate is positively correlated with quality, quality thinning becoming feasible in all commercial diameter classes.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT and Deepseek: Can They Predict the Stock Market and Macroeconomy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether ChatGPT and DeepSeek can extract information from the Wall Street Journal to predict the stock market and the macroeconomy. We find that ChatGPT has predictive power. DeepSeek underperforms ChatGPT, which is trained more extensively in English. Other large language models also underperform. Consistent with financial theories, the predictability is driven by investors' underreaction to positive news, especially during periods of economic downturn and high information uncertainty. Negative news correlates with returns but lacks predictive value. At present, ChatGPT appears to be the only model capable of capturing economic news that links to the market risk premium.</description>

      <title>What are Asset Price Bubbles? A Survey on Definitions of Financial Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial bubbles and crashes have repeatedly caused economic turmoil notably but not only during the 2008 financial crisis. However, both in the popular press as well as scientific publications, the meaning of bubble is sometimes unspecified. Due to the multitude of bubble definitions, we conduct a systematic review with the following questions: What definitions of asset price bubbles exist in the literature? Which definitions are used in which disciplines and how frequently? We develop a system of definition categories and categorize a total of 122 papers from eleven research areas. Our results show that although one definition is indeed prevalent in the literature, the overall definition landscape is not uniform. Next to the mostly used definition as deviation from a present value of expected future cash flows, we identify several other definitions, which rely on price properties or other specifications of a fundamental value. This research contributes by shedding light on the possible variations in which bubbles are defined and operationalized.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity in Sectoral Production and the Macro Effect of Sectoral Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of a negative sectoral shock on GDP depends on how important the shocked sector is as a direct and indirect supplier and how easily sectors can substitute inputs. Past estimates of the parameters that determine these qualities in the US have been restrictive: they have not been allowed to vary across industries or across time. This paper uses a novel empirical strategy to relax those restrictions, by exploiting variation in input expenditure share shifts within industries rather than across industries. The resulting estimates exhibit significant sectoral and temporal heterogeneity, and are dynamically correlated with weighted patents. In a calibrated GE model of multi-sector production, this heterogeneity (1) raises[lowers] the GDP effect of negative shocks to sectors whose customers are less[more] able to substitute inputs (e.g. the GDP effect of "Chemical products" shocks rises), (2) raises[lowers] the GDP effect of negative sectoral shocks in years where sectors are less[more] able to substitute inputs, and (3) raises[lowers] the GDP effect of negative shocks to sectors as they become more[less] central input suppliers (e.g. between 1997 and 2023 the GDP effect of "Paper products" shocks fell and the GDP effect of "Computer and electronic products" shocks rose due to changes in their importance as input suppliers).</description>

      <title>Package Bids in Combinatorial Electricity Auctions: Selection, Welfare Losses, and Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in combinatorial auctions is designing bid formats that accurately capture agents' preferences while remaining computationally feasible. This is especially true for electricity auctions, where complex preferences complicate straightforward solutions. In this context, we examine the XOR package bid, the default choice in combinatorial auctions and adopted in European day-ahead and intraday auctions under the name ``exclusive group of block bids''. Unlike parametric bid formats often employed in US power auctions, XOR package bids are technology-agnostic, making them particularly suitable for emerging demand-side participants. However, the challenge with package bids is that auctioneers must limit their number to maintain computational feasibility. As a result, agents are constrained in expressing their preferences, potentially lowering their surplus and reducing overall welfare. To address this issue, we propose decision support algorithms that optimize package bid selection, evaluate welfare losses resulting from bid limitations, and explore alternative bid formats. Our findings offer actionable insights for both auctioneers and bidders.</description>
