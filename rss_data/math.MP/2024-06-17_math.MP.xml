      <title>Mc'Kean's transformation for 3-rd order operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a non-self-adjoint third order operator $(y''+py)'+py'+qy$ with 1-periodic coefficients $p,q$. This operator is the L-operator in the Lax pair for the good Boussinesq equation on the circle. In 1981, McKean introduced a transformation that reduces the spectral problem for this operator to a spectral problem for the Hill operator with a potential that depends analytically on the energy. In the present paper we are studying this transformation.</description>

      <title>An infinite-rank Lie algebra associated to SL$(2,\mathbb R)$ and SL$(2,\mathbb R)/U(1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a generalised notion of Kac-Moody algebras using smooth maps from the non-compact manifolds ${\cal M}=$SL$(2,\mathbb R)$ and ${\cal M}=$ SL$(2,\mathbb R)/U(1)$ to a finite-dimensional simple Lie group $G$. This construction is achieved through two equivalent ways: by means of the Plancherel Theorem and by identifying a Hilbert basis within $L^2(\mathcal{M})$. We analyse the existence of central extensions and identify those in duality with Hermitean operators on $\cal M$. By inspecting the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$, we derive the Lie brackets characterising the corresponding generalised Kac-Moody algebras. The root structure of these algebras is identified, and it is shown that an infinite number of simultaneously commuting operators can be defined. Furthermore, we briefly touch upon applications of these algebras within the realm of supergravity, particularly in scenarios where the scalar fields coordinatize the non-compact manifold $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})/U(1)$.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of periodic orbits in the 3D secular planetary 3-Body problem: an approach through an integrable Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze, through a geometric description, the sequence of bifurcations of periodic orbits in a Hamiltonian model derived from the normalization of the secular 3D planetary three body problem. Stemming from the results in (Mastroianni &amp; Efthymiopoulos 2023) we analyze the phase space of the corresponding integrable approximation. In particular, we propose a normal form leading to an integrable Hamiltonian whose sequence of bifurcations is qualitatively the same as that in the complete system. Using as representation of the phase space the 3D-sphere in the Hopf variables space, we geometrically analyze phase-space dynamics through the sequence of bifurcations leading to the appearance of fixed points of the secular Hamiltonian flow, i.e., periodic orbits in the complete system. Moreover, through a semi-analytical method, we find the critical values of the second integral giving rise to pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations characterising the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interpolating gauge-fixing for Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory in D=3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory in three-dimensional Minkowski space-time is studied in a gauge-fixing scheme which interpolates between the covariant gauge and light-cone gauge, the interpolating gauge-fixing. The ultraviolet finiteness of the theory is proved via the Becchi-Rouet-Stora (BRS) algebraic renormalization procedure, which allows us to demonstrate the vanishing of all $\beta$-functions and all anomalous dimensions to all orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Anomalies for conformal nets associated with lattices and $T$-kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ an even lattice and $T_{L}=\mathbb{R}^{n}/L$ the associated torus. Associated with $L$ we construct $T_{L}$--kernel on a hyperfinite factor type $\mathcal{A}_{L}$, i.e. a monomorphism $T_{L}\to\mathsf{Out}(\mathcal{A}_{L})$, and compute Sutherland's obstruction class in $H^{3}_{\mathrm{Borel}}(T_{L},\mathbb{T})\cong H^{4}(BT_{L} ,\mathbb{Z})$, which is an invariant of the $T_{L}$--kernel and an obstruction to the existence of a twisted crossed product by $T_{L}$. As a Corollary, we obtain that for any $n$-torus $T$ any class in $H^{3}_{\mathrm{Borel}}(T,\mathbb{T})$ arises as an obstruction for a $T$-kernel on the hyperfinite type III${}_{1}$ factor $R$. The construction is an analogue of the construction of Vaughan Jones for finite groups on the hyperfinite type II${}_{1}$ factor but is also motivated by and has applications to conformal nets. Namely, there is an associated local extension $\mathcal{A}_{L}\supseteq \mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{R}^n}$ of conformal nets and the $T_{L}$--kernel corresponds to a family of $T_{L^\ast}$--twisted sectors representations whose anomaly (obstruction) can be identified with the inner product on $L$ seen as a class in $H^{4}(BT_{L},\mathbb{Z})\cong \operatorname{Sym}^{2}(L,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>On Bourgain's approach to stochastic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2018, Bourgain pioneered a novel perturbative harmonic-analytic approach to the stochastic homogenization theory of discrete elliptic equations with weakly random i.i.d. coefficients. The approach was subsequently refined to show that homogenized approximations of ensemble averages can be derived to a precision four times better than almost sure homogenized approximations, which was unexpected by the state-of-the-art homogenization theory. In this paper, we grow this budding theory in various directions: First, we prove that the approach is robust by extending it to the continuum setting with exponentially mixing random coefficients. Second, we give a new proof via Malliavin calculus in the case of Gaussian coefficients, which avoids the main technicality of Bourgain's original approach. This new proof also applies to strong Gaussian correlations with power-law decay. Third, we extend Bourgain's approach to the study of fluctuations by constructing weak correctors up to order $2d$, which also clarifies the link between Bourgain's approach and the standard corrector approach to homogenization. Finally, we draw several consequences from those different results, both for quantitative homogenization of ensemble averages and for asymptotic expansions of the annealed Green's function.</description>

      <title>Convergence of splitting methods on rotating grids for the magnetized Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-Lagrangian solvers for the Vlasov system offer noiseless solutions compared to Lagrangian particle methods and can handle larger time steps compared to Eulerian methods. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the interpolation steps, it is common to use a directional splitting. However, this typically yields the wrong angular velocity. In this paper, we analyze a semi-Lagrangian method that treats the $v \times B$ term with a rotational grid and combines this with a directional splitting for the remaining terms. We analyze the convergence properties of the scheme both analytically and numerically. The favorable numerical properties of the rotating grid solution are demonstrated for the case of ion Bernstein waves.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian expander obtained with Haar distributed unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a random quantum channel obtained by taking a selection of $d$ independent and Haar distributed $N$ dimensional unitaries. We follow the argument of Hastings to bound the spectral gap in terms of eigenvalues and adapt it to give an exact estimate of the spectral gap in terms of singular values \cite{hastings2007random,harrow2007quantum}. This shows that we have constructed a random quantum expander in terms of both singular values and eigenvalues. The lower bound is an analog of the Alon-Boppana bound for $d$-regular graphs. The upper bound is obtained using Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <title>Schottky-Kronecker forms and hyperelliptic polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elliptic polylogarithms can be defined as iterated integrals on a genus-one Riemann surface of a set of integration kernels whose generating series was already considered by Kronecker in the 19th century. In this article, we employ the Schottky parametrization of a Riemann surface to construct higher-genus analogues of Kronecker's generating series, which we refer to as Schottky-Kronecker forms. Our explicit construction generalizes ideas from Bernard's higher-genus construction of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection. Integration kernels generated from the Schottky-Kronecker forms are defined as Poincar\'e series. Under technical assumptions, related to the convergence of these Poincar\'e series on the underlying Riemann surface, we argue that these integration kernels coincide with a set of differentials defined by Enriquez, whose iterated integrals constitute higher-genus analogues of polylogarithms. Enriquez' original definition is not well-suited for numerical evaluation of higher-genus polylogarithms. In contrast, the Poincar\'e series defining our integration kernels can be evaluated numerically for real hyperelliptic curves, for which the above-mentioned convergence assumptions can be verified. We numerically evaluate several examples of genus-two polylogarithms, thereby paving the way for numerical evaluation of hyperelliptic analogues of polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>On Twisted Spacetimes: a new class of Galilean cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the generalized Newton-Cartan theory, Galilean Twisted spacetimes are introduced as dual models of the well-known relativistic twisted spacetimes. As a natural generalization, torqued vector fields in Galilean spacetimes are defined, showing that the local structure of a Galilean spacetime admitting a timelike torqued vector field is given by a Twisted spacetime. In addition, several results assuring the global splitting as Twisted spacetime are obtained. On the other hand, completeness of free falling observers is studied, as well as general geodesic completeness.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy bounds for pure states of rapid decorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For pure states of multi-dimensional quantum lattice systems, which in a convenient computational basis have amplitude and phase structure of sufficiently rapid decorrelation, we construct high fidelity approximations of relatively low complexity. These are used for a conditional proof of area-law bounds for the states' entanglement entropy. The condition is also shown to imply exponential decay of the state's mutual information between disjoint regions, and hence exponential clustering of local observables. The applicability of the general results is demonstrated on the quantum Ising model in transverse field. Combined with available model-specific information on spin-spin correlations, we establish an area-law type bound on the entanglement in the model's subcritical ground states, valid in all dimensions and up to the model's quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product unitaries: Beyond quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.</description>

      <title>Causal evolution of probability measures and continuity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the notion of a causal time-evolution of a conserved nonlocal physical quantity in a globally hyperbolic spacetime $\mathcal{M}$. The role of the `global time' is played by a chosen Cauchy temporal function $\mathcal{T}$, whereas the instantaneous configurations of the nonlocal quantity are modeled by probability measures $\mu_t$ supported on the corresponding time slices $\mathcal{T}^{-1}(t)$. We show that the causality of such an evolution can be expressed in three equivalent ways: (i) via the causal precedence relation $\preceq$ extended to probability measures, (ii) with the help of a probability measure $\sigma$ on the space of future-directed continuous causal curves endowed with the compact-open topology and (iii) through a causal vector field $X$ of $L^\infty_{\textrm{loc}}$-regularity, with which the map $t \mapsto \mu_t$ satisfies the continuity equation in the distributional sense. In the course of the proof we find that the compact-open topology is sensitive to the differential properties of the causal curves, being equal to the topology induced from a suitable $H^1_{\textrm{loc}}$-Sobolev space. This enables us to construct $X$ as a vector field in a sense `tangent' to $\sigma$. In addition, we discuss the general covariance of descriptions (i)-(iii), unraveling the geometrical, observer-independent notions behind them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theory of partial separability for classical Hamiltonian systems is proposed in the context of Haantjes geometry.
  As a general result, we show that the knowledge of a non-semisimple symplectic-Haantjes manifold for a given Hamiltonian system is sufficient to construct sets of coordinates (called Darboux-Haantjes coordinates) which allow both the partial separability of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equations and the block-diagonalization of the operators of the corresponding Haantjes algebra.
  We also introduce a novel class of Hamiltonian systems, characterized by the existence of a generalized St\"ackel matrix, which by construction are partially separable. They widely generalize the known families of partially separable Hamiltonian systems. Our systems can be described in terms of semisimple but non-maximal-rank symplectic-Haantjes manifolds.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic loops in the loop O(n) model via the XOR trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.11977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The loop $O(n)$ model is a family of probability measures on collections of non-intersecting loops on the hexagonal lattice, parameterized by a loop-weight $n$ and an edge-weight $x$. Nienhuis predicts that, for $0 \leq n \leq 2$, the model exhibits two regimes separated by $x_c(n) = 1/\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2-n}}$: when $x &lt; x_c(n)$, the loop lengths have exponential tails, while, when $x \geq x_c(n)$, the loops are macroscopic.
  In this paper, we prove three results regarding the existence of long loops in the loop $O(n)$ model:
  - In the regime $(n,x) \in [1,1+\delta) \times (1- \delta, 1]$ with $\delta &gt;0$ small, a configuration sampled from a translation-invariant Gibbs measure will either contain an infinite path or have infinitely many loops surrounding every face. In the subregime $n \in [1,1+\delta)$ and $x \in (1-\delta,1/\sqrt{n}]$ our results further imply Russo--Seymour--Welsh theory. This is the first proof of the existence of macroscopic loops in a positive area subset of the phase diagram.
  - Existence of loops whose diameter is comparable to that of a finite domain whenever $n=1, x \in (1,\sqrt{3}]$; this regime is equivalent to part of the antiferromagnetic regime of the Ising model on the triangular lattice.
  - Existence of non-contractible loops on a torus when $n \in [1,2], x=1$.
  The main ingredients of the proof are: (i) the `XOR trick': if $\omega$ is a collection of short loops and $\Gamma$ is a long loop, then the symmetric difference of $\omega$ and $\Gamma$ necessarily includes a long loop as well; (ii) a reduction of the problem of finding long loops to proving that a percolation process on an auxiliary planar graph, built using the Chayes--Machta and Edwards--Sokal geometric expansions, has no infinite connected components; and (iii) a recent result on the percolation threshold of Benjamini--Schramm limits of planar graphs.</description>

      <title>The Lagrange-D'Alembert Principle from the Viewpoint of ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01675v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the Lagrange-D'Alembert Principle as a pure mathematical theory that meets the modern standards of rigor. We note several new aspects of the Lagrange-D'Alembert principle but the article is mainly methodological by its substance. The article is addressed to specialists in ODE who are not experts in theoretical mechanics and to graduate students that specialize in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Algebra of Nonlocal Boxes and the Collapse of Communication Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication complexity quantifies how difficult it is for two distant computers to evaluate a function f(X,Y), where the strings X and Y are distributed to the first and second computer respectively, under the constraint of exchanging as few bits as possible. Surprisingly, some nonlocal boxes, which are resources shared by the two computers, are so powerful that they allow to collapse communication complexity, in the sense that any Boolean function f can be correctly estimated with the exchange of only one bit of communication. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box is an example of such a collapsing resource, but a comprehensive description of the set of collapsing nonlocal boxes remains elusive.
  In this work, we carry out an algebraic study of the structure of wirings connecting nonlocal boxes, thus defining the notion of the "product of boxes" $P\boxtimes Q$, and we show related associativity and commutativity results. This gives rise to the notion of the "orbit of a box", unveiling surprising geometrical properties about the alignment and parallelism of distilled boxes. The power of this new framework is that it allows us to prove previously-reported numerical observations concerning the best way to wire consecutive boxes, and to numerically and analytically recover recently-identified noisy PR boxes that collapse communication complexity for different types of noise models.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a birational representation of an extended affine Weyl group of $(A_{2N}\rtimes A_1)^{(1)}$-type, which gives a higher-order generalization of an $A_4^{(1)}$-surface type $q$-Painlev\'e equation, was obtained. In this paper, we extend it to a birational representation of an extended affine Weyl group of $(A_{2N}\rtimes A_1)^{(1)}\times A_1^{(1)}$-type. Moreover, we provide conjectures on periodic reductions from systems of P$\Delta$Es with the CAC property to Painlev\'e type $q$-O$\Delta$Es.</description>

      <title>Dual-Unitary Classical Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical shadow tomography scheme based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits termed "dual-unitary shadow tomography" (DUST). For this we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. We first show that dual-unitaries must have a minimal amount of entropy production. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$, and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, we demonstrate that the fast-thermalizing properties of dual-unitary circuits make them better at predicting large operators than shallow brick-wall Clifford circuits. Our results are robust to finite-size effects due to the chirality of dual-unitary brick-wall circuits.</description>

      <title>Disorder Chaos in Short-Range, Diluted, and L\'evy Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough [arXiv:2301.04112], Chatterjee proved site disorder chaos in the Edwards-Anderson (EA) short-range spin glass model utilizing the Hermite spectral method. In this paper, we demonstrate the further usefulness of this Hermite spectral approach by extending the validity of site disorder chaos in three related spin glass models.
  The first, called the mixed even $p$-spin short-range model, is a generalization of the EA model where the underlying graph is a deterministic bounded degree hypergraph consisting of hyperedges with even number of vertices. The second model is the diluted mixed $p$-spin model, which is allowed to have hyperedges with both odd and even number of vertices. For both models, our results hold under general symmetric disorder distributions. The main novelty of our argument is played by an elementary algebraic equation for the Fourier-Hermite series coefficients for the two-spin correlation functions. It allows us to deduce necessary geometric conditions to determine the contributing coefficients in the overlap function, which in spirit is the same as the crucial Lemma 1 in [arXiv:2301.04112]. Finally, we also establish disorder chaos in the L\'evy model with stable index $\alpha \in (1, 2)$.</description>

      <title>Complex Scaling Method applied to the study of the Swanson Hamiltonian in the broken PT-symmetry phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the non-PT symmetry phase of the Swanson Hamiltonian in the framework of the Complex Scaling Method. By constructing a bi-orthogonality relation, we apply the formalism of the response function to analyse the time evolution of different initial wave packages. The Wigner Functions and mean value of operators are evaluated as a function of time. We analyse in detail the time evolution in the neighbourhood of Exceptional Points. We derive a continuity equation for the system. We compare the results obtained using the Complex Scaling Method to the ones obtained by working in a Rigged Hilbert Space.</description>

      <title>On fusing matrices associated with conformal boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look at the fusing matrices that arise when a topological defect is attached to a conformal boundary condition. We call such junctions open topological defects. One type of fusing matrices arises when two open defects fuse while another arises when an open defect passes through a boundary operator. We use the topological field theory approach to RCFTs based on Frobenius algebra objects in modular tensor categories to describe the general structure associated with such matrices and how to compute them from a given Frobenius algebra object and its representation theory. We illustrate the computational process on the rational free boson theories. Applications to boundary renormalisation group flows are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Higher Gauge Theory and Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of integrable systems from a gauge theoretic perspective. This development originated with the introduction of $4$d Chern-Simons theory with defects, which provided a systematic framework for constructing two-dimensional integrable systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach to studying higher-dimensional integrable models employing techniques from higher category theory. Starting with higher Chern-Simons theory on the $4$-manifold $\mathbb{R}\times Y$, we complexify and compactify the real line to $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and introduce the disorder defect $\omega=z^{-1}\mathrm{d} z $. This procedure defines a holomorphic five-dimensional variant of higher Chern-Simons theory, which, when endowed with suitable boundary conditions, allows for the localisation to a three-dimensional theory on $Y$. The equations of motion of the resulting model are equivalent to the flatness of a $2$-connection $(L,H)$, that we then use to construct the corresponding higher holonomies. We prove that these are invariants of homotopies relative boundary, which enables the construction of conserved quantities. The latter are labelled by both the categorical characters of a Lie crossed-module and the infinite number of homotopy classes of surfaces relative boundary in $Y$. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the $3$d theory has left and right acting symmetries whose current algebra is given by an infinite dimensional centrally extended affine Lie 2-algebra. Both of these conditions are direct higher homotopy analogues of the properties satisfied by the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten CFT, which we therefore interpret as facets of integrable structures.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time estimates on the size of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of classical Brownian particles interacting via a smooth long-range potential in the mean-field regime, and we analyze the propagation of chaos in form of sharp, uniform-in-time estimates on many-particle correlation functions. Our results cover both the kinetic Langevin setting and the corresponding overdamped Brownian dynamics. The approach is mainly based on so-called Lions expansions, which we combine with new diagrammatic tools to capture many-particle cancellations, as well as with fine ergodic estimates on the linearized mean-field equation, and with discrete stochastic calculus with respect to initial data. In the process, we derive some new ergodic estimates for the linearized Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic equation that are of independent interest. Our analysis also leads to uniform-in-time concentration estimates and to a uniform-in-time quantitative central limit theorem for the empirical measure associated with the particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generating Triangulations and Fibrations with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply reinforcement learning (RL) to generate fine regular star triangulations of reflexive polytopes, that give rise to smooth Calabi-Yau (CY) hypersurfaces. We demonstrate that, by simple modifications to the data encoding and reward function, one can search for CYs that satisfy a set of desirable string compactification conditions. For instance, we show that our RL algorithm can generate triangulations together with holomorphic vector bundles that satisfy anomaly cancellation and poly-stability conditions in heterotic compactification. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm can be used to search for reflexive subpolytopes together with compatible triangulations that define fibration structures of the CYs.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we will give a new combinatorial proof of Ginibre's inequality for XY models. Our proof is based on multigraph representations introduced by van Engelenburg-Lis (2023) and a new bijection, which can be viewed as a combinatorial interpretation of Ginibre's square trick.</description>
