      <title>Miscible fluids patterning and micro-manipulation using vortex-based single-beam acoustic tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex-based single-beam tweezers have the ability to precisely and selectively move a wide range of objects, including particles, bubbles, droplets, and cells with sizes ranging from the millimeter to micrometer scale. In 2017, Karlsen and Bruus [Phys. Rev. Appl. 7, 034017 (2017)] theoretically suggested that these tweezers could also address one of the most challenging issues: the patterning and manipulation of miscible fluids. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate this ability using acoustic vortex beams generated by interdigital transducer-based active holograms. The experimental results are supported by a numerical model based on acoustic body force simulations. This work paves the way for the precise shaping of chemical concentration fields, a crucial factor in numerous chemical and biological processes.</description>

      <title>Torques on curved atmospheric fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small particles are transported over long distances in the atmosphere, with significant environmental impact. The transport of symmetric particles is well understood, but atmospheric particles, such as curved microplastic fibres or ash particles, are generally asymmetric. This makes the description of their transport properties uncertain. Here, we derive a model for how planar curved fibres settle in quiescent air. The model explains that fluid-inertia torques may align such fibres at oblique angles with gravity as seen in recent laboratory experiments, and shows that inertial alignment is a general and thus important factor for the transport of atmospheric particles.</description>

      <title>Effect of the blast wave interaction on the flame heat release and droplet dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study comprehensively investigates the response of a combusting droplet during its interaction with high-speed transient flow imposed by a coaxially propagating blast wave. The blast wave is generated using a miniature shock generator which facilitates wide Mach number range ($1.01&lt;M_s&lt;1.6$). The interaction of the shock flow occurs in two stages: 1) interaction of the temporally decaying velocity ($\rm v_s$) imposed by blast wave and 2) interaction with the induced flow ($\rm v_{ind}$). The flame base lifts off due to the imposed flow, and the advection of flame base towards flame tip results in flame extinction for $M_s &gt; 1.06$. The timescale of the flame extinction is faster (interaction with $\rm v_s$) for $M_s&gt;1.1$. The study investigates the effect on droplet regression, flame heat release rate and flame topological evolution during the interaction. The droplet regression rate gets enhanced after the interaction with blast wave for $M_s &lt; 1.06$, while it slowed down due to complete extinction for $M_s &gt; 1.06$. A momentary flame heat release rate (HRR) enhancement occurs during the interaction with shock flow, and this HRR enhancement is found to be more than 8 times the nominal unforced flame HRR for $M_s &gt; 1.1$, where rapid flame extinction occurs due to faster interaction with $\rm v_s$ ($\sim O(10^{-1})ms$). HRR enhancement has been attributed to the fuel vapor accumulation during the interaction. Furthermore, for $M_s &gt; 1.1$), compressible vortex interaction occurs with the droplet resulting in droplet atomization. The droplet shows a wide range of atomization response modes ranging for different shock strengths. No significant effect of nanoparticle (NP) addition has been found on the flame dynamics due to the faster timescales. However, minimial effects of NP addition are observed during droplet breakup due to fluid property variation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Profile-Preserving Phase-Field model of Two-Phase Flow with Surfactant Interfacial Transport and Marangoni Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a regularized delta function to distribute surfactant interfacial concentration can simplify the computation of the surface gradient operator $\nabla_s$, enabling the phase-field model to effectively simulate Marangoni flows involving surfactant transport. However, the exact conservation of total surfactant mass is compromised due to deviation from the equilibrium phase field profile, numerical diffusion, and mass non-conservation in each phase. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a new model for simulating two-phase flow with surfactant transport along the interface. This model employs a profile-preserving strategy to maintain the equilibrium interface profile, ensuring accurate calculation of the regularized delta function and better surfactant mass conservation. Within the framework of the advective Chan-Hilliard phase-field model, we utilize a regularized delta function with a reduced gradient to minimize numerical diffusion. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid surface tension model that integrates the free-energy and the continuum-surface force models to mitigate spatial discretization errors, particularly in scenarios with high density and viscosity ratio. Verification tests demonstrates the model's effectiveness in simulating surface diffusion on stationary and expanding drop, suppressing spurious currents, and capturing the deformation of two-dimensional drops in shear flow. The results closely align with analytical solutions and previous numerical studies. Finally, we apply the model to investigate the contraction and oscillation dynamics of a surfactant-laden liquid filament, revealing the role of the Marangoni force in shaping filament behavior.</description>

      <title>From Darcy flow to convective flow: pore-scale study of density-driven currents in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a series of pore-scale numerical simulations on convective flow in porous media, with a fixed Schmidt number of 400 and a wide range of Rayleigh numbers. The porous media are modeled using regularly arranged square obstacles in a Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) system. As the Rayleigh number increases, the flow transitions from a Darcy-type regime to an RB-type regime, with the corresponding $Sh-Ra_D$ relationship shifting from sublinear scaling to the classical 0.3 scaling of RB convection. Here, $Sh$ and $Ra_D$ represent the Sherwood number and Rayleigh-Darcy number, respectively. For different porosities, the transition begins at approximately $Ra_D = 4000$, at which point the characteristic horizontal scale of the flow field is comparable to the size of a single obstacle unit. When the thickness of the concentration boundary layer is less than about one-sixth of the pore spacing, the flow finally enters the RB regime. In the Darcy regime, the scaling exponent of $Sh$ and $Ra_D$ decreases as porosity increases. Based on the Grossman-Lohse theory (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 407, 2000; Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 86, 2001), we provide an explanation for the scaling laws in each regime and highlight the significant impact of mechanical dispersion effects within the boundary layer. Our findings provide some new insights into the validity range of the Darcy model.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of hydromagnetic turbulence with higher order fluid moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, Chandrasekhar's deductive theory of turbulence is extended to the case of hydrodynamics and hydromagnetics, with higher order fluid moments. We include the contributions from correlation tensors at two different points of space and two different points in time to account for the energy transfer between Fourier modes with different $k$ values. We start with three governing equations using the first three moments of Vlasov equation, which gives us particle, momentum and energy conservation relations, respectively. We obtain the scalar representations of correlation tensors for hydrodynamics as well as hydromagnetics. Finally we pick an example from literature where the energy spectra alone was not capable of explaining the observations reported by the authors.</description>

      <title>Inference of water waves surface elevation from horizontal velocity components using physics informed neural networks (PINN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a mathematical model is presented to infer the wave free surface elevation from the horizontal velocity components using Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN). PINN is a deep learning framework to solve forward and inverse Ordinary/Partial Differential Equations (ODEs/PDEs). The model is verified by measuring a numerically generated Kelvin waves downstream of a KRISO Container Ship (KCS). The KCS Kelvin waves are generated using two phase Volume of Fluid (VoF) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation with OpenFOAM. In addition, the paper presented the use of the Fourier Features decomposition of the Neural Network inputs to avoid the spectral bias phenomena; Spectral bias is the tendency of Neural Network to converge towards the low frequency solution faster than the high frequency one. Fourier Features decomposition layer showed an improvement for the model learning, as the model was able to learn the high and low frequency components simultaneously.</description>

      <title>High frame rate characterization of interaction between twin-nozzle jet in crossflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twin-nozzle jet in crossflow is a canonical flow structure in various engineering equipment, yet there are limited detailed studies focusing on its dynamical characteristics. In this study, the flow field of a twin-nozzle jet in crossflow, under different velocity ratios (3, 5, and 7) and jet spacing (2d, 3d, and 4d), was measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV) at 40 kHz. Two-dimensional velocity field measurements revealed that the interaction between the front and rear jets is strongly influenced by the jet spacing, leading to variations in jet trajectories, velocity along the trajectories, and vortex dynamics. Notably, both the front and rear jet trajectories are elevated compared to those of a single jet due to the blocking and pressure effects. The trajectories can be fitted to a scaling equation with $r^{(1.5l-5)}d$ as the scaling length. Additionally, the velocity variation, dynamics of the shear layer vortices, local pressure distribution, and turbulent kinetic energy distribution were examined. The findings emphasize the distinctions between single-nozzle and twin-nozzle jets in crossflow while also uncovering the interactions between the front and rear jets. The results demonstrate how varying velocity ratios and jet spacing influence these interactions, providing deeper insights into the complex dynamics at play in twin-nozzle configurations.</description>

      <title>Detonation propagation in three-dimensional continuous curved ducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, 3D detonation numerical studies are conducted using reactive Euler equations in both straight and curved channels. These simulations are compared to investigate the response of detonation to curvature within infinitely long square ducts. The influence of the inner wall radius, cross-section size, and activation energy (Ea) on wave structures, pressure distributions, and velocity are carefully described. The results for detonation waves with low Ea in narrow ducts show that, in straight ducts, it typically exhibits rectangular or diagonal modes which depends on the initial perturbations. However, when propagating in curved ducts, the waves display significantly different patterns and curvature sensitive velocity deficits. For sufficient small radii, due to the compression and expansion in the lateral direction, an initial diagonal perturbation may transit into rectangular mode. For detonation waves with low Ea in wide ducts, mode transition may happen even for rectangular perturbations. An out-of-phase rectangular mode first appears, followed by the twisting of the transverse waves until a diagonal mode develops. The corresponding curved case shows that only one pair of transverse waves on each wall. Furthermore, the cellular patterns become irregular with increasing Ea: in the straight duct, the cells seem more randomly distributed; in curved duct, small cells are observed on the outer wall, while large-scale wave motions are noted on the inner wall, as a result of mixture with high Ea is more sensitive to the perturbations. The current results indicate that a fully developed detonation wave in a continuously curved duct is significantly affected by substantial compression and velocity deficit, which alter the wave structures.</description>

      <title>NeDF: neural deflection fields for sparse-view tomographic background oriented Schlieren</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) density-varying turbulent flows are widely encountered in high-speed aerodynamics, combustion, and heterogeneous mixing processes. Multi-camera-based tomographic background-oriented Schlieren (TBOS) has emerged as a powerful technique for revealing 3D flow density structures. However, dozens of cameras are typically required to obtain high-quality reconstructed density fields. Limited by the number of available optical windows and confined space in the harsh experimental environments, TBOS with only sparse views and limited viewing angles often becomes the necessary choice practically, rendering the inverse problem for TBOS reconstruction severely ill-posed and resulting in degraded tomography quality. In this study, we propose a novel TBOS reconstruction method, neural deflection field (NeDF), utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent the density gradient fields without using any pretrained neural network models. Particularly, state-of-the-art positional encoding techniques and hierarchical sampling strategies are incorporated to capture the density structures of high spatial frequencies. Required background images for TBOS reconstructions are synthesized based on a high-fidelity nonlinear ray-tracing method with the ground truth flows from conducting LES simulations on premixed turbulent flames. Owing to these synthesized BOS images, the superiority of the proposed method is quantitatively verified compared to the classical TBOS reconstruction methods, and the specific contributions from the position encoding and the hierarchical sampling strategy are also elucidated.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Two-Phase Viscoelastic Fluid Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase flows are an important class of fluid flow and their study facilitates the development of diverse applications in industrial, natural and biomedical systems. Simulating such flows requires significant computational resources, making it prudent to devise an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method to mitigate this burden. We use a mathematical model that takes a continuum mechanical approach to describe multiphase mixture flows. The resulting system of equations poses numerical challenges due to the presence of multiple non-linear terms and a co-incompressibility condition, while the resulting fluid dynamics necessitate the development of an adaptive mesh refinement technique to accurately capture regions of interest while keeping computational costs low. We present an accurate, robust, and efficient computational method for simulating multiphase mixtures on adaptive grids, and utilize a multigrid solver to precondition the saddle-point system. We demonstrate that the AMR solver asymptotically approaches second order accuracy in $L^1$, $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms for all solution variables of the Newtonian and non-Newtonian models. All experiments demonstrate the solver is stable provided the time step size satisfies the imposed CFL condition. The solver can accurately resolve sharp gradients in the solution and, with the multigrid preconditioner, the solver behavior is independent of grid spacing. Our AMR solver offers a major cost savings benefit, providing up to 10x speedup in the numerical experiments presented here, with greater speedup possible depending on the problem set-up.</description>

      <title>Flow associated with Lighthill's elongated-body theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic forces acting on an undulating swimming fish consist of two components: a drag-based resistive force and a reactive force originating from the necessary acceleration of an added mass of water. Lighthill's elongated-body theory, based on potential flow, provides a framework for calculating this reactive force. By leveraging the high aspect ratio of most fish, the theory simplifies the problem into a series of independent two-dimensional slices of fluids along the fish's body, which exchange momentum with the body and neighbouring slices. Using momentum conservation arguments, Lighthill's theory predicts the total thrust generated by an undulating fish, based solely on the dimensions and kinematics of its caudal fin. However, the assumption of independent slices has led to the common misconception that the flow produced lacks a longitudinal component. In this paper, we revisit Lighthill's theory, offering a modern reinterpretation using essential singularities of potential flows. We then extend it to predict the full three-dimensional flow field induced by the fish's body motion. Our results compare favourably with numerical simulations of realistic fish geometries.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamics and spatiotemporal patterns in soft robotic swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective swimming of soft robots in an infinite viscous fluid is an emergent phenomenon due to the non-reciprocal hydrodynamic interactions between individual swimmers. These physical interactions give rise to unique spatiotemporal patterns and unusual swimming trajectories that are often difficult to predict due to the two-way fully coupled nature of the strong fluid-structure interaction at a thermodynamic state that is far from equilibrium. Until now, robotic swarms have mostly been studied for rigid swimmers in two-dimensional settings. Here we study the emergence of three-dimensional spatiotemporal patterns of helical magnetically actuated soft-robotic swimmers by systematically studying the effect of different initial configurations. Our results show that swimmers with variations in initial positions in the swimming direction are attracted to each other, while swimmers with variations in lateral positions repel each other, eventually converging to a state in which all swimmers concentrate in one lateral plane drifting radially outward.</description>

Abstract: In so-called Lagrangian melting problems, a solid immersed in a fluid medium is free to rotate and translate in tandem with its phase-change from solid to liquid. Such configurations may be classified as a fluid-solid interaction (FSI) problem coupled to phase-change. Our present work proposes a numerical method capable of simulating these Lagrangian melting problems and adopts a front-tracking immersed-boundary (IB) method. We use the moving least squares IB framework, a well-established method for simulating a diverse range of FSI problems and extend this framework to accommodate melting by additionally imposing the Stefan condition at the interface. In the spirit of canonical front-tracking methods, the immersed solid is represented by a discrete triangulated mesh which is separate from the Eulerian mesh in which the governing flow equations are solved. A known requirement for these methods is the need for comparable Eulerian and Lagrangian grid spacings to stabilise interpolation and spreading operations between the two grids. For a melting object, this requirement is inevitably violated unless interventional remeshing is introduced. Our work therefore presents a novel dynamic remeshing procedure to overcome this. The remeshing is based on a gradual coarsening of the triangulated Lagrangian mesh and amounts to a negligible computational burden per timestep owing to the incremental and local nature of its operations, making it a scalable approach. Moreover, the coarsening is coupled to a volume-conserving smoothing procedure detailed by Kuprat et al. (2001), ensuring a zero net volume change in the remeshing step to machine precision. This added feature makes our present method highly specialised to the study of melting problems, where precise measurements of the melting solid's volume is often the primary predictive quantity of interest.</description>

      <title>WhY shape matters: Hydrodynamics of a Y-shaped membraneless electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel Y-shaped membraneless flow-through electrolyzer is introduced to achieve a homogeneous electrochemical reaction across the entire electrode in a cost-efficient cell design with effective product separation. Numerical simulations of the electrolyte flow and electrical current within the already known I- and T-shaped cells motivate the newly proposed Y-shape cell. Furthermore, a new design criterion is developed based on the balance between bubble removal and gas generation. As proof-of-concept experimental results using the Y-shaped electrolyzer are presented, showing homogeneous gas distributions across the electrode and efficient product separation by the electrolyte flow.</description>

      <title>Instability behavior of odd viscosity-induced viscous fluid over a vibrating bed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manuscript focuses on the theoretical stability analysis of the viscous liquid over a vibrating inclined rigid bed when the fluid undergoes an impact of odd viscosity. Such an impact emerges in the classical fluid owing to the broken time-reversal symmetry. The rigid bottom vibrates in streamwise and cross-stream directions. The time-dependent Orr-Sommerfeld eigenvalue problem is obtained using the normal mode approach and resolved based on the Chebyshev-collocation method and the Floquet theory. The effect of the odd viscosity coefficient on the different types of instability gravitational, subharmonic, and harmonic are identified. The gravitational instability arises in the longwave region, whereas the resonated wave instability appears in the finite wavenumber region. The gravitational instability is generated in the fluid flow owing to the gravity driving force, whereas the subharmonic instability appears for lower forcing amplitude and the harmonic instability emerges for comparatively higher forcing amplitude. It is found that the subharmonic and harmonic resonances appear when the forcing amplitude surpasses its critical value. A higher odd viscosity leads to stabilizing the gravitational instability, whereas a larger odd viscosity diminishes the subharmonic resonance along with the harmonic resonance instigated at a high forcing amplitude. Further, a new instability, named shear instability in the finite wavenumber range emerges together with the aforementioned three instabilities when the Reynolds number is sufficiently high with a low angle of inclination and becomes weaker when the time-reversal symmetry breaks.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Rotating Wall-Mode Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly rotating limit, we derive a balanced set of reduced equations governing the strongly nonlinear development of the convective wall-mode instability in the interior of a general container. The model illustrates that wall-mode convection is a multiscale phenomenon where the dynamics of the bulk interior diagnostically determine the small-scale dynamics within Stewartson boundary layers at the sidewalls. The sidewall boundary layers feedback on the interior via a nonlinear lateral heat-flux boundary condition, providing a closed system. Outside the asymptotically thin boundary layer, the convective modes connect to a dynamical interior that maintains scales set by the domain geometry. In many ways, the final system of equations resembles boundary-forced planetary geostrophic baroclinic dynamics coupled with barotropic quasi-geostrophic vorticity. The reduced system contains the results from previous linear instability theory but captured in an elementary fashion, providing a new avenue for investigating wall-mode convection in the strongly nonlinear regime. We also derive the dominant Ekman-flux correction to the onset Rayleigh number for large Taylor number, Ra ~ 31.8 Ta^(1/2) - 4.43 Ta^(5/12) for no-slip boundaries. We demonstrate some of the reduced model's nonlinear dynamics with numerical simulations in a cylindrical container.</description>

      <title>Lift Force on a Moving Intruder in Granular Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lift and drag forces on moving intruders in granular materials are of fundamental interest. While the drag force on an intruder in granular flow has been studied, the few studies characterizing the lift force explore a relatively limited range of parameters. Here we use discrete element method (DEM) simulations to measure the lift force, $F_\mathrm{L}$, on a spherical intruder in a uniformly sheared bed of smaller spheres for a range of intruder slip velocities, $u_\mathrm{s}$, relative to the unperturbed flow. In what at first appears as a puzzling result, $F_\mathrm{L}$ in granular shear flow acts in the opposite direction to the Saffman lift force on a sphere in a sheared fluid at low $u_\mathrm{s}$, reaches a maximum value, and then decreases, eventually reversing direction and becoming comparable to $F_\mathrm{L}$ for a fluid. This non-monotonic response holds over a range of flow conditions, and the $F_\mathrm{L}$ versus $u_\mathrm{s}$ data can be collapsed by scaling both quantities using the particle sizes, shear rate, and overburden pressure. Analogous fluid simulations demonstrate that the flow field around the intruder particle is similar in the granular and fluid cases. However, the shear stress acting on the intruder in a granular shear flow is much less than that in a fluid shear flow. This difference, combined with a void region behind the intruder in granular flow, which alters the pressure and shear stress on the trailing side of the intruder, significantly changes the lift-force inducing stresses acting on the intruder between the granular and fluid cases.</description>

      <title>Wave evolution within the Cubic Vortical Whitham equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the evolution of disturbances within the framework of the Cubic Vortical Whitham (CV-Whitham) equation, considering both positive and negative cubic nonlinearities. This equation plays important role for description of the wave processes in the presence of shear flows. We find well-formed breather-type structures arising from the evolution of depression disturbances with positive cubic nonlinearity. For elevation disturbances, the results are two-fold. When the cubic nonlinearity is negative, we show that the CV-Whitham equation and the Gardner equation are qualitatively similar, differing only by a small phase lag due to differences in the dispersion term. However, with positive cubic nonlinearity, the differences between the solutions become more pronounced, with the CV-Whitham equation producing sharper waves that suggest the onset of wave breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of shear horizontal (SH) acoustic waves in a quartz elastic plate in contact with a viscous fluid layer of a finite thickness as an acoustic wave sensor for measuring fluid viscosity or density. The first order elastic plate theory by Mindlin and the theory of Newtonian fluids are used. An equation for determining the dispersion relations of the SH waves is obtained. Approximate dispersion relations for long waves are given analytically. Numerical results showing the effects of the fluid on SH wave characteristics are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma is a medium filled with free electrons and positive ions. Each particle acts as a conducting fluid with a single velocity and temperature when electromagnetic fields are present. This distinction between the roles played by electrons and ions is what we refer to as the two$-$fluid description of plasma. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of these particles in both hot and cold plasma using a collisionless ''Euler-Poisson'' system. Employing analytical and computational techniques from differential equations, we show this system is governed by the dynamics of the Korteweg$-$de Vries (KdV) equation in the long$-$wavelength limit.</description>

      <title>Sparse space-time resolvent analysis for statistically-stationary and time-varying flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolvent analysis provides a framework to predict coherent spatio-temporal structures of largest linear energy amplification, through a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the resolvent operator, obtained by linearizing the Navier-Stokes equations about a known turbulent mean velocity profile. Resolvent analysis utilizes a Fourier decomposition in time, which limits its application to statistically-stationary or time-periodic flows. This work develops a variant of resolvent analysis applicable to time-evolving flows, and proposes a variant that identifies spatio-temporally sparse structures, applicable to either stationary or time-varying systems. Spatio-temporal resolvent analysis is formulated through the incorporation of the temporal dimension via a discrete time-differentiation operator. Sparsity (localisation) is achieved through the addition of an l1-norm penalisation term to the optimisation associated with the SVD. This modified problem can be formulated as a nonlinear eigenproblem, and solved via an inverse power method. We first showcase the implementation of the sparse analysis on statistically-stationary turbulent channel flow, and demonstrate that the sparse variant can identify aspects of the physics not directly evident from standard resolvent analysis. This is followed by applying the sparse space-time formulation on systems that are time-varying: a time-periodic turbulent Stokes boundary layer, and then a turbulent channel flow with a sudden imposition of a lateral pressure gradient, with the original streamwise pressure gradient unchanged. We present results demonstrating how the sparsity-promoting variant can either change the quantitative structure of the leading space-time modes to increase their sparsity, or identify entirely different linear amplification mechanisms compared to non-sparse resolvent analysis.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Multi-Phase Flow in Porous Media Considering Dual Shocks and Interphase Solubility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate physical principles into machine learning, finding wide applications in various science and engineering fields. However, solving nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with PINNs presents challenges due to inherent discontinuities in the solutions. This is particularly true for the Buckley-Leverett (B-L) equation, a key model for multi-phase fluid flow in porous media. In this paper, we demonstrate that PINNs, in conjunction with Welge's Construction, can achieve superior precision in handling the B-L equations in different scenarios including one shock and one rarefaction wave, two shocks connected by a rarefaction wave traveling in the same direction, and two shocks connected by a rarefaction wave traveling in opposite directions. Our approach accounts for variations in fluid mobility, fluid solubility, and gravity effects, with applications in modeling 1D water flooding, polymer flooding, gravitational flow, and CO$_2$ injection into saline aquifers. Additionally, we applied PINNs to inverse problems to estimate multiple PDE parameters from observed data, demonstrating robustness under conditions of slight scarcity and up to 5% impurity of labeled data, as well as shortages in collocation data.</description>

      <title>On the inviscid instability of the 2D Taylor-Green vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Euler flows on two-dimensional (2D) periodic domain and are interested in the stability, both linear and nonlinear, of a simple equilibrium given by the 2D Taylor-Green vortex. As the first main result, numerical evidence is provided for the fact that such flows possess unstable eigenvalues embedded in the band of the essential spectrum of the linearized operator. However, the unstable eigenfunction is discontinuous at the hyperbolic stagnation points of the base flow and its regularity is consistent with the prediction of Lin (2004). This eigenfunction gives rise to an exponential transient growth with the rate given by the real part of the eigenvalue followed by passage to a nonlinear instability. As the second main result, we illustrate a fundamentally different, non-modal, growth mechanism involving a continuous family of uncorrelated functions, instead of an eigenfunction of the linearized operator. Constructed by solving a suitable PDE optimization problem, the resulting flows saturate the known estimates on the growth of the semigroup related to the essential spectrum of the linearized Euler operator as the numerical resolution is refined. These findings are contrasted with the results of earlier studies of a similar problem conducted in a slightly viscous setting where only the modal growth of instabilities was observed. This highlights the special stability properties of equilibria in inviscid flows.</description>

      <title>Revisiting visualization of spiral states in a wide-gap spherical Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pioneering study conducted by Egbers and Rath [Acta Mech. 111 pp. 125--140 (1995)] experimentally captured spiral waves to elucidate the transition in the wide-gap spherical Couette flow. However, the physical field quantities of the spiral waves corresponding to light patterns of various intensities, as obtained in the experiment, remain unclear, and we have yet to move beyond the understanding that the reflected light from shear-sensitive flake tracers responds to a flow that appears at the transition. In this study, the experiment to visualize spiral waves using aluminum flakes, as performed by Egbers and Rath, was numerically reproduced by solving the translational and rotational motions of the particles in a spiral wave. First, the spiral wave in a spherical Couette flow with an aspect ratio $\eta=1/2$ was numerically calculated using the Newton--Raphson method. Subsequently, the image that was numerically reproduced from the spiral wave was compared with an experimentally visualized image. The torque acting on the inner sphere and the phase angular velocity of the spiral waves with various wavenumbers were provided. Attempts have been made to determine the instantaneous physical quantity to which the light and dark patterns obtained in the visualization corresponded, and the orientation motion of the flakes developed in the advective history of the flow is essential to yield favorable results. Exploring the correlation between flow visualization results and shear structures may provide a new avenue for quantitatively estimating spatial structures and time scales in complex and quickly time-varying flow fields, such as turbulence.</description>

      <title>Effect of Synthetic Jets Actuator Parameters on Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Flow Control Performance in a Square Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12834v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct an active flow control (AFC) study on the mass flow rate of synthetic jets on the upper and lower surfaces of a square cylinder using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, with a focus on investigating the influence of the position and width of the synthetic jets on the flow control performance. At Reynolds numbers ($Re$) of 100 and 500, it is found that our proposed method significantly reduced the lift and drag coefficients of the square cylinder, and completely suppressed vortex shedding in the wake. In particular, at $Re=100$, placing the synthetic jets near the tail corner was beneficial for reducing drag, with a maximum drag reduction rate of 14.4%. When $Re=500$, positioning the synthetic jets near the leading edge corner resulted in a maximum optimal drag reduction effect of 65.5%. This indicates that locating the synthetic jet at the main flow separation point can achieve optimal control. Furthermore, we notice that when the synthetic jets are positioned near the tail corner, vortex shedding can be completely suppressed. Additionally, a narrower width of the synthetic jets can enhance flow instability and increase the cost of flow control.</description>

      <title>Evaporation limited spreading of ethanol on rectangular porous strips: an experimental and theoretical investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wicking is a widely studied process in both natural and artificial systems. In many industrial applications, such as heat pipes, the wicking liquid evaporates to regulate temperature effectively. This study focuses on a simpler scenario where liquid ethanol climbs a vertically oriented filter paper FP under laboratory conditions, facilitating mass loss through evaporation and inducing cooling. Three filter papers with different permeability values were used, and three diagnostic methods optical imaging, thermal imaging, and precision weighing were employed to understand the dynamics of the process. The results showed a steady state height Lc significantly lower than Jurins limit in all cases, indicating that evaporative mass loss, and not gravity, limits the process. For instance, the filter paper 1005FP, with a capillary radius of 59microm and an average pore size of 2.50microm, would reach a Jurins height of 9.6cm with ethanol if evaporation were not allowed. However, when evaporation occurred, the height reduced to 1.2cm, an eightfold decrease, a similar reduction by a factor of 3 was observed for 1004FP. Further, thermal imaging revealed a non constant temperature distribution along the filter paper, with an unusual temperature inversion near the middle of the wicking liquid. This observation led to an improvement of the Constant Evaporation Model CEM by Fries et al 2008 by accounting for the nonlinear behavior of evaporation rates varying with vertical position. This new model termed the Non-Constant Evaporation Model NCEM, tested two power-law relations for evaporation rates , both of which successfully captured the key features of the process.</description>
