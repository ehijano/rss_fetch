      <title>Many-insurer robust games of reinsurance and investment under model uncertainty in incomplete markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the robust reinsurance and investment games for competitive insurers. Model uncertainty is characterized by a class of equivalent probability measures. Each insurer is concerned with relative performance under the worst-case scenario. Insurers' surplus processes are approximated by drifted Brownian motion with common and idiosyncratic insurance risks. The insurers can purchase proportional reinsurance to divide the insurance risk with the reinsurance premium calculated by the variance principle. We consider an incomplete market driven by the 4/2 stochastic volatility mode. This paper formulates the robust mean-field game for a non-linear system originating from the variance principle and the 4/2 model. For the case of an exponential utility function, we derive closed-form solutions for the $n$-insurer game and the corresponding mean-field game. We show that relative concerns lead to new hedging terms in the investment and reinsurance strategies. Model uncertainty can significantly change the insurers' hedging demands. The hedging demands in the investment-reinsurance strategies exhibit highly non-linear dependence with the insurers' competitive coefficients, risk aversion and ambiguity aversion coefficients. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the herd effect of competition.</description>

      <title>Robust mean-variance stochastic differential reinsurance and investment games under volatility risk and model uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates robust stochastic differential games among insurers under model uncertainty and stochastic volatility. The surplus processes of ambiguity-averse insurers (AAIs) are characterized by drifted Brownian motion with both common and idiosyncratic insurance risks. To mitigate these risks, AAIs can purchase proportional reinsurance. Besides, AAIs allocate their wealth in a financial market consisting of cash, and a stock characterized by the 4/2 stochastic volatility model. AAIs compete with each other based on relative performance with the mean-variance criterion under the worst-case scenario. This paper formulates a robust time-consistent mean-field game in a non-linear system. The AAIs seek robust, time-consistent response strategies to achieve Nash equilibrium strategies in the game. We introduce $n$-dimensional extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equations and corresponding verification theorems under compatible conditions. Semi-closed forms of the robust $n$-insurer equilibrium and mean-field equilibrium are derived, relying on coupled Riccati equations. Suitable conditions are presented to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the coupled Riccati equation as well as the integrability in the verification theorem. As the number of AAIs increases, the results in the $n$-insurer game converge to those in the mean-field game. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate economic behaviors in the games, highlighting the herd effect of competition on the AAIs.</description>

      <title>Partial Information in a Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04045v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers finitely many investors who perform mean-variance portfolio selection under relative performance criteria. That is, each investor is concerned about not only her terminal wealth, but how it compares to the average terminal wealth of all investors. At the inter-personal level, each investor selects a trading strategy in response to others' strategies. This selected strategy additionally needs to yield an equilibrium intra-personally, so as to resolve time inconsistency among the investor's current and future selves (triggered by the mean-variance objective). A Nash equilibrium we look for is thus a tuple of trading strategies under which every investor achieves her intra-personal equilibrium simultaneously. We derive such a Nash equilibrium explicitly in the idealized case of full information (i.e., the dynamics of the underlying stock is perfectly known) and semi-explicitly in the realistic case of partial information (i.e., the stock evolution is observed, but the expected return of the stock is not precisely known). The formula under partial information consists of the myopic trading and intertemporal hedging terms, both of which depend on an additional state process that serves to filter the true expected return and whose influence on trading is captured by a degenerate Cauchy problem. Our results identify that relative performance criteria can induce downward self-reinforcement of investors' wealth--if every investor suffers a wealth decline simultaneously, then everyone's wealth tends to decline further. This phenomenon, as numerical examples show, is negligible under full information but pronounced under partial information.</description>
