      <title>Next-order balanced model captures submesoscale physics and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using nonlinear simulations in two settings, we demonstrate that QG$^\mathrm{+1}$, a potential-vorticity (PV) based next-order-in-Rossby balanced model, captures several aspects of ocean submesoscale physics. In forced-dissipative 3D simulations under baroclinically unstable Eady-type background states, the statistical equilibrium turbulence exhibits long cyclonic tails and a plethora of rapidly-intensifying ageostrophic fronts. Despite that the model requires setting an explicit, small value for the fixed scaling Rossby number, the emergent flows are nevertheless characterized by $O(f)$ vorticity and convergence, as observed in upper-ocean submesoscale flows. Simulations of QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ under the classic strain-induced frontogenesis set-up show realistic frontal asymmetry and a finite time blow-up, quantitatively comparable to simulations of the semigeostrophic equations. The inversions in the QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ model are straightforward elliptic problems, allowing for the reconstruction of all flow fields from the PV and surface buoyancy, while avoiding the semigeostrophic coordinate transformation. Together, these results suggest QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ as a useful tool for studying upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics.</description>

      <title>New versus past silica crush curve experiments: application to Dimorphos benchmarking impact simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crush curves are of fundamental importance to numerical modeling of small and porous astrophysical bodies. The empirical literature often measures them for silica grains, and different studies have used various methods, sizes, textures, and pressure conditions. Here we review past studies and supplement further experiments in order to develop a full and overarching understanding of the silica crush curve behavior. We suggest a new power-law function that can be used in impact simulations of analog materials similar to micro-granular silica. We perform a benchmarking study to compare this new crush curve to the parametric quadratic crush curve often used in other studies, based on the study case of the DART impact onto the asteroid Dimorphos. We find that the typical quadratic crush curve parameters do not closely follow the silica crushing experiments, and as a consequence they under (over) estimate compression close (far) from the impact site. The new crush curve presented here, applicable to pressures between a few hundred Pa and up to 1.1 GPa, might therefore be more precise. Additionally, it is not calibrated by case-specific parameters, and can be used universally for comet- or asteroid-like bodies, given an assumed composition similar to micro-granular silica.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Fireball Luminous Efficiency Models using Acoustic Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The total energy of a fireball is commonly obtained from optical measurements with an assumed value for luminous efficiency. Acoustic energy measurements offer an independent means of energy estimation. Here we combine optical and acoustic methods to validate the luminous efficiency model of Borovi\v{c}ka et al. (2020). Our goal is to compare these models with acoustic measurements of meteoroid energy deposition. Employing theoretical blast scaling laws following the approach of McFadden et al. (2021), we determine explosive yields for both fireball fragmentation events and cylindrical shocks for four different bright fireballs. We model fireballs using the MetSim software (Vida et al., 2023) and find that the Borovi\v{c}ka et al. (2020) model produces agreement better than a factor of two for our three chondritic fireball case studies. The major exception is an iron meteorite-producing fireball where the luminous efficiency is an order of magnitude higher than model predictions calibrated with stony fireballs. We suggest that large disparities between optical and acoustic energies could be a signature of iron fireballs and hence useful as a discriminant of that population.</description>
