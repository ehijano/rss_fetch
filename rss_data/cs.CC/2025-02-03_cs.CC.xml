      <title>Better late, then? The hardness of choosing delays to meet passenger demands in temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18987</link>

Abstract: In train networks, carefully-chosen delays may be beneficial for certain passengers, who would otherwise miss some connection. Given a simple temporal graph and a set of passengers (each specifying a starting vertex, an ending vertex, and a desired arrival time), we ask whether it is possible to delay some of the edges of the temporal graph to realize all the passengers' demands. We call this problem DelayBetter (DB), and study it along with two variants: in $\delta$-DelayBetter, each delay must be of at most $\delta$; in Path DB, passengers fully specify the vertices they should visit on their journey. On the positive side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for Path DB, and obtain as a corollary a polynomial-time algorithm for DB and $\delta$-DB on trees. We also provide an fpt algorithm for both problems parameterized by the size of the graph's Feedback Edge Set together with the number of passengers. On the negative side, we show NP-completeness of ($1$-)DB on bounded-degree temporal graphs even when the lifetime is $2$, and of ($10$-)DB on bounded-degree planar temporal graphs of lifetime $19$. Our results complement previous work studying reachability problems in temporal graphs with delaying operations. This is to our knowledge the first such problem in which the aim is to facilitate travel between specific points (as opposed to facilitating or impeding a broadcast from one or many sources).</description>

      <title>A single-loop SPIDER-type stochastic subgradient method for expectation-constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world problems, such as those with fairness constraints, involve complex expectation constraints and large datasets, necessitating the design of efficient stochastic methods to solve them. Most existing research focuses on cases with no {constraint} or easy-to-project constraints or deterministic constraints. In this paper, we consider nonconvex nonsmooth stochastic optimization problems with expectation constraints, for which we build a novel exact penalty model. We first show the relationship between the penalty model and the original problem. Then on solving the penalty problem, we present a single-loop SPIDER-type stochastic subgradient method, which utilizes the subgradients of both the objective and constraint functions, as well as the constraint function value at each iteration. Under certain regularity conditions (weaker than Slater-type constraint qualification or strong feasibility assumed in existing works), we establish an iteration complexity result of $O(\epsilon^{-4})$ to reach a near-$\epsilon$ stationary point of the penalized problem in expectation, matching the lower bound for such tasks. Building on the exact penalization, an $(\epsilon,\epsilon)$-KKT point of the original problem is obtained. For a few scenarios, our complexity of either the {objective} sample subgradient or the constraint sample function values can be lower than the state-of-the-art results by a factor of $\epsilon^{-2}$. Moreover, on solving two fairness-constrained problems, our method is significantly (up to 466 times) faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms, including switching subgradient method and inexact proximal point methods.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudorandom states (PRSs) are state ensembles that cannot be efficiently distinguished from Haar random states. However, the definition of PRSs has been limited to pure states and lacks robustness against noise. Here, we introduce pseudorandom density matrices (PRDMs), ensembles of $n$-qubit states that are computationally indistinguishable from the generalized Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble (GHSE), which is constructed from $(n+m)$-qubit Haar random states with $m$ qubits traced out. For $m=0$, PRDMs are equivalent to PRSs, whereas for $m=\omega(\log n)$, PRDMs are computationally indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. PRDMs with $m=\omega(\log n)$ are robust to unital noise channels and separated in terms of security from PRS. PRDMs disguise valuable quantum resources, possessing near-maximal entanglement, magic and coherence, while being computationally indistinguishable from resource-free states. PRDMs exhibit a pseudoresource gap of $\Theta(n)$ vs $0$, surpassing previously found gaps. We also render EFI pairs, a fundamental cryptographic primitive, robust to strong mixed unitary noise. Our work has major implications on quantum resource theory: We show that entanglement, magic and coherence cannot be efficiently tested, and that black-box resource distillation requires a superpolynomial number of copies. We also establish lower bounds on the purity needed for efficient testing and black-box distillation. Finally, we introduce memoryless PRSs, a noise-robust notion of PRS which are indistinguishable to Haar random states for efficient algorithms without quantum memory, as well as noise-robust quantum money. Our work provides a comprehensive framework of pseudorandomness for mixed states, which yields powerful quantum cryptographic primitives and fundamental bounds on quantum resource theories.</description>
