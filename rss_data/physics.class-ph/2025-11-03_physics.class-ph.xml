      <title>Quantification of the Influence of Morphologies on Laser Cutting Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser cutting is an old and multi-physical process that was quickly adopted by the metallurgical industry. However, this fast industrialisation has had a significant impact on quality control. Several studies have been carried out to characterise and minimise different types of cutting defects. Reviews published between 2008 and 2022 highlight that research often focuses on single-criterion ___quality' approaches, aiming to minimise specific defects such as the Heat-Affected Zone, surface roughness, or kerf geometry. Consequently, efforts have been directed at optimising specific aspects of quality rather than adopting a complete approach. Furthermore, these reviews reveal that cutting quality can be enhanced through the careful selection of laser manufacturing parameters and part parameters. However, while parameters such as material and thickness have been investigated, the influence of part morphology on cutting quality remains underexplored.___ Although some studies have examined the effects of material and thickness, part morphology is often limited to simple segments with varying cutting lengths or angles. While other research has investigated the impact of angle size on cutting quality, no established method exists to systematically determine the influence of each part morphology on cutting quality.______ In response to this gap, the present study proposes to evaluate the criticality of cutting defects, as defined by existing standards, across various part morphologies using a method adapted from Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). The objective is to develop a global approach that examines the influence of all morphologies on all types of cutting defects. An industrial application shows that cutting defects, particularly thermal ones, are strongly influenced by morphologies, while thickness affects them irregularly. Improvement priorities target critical defects shaped by both factors. Burrs and adherent slag are critical in angles and arcs, while segments, often used in studies, are less sensitive._________ These observations lead to the definition of design limits. This method offers a detailed analysis of the influence of design data on quality, providing practical tools for improving industrial processes._________</description>

      <title>Comment on "Magnetic moments in the Poynting theorem, Maxwell equations, Dirac equation, and QED"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper ``Magnetic moments in the Poynting theorem, Maxwell equations, Dirac equation, and QED", arXiv:2501.02022, by Peter J. Mohr, purports to show that Maxwell's equation, $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot{\bf B}=0$, and Poynting's theorem require significant modications for the $\bf B$ field of a magnetic dipole. We show here that, because of critical errors in the paper, these claims are false, and that Maxwell's equation and the Poynting theorem are the same for a magnetic moment as for any other charge-current distribution.</description>
