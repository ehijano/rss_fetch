      <title>Eukaryotic ancestry in a finite world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following genetic ancestry in eukaryote populations poses several open problems due to sexual reproduction and recombination. The history of extant genetic material is usually modeled backwards in time, but tracking chromosomes at a large scale is not trivial, as successive recombination events break them into several segments. For this reason, the behavior of the distribution of genetic segments across the ancestral population is not fully understood. Moreover, as individuals transmit only half of their genetic content to their offspring, after a few generations, it is possible that ghosts arise, that is, genealogical ancestors that transmit no genetic material to any individual.
  While several theoretical predictions exist to estimate properties of ancestral segments or ghosts, most of them rely on simplifying assumptions such as an infinite population size or an infinite chromosome length. It is not clear how well these results hold in a finite universe, and current simulators either make other approximations or cannot handle the scale required to answer these questions. In this work, we use an exact back-in-time simulator of large diploid populations experiencing recombination that tracks genealogical and genetic ancestry, without approximations. We focus on the distinction between genealogical and genetic ancestry and, additionally, we explore the effects of genome structure on ancestral segment distribution and the proportion of genetic ancestors. Our study reveals that some of the theoretical predictions hold well in practice, but that, in several cases, it highlights discrepancies between theoretical predictions assuming infinite parameters and empirical results in finite populations, emphasizing the need for cautious application of mathematical models in biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Trilobite tridents: hydrodynamic lift and stability mechanisms for queue formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bizarre trident-like cephalic projections of Walliserops trifurcatus have previously been interpreted as sexually selected weapons for intraspecific combat. We propose an alternative hypothesis grounded in biomechanics and collective behavior, that tridents evolved as adaptations for hydrodynamic lift and queue stability, conferring energetic advantages during group locomotion. Under this hypothesis, lift could offset gravitational forces, enabling greater locomotor efficiency, while mechanically linked formations, where tridents rested on the pygidia of leading individuals, enhanced pitch and roll stability and minimized costly accelerations and collisions. These formations also facilitated hydrodynamic drafting, allowing weaker individuals to conserve energy and remain integrated within the group. The trident's structure, though inefficient for solitary lift or combat, functioned effectively in cooperative formations, suggesting that its original selective advantage lay not in individual performance but in enhancing group cohesion and efficiency. Rather than emerging from competitive pressures alone, the trident may have arisen through selection for coordinated, cooperative movement -- potentially representing a precursor stage to traits later exapted for sexual selection.</description>

      <title>Saltatory targeting strategy in rock-paper-scissors models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how strategic leaps alter the classic rock-paper-scissors dynamics in spatially structured populations. In our model, individuals can expend energy reserves to jump toward regions with a high density of individuals of the species they dominate in the spatial game. This enables them to eliminate the target organisms and gain new territory, promoting species proliferation. Through stochastic, lattice-based simulations, we show that even when the energy allocated to jumping, as opposed to random walking, is low, there is a significant shift in the cyclic dominance balance. This arises from the increased likelihood of the leaping species successfully acquiring territory. Due to the cyclical nature of the game, the dominant species becomes the one that is superior to the jumping species. We investigate how spatial patterns are affected and calculate the changes in characteristic length scales. Additionally, we quantify how saltatory targeting reshapes spatial correlations and drives shifts in population dominance. Finally, we estimate the coexistence probability and find evidence that this behavioural strategy may promote biodiversity among low-mobility organisms but jeopardise long-term coexistence in the case of high-mobility dispersal. These results underscore the profound impact of novel foraging tactics on community structure and provide concrete parameters for ecologists seeking to incorporate behavioural innovation into ecosystem models.</description>

      <title>Covariance Decomposition for Distance Based Species Tree Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In phylogenomics, species-tree methods must contend with two major sources of noise; stochastic gene-tree variation under the multispecies coalescent model (MSC) and finite-sequence substitutional noise. Fast agglomerative methods such as GLASS, STEAC, and METAL combine multi-locus information via distance-based clustering. We derive the exact covariance matrix of these pairwise distance estimates under a joint MSC-plus-substitution model and leverage it for reliable confidence estimation, and we algebraically decompose it into components attributable to coalescent variation versus sequence-level stochasticity. Our theory identifies parameter regimes where one source of variance greatly exceeds the other. For both very low and very high mutation rates, substitutional noise dominates, while coalescent variance is the primary contributor at intermediate mutation rates. Moreover, the interval over which coalescent variance dominates becomes narrower as the species-tree height increases. These results imply that in some settings one may legitimately ignore the weaker noise source when designing methods or collecting data. In particular, when gene-tree variance is dominant, adding more loci is most beneficial, while when substitution noise dominates, longer sequences or imputation are needed. Finally, leveraging the derived covariance matrix, we implement a Gaussian-sampling procedure to generate split support values for METAL trees and demonstrate empirically that this approach yields more reliable confidence estimates than traditional bootstrapping.</description>

      <title>An nth-cousin mating model and the n-anacci numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In seeking to understand the size of inbred pedigrees, J. Lachance (J. Theor. Biol. 261, 238-247, 2009) studied a population model in which, for a fixed value of $n$, each mating occurs between $n$th cousins. We explain a connection between the second-cousin case of the model ($n=2$) and the Fibonacci sequence, and more generally, between the $n$th-cousin case and the $n$-anacci sequence $(n \geq 2)$. For a model with $n$th-cousin mating $(n \geq 1)$, we obtain the generating function describing the size of the pedigree $t$ generations back from the present, and we use it to evaluate the asymptotic growth of the pedigree size. In particular, we show that the growth of the pedigree asymptotically follows the growth rate of the $n$-anacci sequence -- the golden ratio $\phi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx 1.6180$ in the second-cousin case $n=2$ -- and approaches 2 as $n$ increases. The computations explain the appearance of familiar numerical sequences and constants in a pedigree model. They also recall similar appearances of such sequences and constants in studies of population biology more generally.</description>

      <title>Self-Balancing of Cell Populations via Martingale Turnover with Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms underlying adaptive control in biological systems, such as intestinal immune regulation, remain poorly understood, despite detailed knowledge of their regulatory networks. Here, we propose an alternative to traditional deterministic regulation. We theoretically demonstrate that stochastic martingale turnover, in which cells proliferate through mutual competition and decay without component-specific control, naturally converges to an appropriate population balance characterized by a low probability of cell loss. This compositional change is described by a modified Langevin equation, where conserved mass is replaced by a dynamic variable representing the fitness of the current composition. A random walk model with step lengths that shorten near the target, together with its mathematical solution, demonstrates entropy increase under favorable conditions. Thus, we propose a fundamental principle for autonomous biological control.</description>

      <title>Foundations of ecological and evolutionary change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10766v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological evolution is realised through the same mechanisms of birth and death that underlie change in population density. The deep interdependence between ecology and evolution is well-established, and recent models focus on integrating eco-evolutionary dynamics to demonstrate how ecological and evolutionary processes interact and feed back upon each other. Nevertheless, a gap remains between the logical foundations of ecology and evolution. Both population ecology and evolution have fundamental equations that define how the size of a population (ecology) and the average characteristic within a population (evolution) change, respectively, over time. These fundamental equations are a complete and exact description of change for any closed population, but how they are formally linked remains unclear. We link the fundamental equations of population ecology and evolution with an equation that sums how individual characteristics interact with individual fitness in a population. From this equation, we derive the fundamental equations of population ecology and evolutionary biology (the Price equation). We thereby identify an overlooked bridge between ecology and biological evolution. Our unification formally recovers the equivalence between mean population growth rate and evolutionary fitness and links this change to ecosystem function. We outline how our framework can be used to further develop eco-evolutionary theory. .</description>

      <title>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</description>

      <title>A data-driven analysis of the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic diffusion in urban settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individuals who do not comply with public health safety measures pose a significant challenge to effective epidemic control, as their risky behaviours can undermine public health interventions. This is particularly relevant in urban environments because of their high population density and complex social interactions. In this study, we employ detailed contact networks, built using a data-driven approach, to examine the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic dynamics in three major Italian cities: Torino, Milano, and Palermo. We use a heterogeneous extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model that distinguishes between ordinary and non-compliant individuals, who are more infectious and/or more susceptible. By combining electoral data with recent findings on vaccine hesitancy, we obtain spatially heterogeneous distributions of non-compliance. Epidemic simulations demonstrate that even a small proportion of non-compliant individuals in the population can substantially increase the number of infections and accelerate the timing of their peak. Furthermore, the impact of non-compliance is greatest when disease transmission rates are moderate. Including the heterogeneous, data-driven distribution of non-compliance in the simulations results in infection hotspots forming with varying intensity according to the disease transmission rate. Overall, these findings emphasise the importance of monitoring behavioural compliance and tailoring public health interventions to address localised risks.</description>
