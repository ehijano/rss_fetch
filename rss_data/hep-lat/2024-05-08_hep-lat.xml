      <title>Onset of scaling violation in pion and kaon elastic electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties, parameter-free predictions are delivered for pion and kaon elastic electromagnetic form factors, $F_{P=\pi,K}$, thereby unifying them with kindred results for nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors. Regarding positive-charge states, the analysis stresses that the presence of scaling violations in QCD entails that $Q^2 F_P(Q^2)$ should exhibit a single maximum on $Q^2&gt;0$. Locating such a maximum is both necessary and sufficient to establish the existence of scaling violations. The study predicts that, for charged $\pi$, $K$ mesons, the $Q^2 F_P(Q^2)$ maximum lies in the neighbourhood $Q^2 \simeq 5\,$GeV$^2$. Foreseeable experiments will test these predictions and, providing their $Q^2$ reach meets expectations, potentially also provide details on the momentum dependence of meson form factor scaling violation.</description>

      <title>Integrable Spin Chains from large-$N$ QCD at strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a spin chain for a confining string that arises at first order in degenerate perturbation from the strong-coupling expansion of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian on a square lattice in the leading large $N$ expansion. We show some subsectors are integrable and that with a relaxed constraint related to zigzag symmetry, the full spin chain is integrable in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Truncation Crafted for UV-divergent QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) to systematically study RG flows that require the renormalization of coupling constants. This is a necessary step towards making HT a fully general method for QFT calculations. We apply this theory to a number of QFTs defined as relevant deformations of $d=1+1$ CFTs. We investigated three examples of increasing complexity: the deformed Ising, Tricritical-Ising, and non-unitary minimal model $M(3,7)$. The first two examples provide a crosscheck of our methodologies against well established characteristics of these theories. The $M(3,7)$ CFT deformed by its $Z_2$-even operators shows an intricate phase diagram that we clarify. At a boundary of this phase diagram we show that this theory flows, in the IR, to the $M(3,5)$ CFT.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>
