      <title>Evolution beats random chance: Performance-dependent network evolution for enhanced computational capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to understand structure-function relationships in networks across scientific disciplines has intensified. However, the optimal network architecture remains elusive, particularly for complex information processing. Therefore, we investigate how optimal and specific network structures form to efficiently solve distinct tasks using a novel framework of performance-dependent network evolution, leveraging reservoir computing principles. Our study demonstrates that task-specific minimal network structures obtained through this framework consistently outperform networks generated by alternative growth strategies and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks. Evolved networks exhibit unexpected sparsity and adhere to scaling laws in node-density space while showcasing a distinctive asymmetry in input and information readout nodes distribution. Consequently, we propose a heuristic for quantifying task complexity from performance-dependently evolved networks, offering valuable insights into the evolutionary dynamics of network structure-function relationships. Our findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of process-specific network evolution but also shed light on the design and optimization of complex information processing mechanisms, notably in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Self-organised dynamics beyond scaling of avalanches: Cyclic stress fluctuations in critical sandpiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognising changes in collective dynamics in complex systems is essential for predicting potential events and their development. Possessing intrinsic attractors with laws associated with scale invariance, self-organised critical dynamics represent a suitable example for quantitatively studying changes in collective behaviour. We consider two prototypal models of self-organised criticality, the sandpile automata with deterministic (Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld) and probabilistic (Manna model) dynamical rules, focusing on the nature of stress fluctuations induced by driving - adding grains during the avalanche propagation, and dissipation through avalanches that hit the system boundary. Our analysis of stress evolution time series reveals robust cycles modulated by collective fluctuations with dissipative avalanches. These modulated cycles are multifractal within a broad range of time scales. Features of the associated singularity spectra capture the differences in the dynamic rules behind the self-organised critical states and their response to the increased driving rate, altering the process stochasticity and causing a loss of avalanche scaling. In the related sequences of outflow current, the first return distributions are found to follow modified laws that describe different pathways to the gradual loss of cooperative behaviour in these two models. The spontaneous appearance of cycles is another characteristic of self-organised criticality. It can also help identify the prominence of self-organisational phenomenology in an empirical time series when underlying interactions and driving modes remain hidden.</description>

      <title>Two distinct transitions in a population of coupled oscillators with turnover: desynchronization and stochastic oscillation quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization, which is caused by mutual coupling, and turnover, which is the replacement of old components with new ones, are observed in various open systems consisting of many components. Although these phenomena can co-occur, the interplay of coupling and turnover has been overlooked. Here, we analyze coupled phase oscillators with turnover and reveal that two distinct transitions occur, depending on both coupling and turnover: desynchronization and what we name stochastic oscillation quenching. Importantly, the latter requires both the turnover and coupling to be sufficiently intense.</description>

      <title>$1/\varphi$ Spectrum of the Stress Dynamics with the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld Sandpile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the original Bak-Tang-Wisenefeld (BTW) sandpile we uncover the $1/\varphi$ noise in the mechanism maintaining self-organized criticality (SOC) - the question raised together with the concept of SOC. We posit that the dynamics of stress in the BTW sandpile follows quasi-cycles of graduate stress accumulation that end up with an abrupt stress-release and the drop of the system to subcritical state. In thermodynamic limit, the intra-cycle dynamics exhibits the $1/\varphi$ spectrum that extends infinitely and corresponds to the stress-release within the critical state.</description>

      <title>Forced oscillation source localization from generator measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Malfunctioning equipment, erroneous operating conditions or periodic load variations can cause periodic disturbances that would persist over time, creating an undesirable transfer of energy across the system -- an effect referred to as forced oscillations. Wide-area oscillations may damage assets, trigger inadvertent tripping or control actions, and be the cause of equipment failure. Unfortunately, for wide-area oscillations, the location, frequency, and amplitude of these forced oscillations may be hard to determine. Recently, a data-driven maximum-likelihood-based method was proposed to perform source localization in transmission grids under wide-area response scenarios. However, this method relies on full PMU coverage and all buses having inertia and damping. Here, we extend this method to realistic scenarios which includes buses without inertia or dumping, such as passive loads and inverter-based generators. Incorporating Kron reduction directly into the maximum likelihood estimator, we are able to identify the location and frequency of forcing applied at both traditional generators and loads.</description>
