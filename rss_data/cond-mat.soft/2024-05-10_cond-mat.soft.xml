      <title>Excluded volume effects on tangentially driven active ring polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformational and dynamical properties of active ring polymers are studied by numerical simulations. The two-dimensionally confined polymer is modeled as a closed bead-spring chain, driven by tangential forces, put in contact with a heat bath described by the Brownian multiparticle collision dynamics. Both phantom polymers and chains comprising excluded volume interactions are considered for different bending rigidities. The size and shape are found to be dependent on persistence length, driving force, and bead mutual exclusion. The lack of excluded volume interactions is responsible for a shrinkage of active rings when increasing driving force in the flexible limit while the presence induces a moderate swelling of chains. Internal dynamics of flexible phantom active rings shows activity-enhanced diffusive behavior at large activity values while, in the case of self-avoiding active chains, it is characterized by active ballistic motion not depending on stiffness. The long-time dynamics of active rings is marked by rotational motion whose period scales as the inverse of the applied tangential force, irrespective of persistence length and beads self-exclusion.</description>

      <title>Penetration of a spinning sphere impacting a granular medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate experimentally the influence of rotation on the penetration depth of a spherical projectile impacting a granular medium. We show that a rotational motion significantly increases the penetration depth achieved. Moreover, we model our experimental results by modifying the frictional term of the equation describing the penetration dynamics of an object in a granular medium. In particular, we find that the frictional drag decreases linearly with the velocity ratio between rotational (spin motion) and translational (falling motion) velocities. The good agreement between our model and our experimental measurements offers perspectives for estimating the depth that spinning projectiles reach after impacting onto a granular ground, such as happens with seeds dropped from aircraft or with landing probes.</description>

      <title>Prigogine-Defay ratio of glassy freezing scales with liquid fragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed study of published experimental data for a variety of materials on the incremental variation of heat capacity, thermal expansion, and compressibility at glassy freezing reveals a striking dependence of the Prigogine-Defay ratio R on the fragility index m. At high m, R approaches values of ~1, the Ehrenfest expectation for 2nd order continuous phase transitions, while R reaches values &gt; 20 for low fragilities. We explain this correlation by the degree of separation of the glassy freezing temperature from a hidden phase transition into an ideal low-temperature glass.</description>

      <title>Enhancing (quasi-)long-range order in a two-dimensional driven crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that 2D systems can exhibit crystalline phases with long-range translational order showcasing a striking violation of the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner (HMW) theorem which is valid at equilibrium. This is made possible by athermal driving mechanisms that inject energy into the system without exciting long wavelength modes of the density field. However, as thermal fluctuations are superimposed on the non-equilibrium driving, long-range translational order is inevitably lost. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of exploiting non-equilibrium effects to suppress arbitrarily large density fluctuations even when a global thermal bath is coupled to the system. We introduce a model of a harmonic crystal driven both by a global thermal bath and by a momentum conserving noise, where the typical observables related to density fluctuations and long-range translational order can be analytically derived and put in relation. This model allows us to rationalize the violation of the HMW theorem observed in previous studies through the prediction of large-wavelength phonons which thermalize at a vanishing effective temperature when the global bath is switched off. The conceptual framework introduced through this theory is then applied to numerical simulations of a hard-disk solid in contact with a thermal bath and driven out-of-equilibrium by active collisions. Our numerical analysis demonstrates how varying driving and dissipative parameters can lead to an arbitrary enhancement of the quasi-long-range order in the system regardless of the applied global noise amplitude. Finally, we outline a possible experimental procedure to apply our results to a realistic granular system.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic conductivity of aqueous electrolytes: beyond the first Wien effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conductivity of strong electrolytes increases under high electric fields, a nonlinear response known as the first Wien effect. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations we show that this nonlinear response is non-monotonic for moderately concentrated aqueous electrolytes. We attribute this unanticipated behavior to the fact that, under high electric fields, the permittivity of water decreases and becomes anisotropic. The permittivity tensor measured in the simulations can be reproduced by a model of water molecules as dipoles. We incorporate the resulting anisotropic interactions between the ions into a generalised Stochastic Density Field Theory and calculate ionic correlations as well as corrections to the Nernst-Einstein conductivity which are in good agreement with the numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Perturbing Dynamics of Active Emulsions and Their Collectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling fluidic flows in active droplets is crucial in developing intelligent models to understand and mimic single-celled microorganisms. Typically, these fluidic flows are affected by the interfacial dynamics of chemical agents. We found that these flows can be reconfigured by the mere presence of anisotropic solid boundary embedded within active droplets. Spontaneous fluidic flows dynamically orient an embedded magnetic cluster and the magnetic cluster, when realigned, causes these flows to reorient. Thus, providing an unprecedented control over the propulsion dynamics of chemotactic emulsions. When continuously perturbed, achiral emulsions exhibit emergent chiral motion with rotating fluidic flows. Such solid-fluid interactions removes barriers of specific emulsion chemistries and complements their inherent abilities thereby also enabling control over emergent collective behaviors of active droplets.</description>

      <title>Extension of Kirkwood-Buff theory: Partial enthalpies, fluctuations of energy density, temperature, and pressure, and solute-induced effects in a mixture solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a statistical mechanical theory of multi-component fluids, where we consider the correlation functions of the number densities and the energy density in the grand canonical ensemble. In terms of their space integrals we express the partial volumes ${\bar v}_i$, the partial enthalpies ${\bar H}_i$, and other thermodynamic derivatives. These ${\bar v}_i$ and ${\bar H}_i$ assume simple forms for binary mixtures and for ternary mixtures with a dilute solute. They are then related to the space-dependent thermal fluctuations of the temperature and the pressure. The space averages of these fluctuations are those introduced by Landau and Lifshits in the isothermal-isobaric ($T$-$p$) ensemble. We also give expressions for the long-range (nonlocal) correlations in the canonical and $T$-$p$ ensembles, which are inversely proportional to the system volume. For a mixture solvent, we examine the solvent-induced solute-solute attraction and the osmotic enthalpy changes due to the solute doping using the correlation function integrals.</description>

      <title>Localization and bistability of bioconvection in a doubly periodic domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A suspension of swimming microorganisms often generates a large-scale convective pattern known as bioconvection. In contrast to the thermal Rayleigh-Benard system, recent experimental studies report an emergence of steady localized convection patterns and bistability near the onset of instability in bioconvection systems. In this study, to understand the underlying mechanisms and identify the roles of particle self-propulsion in pattern formation, we theoretically and numerically investigate a model bioconvection system in a two-dimensional periodic boundary domain. In doing so, we extend a standard bioconvection model by introducing the equilibrium density profile as an independent parameter, for which the particle self-propulsion is treated as an independent dimensional parameter. Since the large-scale vertical structure dominates in this system, we are able to simplify the model by truncating the higher vertical modes. With this truncated model, we analytically derived the neutrally stable curve and found that the particle motility stabilizes the system. We then numerically analyzed the bifurcation diagram and found the bistable structure at the onset of instability. These findings, localization and bistability, are consistent with experimental observations. We further examined the global structure of the bistable dynamical system and found that the non-trivial unstable steady solution behaves as an edge state that separates the basins of attractors. These results highlight the importance of particle self-propulsion in bioconvection, and more generally our methodology based on the dynamical systems theory is useful in understanding complex flow patterns in nature.</description>

      <title>Environment-stored memory in active nematics and extra-cellular matrix remodeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many active systems display nematic order, while interacting with their environment. In this work, we show theoretically how environment-stored memory acts an effective external field that aligns active nematics. The coupling to the environment leads to substantial modifications of the known phase diagram and dynamics of active nematics, including nematic order at arbitrarily low densities and arrested domain coarsening. We are motivated mainly by cells that remodel fibers in their extra-cellular matrix (ECM), while being directed by the fibers during migration. Our predictions indicate that remodeling promotes cellular and ECM alignment, and possibly limits the range of ordered ECM domains, in accordance with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>GCMe: Efficient implementation of the Gaussian core model with smeared electrostatic interactions for molecular dynamics simulations of soft matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a pivotal tool for understanding the structure, dynamics, and phase behavior in charged soft matter systems. To explore phenomena across greater length and time scales in MD simulations, molecules are often coarse-grained for better computational performance. However, commonly-used force fields represent particles as hard-core interaction centers with point charges, which often overemphasizes the packing effect and short-range electrostatics, especially in systems with bulky deformable organic molecules and systems with strong coarse-graining. This underscores the need for an efficient soft-core model to physically capture the effective interactions between coarse-grained particles. To this end, we implement a soft-core model uniting the Gaussian core model with smeared electrostatic interactions that is phenomenologically equivalent to recent theoretical models. We first parameterize it generically using water as the model solvent. Then, we benchmark its performance in the OpenMM toolkit for different boundary conditions to highlight a computational speedup of up to $34\times$ compared to commonly used force fields and existing implementations. Finally, we demonstrate its utility by investigating how boundary polarizability affects the adsorption behavior of a polyelectrolyte solution on perfectly conducting and nonmetal electrodes.</description>
