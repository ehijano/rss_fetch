      <title>Scaling laws for passive polymer dynamics in active turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems commonly combine intrinsically out-of-equilibrium active components with passive polymeric inclusions to produce unique material properties. To explore these composite systems, idealized models - such as polymers in active fluids - are essential to develop a predictive theoretical framework. We simulate a single, freely jointed passive chain in two-dimensional active turbulence. Active flows advect the polymer, producing a substantially enhanced diffusivity. Our results reveal that the dimensionless diffusivity obeys scaling laws governed by the P\'eclet, Weissenberg, and Ericksen numbers, which paves the way for designing active/polymeric hybrid materials with predictable properties that differ significantly from those of nondeformable inclusions.</description>

      <title>Active magneto gyrator as a tunable heat engine or heat pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermodynamic performance characteristics of an active magneto-gyrator taking into account the two-dimensional motion of an inertial charged active particle confined in an asymmetric parabolic potential and in contact with two heat baths kept at two different temperatures.
  A magnetic field of constant magnitude is applied in a direction perpendicular to the plane of motion.
  In such a system, the particle exhibits a gyrating motion across the potential minimum and exerts a torque on the confining potential as long as there is a potential asymmetry and temperature gradient. Hence, this system can operate as an active magneto-heat engine or pump in the presence of a load force. Interestingly, we observe that the activity or self-propulsion impacts the thermodynamic performance characteristics of the gyrator only in the presence of the magnetic field. We examine two scenarios: first, by applying a load in a direction opposing the torque and second, by applying a load in the same direction as that of torque.
  In the first case, for a fixed parameter regime, the gyrator is found to act as a heat engine or a heat pump depending on the strength of the applied load, whereas in the latter case, it can only operate as a heat pump. Moreover, unlike the Brownian gyrator or Brownian magneto gyrator, captivatingly, the efficiency is found to have no universal upper bound and can be made $100\%$ by tuning the system parameters. Additionally, when the system is suspended in a viscoelastic medium characterized by the presence of a finite memory, for a short persistence of memory and a fixed duration of activity, the efficiency can be $100\%$ even for more than one value of viscoelastic memory timescale.</description>

      <title>Experiments and modeling of mechanically-soft, hard magnetorheological foams with potential applications in haptic sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel mechanically-soft and magnetically-hard magnetorheological foam that, upon deformation, leads to robust and measurable magnetic flux changes in its surroundings. This allows to infer qualitatively and even quantitatively the imposed deformation and, eventually from that, an estimation of the stiffness and average stress on the sample even in complex loading scenarios involving combinations of uniform or nonuniform compression/tension with superposed shearing at in different directions. The work provides a complete experimental, theoretical and numerical framework on finite strain, compressible magneto-elasticity, thereby allowing to measure and predict coupled magneto-mechanical properties of such materials and then use it to estimate and design potential haptic sensing devices.</description>

      <title>(Dis)continuous buckling transition in elastic shell mediated by contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snap-buckling is a rapid shape transition in slender structures, appearing as a fundamental switching mechanism of natural and man-made systems. Boundary conditions of structures are crucial to predict and control their snap-buckling behavior. However, the general framework that relates boundary conditions, geometry, and performance of structures is still absent to date. Here, we study the snap-buckling of hemispherical shells in contact with rigid cylinders of different diameters to uncover the roles of boundary conditions in the dynamic performance of shells. Specifically, we analyze the jumping dynamics of the pneumatically inverted shells placed on the rigid cylinder by combining experiments and analytical theory. We find the characteristic diameter classifying the snap-buckling and jumping dynamics into two: (i)~if the diameter of the cylinder is sufficiently larger than the characteristic diameter, the shell is regarded as in contact with the infinitely large flat plate, (ii)~if not, the cylinder is regarded as a point. The analytical predictions for the jumping performance of the shell supplemented with the characteristic diameter are in excellent agreement with our experimental results. Our study clarifies that contact geometry is crucial in predicting the pathway of snap-buckling, indicating that the dynamic performance of soft robots would be optimized by tuning their surface geometry.</description>

      <title>Flow of a two-dimensional liquid foam: Impact of surfactant type and boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we experimentally investigate the rheological and flow behavior of two-dimensional (2D) monodisperse aqueous foams, sheared between parallel plates using a custom-made rheo-optical apparatus with smooth and roughened walls. The foams were prepared using two commercially available detergents, Foam 1 and Foam2, while maintaining similar bubble sizes and liquid fractions. The linear viscoelastic results reveal that the Foam 1 consistently exhibits higher elastic and loss moduli than the Foam 2, regardless of boundary conditions, with roughened walls further enhancing these moduli in both foams. Additionally, the Foam 1 shows a lower viscoelastic relaxation frequency compared to the Foam 2, indicating a less mobile interface for the Foam 1. In the non-linear regime, significant differences were observed. Under smooth boundary conditions, Foam 2 exhibits yield stress behavior, whereas Foam 1 does not, despite having higher viscous stresses. The viscous stress in the Foam 1 scales with the capillary number, while for the Foam 2, the scaling depends on the boundary conditions differently for smooth walls and for roughened walls. These variations in rheological behavior are attributed to differences in surfactant chemistry, leading to different interface mobilities, with the Foam1 having a less mobile interface compared to the Foam 2.</description>

      <title>Drops on architected elastic substrates: A repertoire of regimes at the turn of a knob</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drops on a vibrating substrate can experience a variety of motion regimes, including directional motion and climbing. The key ingredient to elicit these regimes is simultaneously activating the in-plane and out-of-plane degrees of freedom of the substrate with the proper phase difference. This is typically achieved by using a rigid substrate and two independent actuators. However, this framework is unable to establish different motion conditions in different regions of the substrate, achieving spatial variability and selectivity, since this would violate the rigid-body assumption and require a proliferation of actuation channels. Challenging this paradigm, we leverage the inherent elasticity of the substrate to provide the modal and spatial diversity required to establish the desired regimes. To this end, we design deformable substrates exhibiting a rich landscape of deformation modes, and we exploit their multi-modal response to switch between drop motion regimes and select desired spatial patterns, using the excitation frequency as our tuning parameter.</description>

      <title>Load-dependent resistive-force theory for helical filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The passive rotation of rigid helical filaments is the propulsion strategy used by flagellated bacteria and some artificial microswimmers to navigate at low Reynolds numbers. In a classical 1976 paper, Lighthill calculated the `optimal' resistance coefficients in a local (logarithmically accurate) resistive-force theory that best approximates predictions from the nonlocal (algebraically accurate) slender-body theory for force-free swimming of a rotating helix without an attached load (e.g., no cell body). These coefficients have since been widely applied, often beyond the conditions for which they were originally derived. Here, we revisit the problem for the case where a load is attached to the rotating filament, such as the cell body of a bacterium or the head of an artificial swimmer. We show that the optimal resistance coefficients depend in fact on the size of the load, and we quantify the increasing inaccuracy of Lighthill's coefficients as the load grows. Finally, we provide a physical explanation for the origin of this unexpected load-dependence.</description>

      <title>Multiparticle Collision Dynamics Simulations of the Flagellar Apparatus in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the swimming dynamics, orientational behavior, and hydrodynamic interactions of the flagellar apparatus (FA) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD) simulations. Extending the model established in Yang et al., we simulate the FA as a chain of monomers connected by elastic springs. Our simulations reveal that an FA with a nonzero mean curvature in its flagellar beat pattern exhibits sustained ballistic motion for several hundred beats before crossing over to a diffusion-dominated regime due to rotational diffusion. In contrast, $FA_0$, a flagellar apparatus consisting of two flagella with zero average curvature positioned head-to-head, fails to achieve net propulsion due to its mirror-symmetric deformations, confirming that non-reciprocal shape deformation is necessary but not sufficient condition for propulsion. The orientational auto-correlation function (OACF) of FA decays exponentially, aligning with that of an inactive FA, while the OACF of $FA_0$ also follows an exponential decay, similar to an inactive $FA_0$. These findings indicate that active beating does not influence the rotational diffusion of the flagellar apparatus. Additionally, simulations of an asymmetric FA, where the arms beat at different frequencies, corroborate experimental observations, revealing a helical swimming trajectory. When two FAs swim along the same axis in close proximity, they form stable pairs, leading to enhanced swimming speeds. Conversely, head-on encounters result in mutual blocking, preventing any net displacement. These findings provide valuable insights into the collective behavior of microswimmers and their hydrodynamic interactions in low Reynolds number environments.</description>

      <title>Structured Random Binding: a minimal model of protein-protein interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe Structured Random Binding (SRB), a minimal model of protein-protein interactions rooted in the statistical physics of disordered systems. In this model, nonspecific binding is a generic consequence of the interaction between random proteins, exhibiting a phase transition from a high temperature state where nonspecific complexes are transient and lack well-defined interaction interfaces, to a low temperature state where the complex structure is frozen and a definite interaction interface is present. Numerically, weakly-bound nonspecific complexes can evolve into tightly-bound, highly specific complexes, but only if the structural correlation length along the peptide backbone is short; moreover, evolved tightly-bound homodimers favor the same interface structure that is predominant in real protein homodimers.</description>

      <title>When invariants matter: The role of I1 and I2 in neural network models of incompressible hyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the formulation of machine learning-based material models, the usage of invariants of deformation tensors is attractive, since this can a priori guarantee objectivity and material symmetry. In this work, we consider incompressible, isotropic hyperelasticity, where two invariants I1 and I2 are required for depicting a deformation state. First, we aim at enhancing the understanding of the invariants. We provide an explicit representation of the set of invariants that are admissible, i.e. for which (I1, I2) a deformation state does indeed exist. Furthermore, we prove that uniaxial and equi-biaxial deformation correspond to the boundary of the set of admissible invariants. Second, we study how the experimentally-observed behaviour of different materials can be captured by means of neural network models of incompressible hyperelasticity, depending on whether both I1 and I2 or solely one of the invariants, i.e. either only I1 or only I2, are taken into account. To this end, we investigate three different experimental data sets from the literature. In particular, we demonstrate that considering only one invariant, either I1 or I2, can allow for good agreement with experiments in case of small deformations. In contrast, it is necessary to consider both invariants for precise models at large strains, for instance when rubbery polymers are deformed. Moreover, we show that multiaxial experiments are strictly required for the parameterisation of models considering I2. Otherwise, if only data from uniaxial deformation is available, significantly overly stiff responses could be predicted for general deformation states. On the contrary, I1-only models can make qualitatively correct predictions for multiaxial loadings even if parameterised only from uniaxial data, whereas I2-only models are completely incapable in even qualitatively capturing experimental stress data at large deformations.</description>

Abstract: We have analyzed phenology data and protein configurations from molecular dynamics simulations with the nonlinear forecasting method proposed by May and Sugihara. Our primary focus in this work is to characterize the dynamic state of a system by quantifying prediction quality from data. Full plots of prediction quality as a function of dimensionality $E$ and forecasting time $T_p$, the two basic parameters of the method, give fast and valuable information about Complex Systems dynamics. We detect changes in protein dynamics due to mutations and, regarding ecology data, we show how cycles and {\it rhythms} of the environment manifests in parameter space $(E,T_p)$ for some species.</description>

Abstract: The complexation of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and thermoresponsive microgels is widely exploited for applications, but a microscopic description of the mechanisms governing the spatial organization of the NPs is still lacking. Combining small angle X-ray scattering, state-of-the-art simulations and a simple toy model, we uncover how the volume phase transition of microgels controls NP-NP interactions, establishing for the first time a microscopic link between plasmon coupling and NP local structure. Our study paves the way to experimentally investigate phase transitions on controlled curved surfaces at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Equatorial deformation of homogeneous spherical fluid vesicles by a rigid ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the deformation of homogeneous spherical fluid vesicles along their equator by a circular rigid ring. We consider deformations preserving the axial and equatorial mirror symmetries of the vesicles. The configurations of the vesicle are determined employing the spontaneous curvature model subject to the constraints imposed by the ring as well as of having constant area or volume. We determine two expressions of the force exerted by the ring, one involving a discontinuity in the derivative of the curvature of the membrane across the ring, and another one in terms of the global quantities of the vesicle. For small enough values of the spontaneous curvature there is only one sequence of configurations for either fixed area or volume. The behavior of constricted vesicles is similar for both constraints, they follow a transition from prolate to dumbbell shapes, which culminates in two quasispherical vesicles connected by a small catenoid-like neck. We analyze the geometry and the force of the small neck employing a perturbative analysis about the catenoid. A stretched vesicle initially adopts an oblate shape for either constraint. If the area is fixed the vesicle increasingly flattens until it attains a disclike shape, which we examine using an asymptotic analysis. If the volume is fixed the poles approach until they touch and the vesicle adopts a discocyte shape. When the spontaneous curvature of the vesicle is close to the mean curvature of the constricted quasispherical vesicles, the sequences of configurations of both constraints develop bifurcations, and some of the configurations corresponding to one of their branches have the lowest energy.</description>

      <title>A midsurface elasticity model for a thin, nonlinear, gradient elastic plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a dynamic surface elasticity model for the two-dimensional midsurface of a thin, three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, nonlinear gradient elastic plate of thickness $h$. The resulting model is parameterized by five, conceivably measurable, physical properties of the plate, and the stored surface energy reduces to Koiter's plate energy in a singular limiting case. The model corrects a theoretical issue found in wave propagation in thin sheets and, when combined with the author's theory of Green elastic bodies possessing gradient elastic material boundary surfaces, removes the singularities present in fracture within traditional/classical models. Our approach diverges from previous research on thin shells and plates, which primarily concentrated on deriving elasticity theories for material surfaces from classical three-dimensional Green elasticity. This work is the first in rigorously developing a surface elasticity model based on a parent nonlinear gradient elasticity theory.</description>

      <title>Stochastic heat differences between many-particle and density field descriptions</title>

Abstract: This article investigates spatiotemporally discrete or continuous stochastic descriptions, where we focus on differences in heat naturally defined between the particle level and the density field. Both the descriptions are found to generally make the heat differences by the entropic term expressed just with the number density through spatial projection from the many particles' positions onto the density field. The transformation from the Langevin to Dean--Kawasaki equations is considered as the projection in the continuous descriptions, where the emergent heat differences undergo little temporal variations due to the sparse distributions of the point-particles. On the other hand, the analogous formalisms constructed in the discrete models may exhibit the explicit temporal evolutions of the entropic term. Furthermore, we develop arguments about the interpretation and applicability of the heat differences as well as the perspectives to many-polymer system.</description>

      <title>Settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspension of spherical and cubic particles in Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08091</link>

Abstract: The present study investigates the gravity-driven settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspensions of spherical and cubic particles within a triply periodic domain. The effect of solid volume fraction on the evolving microstructure of a suspension is numerically examined by employing the Rigid MultiBlob method under Stokes flow conditions. Our simulations accurately reproduce macroscopic trends observed in experiments and show strong agreement with established semi-empirical correlations over a wide range of volume fractions. It is observed that the hydrodynamic interactions between particles and the surrounding fluid dominate the settling mechanism at low to moderate solid volume fractions, whereas, frequent collisions between particles in a highly packed space tend to suppress velocity fluctuations at denser regime. The transport properties for dilute suspensions are found to be primarily shaped by an anisotropic microstructure, though this anisotropy decreases as many-body interactions significantly grow at higher volume fractions. Notably, cubic particles exhibit lower anisotropy in velocity fluctuations compared to spheres, due to more effective momentum and energy transfer from the gravity-driven direction to transverse directions. Moreover, cubic particles also display higher velocity fluctuations and particle rebounding after collisions, which may create a transient tendency for cubes to move against gravity more readily than spheres. The distinctive behaviors of cubic and spherical particles can notably influence the efficiency of size segregation in bidisperse mixtures. Interestingly, local velocity fluctuation intensity increases for both particle types in mixed suspensions, affecting the local sedimentation velocity field. Overall, spherical particles are found to settle faster than cubes at low to moderate volume fractions.</description>
