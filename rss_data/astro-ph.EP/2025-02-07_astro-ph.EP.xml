      <title>Environmental effects on nearby debris discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the effect of the ISM on debris disc occurrence rates and on the morphologies of the discs. We used results from the Herschel Space Observatory DUNES and DEBRIS surveys of 295 nearby FGK dwarf stars imaged at 100 $\mu$m and 160 $\mu$m. Most of the 48 debris discs in this sample have small optical depths, making them more likely to be affected by the ISM compared to optically thick discs. Since the stars in our sample are located within the Local Interstellar Cloud, we can infer that their debris discs encounter similar conditions. This allows us to use the stellar space velocity as a single indicator of the forces that can act on the debris disc dust grains when they interact with the ISM. The observed debris disc occurrence rates seem to depend on the stellar space velocities, as expected under the hypothesis that stars with higher space velocities have a higher probability of losing their circumstellar dust. The percentage of sources with debris discs in our sample reaches a maximum of $\approx$25% for stars with low space velocity component values, $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$, relative to the local ISM, and decreases for larger $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$ values down to the 10% level. A decrease in the average disc fractional luminosity as a function of $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$ is also observed. These dependences do not disappear after accounting for the reported higher dispersion of $U$ values with age. In extended discs, the impact of the ISM could also explain the links observed between the stellar space velocities and the debris disc projected ellipticities, position angles, and radii. Although these indications may not be fully conclusive on their own, they collectively reinforce the hypothesis that the ISM influences the occurrence rates and morphologies of debris discs.</description>

      <title>Electron-induced CO2 and hydrocarbon sputtering of functionalized hydrocarbons in icy planetary analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CO2 has been detected in both the tenuous exosphere and surface chaos regions of Europa, but it is still unclear whether this CO2 is generated in situ by radiolysis or whether it is directly delivered by the ocean. In this work, we study the radiolysis pathway, and explore the possibility that organics upwelled from the subsurface oceans could be contributing to this signature on the surface and in the exosphere. Specifically, we report here on the evolution of carbon-containing byproducts generated by electron-induced sputtering of organics with different functional groups -- hexanoic acid, hexanol, and hexane -- in water ice. We found that, upon electron irradiation in vacuum, the acid-functionalized molecules generated a factor of over 10x more CO2 than either the non-functionalized or alcohol-functionalized molecules, but that all three species produced CO2 to some extent. The amount of CO2 produced was found to depend upon temperature. CO2 was the dominant product for ices at 100 K and 120 K, and production of CO2 was 3x higher at 100 and 120 K than at 80 K. Sputtering of long chain molecules such as pentane was a factor of 100x higher in the hexanoic acid-containing ice than in the hexane/hexanol ice, suggesting that organics with carboxylic acid (COOH) functional groups may be also more likely to produce volatile species that can be ejected into the exosphere.</description>

      <title>From Planetesimals to Dwarf Planets by Pebble Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size distribution of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in the Kuiper Belt provides crucial insights into the formation and evolution of the outer Solar System. Recent observational surveys, including OSSOS++, have revealed that dynamically cold and hot TNO populations exhibit similar size distributions for dimmer objects ($H_r &gt; 5$), which are consistent with planetesimal formation by streaming instability (SI). However, the hot population contains a significantly larger number of massive bodies, including several dwarf planets. In this study, we investigate the role of pebble accretion in shaping the size distribution of hot TNOs, after their formation in the primordial disk (PB) between 20 and 30 au and before these bodies were dynamically implanted into their current orbits by a migrating Neptune. We find that pebble accretion grows the most massive bodies only, consistent with the flattening of the distribution brightwards of $H_r=5$. All results point to a correlation (degeneracy) between the pebble aerodynamic size and the intensity of the gas motions. Nevertheless, accretion from an inward-drifting stream of pebbles is unlikely, as it puts extreme demands on the mass budget of pebbles. In particular, the masses of the cold classicals are too low to trigger pebble accretion. Accretion in an environment where pebbles are entrained, as believed to be the case in ALMA rings, is preferable. Combining the constraints obtained from this study with ALMA imagery morphology fitting reveals a typical pebble aerodynamic size of $\tau_s \sim 10^{-2}$, a turbulent diffusivity parameter $\alpha_D\sim10^{-3}$, and a total accreted pebble mass of ${\sim}10\,m_\oplus$ in the primordial belt. Those TNOs formed through significant pebble accretion with masses exceeding ${\sim}10^{-4}\,m_\oplus$ are likely to satisfy the International Astronomical Union's "round shape" criterion for dwarf planets.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Kinematic MHD on the Atmospheric Circulation of Eccentric Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are typically considered to be tidally locked due to their short orbital periods. The extreme irradiation can result in atmospheric species becoming thermally ionized on the dayside, which then interact with the planet's magnetic field by resisting flow across magnetic field lines, shaping the atmospheric structure. However, an eccentric orbit results in temporally dependent irradiation and a non-permanent dayside, as the planet-star distance can change drastically during its orbit. In this paper, we present 3D atmospheric models of TOI-150b, an eccentric (e=0.26), Jupiter-mass 1.75 M_Jup planet whose equilibrium temperature varies from 1300K to 1700K. We conduct simulations for magnetic field strengths ranging from 0-30 Gauss using the kinematic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approach. When compared to simulations of the planet assuming a circular orbit, we find that the eccentric orbit results in a strengthened and narrowed equatorial jet, westward winds at mid-latitudes, and a phase-dependent thermal inversion. The strength and magnitude of these effects scale with the chosen global magnetic field strength. We also generate high-resolution (R=100,000) emission spectra to study net Doppler shifts and find inter-orbit spectroscopic variability at moderate magnetic field strengths, as well as decreased Doppler broadening as magnetic field strengths increase. This work represents the first time that the kinematic MHD approach has been applied to an eccentric hot Jupiter and highlights the importance of a locally calculated, temperature dependent magnetic drag prescription for predicting atmospheric structure and resulting spectra.</description>

      <title>Energy needed to propel a tiny spacecraft to Proxima Centauri,and, an unstated assumption in Einstein's 1905 paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Breakthrough Starshot project aims to send a tiny 2 gram spacecraft to Proxima Centauri propelled by a light sail and powerful Earth-based lasers. We provide two derivations of the laser energy required to propel the spacecraft and give the reader the opportunity to decide which one is correct before providing the answer. In the second part of this paper we point out that one of the formulae in Einstein's amazing 1905 paper is correct only in certain limits, but Einstein fails to mention that. This has caused some confusion in the Breakthrough Starshot literature.</description>

      <title>Early Accretion of Large Amounts of Solids for Directly-Imaged Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the number of planetary mass objects (PMOs, $\lessapprox$13 M$_{\rm{Jupiter}}$) at wider separation ($\gtrapprox$10 AU) grows, there is emerging evidence that they form differently from their higher-mass brown-dwarf (BD) counterparts. Specifically, PMOs' atmospheres are often enriched by metals and show a large dispersion of metallicity, which is usually interpreted as a sign of solid accretion. {{As a first step toward a population-level study of the amount and timing of solid accretion, }}we analyze a sample of seven directly-imaged exoplanets with measured stellar and planetary chemical abundances (51 Eri b, $\beta$ Pic b, HIP 65426 b, HR 8799 c and e, AF Lep b, and YSES 1 c). Our analysis uses existing data of stellar and planetary atmospheric metallicities, and adopts a Bayesian framework that marginalizes the probabilities of disk conditions, formation locations, {{planetary interior structures}}, and accretion physics. We show that these PMOs accrete large amounts of solids {{regardless of whether they form via core accretion or disk instability}}. On average $\gtrapprox$50 M$_\oplus$ solids are accreted to enrich planet atmospheres. {{Individual planet accretes between 23.3 and 223.2 M$_\oplus$ of solid mass, more than 75\% of which is assumed to stay in the atmosphere and increase the observed metallicity.}} The result implies that the solid accretion process and therefore the planet formation process {{likely take place}} at an early stage {{($\lessapprox$2 Myr)}} when large amounts of solids are available in young {{massive}} protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Photoevaporation from Inner Protoplanetary Disks Confronted with Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decades-long explorations on the dispersal of protoplanetary disks involve many debates about photoevaporation versus magnetized wind launching mechanisms. This letter argues that the observed winds originating from the inner disk ($R\lesssim 0.3$ AU) cannot be explained by the photoevaporative mechanism. Energy conservation requires the presumed photoevaporative winds to be heated to $\gtrsim 10^5$ K when launched from inner disks. However, due to efficient thermal accommodation with dust grains and cooling processes at high densities, X-ray irradiation at energies above 1 keV cannot efficiently launch winds in the first place because of its high penetration. Some studies claiming X-ray wind launching have oversimplified the thermochemical couplings. Furthermore, heating the gas to escape velocity will over-ionize it, suppressing the species responsible for observed forbidden lines (e.g., [OI] 6300 $\r{A}$ ). Confirmed by semi-analytic integrations of thermochemical fluid structures, such high ionizations contradict the observed emission of neutral and singly-ionized atoms from the winds originating from the inner disks.</description>

      <title>Rapid hydrofracture of icy moon shells: insights from glaciology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Europa's surface exhibits many regions of complex topography termed 'chaos terrains'. One set of hypotheses for chaos terrain formation requires upward migration of liquid water from perched water bodies within the icy shell formed by convection and tidal heating. However, consideration of the behavior of terrestrial ice sheets suggests the upwards movement of water from englacial water bodies is uncommon. Instead, rapid downwards hydrofracture from supraglacial lakes - unbounded given a sufficient volume of water - can occur in relatively low tensile stress states given a sufficiently deep initial fracture due to the negative relative buoyancy of water. I suggest that downwards, not upwards, fracture may be more reasonable for perched water bodies but show that full hydrofracture is unlikely if the perched water body is located beneath a mechanically strong icy lid. However, full hydrofracture is possible in the event of lid break up over a perched water body and likely in the event of a meteor impact that generates sufficient meltwater and a tensile shock. This provides a possible mechanism for the transfer of biologically important nutrients to the subsurface ocean and the formation of chaos terrains.</description>

      <title>Magnetic disk winds in protoplanetary disks: Description of the model and impact on global disk evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Canonically, a protoplanetary disk is thought to undergo (gravito-)viscous evolution, wherein the angular momentum of the accreting material is transported outwards. However, several lines of reasoning suggest that the turbulent viscosity in a typical protoplanetary disk is insufficient to drive the observed accretion rates. An emerging paradigm suggests that radially extended magnetic disk winds may play a crucial role in the disk evolution. We propose a global model of magnetic wind-driven accretion for evolution of protoplanetary disks, based on the insights gained from local shearing box simulations. Here we develop this model and constrain its parameters with the help of theoretical expectations and comparison with observations. The magnetic wind is characterized with the associated loss of angular momentum and mass, which depend on the local disk conditions and stellar properties. We incorporate the disk winds self-consistently in the code FEOSAD and study formation and long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks. We include disk self-gravity and an adaptive turbulent alpha, while the co-evolution of dust is also considered. Synthetic observations are obtained via radiation thermo-chemical code ProDiMo. The models with inclusion of disk winds satisfy general expectations from both theory and observations. The disk wind parameters can be guided by observational constraints and the synthetic observations resulting from such a model compare favorably with the selected ALMA survey data of Class II disks. The proposed magnetic disk wind model is a significant step forward in the direction of representing a more complete disk evolution, wherein the disk experiences concurrent torques from viscous, gravitational, and magnetic wind processes.</description>
