      <title>General base change for relative Du Bois complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A partial answer is given to a question raised by Kov\'acs and Taji in arxiv:2307.07192, namely that the relative Du Bois complex of a family parametrized by a non-singular curve commutes with base change to a general point on the base. It is also shown that this property usually fails for special points.</description>

      <title>A note on the Nielsen realization problem for Enriques manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a numerical criterion for the Nielsen realization problem for Enriques manifolds, based on the recent developments on the Birman-Hilden theory for hyper-K\"ahler manifolds and on Nielsen realization for hyper-K\"ahler manifolds. We apply the criterion to known examples of Enriques manifolds to get explicit groups that can be realized or not realized, and comment on questions related to the Nielsen realization problem.</description>

      <title>Tropical cluster varieties of type C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly describe the tropicalization of a cluster variety of finite type C, realizing it as the space of axially symmetric phylogenetic trees. We also find all occurring sign patterns of coordinates, for both the cluster variety and the cluster configuration space. We realize the corresponding signed tropicalizations as subfans of the tropicalization, with each such subfan dual to either a cyclohedron or an associahedron. As additional results, we construct Gr\"obner and tropical bases for the defining ideals of both varieties, and classify the arising toric degenerations.</description>

      <title>On the Perversity of Chern Classes for Compactified Jacobians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove some perversity bounds for the Chern classes of a compactified Jacobian fibration, namely the $k$-th Chern class of the compactified Jacobian has perversity $\leq k$. Our results are motivic in nature, and we also prove a filtration version of a conjecture raised in arxiv:2402:08861.</description>

      <title>Theta-Categories and Tannakian duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of $\Theta$-categories, which is a refinement of the notion of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. We use this notion to prove a Tannakian duality statement, relating $\Theta$-categories with fpqc-stacks by means of a certain stack of fiber functors in the context of $\Theta$-categories. This provides, over a base ring of arbitrary characteristic, a strong link between Tannakian $\Theta$-categories and the schematic homotopy types.</description>

Abstract: Given a differential operator of geometric origin there exists a list of operations that preserve this property, e.g., tensor products, pull-backs, push-forwards and the middle convolution.

      <title>Nonrational varieties with unirational parametrizations of coprime degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exists a $2$-dimensional family of smooth cubic threefolds admitting unirational parametrizations of coprime degrees. This together with Clemens--Griffiths' work solves the long standing open problem whether there exists a nonrational variety with unirational parametrizations of coprime degrees. Our proof uses a new approach, called the Noether--Cremona method, for determining the rationality of quotients of hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Towards Motivic Coactions at Genus One from Zeta Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motivic coaction of multiple zeta values and multiple polylogarithms encodes both structural insights on and computational methods for scattering amplitudes in a variety of quantum field theories and in string theory. In this work, we propose coaction formulae for iterated integrals over holomorphic Eisenstein series that arise from configuration-space integrals at genus one. Our proposal is motivated by formal similarities between the motivic coaction and the single-valued map of multiple polylogarithms at genus zero that are exposed in their recent reformulations via zeta generators. The genus-one coaction of this work is then proposed by analogies with the construction of single-valued iterated Eisenstein integrals via zeta generators at genus one. We show that our proposal exhibits the expected properties of a coaction and deduce $f$-alphabet decompositions of the multiple modular values obtained from regularized limits.</description>

      <title>Plabic Tangles and Cluster Promotion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the BCFW recurrence for tilings of the amplituhedron, we introduce the general framework of `plabic tangles' that utilizes plabic graphs to define rational maps between products of Grassmannians called `promotions'. The central conjecture of the paper is that promotion maps are quasi-cluster homomorphisms, which we prove for several classes of promotions. In order to define promotion maps, we utilize $m$-vector-relation configurations ($m$-VRCs) on plabic graphs. We relate $m$-VRCs to the degree (a.k.a `intersection number') of the amplituhedron map on positroid varieties and characterize all plabic trees with intersection number one and their VRCs. Finally, we show that promotion maps admit an operad structure and, supported by the class of `$4$-mass box' promotion, we point at new positivity properties for non-rational maps beyond cluster algebras. Promotion maps have important connections to the geometry and cluster structure of the amplituhedron and singularities of scattering amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian polynomials and matroids over triangular hyperfields 1: Topological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentzian polynomials serve as a bridge between continuous and discrete convexity, connecting analysis and combinatorics. In this article, we study the topology of the space $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ of Lorentzian polynomials on $J$ modulo $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, which is nonempty if and only if $J$ is the set of bases of a polymatroid. We prove that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is a manifold with boundary of dimension equal to the Tutte rank of $J$, and more precisely, that it is homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball with the Dressian of $J$ removed from its boundary. Furthermore, we show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is homeomorphic to the thin Schubert cell $\textrm{Gr}_J(\mathbb{T}_q)$ of $J$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_q$, introduced by Viro in the context of tropical geometry and Maslov dequantization, for any $q&gt;0$. This identification enables us to apply the representation theory of polymatroids developed in a companion paper, as well as earlier work by the first and fourth authors on foundations of matroids, to give a simple explicit description of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ up to homeomorphism in several key cases. Our results show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ always admits a compactification homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball. They can also be used to answer a question of Br\"and\'en in the negative by showing that the closure of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ within the space of all polynomials modulo $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ is not homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball in general. In addition, we introduce the Hausdorff compactification of the space of rescaling classes of Lorentzian polynomials and show that the Chow quotient of a complex Grassmannian maps naturally to this compactification. This provides a geometric framework that connects the asymptotic structure of the space of Lorentzian polynomials with classical constructions in algebraic geometry.</description>

Abstract: We consider a derivation D on the ring ${\Lambda}$ of symmetric functions and investigate its combinatorial, algebraic and geometric properties. More precisely, we show that D restricts to a quasi-isometry, with respect to the Hall product, on the graded component of ${\Lambda}$ of each positive degree and provide a chain-rule formula with respect to the plethysm operation. Furthermore, we relate the geometric shape of D(f), where f $\in {\Lambda}$ is an homogeneous symmetric function, to that of f. An application to the shape of the partitions appearing in a given plethysms is proved.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16187v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete answer to the rationality problem (up to stable $k$-equivalence) for norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ of $K/k$ whose Galois closures $L/k$ are $A_5\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_4)$ and ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_8)$ extensions. In particular, we prove that $T$ is stably $k$-rational for $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{8})$, $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\simeq (C_2)^3$ and $H\simeq (C_2)^3\rtimes C_7$ where $C_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$ by using GAP computations with the aid of PARI/GP. Based on the result, we conjecture that $T$ is stably $k$-rational for $G\simeq {\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{F}_{2^d})$, $(C_2)^d\leq H\leq (C_2)^d\rtimes C_{2^d-1}$. Some other cases $G\simeq A_n$, $S_n$, ${\rm GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm PGL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$, ${\rm PSL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{p^d})$ and $H\lneq G$ are also investigated for small $n$ and $p^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a link between open positroid varieties in the Grassmannians $G(k,n)$ and certain moduli spaces of complexes of vector bundles over Kodaira cycle $C^n$, using the shifted Poisson structure on the latter moduli spaces and relating them to a certain twist of the standard Poisson structure on $G(k,n)$. %by a bivector field on its maximal torus. This link allows us to solve a classification problem for extensions of vector bundles over $C^n$. Based on this solution we further classify the symplectic leaves of all positroid varieties in $G(k,n)$ with respect to the twisted standard Poisson structure. Moreover, we get an explicit description of the moduli stack of symplectic leaves of $G(k,n)$ with the twisted standard Poisson structure as an open substack of the stack of vector bundles on $C^n$.</description>

Abstract: Our main result is that chaos in dimension $n+1$ is a one-dimensional geometrical object embedded in a geometrical object of dimension $n$ which corresponds to a $n$ dimensional object which is either singular or non-singular. Our main result is then that this chaos occurs in the first case as either on an isolated or non-isolated singularity. In the first case this chaos is either boundary chaos or spherical chaos which is what happens also in the non-singular case. In the case of an isolated singular geometry one has chaos which can either be boundary, spherical or tubular chaos. We furthermore prove that the prime numbers display quantum behaviour.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Proof of Hrushovski's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his paper on the Mordell-Lang conjecture, Hrushovski employed techniques from model theory to prove the function field version of the conjecture. In doing so he was able to answer a related question of Voloch, which we refer to henceforth as Hrushovski's theorem. In this paper we shall give an alternative proof of said theorem in the characteristic $p$ setting, but using purely algebro-geometric ideas.</description>

      <title>The Miyaoka-Yau inequality for singular varieties with big canonical or anticanonical divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the Miyaoka-Yau inequality for $n$-dimensional projective klt varieties with big canonical divisor $K_X$: \[ (2(n+1)\widehat{c}_2(X) - n \widehat{c}_1(X)^2) \cdot \langle c_1(K_X)^{n-2} \rangle \ge 0. \] We also prove the Miyaoka-Yau inequality for K-semistable projective klt varieties with big anticanonical divisor $-K_X$. As part of our approach, we define the non-pluripolar product $\langle \alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_p \rangle$ on singular varieties, and establish the Bogomolov-Gieseker type inequality for $\langle \alpha^{n-1} \rangle$-semistable Higgs sheaves with respect to a big class $\alpha$. In addition, we investigate second Chern class inequalities in the cases where $K_X$ or $-K_X$ is nef.</description>

      <title>Fano schemes of sub-maximal elementary symmetric functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denote by $E_r$ the $r^{th}$ elementary symmetric polynomial in $\dim V$ variables for a vector space $V$ over an infinite field $\Bbbk$. We describe the rational points on the Fano scheme $F_{d-1}(Z(E_{\dim V-1}))$ of projective $(d-1)$-spaces contained in the zero locus of $E_{\dim V-1}$. Isolated points exist precisely for $\dim V=2d$, in which case they are in bijection with the $1\cdot 3\cdots (2d-1)$ pairings on a $2d$-element set. This, in particular, confirming a conjecture of Ambartsoumian, Auel and Jebelli to the effect that (over $\mathbb{R}$) all isolated points are recoverable via integral star transforms with appropriate symbols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the structure of the coordinate ring of an affine ind-variety. We prove that any coordinate ring of an affine ind-variety which is not isomorphic to an affine algebraic variety does not have a countable set of generators. Also we prove that coordinate rings of affine ind-varieties have an everywhere dense subspace of countable dimension.</description>

      <title>Graphs with tree decompositions of small graphs and realizing them as the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have been interested in graphs and realizing them as Reeb graphs of explicit real algebraic functions.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the quotient space of the manifold of the domain, regarded as the space consisting of all components of preimages of all single points. Reeb graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry of manifolds since the birth of theory of Morse functions, in the former half of the 20th century. We can easily see that the Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere whose dimension is at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and two edges.
  We are concerned with realizations of graphs decomposed into trees nicely, each vertex of which corresponds to a graph with exactly one edge and two edges or a graph with exactly two edges homeomorphic to a circle.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Quantum Toroidal Algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}), Vertex Operators and L-operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new vertex operators, both the type I and the type II dual, of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) by combining representations of U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) and the notions of the elliptic stable envelopes for the instanton moduli space M(n,r). The vertex operators reproduce the shuffle product formula of the elliptic stable envelopes by their composition. We also show that the vacuum expectation value of a composition of the vertex operators gives a correct formula of the K-theoretic vertex function for M(n,r). We then derive exchange relations among the vertex operators and construct a L-operator satisfying the RLL=LLR^* relation with R and R^* being elliptic dynamical instanton R-matrices defined as transition matrices of the elliptic stable envelopes. Assuming a universal form of L, we define a comultiplication \Delta in terms of it. It turns out that the new vertex operators are intertwining operators of the U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor})-modules w.r.t \Delta.</description>

      <title>Birational Transformations on Dimer Integrable Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when two toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds and their corresponding toric varieties are related by a birational transformation, they are associated with a pair of dimer models on the 2-torus that define dimer integrable systems, which themselves become birationally equivalent. These integrable systems defined by dimer models were first introduced by Goncharov and Kenyon. We illustrate this equivalence explicitly using a pair of dimer integrable systems corresponding to the abelian orbifolds of the form C^3/Z_4 x Z_2 with orbifold action (1,0,3)(0,1,1) and C/Z_2 x Z_2 with action (1,0,0,1)(0,1,1,0), whose spectral curves and Hamiltonians are shown to be related by a birational transformation.</description>

      <title>RNS superstring measure for genus 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for the RNS supersting measure for genus 3. Our derivation is based on invariant theory. We follow Witten's idea of using an algebraic parametrization of the moduli space (which he applied to re-derive D'Hoker and Phong's formula for the RNS superstring measure for genus 2); but the particular parametrization that we use has not been applied to superstring theory before. We prove that the superstring measure is a linear combinaition (with complex coefficients) of three known functions. Furthermore, we conjecture the values of the coefficients of this linear combination and provide evidence for this conjecture. Unlike the Ansatz of Cacciatori, Dalla Piazza and van Geemen from 2008, our formula has a polar singularity along the hyperelliptic locus; the existence of this singularity was established by Witten in 2015. Moreover, our formula is not an Ansatz but follows from first principles, except for the values of the three coefficients.</description>

      <title>Three Tone Networks and a Tessellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices signifying major chords and twelve black vertices signifying minor chords. This so-called Levi graph uniquely determines the combinatorial geometry of a remarkable configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in the real projective plane with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of the four principal hexacycles and the three principal octacycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century voice leading, can be read off rather directly as properties of the configuration. We show how analogous tone networks can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music.</description>

      <title>Modular functors from conformal blocks of rational vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a vertex operator algebra $V$, one may naturally define spaces of conformal blocks following a construction of Frenkel-Ben-Zvi generalized by Damiolini-Gibney-Tarasca. If $V$ is strongly rational, these spaces of conformal blocks form vector bundles over a suitable moduli space of algebraic curves. In this article, we establish, under the same assumptions, the widely expected topological result that the spaces of conformal blocks produce a modular functor, i.e. a modular algebra over an extension of the surface operad. This entails that the category $\mathcal{C}_V$ of admissible $V$-modules inherits from the topology of genus zero surfaces a ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier structure that leads even to the structure of a modular fusion category whose structure comes directly from the spaces of conformal blocks of $V$. As a direct consequence, we prove that the modular functor from conformal blocks extends to a three-dimensional topological field theory and comes with a description in terms of factorization homology.</description>
