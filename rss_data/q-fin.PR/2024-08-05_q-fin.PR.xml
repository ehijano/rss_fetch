      <title>SABR/LIBOR market models: pricing and calibration for some interest rate derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to overcome the drawbacks of assuming deterministic volatility coefficients in the standard LIBOR market models to capture volatility smiles and skews in real markets, several extensions of LIBOR models to incorporate stochastic volatilities have been proposed. The efficient calibration to market data of these more complex models becomes a relevant target in practice. The main objective of the present work is to efficiently calibrate some recent SABR/LIBOR market models to real market prices of caplets and swaptions. For the calibration we propose a parallelized version of the simulated annealing algorithm for multi-GPUs. The numerical results clearly illustrate the advantages of using the proposed multi-GPUs tools when applied to real market data and popular SABR/LIBOR models.</description>

      <title>PDEs for pricing interest rate derivatives under the new generalized Forward Market Model (FMM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we derive partial differential equations (PDEs) for pricing interest rate derivatives under the generalized Forward Market Model (FMM) recently presented by A. Lyashenko and F. Mercurio in \cite{lyashenkoMercurio:Mar2019} to model the dynamics of the Risk Free Rates (RFRs) that are replacing the traditional IBOR rates in the financial industry. Moreover, for the numerical solution of the proposed PDEs formulation, we develop some adaptations of the finite differences methods developed in \cite{LopezPerezVazquez:sisc} that are very suitable to treat the presence of spatial mixed derivatives. This work is the first article in the literature where PDE methods are used to value RFR derivatives. Additionally, Monte Carlo-based methods will be designed and the results are compared with those obtained by the numerical solution of PDEs.</description>

      <title>Neural Term Structure of Additive Process for Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The additive process generalizes the L\'evy process by relaxing its assumption of time-homogeneous increments and hence covers a larger family of stochastic processes. Recent research in option pricing shows that modeling the underlying log price with an additive process has advantages in easier construction of the risk-neural measure, an explicit option pricing formula and characteristic function, and more flexibility to fit the implied volatility surface. Still, the challenge of calibrating an additive model arises from its time-dependent parameterization, for which one has to prescribe parametric functions for the term structure. For this, we propose the neural term structure model to utilize feedforward neural networks to represent the term structure, which alleviates the difficulty of designing parametric functions and thus attenuates the misspecification risk. Numerical studies with S\&amp;P 500 option data are conducted to evaluate the performance of the neural term structure.</description>
