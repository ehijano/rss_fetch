      <title>Rigidity and mechanical response in biological structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigidity is an emergent property of materials - it is not a feature of individual components that comprise the structure, but instead arises from interactions between many constituent parts. Recently, it has been recognized that floppy-rigid or fluid-solid transitions are harnessed by biological systems at all scales to drive form and function. This review focuses on the different mechanisms that can drive emergent rigidity transitions in biomechanical networks, and describes how they arise in mathematical formalisms and how they are observed in practice in experiments. The goal is to aid researchers in identifying mechanisms governing rigidity in their biological systems of interest, highlight mechanical features that are universal across different systems, and help drive new scientific hypotheses for observed mechanical phenomena in biology. Looking forward, we also discuss how biological systems might tune themselves towards or away from such transitions over developmental or evolutionary timescales.</description>

      <title>Parameter degeneracy in the vertex model for tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertex model with homogeneous cell properties is known to exhibit a parameter degeneracy in which the system's dynamics is independent of the target area. Here, we show, for the heterogeneous vertex model where cells differ in size and stiffness, that degeneracy is also present with the average product of target areas and stiffness becoming dynamically irrelevant. Fixing this quantity is equivalent to fixing the global internal tissue pressure. Unless properly treated, this degeneracy undermines the physical relevance of key observables' numerical values, such as the shape index, cell pressure, and cell stress tensor. We present methods to resolve the degeneracy and to correctly set the gauge pressure via symmetry transformations applied to the cells' target areas. We further demonstrate that the degeneracy is removed under certain boundary conditions and partially lifted when spherical tissues are modeled using a locally planar approximation, leading to numerical consequences when fitting model parameters to experimental data. The approach extends beyond vertex models and provides a framework for testing whether the parameter spaces of other physical models are free from degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Diverse, Distinct, and Densely Packed DNA Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The liquid-liquid phase separation of biomolecules is an important process for intracellular organization. Biomolecular sequence combinatorics leads to a large variety of proteins and nucleic acids which can interact to form a diversity of dense liquid (`condensate') phases. The relationship between sequence design and the diversity of the resultant phases is therefore of interest. Here, we explore this question using the DNA nanostar system which permits the creation of multi-phase condensate droplets through sequence engineering of the sticky end bonds that drive particle-particle attraction. We explore the theoretical limits of nanostar phase diversity, then experimentally demonstrate the ability to create 9 distinct, non-adhering nanostar phases that do not share components. We further study how thermal processing affects the morphology and dynamics of such a highly diverse condensate system. We particularly show that a rapid temperature quench leads to the formation of a densely packed 2-D layer of droplets that is transiently stabilized by caging effects enabled by the phase diversity, leading to glassy dynamics, such as slow coarsening and dynamic heterogeneity. Generally, our work provides experimental insight into the thermodynamics of phase separation of complex mixtures and demonstrates the rational engineering of complex, long-range, multi-phase droplet structures.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of generic random tensegrity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many mechanical structures, both engineered and biological, combine heavy rigid elements such as bones and beams with lightweight flexible ones such as cables and membranes. These are referred to as tensegrities, reflecting that cables can only support extensile tension. We model such systems via simulations of depleted triangular lattices in which we minimize the energies of tensegrities subject to strained boundary conditions. When there are equal numbers of cables and struts (which support only compressive tension), a cable and a strut together each contribute as much toward rigidity as a rod, with the two contributions being equal in the case of shear strain. Due to the highly nonaffine deformations at the rigidity transitions, the contribution of a cable (strut) can be significant even under global compression (dilation) despite a cable's inability to resist local compression. Further, we find that when neighboring elements tend to point away from one another, as is common in real systems, cables interact significantly more strongly with other cables than do cables with struts in supporting stress. These phenomena shed new light on a variety of realistic, disordered systems at the threshold of mechanical stability.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in creeping salt crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-amplifying creeping of salts can produce striking macroscopic structures, such as desert roses in arid regions and salt pillars near saline lakes. While these formations are visually remarkable, salt crystallization, often seen as efflorescence on surfaces, also poses significant challenges for cultural heritage conservation, materials science, and soil management. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms underlying self-organized crystallization within efflorescence deposits. Our findings reveal that these porous salt deposits exhibit pronounced self-similarity, with the crystallization process recurring at multiple length scales. This results in smaller replicas of the overall structure nested within larger ones, creating fractal geometries similar to those found in cauliflower and broccoli. By performing controlled evaporation experiments and microscale analysis using advanced imaging techniques combined with fractal dimension analysis, we uncover the hierarchical and size-controlled precipitation of cubic microcrystals within the porous efflorescence. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical growth model demonstrating that the ultimate height of the macroscopic salt deposit is primarily determined by the initial mass of salt, rather than by the interplay of capillary and viscous forces when salt solution flows within the porous salt structure.</description>

      <title>Locally tuned hydrodynamics of active polymer chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ mesoscopic simulations to study active polymers in a solvent via multi-particle collision dynamics. We investigate linear chains in which either the head or tail monomer exerts an active force, directed away from or towards its neighbor, respectively, while the remaining monomers are passive. We find that, in contrast to flexible chains, for stiff chains the position of the active monomer has minimal influence on both the structural and dynamic properties of the chain. An active head monomer pulls the chain behind it, straightening the backbone -- an effect that can be interpreted as activity-induced stiffening. In contrast, an active tail pushes into the chain, causing crumpling. This leads to faster decorrelation of the polymer backbone over time, rendering the active motion less persistent. These effects occur regardless of whether hydrodynamic interactions are included or not. Hydrodynamics is included by the imposition of a local counter-force in the surrounding fluid, as opposed to distributing the former equally to all fluid elements. By specifying the position of this counterforce onto the fluid, we can tune the hydrodynamic flow fields of the active polymers being both contractile and extensile. Interestingly, the emerging pusher- and puller flow fields are strongly influenced by the force propagation inside the polymer chain.</description>

      <title>Striking Similarities in Dynamics and Vibrations of 2D Quasicrystals and Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18856v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between structure and dynamics in two structurally distinct two-dimensional systems: a dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) and a supercooled binary liquid. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover striking dynamical similarities despite their fundamentally different structural organizations. Both systems exhibit pronounced dynamic heterogeneities, as evidenced by the cage-trapping plateaus in the mean-squared displacement and the pronounced peaks in the non-Gaussian parameter. In both cases, we observe a strong correlation between local structural order and dynamic propensity, indicating similar structure-dynamics relationships, albeit driven by distinct microscopic mechanisms. Despite these parallels, their vibrational properties diverge: the DDQC exhibits multiple peaks linked to phason dynamics, while the supercooled liquid displays a characteristic boson peak. Analysis of vibrational eigenmodes shows that both systems exhibit extended modes at low frequencies. At high frequencies, however, the DDQC maintains a higher density of topological defects, reflecting its quasi-long-range order. Finally, we contextualize these findings by comparing both systems to a square crystal. While the dynamics appears similar across all three systems, the vibrational and topological features clearly distinguish the DDQC and glass from the crystalline state. These results underscore a surprising universality in dynamical behavior across structurally diverse systems and provide new insights into how structural organization shapes motion in soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Forces Enhance Tracer Diffusion in Non-motile Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochasticity is a defining feature of the pairwise forces governing interactions in biological systems-from molecular motors to cell-cell adhesion-yet its consequences on large-scale dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we show that reciprocal but randomly fluctuating interactions between particles create active suspensions which can enhance the diffusion of an external tracer particle, even in the absence of self-propulsion or non-reciprocity. Starting from a lattice model with pairwise dynamics that minimally break detailed balance, we derive a coarse-grained dynamical theory for spatio-temporal density fluctuations and reveal an elevated effective temperature at short wavelengths. We then compute the self-diffusion coefficient of a tracer particle weakly coupled to our active fluid, demonstrating that purely reciprocal stochastic interactions provide a distinct and generic route to enhanced diffusivity in dense non-equilibrium suspensions.</description>

      <title>Polarity-dependent Electroadhesion at Silicon Interfaces with Nanoscale Roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure and model electroadhesion across multi-asperity silicon interfaces with nanometer scale roughness. When electrically biased, our naturally oxidized silicon interfaces display a leakage current consistent with the Fowler-Nordheim model and electroadhesion that can be successfully captured using a boundary element contact model. We show that polysilicon exhibits electroadhesion only under positive bias applied to the substrate monocrystalline wafer, which we interpret as a result of the reduced mobility of holes, with respect to electrons, within polysilicon. Overall, our findings reveal that electrostatic interactions can significantly enhance adhesion and friction between stiff and smooth surfaces, which can be important for example in precision positioning applications.</description>

      <title>Junctional-Fluctuation-Mediated Fluidisation of Multi-Phase Field Epithelial Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a multi-phase field model for an epithelial monolayer with pairwise adhesions between neighbouring cells following an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, representing the stochastic turnover of junctional molecular motors. These fluctuations in junctional adhesion result in rearrangements in the tissue, fluidising it and producing diffusive cell motion. Similar junctional fluctuations have proven a very useful tool in the vertex model literature, and we hope they will be equally helpful to the multi-phase field model approach. Moreover, we observe that the cells' effective diffusion coefficient depends non-monotonically on the persistence time of the fluctuations, confirming results previously observed in the vertex model.</description>

      <title>Channel flows of deformable nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe channel flows in a continuum model of deformable nematic particles. In a simple shear flow, deformability leads to a nonlinear coupling of strain rate and vorticity, and results in shape oscillations or flow alignment. The final steady state can depend on initial conditions, and we explain this behaviour by considering a phase space representation of the dynamics. In Poiseuille flow, particle deformability and nematic elasticity induce banding, where particles near the walls are aligned, and those near the centre of the channel oscillate in direction and shape. Our results show that particle deformability can lead to complex behaviour even in simple flows, suggesting new microfluidic experiments.</description>

      <title>Density-Velocity Relation Is Scale-Dependent in Epithelial Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between cell density and velocity is often assumed to be negative, reflecting crowding-induced suppression of movement. However, observations across systems reveal a more nuanced picture: while some emphasize contact inhibition of locomotion, others suggest that dense regions exhibit enhanced activity due to force generation and stress buildup. Here, using experimental measurements we show that density-velocity relations in epithelial monolayers are inherently scale dependent. By coarse-graining cell trajectories over multiple spatial windows, we find that cell velocity correlates positively with local density at small scales, but negatively at large scales. Employing traction force measurements, we find that this crossover coincides with the emergence of mechanical pressure segregation, defining a characteristic length scale beyond which crowding dominates. A minimal model incorporating activity-induced shape changes reproduces this crossover and identifies the competition between active force generation and mechanical confinement as the underlying mechanism. Our results reconcile conflicting views of density-regulated migration and highlight an emergent length scale as a key factor in interpreting collective cell dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Directional solidification of water-based solutions has emerged as a versatile technique to template hierarchical porous materials, but this nonequilibrium process remains incompletely understood. Here we use phase-field simulations to shed light on the mechanism that selects the growth direction of the lamellar ice structure that templates those materials. Our results show that this selection can be understood within the general framework of spontaneous parity breaking, yielding quantitative predictions for the tilt angle of lamellae with respect to the thermal axis. The results provide a theoretical basis to interpret a wide range of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field Model of Freeze Casting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional solidification of water-based solutions has emerged as a versatile technique for templating hierarchical porous materials. However, the underlying mechanisms of pattern formation remain incompletely understood. In this work, we present a detailed derivation and analysis of a quantitative phase-field model for simulating this nonequilibrium process. The phase-field model extends the thin-interface formulation of dilute binary alloy solidification with anti-trapping to incorporate the highly anisotropic energetic and kinetic properties of the partially faceted ice-water interface. This interface is faceted in the basal plane normal to the &lt;0001&gt; directions and atomically rough in other directions within the basal plane. On the basal plane, the model reproduces a linear or nonlinear kinetic relationship that can be linked to experimental measurements. In both cases, spontaneous parity breaking of the solidification front is observed, leading to the formation of partially faceted ice lamellae that drift laterally in one of the &lt;0001&gt; directions. We demonstrate that the drifting velocity is controlled by the kinetics on the basal plane and converges as the thickness of the diffuse solid-liquid interface decreases. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the form of the kinetic anisotropy, which is chosen here such that the inverse of the kinetic coefficient varies linearly from a finite value in the &lt;0001&gt; directions to zero in all other directions within the basal plane. Our results indicate that the drifting velocity of ice lamellae is not affected by the slope of this linear relation, and the radius and undercooling at the tip of an ice lamella converge at relatively small slope values. Consequently, the phase-field simulations remain quantitative with computationally tractable choices of both the interface thickness and the slope assumed in the form of the kinetic anisotropy.</description>

      <title>On the Slipperiness of Surfactants: Charge-Mediated Friction Control at the Molecular Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From soap-covered dishes to freshly cleaned floors, surfactants can make surfaces slippery; yet, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the molecular origin behind this ubiquitous phenomenon using macroscopic tribology and surface molecular spectroscopy. We demonstrate that reducing friction through surfactants hinges on charge complementarity: surfactants of opposite charge to the solid surface reduce friction even at extreme contact pressures, whereas like-charged or neutral surfactants are ineffective. Oppositely charged surfactants self-assemble into dense and robust molecular brushes, creating a persistent lubrication beyond the limits of conventional mechanisms. This charge-mediated approach offers a universal and scalable framework for friction control across length scales without significant surface modification.</description>

Abstract: The control of particle trajectories in structured microfluidic environments has significantly advanced sorting technologies, most notably through deterministic lateral displacement (DLD). While previous work has largely targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient, length-based separation of flexible fibers. We discover that these arrays act as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer exhibit minimal lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of fluid-structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with minimal lateral migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open new avenues for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.</description>

      <title>Phase Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Tellurium Flakes</title>

Abstract: Elemental tellurium (Te) is a compelling van der Waals material due to its interesting chiral crystal structure and predicted topological properties. Here, we report the fabrication and comprehensive quantum transport study of devices based on Te flakes with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate a hole mobility reaching up to 1000 cm2/V.s in a 17 nm thick flake at 30 Kelvin. At deep cryogenic temperatures (&lt; 50mK), the transport characteristics transition from Coulomb blockade in the low carrier density regime to pronounced Fabry-P\'erot (F-P) interference at higher densities. Notably, the visibility of these F-P oscillations is significantly enhanced in the thinner flake device. The application of a magnetic field reveals a clear Zeeman splitting of the conductance peaks. The rich variety of quantum transport phenomena observed underscores the high quality of our thin Te flakes and establishes them as a promising platform for exploring novel physics and device concepts, such as topological superconductivity and low-power spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>How glass breaks -- Damage explains the difference between surface and fracture energies in amorphous silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a 16-23 A range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.</description>

      <title>Boundary layers, transport and universal distribution in boundary driven active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss analytical results for a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in one dimension in presence of boundary reservoirs. It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, current without density gradient, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a new transport effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-ranged colored noise. Active processes driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.</description>
