      <title>Reassessing the proper motions of M31/M33 with Gaia DR3. Unraveling systematic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an updated inference of the proper motion of M31 using the Gaia DR3 proper motions of bright stars from the disc of M31. By refining the motion of the quasar reference frame, and statistically accounting for the variations in the inferred proper motions obtained across different regions of M31, we demonstrate that these inconsistencies most likely arise from systematic uncertainties. Our updated favoured values for the proper motion of M31 are 46.9$\pm$11.7(stat)$\pm$50.6(sys)$\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ along the right ascension direction, and -29.1$\pm$9.4(stat)$\pm$35.6(sys)$\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ along the declination direction, the systematics being determined at a 90% confidence level (the values for M33 are given in the paper). This clearly highlights that the systematics are the dominant source of uncertainty, their magnitudes being comparable to the proper motion of M31 itself. The analysis conducted using Gaia DR2 instead of DR3 revealed that a net reduction in these systematic uncertainties occurred between the two data releases. If similar progress is made with the upcoming DR4, the future Gaia-based estimates could match the level of uncertainties of HST, and could be used to refine the dynamics and history of M31 and M33.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurements of the LMC Bar's Geometry With Gaia DR3 and a Novel Solution to Crowding Induced Incompleteness in Star Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new measurements of the two-dimensional (2-D) geometry of the LMC's stellar bar with precise astrometric observations of red clump stars in Gaia DR3. We develop a novel solution to tackle crowding induced incompleteness in Gaia datasets with the Gaia BP-RP color excess. Utilizing the color excess information, we derive a 2-D completeness map of the LMC's disk. We find that incompleteness biases the bar measurements and induces large uncertainties. With the completeness-corrected 2-D red clump map, we precisely measure the LMC bar's properties for the first time using Fourier decomposition. The bar radius is $R_{bar} = 2.13^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ kpc, and its position angle is $121.26^{\circ} \pm 0.21^{\circ}$. The bar's strength as quantified by the Fourier bi-symmetric amplitude is $S_{bar} = 0.27$, indicating that the LMC has a significant bar perturbation. We find the bar has an axis ratio of $0.54 \pm 0.03$, and is offset with respect to the center of the outer disk isophote at R $\approx$ 5 kpc by $0.76 \pm 0.01$ kpc. These LMC bar properties agree with a hydrodynamic model where the SMC has undergone a recent direct collision with the LMC. We compare the LMC's bar properties with other barred galaxies in the local universe, and discover that the LMC is similar to other barred galaxies in terms of bar-galaxy scaling relations. We discuss how our completeness correction framework can be applied to other systems in the Local Group.</description>

      <title>The origin and evolution of the [CII]-deficit in HII regions and star-forming molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse synthetic maps of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m line and FIR continuum of simulated molecular clouds (MCs) within the SILCC-Zoom project to study the origin of the [CII]-deficit, i.e., the drop of the [CII]/FIR intensity ratio. All simulations include stellar radiative feedback and account for further ionisation of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ inside HII regions. For individual HII regions, $I_\mathrm{FIR}$ is initially high in the vicinity of young stars, and then moderately decreases as the gas is compressed into shells. In contrast, $I_\mathrm{CII}$ drops strongly over time, to which the second ionisation of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ contributes. This leads to a strong drop of $I_\mathrm{[CII]}/I_\mathrm{FIR}$ inside HII regions, decreasing from 10$^{-3}$-10$^{-2}$ at scales above 10 pc to 10$^{-6}$-10$^{-4}$ at scales below 2pc. However, projection effects can affect the radial profile of $I_\mathrm{[CII]}$ and $I_\mathrm{FIR}$ and create apparent HII regions without any stars. On MC scales, $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ decreases from values $\gtrsim$10$^{-2}$ in MCs without star formation to values around $\sim10^{-3}$ in MCs with star formation. We attribute this and the origin of the [CII]-deficit to two main contributors: (i) the saturation of the [CII] line and (ii) the conversion of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ by stellar radiation. The drop of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ can be divided into two phases: (i) early on, the saturation of [CII] and the further ionisation of C$^+$ limit the increase of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}$, while $L_\mathrm{FIR}$ increases rapidly, leading to the initial decline of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$. (ii) In more evolved HII regions, $L_\mathrm{CII}$ stagnates and partially even drops due to the aforementioned reasons. $L_\mathrm{FIR}$ stagnates as the gas gets pushed into the cooler shells keeping $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ at low values of $\sim10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Dust-Obscured Galaxies in the XMM-SERVS Fields: Selection, Multiwavelength Characterization, and Physical Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) are enshrouded by dust, and many are believed to host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), which makes them unique objects for probing the coevolution of galaxies and SMBHs. We select and characterize DOGs in the $13\,deg^2$ XMM-Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (XMM-SERVS), leveraging the superb multiwavelength data from X-rays to radio. We select 3738 DOGs at $z\approx1.6-2.1$ in XMM-SERVS, while maintaining good data quality without introducing significant bias. This represents the largest DOG sample with thorough multiwavelength source characterization. Spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling shows DOGs are a heterogeneous population consisting of both normal galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our DOGs are massive ($\log M_\bigstar/M_\odot\approx10.7-11.3$), 174 are detected in X-rays, and they are generally radio-quiet systems. X-ray detected DOGs are luminous and are moderately to heavily obscured in X-rays. Stacking analyses for the X-ray undetected DOGs show highly significant average detections. Critically, we compare DOGs with matched galaxy populations. DOGs have similar AGN fractions compared with typical galaxy populations. X-ray detected DOGs have higher $M_\bigstar$ and higher X-ray obscuration, but they are not more star-forming than typical X-ray AGNs. The results potentially challenge the relevance of the merger-driven galaxy-SMBH coevolution framework for X-ray detected DOGs.</description>

      <title>Characterising the z $\sim$ 7.66 Type-II AGN candidate SMACS S06355 using BEAGLE-AGN and JWST NIRSpec/NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in low mass (Mstar $\lesssim$ $10^{9}$ Msun) galaxies at high redshift has been established, and it is important to characterise these objects and the impact of their feedback on the host galaxies. In this paper we apply the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting code BEAGLE-AGN to SMACS S06355, a z $\sim$ 7.66 Type-II AGN candidate from the JWST NIRSpec Early Release Observations. This object's spectrum includes a detection of the [NeIV]2426 line, indicating an obscured AGN due to its high ionization potential energy ($\sim$ 63eV). We use BEAGLE-AGN to simultaneously model the Narrow Line Region (NLR) AGN and star-forming galaxy contributions to the observed line fluxes and photometry. Having a high-ionization emission line allows the contribution of the NLR to the remaining lines to be probabilistically disentangled. The HII region metallicity is derived to be 12+log(O/H)$^{\mathrm{HII}}$ = $7.74^{+0.18}_{-0.19}$. Assuming that the Neon-to-Oxygen abundance is similar to solar we derive a high NLR metallicity of 12+log(O/H)$^\mathrm{{NLR}}$ = $8.77^{+0.14}_{-0.16}$, with the 2$\sigma$ lower-limit extending to 12+log(O/H)$^{\mathrm{NLR}}$ $\sim$ 8.00, showing the derivation is uncertain. We discuss this result with respect to non-solar Neon abundances that might boost the inferred NLR metallicity. The NLR metallicity places SMACS S06355 in a comparable region of the mass-metallicity plane to intermediate (1.5 $\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 3.0) redshift obscured AGN. Our derived accretion disc luminosity, log($L_{acc}$ / erg $s^{-1}$) = $45.19^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, is moderately high yet still uncertain. We highlight that deviations between bolometric luminosity calibrations and model grid tracks become enhanced at low metallicities.</description>

      <title>The Density and Ionization Profile of Optically Dark and High Redshift GRBs Probed by X-ray Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray column density (NHX) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can probe the local environment of their progenitors over a wide redshift range. Previous work has suggested an increasing trend as a function of redshift. The relevance of the current analysis relies on investigating the selection bias method, such as the effect of the X-ray spectrum in high-redshift GRBs, which complicates the measurement of small NHX, have yet to be fully evaluated or discussed elsewhere. In this work, we evaluated these effects through simulations to define appropriate observational limits in the NHX versus redshift plane. We then applied a one-sided nonparametric method developed by Efron and Petrosian. Within the framework of this method, we investigated the redshift dependence of NHX and the local distribution function. Our results show that the evolution of NHX with redshift firmly exists with a significance of more than four sigma and follows a power law of $(1+z)^{1.39 (+0.22, -0.27)}$. Based on these analyses and previous studies, the GRB progenitor mass varies but is more massive in the high redshift environment and has a higher gas column density. This suggests that part of the luminosity evolution of GRBs, which has been widely reported, may be due to the evolution of the progenitor's mass. Using the same method, we demonstrate that optically dark GRBs show a consistent evolution as $(1+z)^{1.15(+0.67, -0.83)}$. By applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, it is shown that optically dark GRBs have statistically identical flux and photon index distributions compared to normal GRBs, but the NHX is systematically larger. This result suggests that the darkness of some GRB populations is not due to an intrinsic mechanism, but that a higher density surrounds them.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Strong Clustering of Protoclusters at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey is carrying out a systematic search for protoclusters during Cosmic Noon, using Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) as tracers. Once completed, ODIN aims to identify hundreds of protoclusters at redshifts of 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 across seven extragalactic fields, covering a total area of up to 91~deg$^2$. In this work, we report strong clustering of high-redshift protoclusters through the protocluster-LAE cross-correlation function measurements of 150 protocluster candidates at $z~=~2.4$ and 3.1, identified in two ODIN fields with a total area of 13.9 deg$^2$. At $z~=~2.4$ and 3.1, respectively, the inferred protocluster biases are $6.6^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$ and $6.1^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$, corresponding to mean halo masses of $\log \langle M /M_\odot\rangle = 13.53^{+0.21}_{-0.24}$ and $12.96^{+0.28}_{-0.33}$. By the present day, these protoclusters are expected to evolve into virialized galaxy clusters with a mean mass of $\sim$ $10^{14.5}~M_\odot$. By comparing the observed number density of protoclusters to that of halos with the measured clustering strength, we find that our sample is highly complete. Finally, the similar descendant masses derived for our samples at $z=2.4$ and 3.1 assuming that the halo number density remains constant suggest that they represent similar structures observed at different cosmic epochs. As a consequence, any observed differences between the two samples can be understood as redshift evolution. The ODIN protocluster samples will thus provide valuable insights into the cosmic evolution of cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>Narrow [O III] emission lines as a potential proxy for the evolutionary stage of quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio spectral shape of quasars can provide insight into the ages of quasars. We have compiled data for 1804 quasars with $z\lesssim1$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Additionally, these quasars were also mapped by the Low-Frequency Array at 144 MHz and the Very Large Array Sky Survey at 3000 MHz. The radio spectral index, designated as $\alpha^{\rm 144}_{\rm 3000}$ (with $S(\nu)\propto\nu^\alpha$), is analyzed between 144 MHz and 3000 MHz as a proxy for the ages of quasars. We measure the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission line in the SDSS spectra. A strong correlation was found between the equivalent width of the core component of the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission line and $\alpha^{\rm 144}_{\rm 3000}$. This relationship suggests that the core component of the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission line could potentially serve as a surrogate for the evolutionary stage of a quasar. The quasars at an early stage of evolutions tend to show weaker [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission, while older quasars exhibit stronger [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission.</description>

      <title>Joint Modeling of Quasar Variability and Accretion Disk Reprocessing using Latent Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars are bright active galactic nuclei powered by the accretion of matter around supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. Their stochastic brightness variability depends on the physical properties of the accretion disk and black hole. The upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to observe tens of millions of quasars, so there is a need for efficient techniques like machine learning that can handle the large volume of data. Quasar variability is believed to be driven by an X-ray corona, which is reprocessed by the accretion disk and emitted as UV/optical variability. We are the first to introduce an auto-differentiable simulation of the accretion disk and reprocessing. We use the simulation as a direct component of our neural network to jointly model the driving variability and reprocessing to fit simulated LSST 10-year quasar light curves. The driving variability is reconstructed using a latent stochastic differential equation, a physically motivated, generative deep learning method that can model continuous-time stochastic dynamics. By embedding these physical processes into our network, we achieve a model that is more robust and interpretable. We also use transformers to scale our model to tens of millions of parameters. We demonstrate how our model outperforms a Gaussian process regression baseline and can infer accretion disk parameters and time delays between wavebands, even for out-of-distribution driving signals. Our approach provides a powerful and scalable framework that can be adapted to solve other inverse problems in multivariate time series with irregular sampling.</description>

      <title>A theoretical investigation of far-infrared fine structure lines at $z&gt;6$ and of the origin of the [OIII]88/[CII]158 enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] The [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ luminosity ratios have shown to be promising tracers of the ionisation state and gas-phase metallicity of the ISM. Observations of galaxies at redshift $z &gt; 6$ show peculiarly higher [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$ and [CII]$_{158\mu m}$ as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$, [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$, [NII]$_{122\mu m}$ and [NIII]$_{57\mu m}$ emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution ($m_{\mathrm{gas}} = 883.4\, M_{\odot}$) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift $z = 6.5$, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios that are a factor of $\sim 5$ higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$-SFR and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios observed at $z &gt; 6$. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent $z &gt; 6$ JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ ratio of $1.3$, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.</description>

      <title>Measuring the boson mass of fuzzy dark matter with stellar proper motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) is among the most suitable candidates to replace WIMPs and to resolve the puzzling mystery of dark matter. A galactic dark matter halo made of these ultralight bosonic particles leads to the formation of a solitonic core surrounded by quantum interference patterns that, on average, reproduce a Navarro-Frenk-White-like mass density profile in the outskirts of the halo. The structure of such a core is determined once the boson mass and the total mass of the halo are set. We investigated the capability of future astrometric Theia-like missions to detect the properties of such a halo within the FDM model, namely the boson mass and the core radius. To this aim, we built mock catalogs containing three-dimensional positions and velocities of stars within a target dwarf galaxy. We exploited these catalogs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and found that measuring the proper motion of at least 2000 stars within the target galaxy, with uncertainty $\sigma_v \leq 3$ km/s on the velocity components, will constrain the boson mass and the core radius with 3\% accuracy. Furthermore, the transition between the solitonic core and the outermost NFW-like density profile could be detected with an uncertainty of 7\%. Such results would not only help to confirm the existence of FDM, but they would also be useful for alleviating the current tension between galactic and cosmological estimations of the boson mass, or demonstrating the need for multiple particles with a broad mass spectrum as naturally arise String Axiverse.</description>

      <title>On the chlorine abundance in H II regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chlorine (Cl) is a chemical element of the group of the halogens and is between the 17th and the 20th most abundant elements in the Solar System. It is thought to be produced from the capture of a proton or neutron by specific alpha-element isotopes during both hydrostatic and explosive oxygen burning, though some contribution may come from Type Ia supernovae. Cl lines are quite rare in stellar spectra, so most of the information available about its abundance comes from analyzing the emission lines of ionized nebulae, especially the collisionally excited lines of Cl2+ ([Cl III] {\lambda}{\lambda}5518,5538). Our goal is to accurately determine the Cl abundance in H II regions, and gather more information about its nucleosynthetic origin. For this work we used a sample of observations that encompasses the deepest spectra of H II regions available in the literature, from both the Milky Way and other galaxies in the local Universe, covering a range of oxygen (O) abundances, 12+log(O/H), from 7.18 to 8.70. As a first step, we determine the most representative electron temperature of the zone of the nebulae where the Cl2+ ion lies. To this aim we used a grid of photoionization models and diagnostics valid for other ions, as that parameter cannot be determined directly through [Cl III] lines. We then computed the total Cl abundance using different sets of ionization correction factors to account for the contribution from unseen ionization stages.</description>

      <title>The dual nature of GHZ9: coexisting AGN and star formation activity in a remote X-ray source at z=10.145</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopic characterization of GHZ9 at z= 10.145 $\pm$ 0.010, currently the most distant source detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum reveals several UV high-ionization lines, including CII, SiIV, [NIV], CIV, HeII, OIII], NIII], and CIII]. The prominent rest-frame equivalent widths (EW(CIV)$\simeq$65A, EW(HeII)$\simeq$18A, EW(CIII])$\simeq$48A) show the presence of a hard radiation field, while the analysis of line ratio diagnostics suggest this galaxy hosts both AGN and star-formation activity. GHZ9 is nitrogen-enriched (6--9.5 times solar), carbon-poor (0.2--0.65 times solar), metal-poor (Z = 0.01--0.1 Z$_{\odot}$), and compact ($&lt;$ 106 pc), similarly to GNz11, GHZ2, and recently discovered N-enhanced high redshift objects. We exploited the newly available JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam dataset to perform an independent analysis of the Chandra data confirming that GHZ9 is the most likely JWST source associated to X-ray emission at 0.5-7 keV. Assuming a spectral index $\Gamma$ = 2.3 (1.8), we estimate a black hole (BH) mass of 1.60 $\pm$ 0.31 (0.48 $\pm$ 0.09) $\times$ 10$^8$M$_{\odot}$, which is consistent either with Eddington-accretion onto heavy ($\geq$ 10$^6$ M$_{\odot}$) BH seeds formed at z=18, or super-Eddington accretion onto a light seed of $\sim$ 10$^2-10^4$ M$_{\odot}$ at z = 25. The corresponding BH-to-stellar mass ratio M$_{BH}$/M$_{star}$= 0.33$\pm$0.22 (0.10$\pm$0.07), with a stringent limit $&gt;$0.02, implies an accelerated growth of the BH mass with respect to the stellar mass. GHZ9 is the ideal target to constrain the early phases of AGN-galaxy coevolution with future multi-frequency observations.</description>

      <title>A Tale of NGC 3785: The Formation of an Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy at the end of the Longest Tidal Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of an extended and faint tail observed in the isolated environment associated with galaxy NGC 3785. This study additionally provides observational evidence supporting the formation of ultra-diffuse galaxies at the end of the tail. We utilized the Gnuastro software to detect and analyse the low surface brightness structures in the optical $g$, and $r$ bands using data from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. We created a detection map to identify the faint tail, and measured its length using cubic spline fitting. Additionally, we found 84 star-forming clumps along the tail and performed photometric analysis on the tail portion after applying a significance threshold on the signal-to-noise ratio. We have measured the projected length of the tail, which is $\sim$390 kpc. We propose that this tail arises from the interaction of the NGC 3785 with a gas-rich galaxy, which ends up as ultra-diffuse galaxy at the end of the tail.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in Hyper Suprime-Cam galaxy spin directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian analysis of anisotropy in binary galaxy spin directions in the Hyper-Suprime Cam Data Release 3 catalogue, in response to a recent claim that it exhibits a dipole Shamir 2024. We find no significant evidence for anisotropy, or for a direction-independent spin probability that differs from 0.5. These results are unchanged allowing for a quadrupole or simply searching for a fixed anisotropy between any two hemispheres, and the Bayes factor indicates decisive evidence for the isotropic model. Our principled method contrasts with the ad-hoc statistic employed by Shamir 2024. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Study of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission in 30 Dor as seen by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for strong mid-IR emission features near star-forming regions. It is well known that low-metallicity environments exhibit weaker PAH emission, but it is not clear how the metallicity affects the properties of the emitting PAH population. We present a detailed study of the PAH emission in the low-metallicity regime represented by 30 Dor in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and we compare it to the PAH emission in the Orion Bar to investigate the characteristics of the PAH population and how the environments affects the resulting IR emission. We analyze JWST observations of 30 Dor that include imaging (NIRCam, MIRI) and spectroscopy (NIRSpec/IFU, MIRI/MRS). We extracted NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS spectra from 18 apertures that cover the morphological structures of 30 Dor. We characterize the profiles and relative intensities of PAH emission in these apertures. The detailed profiles of the PAH emission bands in 30 Dor are all very similar, and compare well to those from one of the dissociation fronts (DF2) in the Orion Bar. The relative band ratios on the other hand show a much larger range than in the Orion Bar. The PAH emission in 30 Dor originates from a population with a higher ionization fraction than in the Orion Bar, and a size distribution that has more smaller PAHs. Since smaller PAHs typically photo-fragment before larger PAHs, our findings support the hypothesis that the lower PAH emission for lower metallicities is the result of inhibition of growth toward larger PAHs rather than photo-fragmentation.</description>

      <title>PRODIGE -- envelope to disk with NOEMA. IV. An infalling gas bridge surrounding two Class 0/I systems in L1448N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The formation of stars has been subject to extensive studies in the past decades from molecular cloud to protoplanetary disk scales. It is still not fully understood how the surrounding material in a protostellar system, that often shows asymmetric structures with complex kinematic properties, feeds the central protostar(s) and their disk(s). Aims. We study the spatial morphology and kinematic properties of the molecular gas surrounding the IRS3A and IRS3B protostellar systems in the L1448N region located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Methods. We present 1 mm NOEMA observations of the PRODIGE large program and analyze the kinematic properties of molecular lines. Given the complexity of the spectral profiles, the lines are fitted with up to three Gaussian velocity components. The clustering algorithm DBSCAN is used to disentangle the velocity components into the underlying physical structure. Results. We discover an extended gas bridge (~3000 au) surrounding both the IRS3A and IRS3B systems in six molecular line tracers (C18O, SO, DCN, H2CO, HC3N, and CH3OH). This gas bridge is oriented along the northeast-southwest direction and shows clear velocity gradients on the order of 100 km/s/pc towards the IRS3A system. We find that the observed velocity profile is consistent with analytical streamline models of gravitational infall towards IRS3A. The high-velocity C18O (2-1) emission towards IRS3A indicates a protostellar mass of ~1.2 Msun. Conclusions. While high angular resolution continuum data often show IRS3A and IRS3B in isolation, molecular gas observations reveal that these systems are still embedded within a large-scale mass reservoir with a complex spatial morphology as well as velocity profiles. The kinematic properties of the extended gas bridge are consistent with gravitational infall toward the IRS3A protostar.</description>

      <title>Very massive stars and Nitrogen-emitting galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of high-redshift galaxies using JWST, such as GN-z11 revealed highly elevated levels of nitrogen (N). This phenomenon extends to gravitationally-lensed galaxies like the Sunburst Arc at z = 2.37, as well as to globular clusters (GCs). We propose that this originates from the presence of very massive stars (VMSs) with masses ranging from 100 to 1000\,\Msun. The He {\sc ii} observed in the Sunburst Arc could also stem from the disproportionately large contribution of VMSs. We build an entirely new Framework for massive star evolution which is no longer set by Dutch or other mass-loss "recipes" but which take the physics of $\Gamma$ or $L/M$-dependent winds into account. We discuss the mass-loss kink and the transition mass-loss rate between optically thin and thick winds, before we study the evaporative mass-loss history of VMSs. Our novel evolution models exhibit vertical evolution in the HR-diagram from the zero-age main sequence due to a self-regulatory effect driven by their wind-dominated nature, and we discuss what wind physics sets the stellar upper-mass limit. Our estimate for the Sunburst Arc in Vink (2023) suggests that the significant amounts of N found in star-forming galaxies likely arise from VMSs. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of previous hypotheses, including fast rotating massive stars and supermassive stars (SMSs), and we conclude that only our VMS model satisfies the relevant criteria. Finally, we advocate for the inclusion of VMSs in population synthesis and chemical evolution models, emphasizing the need for a self-consistent wind approach, which currently does not exist. Even minor inaccuracies in mass-loss rates dramatically impact the stellar evolution of VMS, as well as their ionizing and chemical feedback.</description>

      <title>IceCube AGN Neutrino candidate PKS 1717+177: Dark deflector bends nuclear jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BL Lac Object PKS 1717+177 has been identified as potential neutrino-emitting AGN in the point source stacking analysis of IceCube data. We explore peculiarities in the morphology and kinematics of the jet and examine multi-wavelength light curves for distinctive effects which might allow to pinpoint a likely neutrino generation mechanism. We re-modeled 34 high resolution radio interferometric Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations obtained at 15 GHz (between 1999/12/27 and 2023/05/03). A correlation and periodicity analysis of optical KAIT and Tuorla data, as well as for Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data has been performed. The nuclear jet appears deflected and bent at about 0.5 mas distance from the radio core by an encounter with a dark, unseen object. The deviation of the jet evolves over 23.5 years from a simple apparent bend into a significantly meandering structure with increasing amplitude: a zig-zag line. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the temporal evolution of a jet deviation can be traced. The turning point shifts with time and the jet seems to brighten up almost periodically at the point of deviation. The radio core as well as the jet contribute approximately equally to the total flux-density at 15 GHz. We discuss scenarios which could explain the complex jet bending and quasi-regular flaring. We propose that the jet could either be deflected by the magnetosphere of a second massive black hole, by the pressure gradient due to a circumnuclear dense cloud, or via gravitational lensing by an intervening black hole.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI detection of a carbon-rich chemistry in a solar nebula analog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed, and confirmed by multiple observations, that disks around low mass stars display a molecule-rich emission and carbon-rich disk chemistry as compared to their hotter, more massive solar counterparts. In this work, we present JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS) MIRI-MRS observations of the solar-mass star DoAr 33, a low-accretion rate T Tauri star showing an exceptional carbon-rich inner disk. We report detections of H$_2$O, OH, and CO$_2$, as well as the more complex hydrocarbons, C$_2$H$_2$ and C$_4$H$_2$. Through the use of thermochemical models, we explore different spatial distributions of carbon and oxygen across the inner disk and compare the column densities and temperatures obtained from LTE slab model retrievals. We find a best match to the observed column densities with models that have carbon enrichment, and the retrieved emitting temperature and area of C$_2$H$_2$ with models that have C/O $=$ 2$-$4 inside the 500 K carbon-rich dust sublimation line. This suggests that the origin of the carbon-rich chemistry is likely due to the sublimation of carbon rich grains near the soot line. This would be consistent with the presence of dust processing as indicated by the detection of crystalline silicates. We propose that this long-lived hydrocarbon rich chemistry observed around a solar-mass star is a consequence of the unusually low M-star-like accretion rate of the central star, which lengthens the radial mixing timescale of the inner disk allowing the chemistry powered by carbon grain destruction to linger.</description>

Abstract: NGC 2506 is a rich, intermediate-age (2.0 Gyr), metal-poor ([Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.2) open cluster. This work presents the results of 12,157 spectroscopic radial-velocity measurements of 2,442 stars in the NGC 2506 field over 41 years, made as part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study. Radial-velocity measurements are complete for the population of proper-motion member stars brighter than a Gaia G magnitude of 15.5, in which 320 proper-motion and radial-velocity cluster members were identified. Within the observation limit of G $&lt;$ 16.5, 469 proper-motion and radial-velocity members were identified. This work reports on the characteristics of NGC 2506, including projected spatial distribution, radial-velocity dispersion, and virial mass. This work also presents orbital solutions for 49 binary members with periods between 1 and 7,580 days. NGC 2506 has an incompleteness-corrected binary frequency for binaries with periods less than $10^4$ days of $35 \pm 5$%. This work also discusses in detail the 14 blue stragglers stars of NGC 2506$\unicode{x2014}$finding at least 64 $\pm$ 21% to be in binaries, 5 yellow straggler stars, and several other stars of note.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Consequences of Black Holes in Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity: Shadows and Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of black holes in asymptotically safe quantum gravity, characterized by the parameters $S_0$, $S_2$, $m_0$, and $m_2$, in addition to the black hole mass $M$. To evaluate the physical validity of the fundamental asymptotically safe theory of quantum gravity black hole solutions, we analyze their gravitational lensing properties in the strong field regime. Specifically, we examine the shadow cast by the asymptotically safe quantum gravity black hole and constrain its parameters using observational data from the M87* and Sgr A* supermassive black holes. Our analysis reveals that, within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, a significant portion of the parameter space for asymptotically safe quantum gravity black holes is consistent with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* and Sgr A*. This suggests these black holes are plausible candidates for describing astrophysical black holes. As an additional observational test, we perform a detailed investigation of the strong gravitational lensing properties of these black holes. We explore the fundamental strong lensing observables in detail, including the angular positions and separations of the lensed images, the relative magnifications, the radius of the outermost Einstein ring, and the relativistic time delay between images. We compare the predictions of the asymptotically safe quantum gravity black hole for each observable with those of the classical Schwarzschild solution using realistic astrophysical data. Our findings provide a pathway for testing asymptotically safe quantum gravity at galactic and extragalactic scales, offering new insights into the observational properties of black hole solutions within this framework.</description>

      <title>ExoMol Line Lists -- LXII: Ro-Vibrational Energy Levels and Line-Strengths for the Propadienediylidene (C3) in its Ground Electronic State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved opacities are needed for modelling the atmospheres and evolution of cool carbon-rich stars and extra-solar planets; in particular, contributions made by the astrophysically important propadienediylidene (C$_3$) molecule need, at a minimum, to be determined using a line list which includes all significant transitions in the energy range of interest. We report variational calculations giving ro-vibrational energy levels and corresponding line-strengths for $^{12}$C$_3$, $^{12}$C$^{13}$C$^{12}$C and $^{12}$C$^{12}$C$^{13}$C. In the $^{12}$C$_3$ case we obtain 2166503 ro-vibrational state energies $\le$ 20000 cm$^{-1}$ for the electronic $\tilde{X}^1 \Sigma_g^+$ ground-state. Comparison with experiment indicates a maximum error of +/- 0.03 cm$^{-1}$ in calculated positions of lines involving an upper state energy $\lesssim$ 4000 cm$^{-1}$. For lines with upper state energies $\gtrsim$ 4000 cm$^{-1}$ to have comparable line-position accuracies, conical intersections would need to be accounted for in an adopted potential energy surface. Line lists and associated opacities are provided in the ExoMol Database http://www.exomol.com ).</description>

      <title>The two-body problem in Yukawa gravity (a revisited version) and in Buckingham gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Keplerian-like parametrization of the two-body problem in Yukawa gravity studied in the literature. Some inconsistencies which spoil the Bertrand's theorem, observed, in particular, in the formulae for the pericenter's advance are resolved. Moreover, inspired in this kind of study, we couple the Buckingham potential, a variation of the Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential, with the gravitational Newtonian potential and find a Keplerian-like parametrization for the solution of the two-body problem in this sort of gravity. The outcomes for the advance of the pericenter in both types of gravity are corroborated by using the Landau and Lifshitz's method.</description>

      <title>Exploring the physical origins of halo assembly bias from early times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale linear halo bias encodes the relation between the clustering of dark-matter (DM) halos and that of the underlying matter density field. Although the primary dependence of bias on halo mass is well understood in the context of structure formation, the physical origins of the multiple additional relations at fixed halo mass, commonly known as secondary halo bias, have not been fully elucidated. Of particular relevance is the secondary dependence on halo assembly history, known as halo assembly bias. Our goal is to determine whether the properties of the initial regions from which $z=0$ halos originate produce any secondary bias at $z=0$. By analyzing these initial dependencies in connection with halo assembly bias, we intend to provide insight on the physical origins of the effect. To this end, we select halos at $z=0$ in the IllustrisTNG DM-only simulation and trace back the positions and velocities of their DM particles to $z=12$. The resulting initial regions are characterized according to several shape-related and kinematic properties. The secondary bias signal produced by these properties at $z=0$ is measured using an object-by-object bias estimator, which offers significant analytical advantages. We show that, when split by the properties of their initial DM clouds, $z=0$ halos display significant secondary bias, clearly exceeding the amplitude of the well-known halo assembly bias signal produced by concentration and age. The maximum bias segregation is measured for cloud velocity dispersion and radial velocity, followed by cloud concentration, sphericity, ellipticity and triaxiality. We further show that both velocity dispersion and radial velocity are also the properties of the initial clouds that most strongly correlate with halo age and concentration at fixed halo mass. Our results highlight the importance of linear effects in shaping halo assembly bias.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Black Holes in Non-interacting, Isolated Binaries. Gaia Black Holes as Calibrators of Stellar Winds From Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The black holes discovered using Gaia, especially Gaia BH1 and BH2, have low mass companions of solar-like metallicity in wide orbits. For standard isolated binary evolution formation channels including interactions such an extreme mass ratio is unexpected; especially in orbits of hundreds to thousands of days. Aims. Here, we investigate a non-interacting formation path for isolated binaries to explain the formation of Gaia BH1 and BH2. Methods. We use single star models computed with MESA to constrain the main characteristics of possible progenitors of long-period black hole binaries like Gaia BH1 and BH2. Then, we incorporate these model grids into the binary population synthesis code POSYDON, to explore whether the formation of the observed binaries at solar metallicity is indeed possible. Results. We find that winds of massive stars ($\gtrsim 80\,M_\odot$), especially during the Wolf-Rayet phase, tend to cause a plateau in the initial stellar mass to final black hole mass relation (at about $13\,M_\odot$ in our default wind prescription). However, stellar winds at earlier evolutionary phases are also important at high metallicity, as they prevent the most massive stars from expanding ($&lt;100\,R_\odot$) and filling their Roche lobe. Consequently, the strength of the applied winds affects the range of the final black hole masses in non-interacting binaries, making it possible to form systems similar to Gaia BH1 and BH2. Conclusions. We deduce that wide binaries with a black hole and a low mass companion can form at high metallicity without binary interactions. There could be hundreds of such systems in the Milky Way. The mass of the black hole in binaries evolved through the non-interacting channel can potentially provide insights into the wind strength during the progenitors evolution.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Fall: Stationary and super-Keplerian spiral arms generated by accretion streamers in protostellar discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Late-stage infall onto evolved protoplanetary discs is an important source of material and angular momentum replenishment, and disc substructures. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model streamer-disc interactions for a prograde streamer. The initially parabolic streamer interacts with the disc material to excite disc eccentricity, which can last on the order of $10^5$ years. We found that the spiral arms the streamer excited in the disc can have a variety of pattern speeds, ranging from stationary to super-Keplerian. Spiral arms with various pattern speeds can exist simultaneously, providing a way to diagnose them in observations. Streamer induced spirals appear similar to those generated by a massive outer companion, where the pitch angle of the spiral increases towards the source of the perturbation. Additionally, the spirals arms can show large and sudden pitch angle changes. Streamer induced spirals are long-lived, lasting approximately $3-4\times$ longer than the initial streamer infall timescale ($\sim$$10^4$ years). After the initial interaction with the disc, a long lasting low $m$ azimuthal mode persists in the disc.</description>

      <title>A second radio flare from the tidal disruption event AT2020vwl: a delayed outflow ejection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a second radio flare from the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020vwl via long-term monitoring radio observations. Late-time radio flares from TDEs are being discovered more commonly, with many TDEs showing radio emission 1000s of days after the stellar disruption, but the mechanism that powers these late-time flares is uncertain. Here we present radio spectral observations of the first and second radio flares observed from the TDE AT2020vwl. Through detailed radio spectral monitoring, we find evidence for two distinct outflow ejection episodes, or a period of renewed energy injection into the pre-existing outflow. We deduce that the second radio flare is powered by an outflow that is initially slower than the first flare, but carries more energy and accelerates over time. Through modelling the long-term optical and UV emission from the TDE as arising from an accretion disc, we infer that the second radio outflow launch or energy injection episode occurred approximately at the time of peak accretion rate. The fast decay of the second flare precludes environmental changes as an explanation, while the velocity of the outflow is at all times too low to be explained by an off-axis relativistic jet. Future observations that search for any link between the accretion disc properties and late time radio flares from TDEs will aid in understanding what powers the radio outflows in TDEs, and confirm if multiple outflow ejections or energy injection episodes are common.</description>

      <title>Multi-band optical variability on diverse timescales of blazar 1E 1458.8+2249</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an analysis of the optical variability of the blazar 1E 1458.8+2249 on diverse timescales using multi-band observations, including observations in the optical BVRI bands carried out with the T60 and T100 telescopes from 2020 to 2023 and ZTF gri data from 2018 to 2023. On seven nights, we searched for intraday variability using the power-enhanced F-test and the nested ANOVA test, but no significant variability was found. The long-term light curve shows a variability behaviour in the optical BVRI bands with amplitudes of $\sim100\%$ and in the gri bands with amplitudes of $\sim120\%$, including short-term variability of up to $\sim1.1$ mag. Correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between the optical multi-band emissions without any time lag.From 62 nightly SEDs, we obtained spectral indices between 0.826 and 1.360, with an average of $1.128\pm0.063$. The relationships of both spectral indices and colour with respect to brightness indicate a mild BWB trend throughout the observation period, both intraday and long-term. We also performed a periodicity search using the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle methods. A recurrent optical emission pattern with a quasi-periodicity of $\sim340$ days is detected in the combined V- and R-band light curves. The observational results indicate that the blazar 1E 1458.8+2249 has a complex variability, while emphasising the need for future observations to unravel its underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young star-forming regions in massive environments are ideal test beds to study the influence of surroundings on the evolution of disks around low-mass stars. We explore two distant young clusters, IC 1848-East and West located in the massive W5 complex. These clusters are unique due to their similar (distance, age, and extinction) yet distinct (stellar density and FUV radiation fields) physical properties. We use deep multi-band photometry in optical, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths complete down to the substellar limit in at least five bands. We trace the spectral energy distribution of the sources to identify the young pre-main sequence members in the region and derive their physical parameters. The disk fraction for the East and West clusters down to 0.1 M$_\odot$ was found to be $\sim$27$\pm$2% (N$_{disk}$=184, N$_{diskless}$=492) and $\sim$17$\pm$1% (N$_{disk}$=173, N$_{diskless}$=814), respectively. While no spatial variation in the disk fraction is observed, these values are lower than those in other nearby young clusters. Investigating the cause of this decrease, we find a correlation with the intense feedback from massive stars throughout the cluster area. We also identified the disk sources undergoing accretion and observed the mass accretion rates to exhibit a positive linear relationship with the stellar host mass and an inverse relationship with stellar age. Our findings suggest that the environment significantly influences the dissipation of disks in both clusters. These distant clusters, characterized by their unique attributes, can serve as templates for future studies in outer galaxy regions, offering insights into the influence of feedback mechanisms on star and planetary formation.</description>

Abstract: Polarimetry of stars at optical and near-infrared wavelengths is an invaluable tool for tracing interstellar dust and magnetic fields. Recent studies have demonstrated the power of combining stellar polarimetry with distances from the Gaia mission, in order to gain accurate, three-dimensional information on the properties of the interstellar magnetic field and the dust distribution. However, access to optical polarization data is limited, as observations are conducted by different investigators, with different instruments and are made available in many separate publications. To enable a more widespread accessibility of optical polarimetry for studies of the interstellar medium, we compile a new catalog of stellar polarization measurements. The data are gathered from 81 separate publications spanning two decades since the previous, widely-used agglomeration of catalogs by Heiles (2000). The compilation contains a total of 55,742 measurements of stellar polarization. We combine this database with stellar distances based on the Gaia Early Data Release 3, thereby providing polarization and distance data for 42,482 unique stars. We provide three separate data products: an Extended Polarization Catalog (containing all polarization measurements), a Source Catalog (with distances and stellar identifications) and a Unique Source Polarization and Distance catalog (containing a subset of sources excluding duplicate measurements). We propose the use of a common tabular format for the publication of stellar polarization catalogs to facilitate accessibility and increase discoverability in the future.</description>

      <title>Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. I.Sample from the Early Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei (CL AGN) can be generally confirmed by the emergence (turn-on) or disappearance (turn-off) of broad emission lines, associated with a transient timescale (about $100\sim5000$ days) that is much shorter than predicted by traditional accretion disk models. We carry out a systematic CL AGN search by cross-matching the spectra coming from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Following previous studies, we identify CL AGN based on $\rm{H}\alpha $, $\rm{H}\beta$, and Mg\,{\sc ii} at $z\leq0.75$ and Mg\,{\sc ii}, C\,{\sc iii}], and C\,{\sc iv} at $z&gt;0.75$. We present 130 CL AGN based on visual inspection and three selection criteria, including 2 $\rm{H}\alpha$, 45 $\rm{H}\beta$, 38 Mg\,{\sc ii}, 61 C\,{\sc iii}], and 10 C\,{\sc iv} CL AGN. Twenty cases show simultaneous appearances/disappearances of two broad emission lines while three AGN exhibit the concurrent appearance of three broad emission lines. We also present 91 CL AGN candidates with significant flux variation of broad emission lines but remaining strong broad components. In the confirmed CL AGN, 42 cases show additional CL candidate features for different lines. In this paper, we find 1) a 95:35 ratio of a turn-on to turn-off CL AGN; 2) the highest redshift CL AGN ($z=3.56$) ever discovered; 3) an upper limit transition timescale ranging from 244 to 5762 days in the rest-frame; 4) the majority of CL AGN follow the bluer-when-brighter trend. Our results greatly increase the current CL census ($30\sim50\%$) and would be conducive to explore the underlying physical mechanism.</description>

      <title>Bar formation and destruction in the FIRE-2 simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical mechanisms responsible for bar formation and destruction in galaxies remain a subject of debate. While we have gained valuable insight into how bars form and evolve from isolated idealized simulations, in the cosmological domain, galactic bars evolve in complex environments with mergers, gas accretion events, in presence of turbulent Inter Stellar Medium (ISM) with multiple star formation episodes, in addition to coupling to their host galaxies' dark matter halos. We investigate bar formation in 13 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 (Feedback in Realistic Environments) cosmological zoom-in simulations. 8 of the 13 simulated galaxies form bars at some point during their history: three from tidal interactions and five from internal evolution of the disk. The bars in FIRE-2 are generally shorter than the corotation radius (mean bar radius $\sim 1.53$ kpc), have a wide range of pattern speeds (36--97 km s$^{-1}$kpc$^{-1}$), and live for a wide range of dynamical times (2--160 bar rotations). We find that bar formation in FIRE-2 galaxies is influenced by satellite interactions and the stellar-to-dark matter mass ratio in the inner galaxy, but neither is a sufficient condition for bar formation. Bar formation is more likely to occur, and the bars formed are stronger and longer-lived, if the disks are kinematically cold; galaxies with high central gas fractions and/or vigorous star formation, on the other hand, tend to form weaker bars. In the case of the FIRE-2 galaxies these properties combine to produce ellipsoidal bars with strengths $A_2/A_0 \sim$ 0.1--0.2.</description>

      <title>Simba-EoR: Early galaxy formation in the Simba simulation including a new sub-grid interstellar medium model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We update the dust model present within the Simba galaxy simulations with a self-consistent framework for the co-evolution of dust and molecular hydrogen populations in the interstellar medium, and use this to explore $z \geq 6$ galaxy evolution. In addition to tracking the evolution of dust and molecular hydrogen abundances, our model fully integrates these species into the Simba simulation, explicitly modelling their impact on physical processes such as star formation and cooling through the inclusion of a novel two-phase sub-grid model for interstellar gas. In running two high-resolution simulations down to $z \sim 6$ we find that our Simba-EoR model displays a generally tighter concordance with observational data than fiducial Simba. Additionally we observe that our Simba-EoR models increase star formation activity at early epochs, producing larger dust-to-gas ratios consequently. Finally, we discover a significant population of hot dust at $\sim 100$ K, aligning with contemporaneous observations of high-redshift dusty galaxies, alongside the large $\sim 20$ K population typically identified.</description>

Abstract: The authors of the article set out to investigate the motion of Globular Star Clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way relative to the plane and center of the Galaxy. For this study, we used data from 164 Galactic Globular Clusters derived from Gaia, HST, and literature studies. The study calculated the average GC motion velocities relative to the Galactic plane in the northern and southern regions depending on the galactic latitude b and distance from the Galactic plane. The work consisted of using the GC parameters to find the proper motion of clusters along the Galactic latitude b and the velocities V of cluster motion in the perpendicular direction relative to the Galactic plane for the northern and southern regions, respectively, and determine the average values of these velocities. The velocities V of GC motion were also found depending on the distance to the Galaxy plane and their average values were determined. The work also determined the average velocity VR of motion of the GC relative to the center of the galaxy. The study yielded</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: Insights into the Lyman-alpha line widths and the size of ionized bubbles at the edge of cosmic reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic properties of 22 Lyman-alpha emitters(LAEs) at z=5.5-6.6 with Lyman-alpha(Lya) luminosity log($L_{Lya}$[$ergs^{-1}$])=42.4-43.5, obtained using VLT/MUSE as part of the Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral Field Spectroscopy(MAGPI) survey. Additionally, we incorporate broad-band photometric data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam(HSC) for 17 LAEs in our sample. The HSC-y band magnitudes show that our LAEs are UV-bright, with rest-frame absolute UV magnitudes -19.7 &lt; $M_{UV}$ &lt; -23.3. We find that the Lya line width increases with luminosity, and this trend becomes more prominent at z &gt; 6 where Lya lines become significantly broadened (&gt; 260 $kms^{-1}$) at luminosities log($L_{Lya}$[$ergs^{-1}$]) &gt; 43. This broadening is consistent with previous studies, suggesting that these sources are located inside larger ionized bubbles. We observe a slightly elevated ionizing photon production efficiency estimated for LAEs at z &gt; 6, indicating that younger galaxies could be producing more ionizing photons per UV luminosity. A tentative anti-correlation between ionizing photon production efficiency and Lya rest-frame equivalent width is noticed, which could indicate a time delay between production and escape of ionizing photon primarily due to supernovae activity. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation between bubble radius and Lya line width, which again suggests that large ionized bubbles are created around these LAEs, allowing them to self-shield from the scattering effects of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We also detect two closely separated LAEs at z=6.046 (projected spatial separation is 15.92 kpc). The size of their respective bubbles suggests that they likely sit inside a common large ionized region. Such a closely-separated LAE pair increases the size of ionized bubble, potentially allowing a boosted transmission of Lya through neutral IGM. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>ProGeny I: a new simple stellar population generator and impact of isochrones / stellar atmospheres / initial mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce ProGeny, a new stellar population library (SPL) software package written in R. This release encapsulates the core software to generate simple/single stellar populations (SSPs); the various data inputs required (in particular isochrones and stellar atmospheres); example scripts to generate the SSPs; and a number of pre-generated static SSP available for immediate use. The most novel feature of ProGeny is its ability to produce SSPs with evolving initial mass functions (IMFs), allowing functional dependencies on stellar age or metallicity. We perform both internal comparisons (within the ProGeny SPL) and external comparisons (with other public SSPs) and tests. The main conclusion is that the choice of isochrone has significantly more impact on the predicted spectra than the choice of stellar atmospheres and/or IMF (comparing Chabrier and Kroupa variants). A number of limiting uncertainties and corrections for star formation rates and stellar masses are also presented.</description>

      <title>ProGeny II: the impact of libraries and model configurations on inferred galaxy properties in SED fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a volume-complete sample of ~8,000 galaxies from the GAMA survey to characterise the impact of stellar population libraries (SPLs) and model configurations on the resulting inferred galaxy properties from Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. We compare a fiducial SPL from ProGeny (a new tool that can generate SPLs quickly and flexibly) against five other commonly used SPLs using the SED-fitting code ProSpect. The impact of selecting each SPL is compared to the consequence of changing the model implementation in the SED fitting process, including the implementation of metallicity evolution versus a fixed or constant metallicity, and a functional parametric star formation history (SFH) versus a stepwise parametric (or "non-parametric") SFH. Furthermore, we use ProGeny to assess the impact of sub-SPL choices, including isochrone selection, atmosphere selection, and IMF selection. Through a comparison of derived stellar masses, star formation rates, metallicities, ages, and the inferred cosmic star formation history (CSFH), we rank the impact of varying choices. Overall the assumption of a solar metallicity creates the greatest biases, with a substantial impact also caused by the choice of a specific SPL. To recover a CSFH most consistent with observations, we advocate for the use of the fiducial implementation with a skewed Normal functional form for the SFH, and an evolving metallicity. While all current SPLs currently underestimate the peak in the CSFH, ProGeny and FSPS are the closest to recovering the observed CSFH.</description>

      <title>Deep learning interpretability analysis for carbon star identification in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. A large fraction of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars develop carbon-rich atmospheres during their evolution. Based on their color and luminosity, these carbon stars can be easily distinguished from many other kinds of stars. However, numerous G, K, and M giants also occupy the same region as carbon stars on the HR diagram. Despite this, their spectra exhibit differences, especially in the prominent CN molecular bands. Target. We aim to distinguish carbon stars from other kinds of stars using $Gaia$'s XP spectra, while providing attributional interpretations of key features necessary for identification, and even discovering additional new spectral key features. Method. We propose a classification model named `GaiaNet', an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network specifically designed for handling $Gaia$'s XP spectra. We utilized the SHAP interpretability model to determine SHAP values for each feature in a spectrum, enabling us to explain the output of the `GaiaNet' model and provide further meaningful analysis. Compared to four traditional machine-learning methods, the `GaiaNet' model exhibits an average classification accuracy improvement of approximately 0.3% on the validation set, with the highest accuracy reaching 100%. Utilizing the SHAP model, we present a clear spectroscopic heatmap highlighting molecular band absorption features primarily distributed around CN773.3 and CN895.0, and summarize five key feature regions for carbon star identification. Upon applying the trained classification model to the CSTAR sample with Gaia `xp_sampled_mean' spectra, we obtained 451 new candidate carbon stars as a by-product.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at low metallicity IX: Empirical constraints on mass-loss rates and clumping parameters for OB supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Current implementations of mass loss for hot, massive stars in stellar evolution models include a sharp increase in mass loss when blue supergiants become cooler than Teff 20-22kK. This drastic mass-loss jump has been motivated by the potential presence of a so-called bistability ionisation effect, which may occur for line-driven winds in this temperature region due to recombination of important line-driving ions. Aims. We perform quantitative spectroscopy using UV (ULLYSES program) and optical (XShootU collaboration) data for 17 OB-supergiant stars in the LMC (covering the range Teff 14-32kK), deriving absolute constraints on global stellar, wind, and clumping parameters. We examine whether there are any empirical signs of a mass-loss jump in the investigated region, and we study the clumped nature of the wind. Methods. We use a combination of the model atmosphere code fastwind and the genetic algorithm code Kiwi-GA to fit synthetic spectra of a multitude of diagnostic spectral lines in the optical and UV. Results. We find no signs of any upward mass loss jump anywhere in the examined region. Standard theoretical comparison models, which include a strong bistability jump thus severely over predict the empirical mass-loss rates on the cool side of the predicted jump. Additionally, we find that on average about 40% of the total wind mass seems to reside in the diluted medium in between dense clumps. Conclusions. Our derived mass-loss rates suggest that for applications like stellar evolution one should not include a drastic bistability jump in mass loss for stars in the temperature and luminosity region investigated here. The derived high values of interclump density further suggest that the common assumption of an effectively void interclump medium (applied in the vast majority of spectroscopic studies of hot star winds) is not generally valid in this parameter regime.</description>
