      <title>Three-dimensional inversion of gravity data using implicit neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inversion of gravity data is an important method for investigating subsurface density variations relevant to diverse applications including mineral exploration, geothermal assessment, carbon storage, natural hydrogen, groundwater resources, and tectonic evolution. Here we present a scientific machine-learning approach for three-dimensional gravity inversion that represents subsurface density as a continuous field using an implicit neural representation (INR). The method trains a deep neural network directly through a physics-based forward-model loss, mapping spatial coordinates to a continuous density field without predefined meshes or discretisation. Positional encoding enhances the network's capacity to capture sharp contrasts and short-wavelength features that conventional coordinate-based networks tend to oversmooth due to spectral bias. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic examples including Gaussian random fields, representing realistic geological complexity, and a dipping block model to assess recovery of blocky structures. The INR framework reconstructs detailed structure and geologically plausible boundaries without explicit regularisation or depth weighting, while significantly reducing the number of inversion parameters. These results highlight the potential of implicit representations to enable scalable, flexible, and interpretable large-scale geophysical inversion. This framework could generalise to other geophysical methods and for joint/multiphysics inversion.</description>

      <title>Developing an Open-access Telegram Bot for Automated, estimation and IA-based interpreted of OpenQuake Ground-Motion intensity measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of Intensity Measures (IMs) using Ground-Motion Models (GMM) is a fundamental component of seismic hazard assessment. However, the best estimation of IMs traditionally requires specialised searchers, programming expertise, and the manual sourcing of regression coefficients. This complexity creates a significant barrier to rapid, scenario-based analysis for engineers, researchers, and students. To address this challenge, we have developed the OpenGSIM bot, an automated and conversational workflow that provides on-demand access to the entire OpenQuake-engine GMM library via the Telegram messaging application. The system leverages the n8n workflow automation platform to orchestrate a user interaction, guiding the selection from over 21 IMs along with their associated total standard deviation (aleatory variability) and more than 500 distinct GMMs classes. The bot interactively elicits the necessary physical parameters, accounting for source, path, site, geological, tectonic, and regional effects as required by the chosen model. A Python wrapper executes the calculation and generates a comprehensive report. A Large Language Model is used to provide an automated interpretation of different types of response spectrum. By abstracting the complexities of software installation and programming, OpenGSIM democratises access to advanced seismic hazard tools, enabling robust IM estimation on any device and without the installation of any software or code package.</description>

      <title>Mineral Type Impact on Thermal Conductivity of Biocement and Biocemented Sand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study experimentally investigates the influence of CaCO3 polymorphs on the thermal conductivity (TC) of biocement and biocemented sand. Calcite-rich biocements consistently showed higher TC than vaterite-dominated ones, regardless of density or saturation. Vaterite-rich biocement, resulting from rapid precipitation and elevated organic content, yields inherently lower TC. This study shed light on the limited TC improvement observed in vaterite-rich biocemented sand.</description>
