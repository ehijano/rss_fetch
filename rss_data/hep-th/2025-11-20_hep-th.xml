      <title>Spinors and the quaternionic Poincar\'e group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When four dimensional spacetime R is considered as locally embedded on a larger manifold M, labelled by higher division algebra coordinates, a natural question to ask is how much of the symmetry properties of the larger space are inherited by R. Here this question is studied when M is a quaternion manifold. Of particular relevance is the absence of spinors in the linear representations of the symmetry group of the larger manifold and the emergence of new quantum numbers when, by Whitney sums, spinors are implemented on the vector bundles associated to the coset manifolds of the symmetry groups of M. A possible relation to the structures of the standard model is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Infrared Landscape of the SYK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a class of SYK models whose Hamiltonian is the sum of two SYK Hamiltonians with different numbers of fermions $q, \tilde q$ in each interaction. We consider both Euclidean and Lorentzian probes of the quantum system in the large $N$ limit. In the strong coupling phase, the entropy provides a diagnostic of the thermal renormalisation group flow. Under certain conditions, two parametrically separated regimes of near-conformal behaviour emerge. The first reproduces the standard linear-in-temperature scaling characteristic of the single SYK model. The system then flows to another near-fixed point whose entropy scaling depends on the ratio $n = q/\tilde q$. For $n&lt;3/2$, the entropy exhibits anomalous, faster-than-linear scaling in temperature. At $n=3/2$, there is an additional logarithmic enhancement. Using conformal perturbation theory, we argue that in the infrared regime of the SYK model, there may exist disordered conformal operators with dimensions $1 &lt; \Delta \leq 3/2$. In Lorentzian signature, we study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and show that these deformed theories exhibit near-maximal chaos in both regimes (when they exist). We comment on the relation between the anomalous scalings found here and those observed in certain near-extremal black holes in two and higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Penrose Transform and the Kerr-Schild double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are a number of classical double copies, each providing a prescription for generating solutions to the Maxwell and scalar wave equations from exact solutions of Einstein's equations. Two such prescriptions are the Kerr-Schild and twistorial double copies. We argue that for a broad class of self-dual vacuum solutions of the Kerr-Schild form, which we refer to as twistorial Kerr-Schild spacetimes, these two prescriptions are in fact equivalent. The approach is elementary, utilizing null Lorentz transformations, with homogenous functions on twistor space playing a central role. The equivalence is illustrated explicitly for the example of the self-dual (Kerr)-Taub-NUT spacetime. A detailed proof and several more examples will be presented in a long-form companion to this letter.</description>

      <title>Sampling Polynomial Rational Remainders with SP$\mathbb{Q}$R: A new Package for Polynomial Division and Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SP$\mathbb{Q}$R, a new Mathematica package for the division and elimination of variables from polynomial systems. SP$\mathbb{Q}$R works by sampling and reconstructing results over finite fields, in an analogous manner to many state of the art Integration by Parts algorithms for Feynman integrals. This allows SP$\mathbb{Q}$R to effectively overcome expression swell during the construction of Gr\"obner bases, which in many cases is the major bottleneck in such computations. Benchmarks on state of the art Macaulay resultants show that SP$\mathbb{Q}$R can deliver substantial gains over symbolic computer algebra workflows -- reducing both runtime and memory footprint by multiple orders of magnitude. Likewise when applied to study Feynman integrals, we show how SP$\mathbb{Q}$R can be used to find previously unknown Landau singularities.</description>

      <title>Unitary SUSY for the chiral graviton and chiral gravitino in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that a unitary supersymmetric quantum field theory (QFT) involving graviton and gravitino fields on fixed 4-dimensional de Sitter spacetime ($dS_4$) cannot exist due to known challenges associated with supersymmetry (SUSY) on spaces with positive cosmological constant. In this talk, we contradict this expectation by presenting a new unitary supersymmetric QFT on fixed $dS_4$ : the free supersymmetric theory of the chiral graviton and chiral gravitino fields. The theory overcomes the known obstacles to unitary global SUSY on de Sitter because the commutator between two SUSY transformations closes on the conformal algebra $so(4,2)$ rather than the de Sitter algebra $so(4,1)$. Crucially, the $so(4,2)$ symmetry is realised through unconventional conformal-like transformations. Based on arxiv:2503.04515.</description>

      <title>Note on Logical Gates by Gauge Field Formalism of Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge field formalism, or operator-valued cochain formalism, has recently emerged as a powerful framework for describing quantum Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. In this work, we extend this framework to construct a broad class of logical gates for general CSS codes, including the S, Hadamard, T, and (multi-)controlled-Z gates, under the condition where fault-tolerance or circuit-depth optimality is not necessarily imposed. We show that these logical gates can be expressed as exponential of polynomial functions of the electric and magnetic gauge fields, which allows us to derive explicit decompositions into physical gates. We further prove that their logical action depends only on the (co)homology classes of the corresponding logical qubits, establishing consistency as logical operations. Our results provide a systematic method for formulating logical gates for general CSS codes, offering new insights into the interplay between quantum error correction, algebraic topology, and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>A construction of single-valued elliptic polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general construction of single-valued elliptic polylogarithms as functions on the once-punctured elliptic curve. Our formalism is an extension of Brown's construction of genus-zero single-valued polylogarithms to the elliptic curve: the condition of trivial monodromy for solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation is expressed in terms of elliptic associators and involves two representations of a two-letter alphabet. Our elliptic single-valued condition reduces to Brown's genus-zero condition upon degeneration of the torus. We provide several examples for our construction, including the elliptic Bloch-Wigner dilogarithm.</description>

      <title>Reflection positivity in a higher-derivative model with physical bound states of ghosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusion of higher derivatives is a necessary condition for a renormalizable or superrenormalizable local theory of quantum gravity. On the other hand, higher derivatives lead to classical instabilities and a loss of unitarity at the quantum level. A standard way to detect such issues is by examining the reflection positivity condition and the existence of a Kallen-Lehmann spectral representation for the two-point function. We demonstrate that these requirements for a consistent quantum theory are satisfied in a theory we have recently proposed. This theory is based on a six-derivative scalar field action featuring a pair of complex-mass ghost fields that form a bound state. Our results support the interpretation that physical observables can emerge from ghost dynamics in a consistent and unitary framework.</description>

      <title>New algorithms for Feynman integral reduction and $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a detailed account of the algorithm outlined in [1] for Feynman integral reduction and $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations. The algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, we use a new geometric order relation in the integration-by-parts reduction to obtain a basis of master integrals, whose differential equations are of a Laurent polynomial form in the regularisation parameter $\varepsilon$ and compatible with a filtration. This step works entirely with rational functions. In a second step, we provide a method to $\varepsilon$-factorise the aforementioned Laurent differential equations. The second step may introduce algebraic and transcendental functions. We illustrate the versatility of the algorithm by applying it to different examples with a wide range of complexity.</description>

      <title>Probing decoupled Throats of AdS$_{D}$ Black Holes in $D=6,7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kerr/CFT correspondence establishes a relationship between extremal black holes in higher dimensions and a chiral conformal field theory (CFT) in their near-horizon limit. A generalization of this framework, known as the EVH/CFT correspondence, has been developed for four- and five-dimensional AdS black holes. It was further proposed in arXiv:1910.14293 that a generalized duality between $(D-2)$ dimensional geometry and $(D-3)$ dimensional field theory may emerge in AdS$_{D=6,7}$ black holes under a suitably defined extremal vanishing horizon (EVH) limit. In this work, we demonstrate that the near-EVH geometries arising in these AdS$_{6,7}$ black hole models are not of the standard lower dimensional AdS kinds of black holes to establish a lower dimensional version of AdS/CFT correspondence, but instead belong to the family of Einstein-Maxwell-Maxwell-dilaton (EMMD) gravity theories. This realization opens a pathway toward a microscopic counting of non-AdS black hole entropy via higher-dimensional AdS/CFT techniques.</description>

      <title>Self-dual instantons and gravitating dyons in non-Abelian ModMax theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in conformal and duality invariant nonlinear electrodynamics, we study the non-Abelian extension of ModMax electrodynamics. The theory is parameterized by a single dimensionless constant, and it is continuously connected to Yang-Mills theory in its vanishing limit. We show that the theory admits (anti-)self-dual instantons, despite the additional nonlinearities that characterize the non-Abelian ModMax theory. For $SU(2)$, we construct the generalization of the BPST instanton and extend this solution to Euclidean de Sitter and anti-de Sitter backgrounds. In the latter case, the Chern-Pontryagin index depends on the instanton size since the configuration is not a pure gauge at infinity; a property already pointed out in Yang-Mills on negative-curvature backgrounds by Callan and Wilczek. We compute the contribution of the latter to the spectrum of the Dirac operator at the boundary, which is crucial for determining the non-local contributions to the Dirac index. Then, we show that the ansatz constructed with 't Hooft symbols accommodates multi-instantons in the non-Abelian ModMax theory. The system of (anti-)self-dual equations reduces to a single nonlinear equation, which can be perturbatively solved order by order in the parameter that controls the nonlinearity. Following such a strategy, we provide a formal solution for the $N$-instanton configuration to first order in the expansion. Then, we couple non-Abelian ModMax theory to gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field and construct new gravitating solutions that describe Euclidean wormholes and other smooth configurations with secondary hair.</description>

      <title>The effective field theory of the gravitational functional measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral measure has been the subject of an increasing interest lately, and no conclusive answer yet exists for its correct form. In this paper, we adopt effective field theory techniques to shed light on this issue. We build the configuration-space metric as an energy expansion, including all possible terms that satisfy the underlying symmetries, and use it to define a Riemannian measure. We study the running of the free parameters that show up in this expansion at leading order, which corresponds to the DeWitt metric with parameter $\lambda$. We show that a flat configuration space is excluded on unitarity grounds. The renormalization group contains one UV fixed point at $\lambda=-1$, thus allowing for the UV completion of the measure sector. This fixed point corresponds to the value obtained by identifying DeWitt's metric from the kinetic term of general relativity, a standard procedure in the literature that otherwise lacks physical motivation. Our results provide such a justification from first principles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky quantization of the quadratic gravity theory, which is the most general theory with terms up to quadratic order in curvature. This approach of quantization is based on the Hamiltonian formulation. In this sense, this study contributes to the consistency of the quantum formulation of the theory. With this scheme of quantization we may introduce a broad class of additional conditions on the field variables, by including Lagrange multipliers and time derivatives. We find that a mandatory condition for the validity of the Hamiltonian formulation, previously known from classical analysis, can be incorporated consistently in this quantization. We obtain the propagators of the fields, including the propagators associated with the quantum states of negative norm. The spectrum of masses coincides with the results of Stelle, but distributed on a different way among the fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider complex, supersymmetric, non-extremal Euclidean black holes that are asymptotically locally AdS$_5$, with $S^1 \times M_3$ conformal boundary. We study field theory backgrounds consisting of various $M_3$, and explicitly construct Killing spinors that are anti-periodic around the Euclidean time circle. Focussing on elliptically/biaxially squashed three-spheres and Lens spaces, we compute the supersymmetric index of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM in a Cardy-like limit. While such black holes have not been constructed for general $M_3$, we show that our field theory results can be recovered from a gravity computation using equivariant localization, just assuming the solutions exist.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior and real-time scattering dynamics of the interacting $\phi^4$ quantum field theory in $(1+1)$ dimensions using uniform matrix product states and the time-dependent variational principle. A finite-entanglement scaling analysis at $\lambda = 0.8$ bounds the critical mass-squared to $\mu_c^2 \in [-0.3190,-0.3185]$ and provides a quantitative map of the symmetric, near-critical, weakly broken, and deeply broken regimes. Using these ground states as asymptotic vacua, we simulate two-particle collisions in a sandwich geometry and extract the elastic scattering probability $P_{11\to 11}(E)$ and Wigner time delay $\Delta t(E)$ following the prescription of Jha et al. [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 023266 (2025)]. We find strongly inelastic scattering in the symmetric phase ($P_{11\to 11} \simeq 0.63$, $\Delta t \simeq -180$ for $\mu^2 = 0.2$), almost perfectly elastic collisions in the spontaneously broken phase ($P_{11\to 11} \simeq 0.998$, $\Delta t \simeq -270$ for $\mu^2=-0.2$ and $P_{11\to 11} \simeq 1$, $\Delta t \simeq -177.781$ for $\mu^2=-0.5$), and a breakdown of the sandwich evolution precisely at the critical coupling, which provides a dynamical signature of the quantum critical point. These results demonstrate that TDVP-based uniform matrix product states can probe nonperturbative scattering and critical dynamics in lattice $\phi^4$ theory with controlled entanglement truncation.</description>

      <title>Twisting asymptotically-flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Bondi formalism to describe asymptotically-flat spacetimes where the outgoing null geodesic congruence is not hypersurface-orthogonal, i.e. has a non-vanishing twist. In the Newman-Penrose formulation, the twist $\text{Im}(\rho)$ is sourced by a twist potential sitting in the transverse null dyad $(m,\bar{m})$, while in the metric formulation this potential arises from $g_{ra}\neq0$. We explain how to arrange and solve the Einstein equations for such generalized line elements, thereby providing an extension of the Bondi hierarchy to asymptotically-flat spacetimes with non-vanishing twist. We work out the twisting generalizations of all the well-known features pertaining to asymptotically-flat spacetimes in Bondi gauge, such as the solution space, the flux-balance laws, the asymptotic symmetries, and the transformation laws. The twist potential has a natural Carrollian interpretation as an Ehresmann connection, and gives rise to Carroll boosts as extra asymptotic symmetries. One of the advantages of the Bondi gauge with non-vanishing twist is that it allows to write algebraically special solutions in a manifestly finite radial expansion, and with a repeated principal null direction such that $\Psi_0=\Psi_1=0$. This is in particular the case for the Kerr-Taub-NUT solution. The asymptotic symmetries of algebraically special solutions also have a finite radial expansion, which enables to study the supertranslated Schwarzschild solution and its charges quite straightforwardly. We expect that these results will find applications in the development of flat holography for algebraically special solutions and in the study of their perturbations. We also study an analogue of the twist in three-dimensional spacetimes with non-vanishing cosmological constant, and find an 8-dimensional solution space which encompasses and generalizes the existing results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics for a two-component plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics for a two-component ultrarelativistic plasma directly from kinetic theory. Starting with the Boltzmann--Vlasov equation and using the 14-moment approximation in the Landau frame, we obtain coupled evolution equations for the charge diffusion four-current and the shear-stress tensor. Benchmarking against the usual Israel-Stewart type relaxation form shows that this simplified description is accurate for small viscosity to entropy ($\eta/s$) ratio, vanishing magnetic field, and not so strong electric field. Outside this regime the dynamics depart in a controlled way, i.e., strong electric fields introduce nonlinear back-reaction that delays and reduces current peaks, and a sizable shear-stress is produced even without a flow profile.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Black Holes and Their Environments: Consequences for Gravitational Wave Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ten short years ago, we had the rare privilege of witnessing the onset of a renaissance in science: humanity finally succeeded in its arduous quest to directly detect gravitational waves. This breakthrough did not occur in a vacuum: it was the natural culmination of decades of research dedicated towards understanding the nature of gravitation based on Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. It is a story of false starts, perseverance, and remarkable insights, propelled as much by technological progress as by human curiosity. We now proudly live in the new golden age of gravitational physics. The detection of gravitational wave signals from the merger of binary black holes and neutron stars are becoming routine. Coupled with our theoretical understanding of phenomena in the strong gravity regime, black hole physics has become a precision science. The purpose of these lecture notes is to help the reader understand the language and framework of this rapidly evolving subject, and to develop the ability to interpret, think, and discuss ideas that lie at the confluence of gravitational wave astronomy and black hole physics. It is our hope that these notes will prepare students and colleagues for the next revolution when gravitational wave events become commonplace and we begin to observe unexpected features in the signal, indicating either surprising astrophysical scenarios or a strong need to modify the theoretical description of gravitational interactions. We provide first principles analysis of black hole and gravitational wave physics, and sometimes a very personal interpretation of results. We share with the readers a number of notebooks that will allow them to reproduce some of the most important results in the field, and could even help in carrying out state-of-the-art research. We also include a few original results that we think are helpful in understanding the broader picture.</description>

      <title>From minimal-length quantum theory to modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider generalized uncertainty principles (GUPs) that incorporate a minimal length through generic momentum-dependent deformation functions. We thus develop a systematic approach connecting such a framework to effective gravitational actions extending general relativity. By examining quantum gravity-motivated corrections to black hole entropy induced by the GUP and employing Wald's formalism, we reconstruct modifications to Einstein's gravity within the contexts of $f(R)$ and $f(R, R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu})$ theories. In this way, we establish a direct mapping between the GUP parameters and the higher-order curvature coefficients in the gravitational Lagrangian. As an illustrative application, we compute corrections to the general relativistic prediction for light deflection, which in turn allows us to infer a stringent upper bound on the minimal measurable length. Our results show that GUP-induced effects can be consistently embedded into extended gravity theories, offering a promising framework for testing quantum gravity phenomenology through astrophysical and cosmological observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the structure of both Abelian and non-Abelian non-global logarithms up to four loops for $e^+ e^-$ processes in perturbative QCD, where final-state jets are defined using the Cambridge-Aachen (C/A) clustering algorithm. The calculations are performed within the soft (eikonal) approximation using strong-energy ordering of the final-state partons. The resulting expressions include full colour and complete jet-radius dependence. Compared to the anti-$k_t$ and $k_t$ clustering algorithms, the C/A distribution minimises the impact of these non-global logarithms, making it the preferred choice among the three algorithms.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bound State Perturbations Inside Black Holes and Isospectrality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bound state solutions for the polar perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. It is shown that for a given value of the spherical harmonic index $\ell$, there are a total of $\ell-1$ bound states for polar perturbations. We show both analytically and numerically that the spectrum of $\ell-2$ of these perturbations agrees identically with the spectrum of axial perturbations. Correspondingly, the isospectrality between the bound states of the axial and polar perturbations in the interior of the black hole does hold. This is significant since the effective potential is singular at the center of the black hole, and the existence of the isospectrality is far from obvious. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional mode found in the spectrum of polar perturbations is the algebraically special mode, which is the ground state of polar perturbations as well.</description>

      <title>Covariant Measures of Non-Markovianity in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard measures of quantum non-Markovianity are usually defined in terms of dynamical maps on a preferred time foliation and therefore do not extend straightforwardly to curved spacetimes, where no global time coordinate exists and causal structure is primary. We develop a covariant framework for open quantum dynamics along arbitrary timelike worldlines by building multi-time quantum processes (process tensors) from overlapping causal diamonds. For an Unruh--DeWitt detector weakly coupled to a scalar field in a Hadamard state, we define a foliation-independent measure of non-Markovianity as the operational distance between the physical process tensor and the convex set of Markovian (CP-divisible) processes. Numerical benchmarks in $(1{+}1)$ dimensions compare inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and static and infalling trajectories in Schwarzschild spacetime. Inertial trajectories are found to be almost Markovian, whereas acceleration and curvature generate pronounced long-range temporal correlations and strong non-Markovian behaviour. In Rindler spacetime, acceleration produces horizon-induced memory tails. In Schwarzschild spacetime, near-horizon field correlations cause both static and freely falling observers to experience enhanced memory, which can remain hidden in single-step diagnostics but becomes evident in multi-time protocols and can even be superactivated by combining different time steps. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first coordinate-independent, operational quantification of quantum memory in relativistic settings. They identify spacetime curvature, horizons, and acceleration as controllable ingredients that can either degrade or be harnessed as resources in relativistic quantum information tasks, including communication and metrology with accelerated detectors and near black holes.</description>

      <title>A New Definition of Horndeski Theory and the Possibility of Multiple Scalar Field Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the single-field case, Horndeski provides the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations. By contrast, systematic multi-field extensions remain incomplete: while the general field equations for the bi-Horndeski case are known, a general action has not been established, and for cases with three or more fields, neither a general action nor general equations are available. We characterize Horndeski by two mild axioms: closure under invertible pure disformal transformations and the requirement that the theory includes the minimal Horndeski theory. Under this characterization, we recover the standard single-field action up to boundary terms and obtain a practical path to multi-field constructions. In particular, we show that antisymmetric structures, such as those identified by Allys, Akama, and Kobayashi, appear within this framework, and indicate that this viewpoint has the potential to account for features captured by known bi-Horndeski equations.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the emergence of non-Abelian zero modes from twist defects in Abelian topological phases. We consider a setup built from a fractional quantum Hall (FQH)-superconductor heterostructure, which effectively induces a phase transition, leading to a topological phase endowed with new anyonic symmetries, and accordingly supporting distinct types of zero modes at fixed filling. These defects are modeled at the interface between two copies of the same heterostructure arranged side by side, which produces counterpropagating modes that can be gapped by interactions that realize the anyonic symmetries. We characterize the parafermions associated with each anyonic symmetry and discuss how their presence affect the periodicity of Josephson tunneling current.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky potential and power suppression in hybrid Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect on the primordial tensor power spectrum of varying the number of e-folds during slow-roll inflation in Loop Quantum Cosmology with a Starobinsky potential. Using the hybrid quantization approach, we derive the effective mass governing tensor mode evolution. The choice of vacuum state is crucial, especially since the preinflationary phase predicted by Loop Quantum Cosmology invalidates the choice of the Bunch-Davies state as the preferred vacuum. We adopt a choice which is optimally adapted to the dynamics, so that it provides a non-oscillating (NO) spectrum free of spurious contributions, and permits an asymptotic Hamiltonian diagonalization (AHD) of the perturbations. For this so-called NO-AHD vacuum, we compute the power spectrum using both analytic approximations and numerical integration. Our results confirm the accuracy of our approximations in a wide range of situations, including short- and long-lived inflationary scenarios. The primordial power spectrum exhibits a characteristic cutoff on a wavenumber scale determined primarily by the background dynamics around the bounce that replaces the big bang in Loop Quantum Cosmology.</description>

Abstract: We present a categorical formulation of the Hamiltonian renormalisation programme for quantum field theories, establishing a systematic bridge between functional and lattice renormalisation. To this end, we introduce two categories, $Seq$ and $Func$, whose objects correspond to resolution spaces at different ultraviolet scales, and whose morphisms encode embeddings, projections, coarse-graining maps, and discrete derivatives.
  Focusing on Dirichlet-type embeddings, we construct the corresponding subcategories $Seq_D$, $Func_D$ and prove that the embedding and its adjoint define functors between them.
  Furthermore we revisit and extend the analysis of the convergence rate to the fixed point for the couplings of the $U(1)^3$ model for $3+1$ Euclidean quantum gravity, analysing different combinations of Haar and Dirichlet embeddings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer models are effective in describing quantum gravity effects around the initial singularity, leading to its replacement by bouncing surfaces on which the curvature and densities are finite. Their properties depend on the space-time symmetry and on the particular polymerisation scheme adopted. In this article we investigate anisotropic models under the Gambini-Ben\'itez-Pullin polymerisation, recently used to quantise spherically symmetric black-holes, whose interiors are isometric to Kantowski-Sachs (KS) space-times. Demanding that the minimum area defined by the bouncing surface matches the Loop Quantum Gravity area gap, we can find its radius alongside the curvature and effective density and pressures at the bounce. The density is always positive, while the pressures are negative enough to avoid the singularity. Due to the positive spatial curvature, the solution is oscillatory, reaching a maximum radius where a re-collapse occurs. Therefore, a positive cosmological constant is included in order to have an eternal expansion to a late de Sitter phase. We have also considered a Bianchi III metric, showing that the bounce is still present, but the space-time is asymptotically flat in this case, with no re-collapse. In this hyperbolic space, the minimal area constraint can also be imposed on compact $2$-surfaces. Nevertheless, in contrast to the KS case, it is enough for avoiding the singularity, independently of polymerisation procedures.</description>

Abstract: Using the fact that flat space with a boundary is related by a Weyl transformation to anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, one may study observables in boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) by placing a CFT in AdS. In addition to correlation functions of local operators, a quantity of interest is the free energy of the CFT computed on the AdS space with hyperbolic ball metric, i.e. with a spherical boundary. It is natural to expect that the AdS free energy can be used to define a quantity that decreases under boundary renormalization group (RG) flows. We test this idea by discussing in detail the case of the large $N$ critical $O(N)$ model in general dimension $d$, as well as its perturbative descriptions in the epsilon-expansion. Using the AdS approach, we recover the various known boundary critical behaviors of the model, and we compute the free energy for each boundary fixed point, finding results which are consistent with the conjectured $F$-theorem in a continuous range of dimensions. Finally, we also use the AdS setup to compute correlation functions and extract some of the BCFT data. In particular, we show that using the bulk equations of motion, in conjunction with crossing symmetry, gives an efficient way to constrain bulk two-point functions and extract anomalous dimensions of boundary operators.</description>

Abstract: Chiral higher-spin gravity is a higher-spin extension of both self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity and is a unique local higher-spin gravity in four dimensions. Its existence implies that there are two closed subsectors in Chern-Simons matter theories. We make first steps in identifying these (anti-)chiral subsectors directly on the CFT side, which should result in a holographically dual pair where both sides are nontrivial, complete, yet exactly soluble. We also discuss closely related theories: self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) and self-dual gravity (SDGR) in the holographic context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review 2d CFT in the bootstrap approach, and sketch the known exactly solvable CFTs with no extended chiral symmetry: Liouville theory, (generalized) minimal models, limits thereof, and loop CFTs, including the $O(n)$, Potts and $PSU(n)$ CFTs.
  Exact solvability relies on local conformal symmetry, and on the existence of degenerate fields. We show how these assumptions constrain the spectrum and correlation functions. We discuss how crossing symmetry equations can be solved analytically and/or numerically, leading to analytic expressions for structure constants in terms of the double Gamma function.
  In the case of loop CFTs, we sketch the corresponding statistical models, and derive the relation between statistical and CFT variables. We review the resulting combinatorial description of correlation functions, and discuss what remains to be done for solving the CFTs.</description>

Abstract: This article continues previous work done in arXiv:2406.01907. It is shown in more detail how vacuum partition functions and the cosmological constant vanish at all orders of perturbation theory. Further, all-multiplicity higher-loop amplitudes are given and shown to be modular invariant, to have proper factorization, and to be UV-finite at least up to one-loop level, formally even to all levels. Therefore, the model provides a modular invariant and unitary N=8 supergravity theory in twistor space with embedded Super-Yang-Mills and promising UV-finiteness behavior.</description>

      <title>Modular-invariant random matrix theory and AdS${}_3$ wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a non-perturbative definition of RMT${}_2$: a generalization of random matrix theory that is compatible with the symmetries of two-dimensional conformal field theory. Given any random matrix ensemble, its $n$-point spectral correlations admit a prescribed modular-invariant lift to RMT${}_2$, which moreover reduce to the original random matrix correlators in a near-extremal limit. Central to the prescription is a presentation of random matrix theory in Mellin space, which lifts to two dimensions via the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ spectral decomposition employed in previous work. As a demonstration we perform the explicit RMT${}_2$ lift of two-point correlations of the GUE Airy model. We propose that in AdS$_3$ pure gravity, semiclassical amplitudes for off-shell $n$-boundary torus wormholes with topology $\Sigma_{0,n} \times S^1$ are given by the RMT${}_2$ lift of JT gravity wormhole amplitudes. For the three-boundary case, we identify a gravity calculation which matches the RMT${}_2$ result.</description>

      <title>Integrability and Conformal Blocks for Surface Defects in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various aspects of half-BPS surface defect operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. For defects on generic points on the moduli space we use superconformal symmetry to fix the form of one-point and two-point functions of half-BPS operators and solve the superconformal Ward identities in terms of superconformal blocks, emphasizing the role of the broken rotational symmetry transverse to the defect in the superconformal block expansion. We verify this expansion by the leading-order perturbative calculation for the two-point functions. We also investigate the integrability of the defect CFT in the planar limit and argue that the integrability is broken at generic points of the defect moduli. The integrability is expected to be restored in the singular point of this moduli space where another "rigid" branch appears, and we provide evidence for this by showing that the defect one-point functions in this case can be mapped to a class of known integrable quenches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify a key point in the geometric reinterpretation of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar (GW) model proposed in "Geometry of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model" [JHEP 03 (2010) 053]. Specifically, we show that the analysis in Section 6 was applied not to the actual $\Omega$-term in the GW action, but to a closely related term involving a mixed use of ordinary and star-products. Once corrected, the main conclusion -- relating the harmonic potential term to background curvature -- remains valid, though the parameter identification must be revised. This also resolves a discrepancy concerning the emergence of certain vacuum solutions in the self-dual limit of the model.</description>

      <title>Three-point functions from integrability in $\mathcal{N}=2$ orbifold theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides solving the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, integrability also provides us with tools to compute the structure constants of the theory, most prominently through the hexagon formalism. We show that, with minor modifications, this formalism can also be applied to orbifolds of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory, which are integrable theories in their own right. To substantiate this claim, we test our results against a direct gauge-theory calculation at tree-level. We focus here on a family of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric $\mathbb{Z}_M$-orbifold theories. BPS correlators in these theories have recently been investigated with independent localisation techniques and a structural matching with wrapping corrections in the hexagon formalism was observed. Together with our weak-coupling evidence, this suggests that a full determination of the structure constants of orbifold theories at finite coupling may be within reach.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Corrections to the Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes in Near-Extremal Reissener-Nordstr\"{o}m Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to scalar quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background with quantum correction in the near-horizon AdS$_2\times \mathrm{S}^2$ region. By performing a dimensional reduction, we obtain an effective Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity theory, whose quantum fluctuations are captured by the Schwarzian action. Using path integral techniques, we derive the quantum-corrected scalar field equation, which modifies the effective potential governing the QNMs. These corrections are extended from the near-horizon region to the full spacetime via a matching procedure. We compute the corrected QNMs using both the third-order WKB method and the Prony method and find consistent results. Our analysis reveals that quantum corrections can lead to substantial shifts in the real parts of QNM frequencies, particularly for small-mass or near-extremal black holes, while the imaginary parts remain relatively stable. This suggests that quantum gravity effects may leave observable imprints on black hole perturbation spectra, which could be potentially relevant for primordial or microscopic black holes.</description>

      <title>Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries: Noether Realization &amp; Algebraic Structure in Einstein-Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis deals with the phase space realization of asymptotic higher spin symmetries, in 4d asymptotically flat spacetimes. In the gravitational case for instance, these symmetries generalize the BMS algebra to include an infinite tower of symmetry generators constructed from tensors on the sphere of arbitrary high rank $s$.
  Building on a first series of results on their canonical representation, we develop the necessary framework to define Noether charges for all degrees $s$. Importantly, we construct these charges out of a `holomorphic' asymptotic symplectic potential, such that we obtain an infinite collection of charges conserved in the absence of radiation. The classical symmetry is then realized non-perturbatively and non-linearly in the so-called holomorphic coupling constant, generalizing the perturbative linear and quadratic approach known so far. The infinitesimal action defines a symmetry algebroid which reduces to a symmetry algebra at non-radiative cuts of $\mathscr{I}$. The key ingredient for our construction is to consider field and time dependent symmetry parameters constrained to evolve according to equations of motion dual to (a truncation of) the asymptotic equations of motion in vacuum. We expose our results for Yang-Mills, General Relativity, and Einstein-Yang-Mills theories.
  This canonical analysis comes hand in hand with an in-depth study of the algebraic structure underlying the symmetry. We reveal several Lie algebroid and Lie algebra brackets, which connect the Carrollian, celestial and twistorial realizations.
  For the specific case of non-abelian gauge theory, we also investigate how the asymptotic expansion around null infinity of the full Yang-Mills equations of motion in vacuum can be recast in terms of the higher spin charge aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a symmetry argument for the vanishing and non-renormalization of static Love numbers for spherically symmetric black holes at full nonlinear order in four-dimensional General Relativity. The symmetry is realized both in full GR and in the worldline EFT, allowing for a unified treatment and proving both vanishing and non-renormalization to all orders. This closes some loop-holes in previous arguments that neglected nonlinearities in the worldline EFT, and extends previous vanishing results to all nonlinear static tides. When extended to higher-dimensional gravity, these arguments also explain the pattern of vanishing and running static Love numbers of electric and tensor type, and predict new results at the nonlinear order. We also apply our findings to the tidal response of shift-symmetric scalar fields, predicting the vanishing of even order nonlinear static Love numbers and unifying these statements with the no-hair theorem (and its violations).</description>

      <title>Interplay of Generalised Symmetries and Moduli Spaces in 3d $\mathcal{N}=5$ SCFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moduli space and generalised global symmetries of 3d $\mathcal{N} = 5$ superconformal field theories are investigated, with a focus on the orthosymplectic ABJ theories and their discrete gauging variants. We extend the known classification of $\mathcal{N}=5$ moduli spaces as orbifolds $\mathbb{H}^{2N}/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a quaternionic reflection group, to theories incorporating $\mathrm{Spin}$, $\mathrm{O}^-$, and $\mathrm{Pin}$-type gauge groups. In these cases, we find that the moduli space is governed not by $\Gamma$ itself, but by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ central extension thereof, for which we explicitly describe the generators. We provide a systematic method to construct the group $\Gamma'$ governing the moduli space of a theory $\mathcal{T}'$ obtained by gauging a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ zero-form symmetry of an original theory $\mathcal{T}$. This is achieved by identifying the specific generator that must be added to $\Gamma$. We compute the Hilbert series for these moduli spaces and verify them against the corresponding limits of the superconformal index, finding perfect agreement. We also discuss how 't Hooft anomalies for the zero-form symmetries manifest in the superconformal index and the moduli space. Furthermore, we revisit the symmetry category of the $\mathfrak{so}(2N)_{2k} \times \mathfrak{usp}(2N)_{-k}$ theories. Building on previous work that identified the symmetry category for all parities of $N$ and $k$, we provide the explicit symmetry webs for the opposite parity $D_8$ case. We find that the details of these webs differ from the previously studied $D_8$ webs corresponding to the both even parity case. Finally, we analyse theories with unequal ranks, those containing the $\mathfrak{so}(2N+1)$ gauge algebra, and the two SCFT variants based on the $F(4)$ superalgebra.</description>

Abstract: We study rank-2 wobbly bundles on a Riemann surface $C$ of genus $g\geq 2$, i.e. semi-stable bundles admitting nonzero nilpotent Higgs fields, in terms of direct images of line bundles on smooth spectral curves $\tilde{C} \overset{\pi}{\rightarrow} C$. We give a sufficient condition for a semi-stable bundle $E$ to be wobbly: $E$ is a twist of $\pi_\ast \left(\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{C}}(\tilde{D}) \right)$ where the norm of $\tilde{D}$ is a summand of the divisor of a quadratic differential on $C$. We sketch the proof of the necessary condition statement, namely all rank-2 wobbly bundles can be characterised as such, and discuss how certain singularities of the wobbly locus arise from the Brill-Noether loci of spectral curves.</description>

      <title>Harvesting stabilizer entropy and non-locality from a quantum field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11918v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The harvesting of quantum resources from the vacuum state of a quantum field is a central topic in relativistic quantum information. While several proposals for the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum exist, less attention has been paid to other quantum resources, such as non-stabilizerness, commonly dubbed {\em magic} and quantified by the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE). In this work, we show how to harvest SRE from the vacuum state of a massless field using accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in Minkowski spacetime. In particular, one can harvest a particular non-local form of SRE that cannot be erased by local unitary operations. This non-local SRE is a fundamental quantity to study the interplay between entanglement and non-stabilizer resources. We conclude our work with an analysis of the CHSH inequalities: when restricting to stabilizer measurements, i.e. Pauli measurements, one cannot extract a violation from the quantum field.</description>

      <title>A new exact rotating spacetime in vacuum: The Kerr--Levi-Civita Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new rotating solution of Einstein's theory in vacuum by exploiting the Lie point symmetries of the field equations in the complex potential formalism of Ernst. In particular, we perform a discrete symmetry transformation, known as inversion, of the gravitational potential associated with the Kerr metric. The resulting metric describes a rotating generalization of the Schwarzschild--Levi-Civita spacetime, and we refer to it as the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric. We study the key geometric features of this novel spacetime, which turns out to be free of curvature singularities, topological defects, and closed timelike curves. These attractive properties are also common to the extremal black hole and the super-spinning case. The solution is algebraically general (Petrov-type I), and its horizons lie at the horizon radii of the Kerr black hole. The ergoregions, however, are strongly influenced by the Levi-Civita-like asymptotic structure, producing an effect akin to the magnetized Kerr--Newman and swirling solutions. Interestingly, while its static counterpart permits a Kerr--Schild representation, the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric does not admit such a formulation.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. III. Covariant canonical quantum gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.</description>

      <title>Analytic and numerical toolkit for the Anderson model in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature does not readily provide, however, practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>Black holes in the external Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12908v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity coupled with Maxwell electromagnetism, is built by means of a Lie point symmetry of the Ernst equations, the Harrison transformation. The new spacetime describes a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded into a general external back-reacting electromagnetic field, which is the superposition of the Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson and the Bonnor-Melvin ones. The relation between the two homogeneous electromagnetic fields is clarified. Conserved charges and the first law of thermodynamics are analysed. Swirling generalisations are also considered. Limits to the known metrics such as Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson, Schwarzschild-Bonnor-Melvin and Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin are discussed.</description>

      <title>Counting gauge-invariant states with matter fields and finite gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories with finite gauge groups have applications to quantum simulation and quantum gravity. Recently, the exact number of gauge-invariant states was computed for pure gauge theories on arbitrary lattices. In this work, we generalize this counting to include the case of scalar and fermionic matter, as well as various kinds of boundary conditions. As a byproduct, we consider several related questions, such as the implementation of charge conjugation for a generic finite group. These results are relevant for resource estimation and also as a crosscheck when working in a gauge-invariant basis.</description>

      <title>Amplification of new physics in the quasinormal mode spectrum of highly-rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that perturbatively-small higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action can lead to order-one modifications of the quasinormal mode spectrum of near-extremal Kerr black holes. The spectrum of such black holes contains zero-damping modes (ZDMs) and damped modes (DMs), with the latter only existing when the ratio $\mu=m/(l+1/2)$ is below a critical value $\bar{\mu}_{\rm cr}\approx 0.744$. Thus, this value represents a "phase boundary" that separates a region with both ZDMs and DMs and a region with only ZDMs. We find that the modes lying close to the phase boundary are very sensitive to modifications of GR, as their lifetimes receive corrections inversely proportional to their distance to the boundary. We link this growth of the corrections to a modification of the critical point $\bar{\mu}_{\rm cr}$, which can lead to a change in the number of DMs and produce order-one effects in the spectrum. We show that these large effects can take place in a regime in which the higher-derivative expansion remains under control. We also perform an exact analysis of the modification of the phase boundary for lower $(l,m)$ modes and pinpoint those that are most sensitive to corrections. Our results indicate that spectroscopy of highly-rotating black holes is by far the most powerful way to search for new physics in ringdown signals.</description>

      <title>Globalization of perturbative Chern-Simons theory on the moduli space of flat connections in the BV formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the perturbative path integral of Chern-Simons theory (the effective BV action on zero-modes) in Lorenz gauge, expanded around a (possibly non-acyclic) flat connection, as a family over the smooth irreducible stratum $\mathcal{M}' \subset \mathcal{M}$ of the moduli space of flat connections. We prove that it is horizontal with respect to the Grothendieck connection up to a BV-exact term. From it, we construct a volume form on $\mathcal{M'}$ - the "global partition function" - whose cohomology class is independent of the metric, and so is a 3-manifold invariant.
  As an element of the construction, we construct an extension of the perturbative partition function to a nonhomogeneous form on the space of triples $(A,A',g)$ consisting of (1) a "kinetic" flat connection $A$ around which Chern-Simons action is expanded, (2) a "gauge-fixing" flat connection $A'$, (3) a metric $g$. This extension is horizontal with respect to an appropriate Gauss-Manin superconnection (which involves the BV operator as a degree zero component).</description>

      <title>Recurrence Relations and Dispersive Techniques for Precision Multi-Loop Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio predictions of two-loop electroweak contributions to observables are increasingly essential for precision collider experiments, yet their evaluation remains very challenging. We connect recurrence techniques and dispersive method in order to evaluate complex multi-loop Feynman diagrams. By expressing multi-point Passarino-Veltman functions in a two-point basis and using shifted space-time dimensions with recurrence relations, we minimize the number of required dispersive integrals. This approach reduces computation time and enables a precise and efficient analysis of one- and two-loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>Short-time dynamics in phase-ordering kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-time dynamics in the $2D$ Blume-Capel model, with a non-conserved order-parameter and short-ranged interactions, is analysed. For non-equilibrium dynamics, both at a critical point in the $2D$ Ising universality class and at the tricritical point, we reproduce the values $\Theta=0.190({5})$ and $\Theta=-0.542({5})$, respectively, of the critical initial slip exponent. These agree with more early estimates and with the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation. In phase-ordering kinetics, after a quench into the ordered phase, we establish the validity of short-time dynamics. In the $2D$ Ising universality class, we find $\Theta=0.39({1})$ in agreement with the scaling relation $\lambda=d-2\Theta$.</description>

      <title>Integrability of a family of clean SYK models from the critical Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the integrability of a family of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models with uniform $p$-body interactions. We derive the R-matrix and mutually commuting transfer matrices that generate the Hamiltonians of these models, and obtain their exact eigenspectra and eigenstates. Remarkably, the R-matrix is that of the critical transverse-field Ising chain. This work reveals an unexpected connection between the SYK model, central to many-body quantum chaos, and the critical Ising chain, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Coexisting phases in the chiral transition within the Linear sigma model with quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is believed at present that the chiral transition changes from a smooth crossover to a first-order transition at low temperatures and high densities. Such regime is commonly analyzed using effective models since first principle calculations, as in lattice arrangements, are not feasible. This transition is assumed to be discontinuous, with unstable or metastable intermediate states. However, if multiple charges are simultaneously conserved the system could undergo a continuous change through a coexistence of equilibrium states. This type of transition has multiple manifestations, as in the nuclear liquid-gas transition causing the spinodal fragmentation. The coexistence of phases in the chiral transition is studied here for quark matter assuming the conservation of the isospin composition. Using the Linear sigma model with quarks several remarkable effects are found and discussed.</description>
