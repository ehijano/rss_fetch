      <title>GloBIAS: strengthening the foundations of BioImage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a global need for BioImage Analysis (BIA) as advances in life sciences increasingly rely on cutting-edge imaging systems that have dramatically expanded the complexity and dimensionality of biological images. Turning these data into scientific discoveries requires people with effective data management skills and knowledge of state-of-the-art image processing and data analysis, in other words, BioImage Analysts. The Global BioImage Analysts' Society (GloBIAS) aims to enhance the profile of BioImage Analysts as a key role in science and research. Its vision encompasses fostering a global network, democratising access to BIA by providing educational resources tailored to various proficiency levels and disciplines, while also establishing guidelines for BIA courses. By collaboratively shaping the education of BioImage Analysts, GloBIAS aims to unlock the full potential of BIA in advancing life science research and to consolidate BIA as a career path. To better understand the needs and geographical representation of the BIA community, a worldwide survey was conducted and 291 responses were collected across people from all career stages and continents. This work discusses how GloBIAS aims to address community-identified shortcomings in work environment, funding, and scientific activities. The survey underscores a strong interest from the BIA community in activities proposed by GloBIAS and their interest to actively contribute. With 72% of respondents willing to pay for membership, the community's enthusiasm for both online and in-person events is set to drive the growth and sustainability of GloBIAS.</description>

      <title>Magneto-radiative modelling and artificial neural network optimization of biofluid flow in a stenosed arterial domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities, such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids, which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to the changes in the Maxwell parameter.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Response Identities and Bounds for Nonequilibrium Steady States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19602v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is fundamental to statistical physics. For systems far from equilibrium, a general framework for response remains elusive. While progress has been made on the linear response of nonequilibrium systems, a theory for the nonlinear regime under finite perturbations has been lacking. Here, building on a novel connection between response and mean first-passage times in continuous-time Markov chains, we derive a comprehensive theory for the nonlinear response to archetypal local perturbations. We establish an exact identity that universally connects the nonlinear response of any observable to its linear counterpart via a simple scaling factor. This identity directly yields universal bounds on the response magnitude. Furthermore, we establish a universal bound on response resolution -- an inequality constraining an observable's change by its intrinsic fluctuations -- thereby setting a fundamental limit on signal-to-noise ratio. These results provide a rigorous and general framework for analyzing nonlinear response far from equilibrium, which we illustrate with an application to transcriptional regulation.</description>

      <title>Identifying the sources of noise synergy and redundancy in the gene expression of feed-forward loop motif</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The propagation of noise through parallel regulatory pathways is a characteristic feature of feed-forward loops in genetic networks. Although the contributions of the direct and indirect regulatory pathways of feed-forward loops to output variability have been well characterized, the impact of their joint action arising from their shared input and output remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an additional component of noise that emerges specifically from this convergent nature of the pathways. Using inter-gene correlations, we reveal the regulatory basis of the cross-interaction noise and interpret it as synergy or redundancy in noise propagation, depending on whether the combined pathways amplify or suppress fluctuations. Synergy typically arises in coherent feed-forward loops, whereas redundancy is common in incoherent ones. This framework not only accounts for previously observed differences in noise behavior across coherent and incoherent structures but also provides a generalizable strategy to connect network structure with stochastic gene regulation. Furthermore, by relating these synergy and redundancy to dynamical properties such as sign-sensitive delay or response acceleration, the framework offers a statistical lens to interpret the functional roles in cellular decision-making.</description>

      <title>Gliding microtubules exhibit tunable collective rotation driven by chiral active forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How chirality propagates across scales remains an open question in many biological and synthetic systems. An especially clear manifestation of this propagation is found in in vitro gliding assays of cytoskeletal filaments on surfaces, driven by molecular motors. These assays have become model systems of active matter dynamics, as they spontaneously organize into diverse dynamical states, including collective motions with chiral rotation. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying these chiral collective dynamics have remained unclear. Here, we investigate rotating active nematic order in microtubule gliding assay experiments under two stabilization conditions, each on two types of substrates. We propose that chirality in active forces exerted by motors on microtubules represents a viable mechanism for this large-scale chirality. Using Brownian dynamics simulations of self-propelled, semiflexible filaments with chiral activity, we demonstrate that coherently rotating active nematic order emerges by this mechanism even in the absence of curvature, i.e. shape chirality, of the constituent filaments. Moreover, we predict that the angular speed and handedness of the collective rotation can be tuned by modulating filament stiffness. Our findings identify a new set of sufficient microscopic ingredients for predictable propagation of chiral handedness from the molecular to the material scale in living and active matter.</description>
