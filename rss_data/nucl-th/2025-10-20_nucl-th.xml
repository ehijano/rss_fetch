      <title>Ab initio symmetry-adapted approaches to nuclear reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we discuss recent applications of the ab initio symmetry-adapted no-core shell-model (SA-NCSM) theory for study and prediction of structure and reactions of stable and unstable nuclei from light to medium mass range. We explore structure properties of neutron-rich He, Mg, and Li isotopes, with a focus on nuclear collectivity, clustering, and spectroscopic factors, as well as multi-particle excitations of utmost significance in the proximity of the drip lines. In addition, we present extensions of the SA-NCSM with continuum for determining the microscopic structure of reaction fragments, which enables calculations of reaction cross sections for targets from the lightest $^{4,6}$He to $^{40}$Ca, rooted in first principles. We illustrate this for neutron and proton elastic scattering, deuteron and alpha capture reactions, and alpha knock-out reactions. Furthermore, we discuss microscopic optical potentials with uncertainty quantification, a critical ingredient in many reaction models, and reaction observables with uncertainties that stem from the underlying chiral potential. We also discuss the impact of alpha clustering on reactions of significance to nuclear astrophysics, as well as on beta decays and beyond-the-standard-model physics.</description>

      <title>Universal Relation for the Neutron Star Maximum Mass within Relativistic Mean-Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a universal relation for the neutron star maximum mass arising from a particular combination of the saturation density ($n_0$), the effective mass ($m^*$), and (when present) the vector meson self-coupling constant ($\zeta$) within the relativistic mean-field model framework. Observations of massive neutron stars heavier than $\sim 2M_{\odot}$ have eliminated the softest equation of state from consideration and impose strong constraints on nuclear interactions used to model dense nuclear matter. To date there have been numerous attempts to refine relativistic mean-field models by including the presence of additional mesons, such as the delta meson, and couplings. We show that current RMF models, including our own constructions, exhibit a maximum neutron star mass that is primarily determined by the combination of the saturation density, the effective mass at saturation, and the vector meson self-coupling constant. When constraining the pure neutron matter equation of state using chiral effective field theory (ChEFT) at low densities, 250 parameter sets were generated to derive an empirical formula for the maximum mass of neutron stars and apply the formula with the present relativistic mean field models.</description>

      <title>New Elementary Operator for Kaon Photoproduction on the Nucleon and Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new elementary operator for kaon photoproduction on the nucleon and nuclei has been developed within a Feynman diagrammatic framework. By fitting the unknown coupling strengths at the electromagnetic and hadronic vertices of the baryon resonances to all available experimental data across the six isospin channels, the model achieves excellent agreement with the data. The operator includes 26 nucleon resonances in the $K\Lambda$ channels and 17 additional $\Delta$ resonances in the $K\Sigma$ channels. For applications to nuclear reactions, such as hypernuclear photoproduction, the operator is formulated in Pauli space, allowing a straightforward implementation of the nonrelativistic approximation. Several alternative forms for expressing the operator output are proposed. In one of them, the spin operators and photon polarization vectors are separated from the operator, since both are frame dependent, thereby enhancing its versatility in nuclear applications.</description>

      <title>Antikaon condensation in magnetized neutron star matter within the framework of the $\sigma$-cut scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of strong magnetic fields on antikaon condensation in neutron star matter using the extended FSUGold model model. It is found that the presence of strong magnetic fields alters the threshold density of antikaon condensation significantly, which means the threshold density of antikaon condensation is shifted to higher density compared with the magnetic field-free case. In the presence of strong magnetic fields, the equation of state (EoS) becomes stiffer than that of the zero field case. The effects of the $\sigma$-cut scheme on the EoS are also researched when the appearance of antikaon condensation is occurred. Through careful choice of the parameter of the $\sigma$-cut scheme, we are able to produce a maximum mass neutron star heavier than 2$M_{sun}$.</description>

      <title>Faddeev-type calculation of nonelastic breakup in deuteron-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonelastic breakup (NEB), one of channels in $(d,p)$ inclusive reactions, is studied using the Faddeev-type scattering theory. The NEB differential cross section is obtained in terms of the imaginary part of the neutron-nucleus optical potential sandwiched between the Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas three-body transition operators. The momentum-space calculations including the Coulomb force are extended to higher charge numbers. Well converged numerical results are obtained for the energy distribution of the NEB cross section, being roughly consistent with previous works. The spin-dependent interaction terms do not play a significant role. The optical potential nonlocality effect shows up at higher proton energies, but is comparable to local potential uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Reexamining the perturbative renormalizability of the coupled triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I reexamine the perturbative renormalizability of chiral two-pion exchange in two-nucleon scattering for coupled triplets when one-pion exchange has been fully iterated at leading order. Improving over previous works, it is shown that only two counterterms are required to obtain cutoff independent results, which is one less than in naive dimensional analysis. The explanation for this reduction is the existence of an attractive and repulsive eigenchannel in the one-pion exchange potential for the coupled triplets: the attractive eigenchannel can be renormalized like a regular attractive uncoupled triplet, while the repulsive eigenchannel is always finite regardless of whether there are counterterms or not. I discuss the implications of this finding for the power counting of the $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$ and $^3P_2$-$^3F_2$ partial waves.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations of Light Nuclei with Fully Propagated Theoretical Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first quantum Monte Carlo calculations of helium isotopes with fully propagated theoretical uncertainties from the interaction to the many-body observables. To achieve this, we build emulators for solutions to the Faddeev equations for the binding energy and Gamow-Teller matrix element of $^3\text{H}$, as well as for auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the $^4\text{He}$ charge radius, employing local two- and three-body interactions up to next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory. We use these emulators to determine the posterior distributions for all low-energy couplings that appear in the interaction up to this order using Bayesian inference while accounting for theoretical uncertainties. We then build emulators for auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo for helium isotopes and propagate the full posterior distributions to these systems. Our approach serves as a framework for $\textit{ab initio}$ studies of atomic nuclei with consistently treated and correlated theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic hydrodynamization and quasinormal modes of nonthermal attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonthermal attractors characterize the emergent self-similar evolution of far-from-equilibrium quantum systems, from nuclear collisions to cold-atom experiments. Within the adiabatic hydrodynamization framework, the approach to the nonthermal attractor can be understood as the decay of excited states of an effective Hamiltonian. We use an exactly solvable case of the Boltzmann equation -- the longitudinally expanding overoccupied gluon plasma dominated by small-angle elastic collisions -- to map the eigenmodes in adiabatic hydrodynamization to the quasinormal mode spectrum of the nonthermal attractor. If generalized, this equivalence may be used as a discovery tool for new phenomena in out-of-equilibrium systems. A byproduct of our analysis is the analytic prescaling solutions for systems undergoing strong longitudinal expansion.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations for Elastic Hybrid Stars and Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some compact stars may contain deconfined quark matter, forming hybrid stars or quark stars. If the quark matter forms an inhomogeneous condensate in the crystalline color superconducting phase, its rigidity may be high enough to noticeably alter the stellar properties. In this paper, we investigate whether these elastic stars follow the universal relations, i.e., relations insensitive to equations of state, that have been well established for fluid stars. We improve upon previous studies by allowing quark matter in the background, static, and spherically symmetric configuration to be sheared. Such background shear can be treated in the form of an effective pressure anisotropy. We then calculate the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability ${\lambda}_2$, and spin-induced quadrupole moment $Q$ of these models with pressure anisotropy. The $I$-${\lambda}_2$-$Q$ universal relations for the elastic hybrid (quark) star models are valid up to a variation of $\approx2\,(3)\%$, larger than that for typical fluid star models, when the maximal magnitude of quark matter shear modulus is considered in the crystalline color superconducting phase from realistic calculations. The uncertainty in universal relations related to the stellar compactness for these elastic star models, on the other hand, remain comparable to those for typical fluid star models. Our results demonstrate the validity of universal relations for hybrid stars and quark stars with a realistic degree of pressure anisotropy due to the crystalline color superconducting quark matter.</description>

      <title>Probing Composite Structure and Spin-Orbit Coupling with GPDs in ${}^{4}$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a relation between the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of a spin-0 composite hadron and the GPDs of its spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ constituents. The method decomposes matrix elements of the composite parent into matrix elements of its constituents, weighted by the Wigner distributions of the constituents inside the composite parent. Exploiting the boost invariance of the light-front Wigner distributions, we derive the dictionary between rest-frame and boosted-frame kinematics and use it to perform a Pauli matrix decomposition of the spin degree of freedom. The constraints of unbroken rotational, parity, and time-reversal invariance lead to a master integral for the quark GPDs of the spin-0 composite target. We also identify a novel $\Delta\vec{L}\cdot\vec{S}$ form of spin-orbit coupling responsible for GPD mixing in composite hadrons which is absent in the case of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of composite hadrons. We then apply the framework to a composite ${}^{4}$He target with simple phenomenological models to identify possible experimental signatures of composite-structure effects in light nuclei. The framework we have constructed here can be readily extended to the case of generalized TMDs (GTMDs), while the phenomenological framework is applicable both to analyses of light nucleus data and as training input for AI-assisted applications.</description>

      <title>Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity deficit reduction via finite nuclear size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the extraction of the $|V_{ud}|$ CKM matrix element from the superallowed transition decay rate of $^{26m}$Al$\rightarrow$$^{26}$Mg, focusing on finite nuclear size effects. The decay rate dependence on the $^{26m}$Al charge radius is found to be four times higher than previously believed, necessitating precise determination. However, for a short-lived isotope of an odd $Z$ element such as $^{26m}$Al, radius extraction relies on challenging many-body atomic calculations. We performed the needed calculations, finding an excellent agreement with previous ones, which used a different methodology. This sets a new standard for the reliability of isotope shift factor calculations in many-electron systems. The $\mathcal{F}t$ value obtained from our analysis is lower by $2.2\,\sigma$ than the corresponding value in the previous critical survey, resulting in an increase in $|V_{ud}|^2$ by $0.9\,\sigma$. Adopting $|V_{ud}|$ from this decay alone reduces the CKM unitarity deficit by one standard deviation, irrespective of the choice of $|V_{us}|$.</description>

      <title>Description of nucleon transfer reactions at intermediate energies within the impulse picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background:
  At intermediate energies, transfer reactions are suppressed because the momentum-matching condition is difficult to satisfy. In the standard distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA), a high momentum component of the transferred particle is required to match the large momentum transfer.
  Purpose:
  We investigate the applicability of the distorted wave impulse approximation (DWIA) for describing ($p,d$) transfer reactions at intermediate energies by performing a comparative study with the standard DWBA. DWIA, which has been successful for knockout reactions, is expected to provide an alternative reaction mechanism at this energy region.
  Methods:
  Both DWBA and DWIA formalisms are applied to the $^{16}$O($p,d$){}$^{15}$O reaction at 200~MeV. In DWBA, the reaction is described as a neutron pickup, while in DWIA, it is treated as a quasi-elastic scattering from a preformed deuteron cluster in the target.
  Results:
  The DWBA calculation is in good agreement with the experimental data, reproducing both the angular distribution and the absolute magnitude of the cross section with a reasonable spectroscopic factor. In contrast, the DWIA calculation, while qualitatively reproducing the trend of the angular distribution, severely underestimates the cross section by about two orders of magnitude.
  Conclusions:
  Our findings suggest that conventional DWBA provides a more suitable description for the $^{16}$O($p,d$){}$^{15}$O reaction at 200~MeV. The failure of DWIA in this case, unlike its success in knockout reactions, raises open questions about its applicability to transfer reactions. This motivates the need for systematic investigations to delineate the applicability of both reaction mechanisms under various conditions.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy can tell whether $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$ are resonances or virtual states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been extended and heated discussions on the nature of the two exotic states, $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$, particularly whether they are near-threshold resonances, virtual states, or bound states. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the femtoscopic technique can be employed to distinguish between these three scenarios. More concretely, based on the Koonin-Pratt formula with a Gaussian source, we show that the low-momentum $D^0D^{*-}$/$D^0D_s^{*-}$ correlation functions significantly differ in the three scenarios. The high-momentum results exhibit distinct characteristics in the resonant and virtual state scenarios, especially in small collision systems of 1 fm, as produced in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. We hope that these discoveries will stimulate further experimental studies and help clarify the nature of the many exotic states that have been discovered.</description>

      <title>Unwinding the rare $\Omega$ sector: Fragmentation of fully charmed baryons from HL-LHC to FCC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By adopting a hadron-structure-oriented approach, we present and discuss the release of the novel OMG3Q1.0 set of collinear fragmentation functions for fully charmed, rare $\Omega$ baryons. Our methodology combines diquark-like proxy model inputs for both charm-quark and gluon channels, calculated at the initial energy scales, with a DGLAP evolution that ensures a consistent treatment of heavy-quark thresholds, following directly from the HF-NRevo scheme. We complement our work with a phenomenological study of NLL/NLO$^+$ resummed $\Omega_{3c}$ plus jet distributions using (sym)JETHAD at the HL-LHC and the future FCC. Unraveling the production mechanisms of rare, yet-unobserved hadrons, as provided by the OMG3Q1.0 functions, stands as a key asset for deepening our understanding of QCD at future high-energy hadron colliders.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) continues to evade direct detection, but neutron stars (NSs) serve as natural laboratories where even a modest DM component can alter their structure. While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely on specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and lack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear EOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and GW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\sim10\%$ remain consistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to reduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible pressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically significant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating that DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties. However, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our empirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core configurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span $\Delta R_\chi \equiv R_{\chi,\mathrm{max}} - R_{\chi,\mathrm{min}}$ as a unified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously characterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear correlations ($\Delta R_\chi &lt; 4\,\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters, providing a clear avenue for future constraints. Our approach bridges current limitations and future potential in probing DM through compact star observations.</description>
