      <title>Invariant submodules of modular operators and Lomonosov type theorem for Hilbert C*-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of invariant submodule in the theory of Hilbert C*-modules and study some basic properties of bounded adjointable operators and their generalized inverses which have nontrivial invariant submodules. We demonstrate the representation of the solution set of an operator equation on Hilbert C*-modules by taking advantage of invariant submodules. In particular, we consider the special cases of finite dimensional C*-algebras and C*-algebras of compact operators as the underling C*-algebra to simplify our results, and obtain a Lomonosov type theorem for compact operators on some Hilbert C*-modules.</description>

      <title>On the genericity of irreducible subfactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that finitely generated irreducible $\mathrm{II}_1$ subfactors are generic in the following sense. Given a separable $\mathrm{II}_1$ factor $M$ and an integer $n\geq 2$, equip the set of $n$-tuples of self-adjoint operators in $M$ with norm at most $1$ with the metric $d(x,y) = \max_{1\leq i \leq n} \|x_i - y_i\|_2$. Then the set of $n$-tuples that generate an irreducible subfactor of $M$ forms a dense $G_\delta$ set in this metric space. On the way to proving this result, we show that closable derivations vanish on the anticoarse space associated to their kernels, which leads to new applications of conjugate systems in free probability.</description>

      <title>The Free Functional Calculus in General</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical theory of free analysis generalizes the noncommutative (nc) polynomials and rational functions, easily providing such results as an nc analogue of the Jacobian conjecture. However, the classical theory misses out on important functions, such as the Schur complement. This paper presents a generalization of free functions, viewing them as a natural categorial structure: functors between functor categories that commute with natural transformation. We study this construction on general additive categories; we define, characterize and categorize certain sorts of free maps, such as polynomials and rational expressions, and then prove an analogue of the inverse function theorem, demonstrating a natural lifting of a proof into this broader context.
  We then provide some algebraic basis for this theory, constructing vector spaces, an additive category of free polynomials, and defining a class of products that allows us to form true ring structures on any vector space of free nc polynomials.</description>

      <title>Bounded geometry version of property A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For uniformly dicrete metric spaces without bounded geometry we suggest a modified version of property A based on metrics of bounded geometry greater than the given metric. We show that this version still implies coarse embeddability in Hilbert spaces, and that some examples of non-property A spaces of unbounded geometry satisfy this version. We also relate this version of property A to our version of uniform Roe algebras for spaces without bounded geometry and introduce an appropriate equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>Moduli space of Conformal Field Theories and non-commutative Riemannian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the analogy between collapsing Conformal Field Theories and measured Gromov-Hausdorff limit of Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. Motivated by this analogy we propose the notion of non-commutative (``quantum") Riemannian d-geometry. We explain how this structure is related to Connes's spectral triples in the case d=1. In the Appendix based on the unpublished joint work with Maxim Kontsevich we discuss deformation theory of Quantum Field Theories as well as an approach to QFTs in the case when the space-time is an arbitrary compact metric space.</description>

      <title>Rational and non-rational two-dimensional conformal field theories arising from lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a (finite-dimensional) real Hilbert space $\mathfrak h$ and an orthogonal projection $p$, we consider the associated Heisenberg Lie algebra and the two-dimensional Heisenberg conformal net. Given an even lattice $Q$ in $\mathfrak h$ with respect to the indefinite bilinear form on $\mathfrak h$ defined by $p$, we construct a two-dimensional conformal net ${\mathcal A}_Q$ extending the Heisenberg conformal net. Moreover, with a certain discreteness assumption on the spectrum of the extension, we show that any two-dimensional extension of the Heisenberg conformal net is of the form ${\mathcal A}_Q$ up to unitary equivalence.
  We consider explicit examples of even lattices where $\mathfrak h$ is two-dimensional and $p$ is one-dimensional, and we show that the extended net may have completely rational or non-completely rational chiral (i.e. one-dimensional lightray) components, depending on the choice of lattice. In the non-rational case, we exhibit the braided equivalence of a certain subcategory of the representation category of the chiral Heisenberg net corresponding to the two-dimensional lattice extension.
  Inspired by the charge and braiding structures of these nets, we construct two-dimensional conformal Wightman fields on the same Hilbert spaces. We show that, in some cases, these Wightman fields generate the corresponding extended nets.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for von Neumann algebras of graph product groups. I. Structure of automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study various rigidity aspects of the von Neumann algebra $L(\Gamma)$ where $\Gamma$ is a graph product group \cite{Gr90} whose underlying graph is a certain cycle of cliques and the vertex groups are the wreath-like product property (T) groups introduced recently in \cite{CIOS21}. Using an approach that combines methods from Popa's deformation/rigidity theory with new techniques pertaining to graph product algebras, we describe all symmetries of these von Neumann algebras and reduced C$^*$-algebras by establishing formulas in the spirit of Genevois and Martin's results on automorphisms of graph product groups \cite{GM19}.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for von Neumann algebras of graph product groups II. Superrigidity results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{CDD22} we investigated the structure of $\ast$-isomorphisms between von Neumann algebras $L(\Gamma)$ associated with graph product groups $\Gamma$ of flower-shaped graphs and property (T) wreath-like product vertex groups as in \cite{CIOS21}. In this follow-up we continue the structural study of these algebras by establishing that these graph product groups $\Gamma$ are entirely recognizable from the category of all von Neumann algebras arising from an arbitrary non-trivial graph product group with infinite vertex groups. A sharper $C^*$-algebraic version of this statement is also obtained. In the process of proving these results we also extend the main $W^*$-superrigidity result from \cite{CIOS21} to direct products of property (T) wreath-like product groups.</description>

      <title>Inverse semigroups of separated graphs and associated algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an inverse semigroup $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$ associated to a separated graph $(E,C)$ and describe its internal structure. In particular we show that it is strongly $E^*$-unitary and can be realized as a partial semidirect product of the form $\mathcal{Y}\rtimes\mathbb{F}$ for a certain partial action of the free group $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}(E^1)$ on the edges of $E$ on a semilattice $\mathcal{Y}$ realizing the idempotents of $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$. In addition we also describe the spectrum as well as the tight spectrum of $\mathcal{Y}$.
  We then use the inverse semigroup $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$ to describe several "tame" algebras associated to $(E,C)$, including its Cohn algebra, its Leavitt-path algebra, and analogues in the realm of $C^*$-algebras, like the tame $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{O}(E,C)$ and its Toeplitz extension $\mathcal{T}(E,C)$, proving that these algebras are canonically isomorphic to certain algebras attached to $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$. Our structural results on $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$ imply that these algebras can be realized as partial crossed products, revealing a great portion of their structure.</description>

      <title>Traces on the uniform tracial completion of $\mathcal{Z}$-stable C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniform tracial completion of a C*-algebra A with compact non-empty trace space T(A) is obtained by completing the unit ball with respect to the uniform 2-seminorm $\|a\|_{2,T(A)}=\sup_{\tau \in T(A)} \tau(a^*a)^{1/2}$. The trace problem asks whether every trace on the uniform tracial completion is the $\|\cdot\|_{2,T(A)}$-continuous extension of a trace on A. We answer this question positively in the case of C*-algebras that tensorially absorb the Jiang-Su algebra, such as those studied in the Elliott classification programme.</description>

      <title>Spectral Sequence Computation of Higher Twisted $K$-Groups of $ SU(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Freed-Hopkins-Teleman theorem we study graded equivariant higher twists of $K$-theory for the groups $G = SU(n)$ induced by exponential functors. We compute the rationalisation of these groups for all $n$ and all non-trivial functors. Classical twists use the determinant functor and yield equivariant bundles of compact operators that are classified by Dixmier-Douady theory. Their equivariant $K$-theory reproduces the Verlinde ring of conformal field theory. Higher twists give equivariant bundles of stable UHF algebras, which can be classified using stable homotopy theory. Rationally, only the $K$-theory in degree $\dim(G)$ is again non-trivial. The non-vanishing group is a quotient of a localisation of the representation ring $R(G) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ by a higher fusion ideal $J_{F,\mathbb{Q}}$. We give generators for this ideal and prove that these can be obtained as derivatives of a potential. For the exterior algebra functor, which is exponential, we show that the determinant bundle over $LSU(n)$ has a non-commutative counterpart where the fibre is the unitary group of the UHF algebra.</description>
