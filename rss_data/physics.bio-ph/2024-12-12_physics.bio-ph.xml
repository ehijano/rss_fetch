      <title>Deterministic Path Search Algorithm on Free-Energy Landscape using Random Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a multidimensional free-energy or potential-energy landscape, finding reaction paths that connect an initial (or reactant) state and a final (or product) state is important for biophysics and materials science. The likelihood of a path can be evaluated using an objective function, and the most likely reaction path can be found by optimizing its objective function. However, nonlinear optimization on a complex free-energy or potential-energy landscape may lead to suboptimal solutions. In this study, this drawback is avoided using deterministic path-finding methods such as Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph by assigning grids on the coordinate system to graph nodes and relating the objective function of the path to the edge cost between the nodes. Furthermore, the use of random grids is proposed because they more accurately represent paths than regular grids. As a demonstration, the proposed method is successfully applied to find the minimum resistance path on a three-hole potential model, demonstrating that the proposed method is promising.</description>

      <title>Dynamic landscapes and statistical limits on growth during cell fate specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of gene regulatory networks in multicellular organisms makes interpretable low-dimensional models highly desirable. An attractive geometric picture, attributed to Waddington, visualizes the differentiation of a cell into diverse functional types as gradient flow on a dynamic potential landscape. However, it is unclear under what biological constraints this metaphor is mathematically precise. Here, we show that growth-maximizing regulatory strategies that guide a single cell to a target distribution of cell types are described by time-dependent potential landscapes under certain generic growth-control tradeoffs. Our analysis leads to a sharp bound on the time it takes for a population to grow to a target distribution of a certain size. We show how the framework can be used to compute regulatory strategies and growth curves in an illustrative model of growth and differentiation. The theory suggests a conceptual link between nonequilibrium thermodynamics and cellular decision-making during development.</description>

      <title>Cauliflower shapes of bacterial clusters in the off-lattice Eden model for bacterial growth in a Petri dish with an agar layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed the off-lattice Eden model to simulate the growth of bacterial colonies in the three-dimensional geometry of a Petri dish. In contrast to its two-dimensional counterpart, our model takes a three-dimensional set of possible growth directions and employs additional constraints on growth, which are limited by access to the nutrient layer. We rigorously tested the basic off-lattice Eden implementation against literature data for a planar cluster. We then extended it to three-dimensional growth. Our model successfully demonstrated the non-trivial dependency of the cluster morphology, non-monotonous dependency of the cluster density, and power law of the thickness of the boundary layer of clusters as a function of the nutrient layer height. Moreover, we revealed the fractal nature of all the clusters by investigating their fractal dimensions. Our density results allowed us to estimate the basic transport properties, namely the permeability and tortuosity of the bacterial colonies.</description>

      <title>Information theory, Signal Analysis and Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book is intended for teaching Signal Analysis methods and Inverse Problems theory. It is completely open access and will remain free. It is currently illustrated with examples that we have actually encountered in geophysics, but will eventually evolve to address problems in biology. The main idea is to develop this material over time (probably every six months) and throughout our careers. Therefore, it is not yet complete and some minor points need to be corrected in this English version. It is also available in French ( https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yx9le4tbwjg0ur7llp0fj/TheorieInfoTTS_vf.pdf?rlkey=uvc1ku8v4ihhogkcy0w2iixdf&amp;st=gcddwegm&amp;dl=0 ) and Portuguese ( https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mx46mgn66ob3r1z9r0igq/TheorieInfoTTS_vp.pdf?rlkey=c8m9e8dmbwf1npu4bwfqkhblr&amp;st=xveovcvs&amp;dl=0 ). The MATLAB codes we used can be found at the following address: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6tedk1xyquswmh0vcekfi/matlab_book.zip?rlkey=cbj5ura63qy6u57ij2yzgggkw&amp;st=8gp4gddd&amp;dl=0</description>

      <title>Correlation-weighted 23Na magnetic resonance fingerprinting in the brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed a new sodium magnetic resonance fingerprinting ($^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF) method for the simultaneous mapping of $\text{T}_\text{1}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,long}^{*}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,short}^{*}$ and sodium density with built-in $\Delta\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ (radiofrequency transmission inhomogeneities) and $\Delta\text{f}_\text{0}$ corrections (frequency offsets). We based our $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF implementation on a 3D FLORET sequence with 23 radiofrequency pulses. To capture the complex spin ${\frac{\text{3}}{\text{2}}}$ dynamics of the $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ nucleus, the fingerprint dictionary was simulated using the irreducible spherical tensor operators formalism. The dictionary contained 831,512 entries covering a wide range of $\text{T}_\text{1}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,long}^{*}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,short}^{*}$, $\Delta\text{B}_\text{1}^{+}$ factor and $\Delta\text{f}_\text{0}$ parameters. Fingerprint matching was performed using the Pearson correlation and the resulting relaxation maps were weighted with a subset of the highest correlation coefficients corresponding to signal matches for each voxel. Our $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF method was compared against reference methods in a 7-compartment phantom, and applied in brain in five healthy volunteers at 7 T. In phantoms, $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF produced values comparable to those obtained with reference methods. Average sodium relaxation time values in cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter and white matter across five healthy volunteers were in good agreement with values previously reported in the literature.</description>
