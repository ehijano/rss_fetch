      <title>GATES: Graph Attention Network with Global Expression Fusion for Deciphering Spatial Transcriptome Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell spatial transcriptomics (ST) offers a unique approach to measuring gene expression profiles and spatial cell locations simultaneously. However, most existing ST methods assume that cells in closer spatial proximity exhibit more similar gene expression patterns. Such assumption typically results in graph structures that prioritize local spatial information while overlooking global patterns, limiting the ability to fully capture the broader structural features of biological tissues. To overcome this limitation, we propose GATES (Graph Attention neTwork with global Expression fuSion), a novel model designed to capture structural details in spatial transcriptomics data. GATES first constructs an expression graph that integrates local and global information by leveraging both spatial proximity and gene expression similarity. The model then employs an autoencoder with adaptive attention to assign proper weights for neighboring nodes, enhancing its capability of feature extraction. By fusing features of both the spatial and expression graphs, GATES effectively balances spatial context with gene expression data. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that GATES significantly outperforms existing methods in identifying spatial domains, highlighting its potential for analyzing complex biological tissues.

      <title>Disentangling Genotype and Environment Specific Latent Features for Improved Trait Prediction using a Compositional Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a compositional autoencoder (CAE) framework designed to disentangle the complex interplay between genotypic and environmental factors in high-dimensional phenotype data to improve trait prediction in plant breeding and genetics programs. Traditional predictive methods, which use compact representations of high-dimensional data through handcrafted features or latent features like PCA or more recently autoencoders, do not separate genotype-specific and environment-specific factors. We hypothesize that disentangling these features into genotype-specific and environment-specific components can enhance predictive models. To test this, we developed a compositional autoencoder (CAE) that decomposes high-dimensional data into distinct genotype-specific and environment-specific latent features.
  Our CAE framework employs a hierarchical architecture within an autoencoder to effectively separate these entangled latent features. Applied to a maize diversity panel dataset, the CAE demonstrates superior modeling of environmental influences and 5-10 times improved predictive performance for key traits like Days to Pollen and Yield, compared to the traditional methods, including standard autoencoders, PCA with regression, and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). By disentangling latent features, the CAE provides powerful tool for precision breeding and genetic research. This work significantly enhances trait prediction models, advancing agricultural and biological sciences.</description>

      <title>Nanopore DNA Sequencing Technology: A Sociological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing, a next-generation sequencing technology, holds the potential to revolutionize multiple facets of life sciences, forensics, and healthcare. While previous research has focused on its technical intricacies and biomedical applications, this paper offers a unique perspective by scrutinizing the societal dimensions (ethical, legal, and social implications) of nanopore sequencing. Employing the lenses of Diffusion and Action Network Theory, we examine the dissemination of nanopore sequencing in society as a potential consumer product, contributing to the field of the sociology of technology. We investigate the possibility of interactions between human and nonhuman actors in developing nanopore technology to analyse how various stakeholders, such as companies, regulators, and researchers, shape the trajectory of the growth of nanopore sequencing. This work offers insights into the social construction of nanopore sequencing, shedding light on the actors, power dynamics, and socio-technical networks that shape its adoption and societal impact. Understanding the sociological dimensions of this transformative technology is vital for responsible development, equitable distribution, and inclusive integration into diverse societal contexts.</description>

      <title>Popping Bubbles in Pangenome Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce flubbles, a new definition of "bubbles" corresponding to variants in a (pan)genome graph $G$. We then show a characterization for flubbles in terms of equivalence classes regarding cycles in an intermediate data structure we built from the spanning tree of the $G$, which leads us to a linear time and space solution for finding all flubbles. Furthermore, we show how a related characterization also allows us to efficiently detect what we define as hairpin inversions: a cycle preceded and followed by the same path in the graph; being the latter necessarily traversed both ways, this structure corresponds to inversions. Finally, Inspired by the concept of Program Structure Tree introduced fifty years ago to represent the hierarchy of the control structure of a program, we define a tree representing the structure of G in terms of flubbles, the flubble tree, which we also find in linear time. The hierarchy of variants introduced by the flubble tree paves the way for new investigations of (pan)genomic structures and their decomposition for practical analyses. We have implemented our methods into a prototype tool named povu which we tested on human and yeast data. We show that povu can find flubbles and also output the flubble tree while being as fast (or faster than) well established tools that find bubbles, such as vg and BubbleGun. Moreover, we show how, within the same time, povu can find hairpin inversions that, to the best of our knowledge, no other tool is able to find.

      <title>Heterogeneity analysis provides evidence for a genetically homogeneous subtype of bipolar-disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00159</link>

Abstract: Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a complex disease. It is heterogeneous, both at the phenotypic and genetic level, although the extent and impact of this heterogeneity is not fully understood. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in heterogeneity analysis to look for genetically-driven subgroups (i.e., biclusters) within the broad phenotype of Bipolar Disorder. We first apply this covariate-corrected biclustering algorithm to a cohort of 2524 BD cases and 4106 controls from the Bipolar Disease Research Network (BDRN) within the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). We find evidence of genetic heterogeneity delineating a statistically significant bicluster comprising a subset of BD cases which exhibits a disease-specific pattern of differential-expression across a subset of SNPs. This disease-specific genetic pattern (i.e., 'genetic subgroup') replicates across the remaining data-sets collected by the PGC containing 5781/8289, 3581/7591, and 6825/9752 cases/controls, respectively. This genetic subgroup (discovered without using any BD subtype information) was more prevalent in Bipolar type-I than in Bipolar type-II. Our methodology has successfully identified a replicable homogeneous genetic subgroup of bipolar disorder. This subgroup may represent a collection of correlated genetic risk-factors for BDI. By investigating the subgroup's bicluster-informed polygenic-risk-scoring (PRS), we find that the disease-specific pattern highlighted by the bicluster can be leveraged to eliminate noise from our GWAS analyses and improve risk prediction. This improvement is particularly notable when using only a relatively small subset of the available SNPs, implying improved SNP replication. Though our primary focus is only the analysis of disease-related signal, we also identify replicable control-related heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>DNAHLM -- DNA sequence and Human Language mixed large language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are already many DNA large language models, but most of them still follow traditional uses, such as extracting sequence features for classification tasks. More innovative applications of large language models, such as prompt engineering, RAG, and zero-shot or few-shot prediction, remain challenging for DNA-based models. The key issue lies in the fact that DNA models and human natural language models are entirely separate; however, techniques like prompt engineering require the use of natural language, thereby significantly limiting the application of DNA large language models. This paper introduces a pre-trained model trained on the GPT-2 network, combining DNA sequences and English text, and uses a unified BPE tokenization method. We then convert classification and other downstream tasks into Alpaca format instruction data, and perform instruction fine-tuning on this pre-trained model to create a fine-tuned model capable of handling multiple tasks. The model has demonstrated its effectiveness in DNA related zero-shot prediction and multitask application. This research provides a highly promising direction for building a unified DNA sequence task framework.</description>
