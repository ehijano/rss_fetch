      <title>A Hybrid Intelligent System for Protection of Transmission Lines Connected to PV Farms based on Linear Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional relays face challenges for transmission lines connected to inverter-based resources (IBRs). In this article, a single-ended intelligent protection of the transmission line in the zone between the grid and the PV farm is suggested. The method employs a fuzzy logic and random forest (RF)-based hybrid system to detect faults based on combined linear trend attributes of the 3-phase currents. The fault location is determined and the faulty phase is detected. RF feature selection is used to obtain the optimal linear trend feature. The performance of the methodology is examined for abnormal events such as faults, capacitor and load-switching operations simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC on IEEE 9-bus system obtained by varying various fault and switching parameters. Additionally, when validating the suggested strategy, consideration is given to the effects of conditions such as the presence of double circuit lines, PV capacity, sampling rate, data window length, noise, high impedance faults, CT saturation, compensation devices, evolving and cross-country faults, and far-end and near-end faults. The findings indicate that the suggested strategy can be used to deal with a variety of system configurations and situations while still safeguarding such complex power transmission networks.</description>

      <title>An Efficient yet High-Performance Method for Precise Radar-Based Imaging of Human Hand Poses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contactless hand pose estimation requires sensors that provide precise spatial information and low computational complexity for real-time processing. Unlike vision-based systems, radar offers lighting independence and direct motion assessments. Yet, there is limited research balancing real-time constraints, suitable frame rates for motion evaluations, and the need for precise 3D data. To address this, we extend the ultra-efficient two-tone hand imaging method from our prior work to a three-tone approach. Maintaining high frame rates and real-time constraints, this approach significantly enhances reconstruction accuracy and precision. We assess these measures by evaluating reconstruction results for different hand poses obtained by an imaging radar. Accuracy is assessed against ground truth from a spatially calibrated photogrammetry setup, while precision is measured using 3D-printed hand poses. The results emphasize the method's great potential for future radar-based hand sensing.</description>

      <title>Automatic Voice Classification Of Autistic Subjects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) describe a heterogeneous set of conditions classified as neurodevelopmental disorders. Although the mechanisms underlying ASD are not yet fully understood, more recent literature focused on multiple genetics and/or environmental risk factors. Heterogeneity of symptoms, especially in milder forms of this condition, could be a challenge for the clinician. In this work, an automatic speech classification algorithm is proposed to characterize the prosodic elements that best distinguish autism, to support the traditional diagnosis. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluted by testing the classification algorithms on a dataset composed of recorded speeches, collected among both autustic and non autistic subjects.</description>

      <title>Using Geometrical information to Measure the Vibration of A Swaying Millimeter-wave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two new, simple yet effective approaches to measure the vibration of a swaying millimeter-wave radar (mmRadar) utilizing geometrical information. Specifically, for the planar vibrations, we firstly establish an equation based on the area difference between the swaying mmRadar and the reference objects at different moments, which enables the quantification of planar displacement. Secondly, volume differences are also utilized with the same idea, achieving the self-vibration measurement of a swaying mmRadar for spatial vibrations. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our methods, demonstrating its capability to estimate both the amplitude and a crude direction of the mmRadar's self-vibration.</description>

      <title>Groupwise Deformable Registration of Diffusion Tensor Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance: Disentangling Diffusion Contrast, Respiratory and Cardiac Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion tensor based cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) offers a non-invasive method to visualize the myocardial microstructure. With the assumption that the heart is stationary, frames are acquired with multiple repetitions for different diffusion encoding directions. However, motion from poor breath-holding and imprecise cardiac triggering complicates DT-CMR analysis, further challenged by its inherently low SNR, varied contrasts, and diffusion-induced textures. Our solution is a novel framework employing groupwise registration with an implicit template to isolate respiratory and cardiac motions, while a tensor-embedded branch preserves diffusion contrast textures. We've devised a loss refinement tailored for non-linear least squares fitting and low SNR conditions. Additionally, we introduce new physics-based and clinical metrics for performance evaluation.

      <title>Efficient Transmission Scheme for LEO Satellite-Based NB-IoT: A Data-Driven Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyses the medium access control (MAC) layer aspects of a low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite-based Internet of Things (IoT) network. A transmission scheme based on change detection is proposed to accommodate more users within the network and improve energy efficiency. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are also proposed to reduce the payload size by leveraging the correlation among the sensed parameters. Real-world data from an IoT testbed deployed for a smart city application is utilised to analyse the performance regarding collision probability, effective data received and average battery lifetime. The findings reveal that the traffic pattern, post-implementation of the proposed scheme, differs from the commonly assumed Poisson traffic, thus proving the effectiveness of having IoT data from actual deployment. It is demonstrated that the transmission scheme facilitates accommodating more devices while targeting a specific collision probability. Considering the link budget for a direct access NB-IoT scenario, more data is effectively offloaded to the server within the limited visibility of LEO satellites. The average battery lifetimes are also demonstrated to increase by many folds by using the proposed access schemes and ML algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Design and Implementation of Fast-Convolution-Based Variable-Bandwidth Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient design approach for a fast-convolution-based variable-bandwidth (VBW) filter. The proposed approach is based on a hybrid of frequency sampling and optimization (HFSO), that offers significant computational complexity reduction compared to existing solutions for a given performance. The paper provides a design procedure based on minimax optimization to obtain the minimum complexity of the overall filter. A design example includes a comparison of the proposed design-based VBW filter and time-domain designed VBW filters implemented in the time domain and in the frequency domain. It is shown that not only the implementation complexity can be reduced but also the design complexity by excluding any computations when the bandwidth of the filter is adjusted. Moreover, memory requirements are also decreased compared to the existing frequency-domain implementations.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Switching Point and Power Control in Dynamic TDD Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) network operating in dynamic time division duplex (DTDD). The switching point between the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) data transmission phases can be adapted dynamically to the instantaneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in order to improve energy efficiency (EE). To this end, we formulate a problem of optimizing the DTDD switching point jointly with the UL and DL power control coefficients, and the large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) weights for EE maximization. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the formulated challenging problem using successive convex approximation with an approximate stationary solution. Simulation results show that optimizing switching points remarkably improves EE compared with baseline schemes that adjust switching points heuristically.</description>

      <title>Single Channel-based Motor Imagery Classification using Fisher's Ratio and Pearson Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor imagery-based BCI systems have been promising and gaining popularity in rehabilitation and Activities of daily life(ADL). Despite this, the technology is still emerging and has not yet been outside the laboratory constraints. Channel reduction is one contributing avenue to make these systems part of ADL. Although Motor Imagery classification heavily depends on spatial factors, single channel-based classification remains an avenue to be explored thoroughly. Since Fisher's ratio and Pearson Correlation are powerful measures actively used in the domain, we propose an integrated framework (FRPC integrated framework) that integrates Fisher's Ratio to select the best channel and Pearson correlation to select optimal filter banks and extract spectral and temporal features respectively. The framework is tested for a 2-class motor imagery classification on 2 open-source datasets and 1 collected dataset and compared with state-of-art work. Apart from implementing the framework, this study also explores the most optimal channel among all the subjects and later explores classes where the single-channel framework is efficient.</description>

      <title>A tensor model for calibration and imaging with air-coupled ultrasonic sensor arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of ultrasonic sensors are capable of 3D imaging in air and an affordable supplement to other sensing modalities, such as radar, lidar, and camera, i.e. in heterogeneous sensing systems. However, manufacturing tolerances of air-coupled ultrasonic sensors may lead to amplitude and phase deviations. Together with artifacts from imperfect knowledge of the array geometry, there are numerous factors that can impair the imaging performance of an array. We propose a reference-based calibration method to overcome possible limitations. First, we introduce a novel tensor signal model to capture the characteristics of piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers (PUTs) and the underlying multidimensional nature of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) sensor array. Second, we formulate an optimization problem based on the proposed tensor model to obtain the calibrated parameters of the array and solve the problem using a modified block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Third, we assess both our model and the commonly used analytical model using real data from a 3D imaging experiment. The experiment reveals that our array response model we learned with calibration data yields an imaging performance similar to that of the analytical array model, which requires perfect array geometry information.</description>

      <title>LLM4CP: Adapting Large Language Models for Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel prediction is an effective approach for reducing the feedback or estimation overhead in massive multi-input multi-output (m-MIMO) systems. However, existing channel prediction methods lack precision due to model mismatch errors or network generalization issues. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful modeling and generalization abilities, and have been successfully applied to cross-modal tasks, including the time series analysis. Leveraging the expressive power of LLMs, we propose a pre-trained LLM-empowered channel prediction method (LLM4CP) to predict the future downlink channel state information (CSI) sequence based on the historical uplink CSI sequence. We fine-tune the network while freezing most of the parameters of the pre-trained LLM for better cross-modality knowledge transfer. To bridge the gap between the channel data and the feature space of the LLM, preprocessor, embedding, and output modules are specifically tailored by taking into account unique channel characteristics. Simulations validate that the proposed method achieves SOTA prediction performance on full-sample, few-shot, and generalization tests with low training and inference costs.</description>

      <title>Traffic Prediction considering Multiple Levels of Spatial-temporal Information: A Multi-scale Graph Wavelet-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although traffic prediction has been receiving considerable attention with a number of successes in the context of intelligent transportation systems, the prediction of traffic states over a complex transportation network that contains different road types has remained a challenge. This study proposes a multi-scale graph wavelet temporal convolution network (MSGWTCN) to predict the traffic states in complex transportation networks. Specifically, a multi-scale spatial block is designed to simultaneously capture the spatial information at different levels, and the gated temporal convolution network is employed to extract the temporal dependencies of the data. The model jointly learns to mount multiple levels of the spatial interactions by stacking graph wavelets with different scales. Two real-world datasets are used in this study to investigate the model performance, including a highway network in Seattle and a dense road network of Manhattan in New York City. Experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models. Furthermore, different scales of graph wavelets are found to be effective in extracting local, intermediate and global information at the same time and thus enable the model to learn a complex transportation network topology with various types of road segments. By carefully customizing the scales of wavelets, the model is able to improve the prediction performance and better adapt to different network configurations.</description>

      <title>Overlay Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks with SWIPT-Empowered Aerial Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider overlay space-air-ground integrated networks (OSAGINs) where a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communicates with ground users (GUs) with the assistance of an energy-constrained coexisting air-to-air (A2A) network. Particularly, a non-linear energy harvester with a hybrid SWIPT utilizing both power-splitting and time-switching energy harvesting (EH) techniques is employed at the aerial transmitter. Specifically, we take the random locations of the satellite, ground and aerial receivers to investigate the outage performance of both the satellite-to-ground and aerial networks leveraging the stochastic tools. By taking into account the Shadowed-Rician fading for satellite link, the Nakagami-\emph{m} for ground link, and the Rician fading for aerial link, we derive analytical expressions for the outage probability of these networks. For a comprehensive analysis of aerial network, we consider both the perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) scenarios. Through our analysis, we illustrate that, unlike linear EH, the implementation of non-linear EH provides accurate figures for any target rate, underscoring the significance of using non-linear EH models. Additionally, the influence of key parameters is emphasized, providing guidelines for the practical design of an energy-efficient as well as spectrum-efficient future non-terrestrial networks. Monte Carlo simulations validate the accuracy of our theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Investigating Low-Cost LLM Annotation for~Spoken Dialogue Understanding Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spoken Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems, the choice of the semantic representation describing the users' requests is key to a smooth interaction. Indeed, the system uses this representation to reason over a database and its domain knowledge to choose its next action. The dialogue course thus depends on the information provided by this semantic representation. While textual datasets provide fine-grained semantic representations, spoken dialogue datasets fall behind. This paper provides insights into automatic enhancement of spoken dialogue datasets' semantic representations. Our contributions are three fold: (1) assess the relevance of Large Language Model fine-tuning, (2) evaluate the knowledge captured by the produced annotations and (3) highlight semi-automatic annotation implications.</description>

      <title>AI-Empowered Multiple Access for 6G: A Survey of Spectrum Sensing, Protocol Designs, and Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapidly increasing number of bandwidth-intensive terminals capable of intelligent computing and communication, such as smart devices equipped with shallow neural network models, the complexity of multiple access for these intelligent terminals is increasing due to the dynamic network environment and ubiquitous connectivity in 6G systems. Traditional multiple access (MA) design and optimization methods are gradually losing ground to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that have proven their superiority in handling complexity. AI-empowered MA and its optimization strategies aimed at achieving high Quality-of-Service (QoS) are attracting more attention, especially in the area of latency-sensitive applications in 6G systems. In this work, we aim to: 1) present the development and comparative evaluation of AI-enabled MA; 2) provide a timely survey focusing on spectrum sensing, protocol design, and optimization for AI-empowered MA; and 3) explore the potential use cases of AI-empowered MA in the typical application scenarios within 6G systems. Specifically, we first present a unified framework of AI-empowered MA for 6G systems by incorporating various promising machine learning techniques in spectrum sensing, resource allocation, MA protocol design, and optimization. We then introduce AI-empowered MA spectrum sensing related to spectrum sharing and spectrum interference management. Next, we discuss the AI-empowered MA protocol designs and implementation methods by reviewing and comparing the state-of-the-art, and we further explore the optimization algorithms related to dynamic resource management, parameter adjustment, and access scheme switching. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, point out open issues, and outline potential future research directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Parameter Training Efficiency Aware Resource Allocation for AIGC in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the evolution of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) techniques and the development of space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN), there will be a growing opportunity to enhance more users' mobile experience with customized AIGC applications. This is made possible through the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) training alongside mobile edge computing. In this paper, we formulate the optimization problem of maximizing the parameter training efficiency of the SAGIN system over wireless networks under limited resource constraints. We propose the Parameter training efficiency Aware Resource Allocation (PARA) technique to jointly optimize user association, data offloading, and communication and computational resource allocation. Solid proofs are presented to solve this difficult sum of ratios problem based on quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), semidefinite programming (SDP), graph theory, and fractional programming (FP) techniques. Our proposed PARA technique is effective in finding a stationary point of this non-convex problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PARA method outperforms other baselines.</description>

      <title>Channel Charting in Real-World Coordinates with Distributed MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel charting is an emerging self-supervised method that maps channel-state information (CSI) to a low-dimensional latent space (the channel chart) that represents pseudo-positions of user equipments (UEs). While channel charts preserve local geometry, i.e., nearby UEs are nearby in the channel chart (and vice versa), the pseudo-positions are in arbitrary coordinates and global geometry is typically not preserved. In order to embed channel charts in real-world coordinates, we first propose a bilateration loss for distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) wireless systems in which only the access point (AP) positions are known. The idea behind this loss is to compare the received power at pairs of APs to determine whether a UE should be placed closer to one AP or the other in the channel chart. Second, we propose a line-of-sight (LoS) bounding-box loss that places the UE in a predefined LoS area of each AP that is estimated to have a LoS path to the UE. We demonstrate the efficacy of combining both of these loss functions with neural-network-based channel charting using ray-tracing-based and measurement-based channel vectors. Our approach outperforms several baselines and maintains the self-supervised nature of channel charting as it does not rely on geometrical propagation models or require ground-truth UE position information.</description>

      <title>Primal-Dual Strategy (PDS) for Composite Optimization Over Directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distributed multi-agent sharing optimization problem in a directed graph, with a composite objective function consisting of a smooth function plus a convex (possibly non-smooth) function shared by all agents. While adhering to the network connectivity structure, the goal is to minimize the sum of smooth local functions plus a non-smooth function. The proposed Primal-Dual algorithm (PD) is similar to a previous algorithm \cite{b27}, but it has additional benefits. To begin, we investigate the problem in directed graphs, where agents can only communicate in one direction and the combination matrix is not symmetric. Furthermore, the combination matrix is changing over time, and the condition coefficient weights are produced using an adaptive approach. The strong convexity assumption, adaptive coefficient weights, and a new upper bound on step-sizes are used to demonstrate that linear convergence is possible. New upper bounds on step-sizes are derived under the strong convexity assumption and adaptive coefficient weights that are time-varying in the presence of both smooth and non-smooth terms. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared to some other algorithms.</description>

      <title>PAPR Reduction with Pre-chirp Selection for Affine Frequency Division Multiple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising new multicarrier technique based on discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). By properly tuning pre-chirp parameter and post-chirp parameter in the DAFT, the effective channel in the DAFT domain can completely avoid overlap of different paths, thus constitutes a full representation of delay-Doppler profile, which significantly improves the system performance in high mobility scenarios. However, AFDM has the crucial problem of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) caused by phase randomness of modulated symbols. In this letter, an algorithm named grouped pre-chirp selection (GPS) is proposed to reduce the PAPR by changing the value of pre-chirp parameter on sub-carriers group by group. Specifically, it is demonstrated first that the important properties of AFDM system are maintained when implementing GPS. Secondly, we elaborate the operation steps of GPS algorithm, illustrating its effect on PAPR reduction and its advantage in terms of computational complexity compared with the ungrouped approach. Finally, simulation results of PAPR reduction in the form of complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) show the effectiveness of the proposed GPS algorithm.</description>

      <title>A microwave photonic prototype for concurrent radar detection and spectrum sensing over an 8 to 40 GHz bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a microwave photonic prototype for concurrent radar detection and spectrum sensing is proposed, designed, built, and investigated. A direct digital synthesizer and an analog electronic circuit are integrated to generate an intermediate frequency (IF) linearly frequency-modulated (LFM) signal with a tunable center frequency from 2.5 to 9.5 GHz and an instantaneous bandwidth of 1 GHz. The IF LFM signal is converted to the optical domain via an intensity modulator and then filtered by a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) to generate only two 2nd-order optical LFM sidebands. In radar detection, the two optical LFM sidebands beat with each other to generate a frequency-and-bandwidth-quadrupled LFM signal, which is used for ranging, radial velocity measurement, and imaging. By changing the center frequency of the IF LFM signal, the radar function can be operated within 8 to 40 GHz. In spectrum sensing, one 2nd-order optical LFM sideband is selected by another FBG, which then works in conjunction with the stimulated Brillouin scattering gain spectrum to map the frequency of the signal under test to time with an instantaneous measurement bandwidth of 2 GHz. By using a frequency shift module to adjust the pump frequency, the frequency measurement range can be adjusted from 0 to 40 GHz. The prototype is comprehensively studied and tested, which is capable of achieving a range resolution of 3.75 cm, a range error of less than $\pm$ 2 cm, a radial velocity error within $\pm$ 1 cm/s, delivering clear imaging of multiple small targets, and maintaining a frequency measurement error of less than $\pm$ 7 MHz and a frequency resolution of better than 20 MHz.</description>

      <title>FLoCoRA: Federated learning compression with low-rank adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods have gained popularity in efficient parameter fine-tuning of models containing hundreds of billions of parameters. In this work, instead, we demonstrate the application of LoRA methods to train small-vision models in Federated Learning (FL) from scratch. We first propose an aggregation-agnostic method to integrate LoRA within FL, named FLoCoRA, showing that the method is capable of reducing communication costs by 4.8 times, while having less than 1% accuracy degradation, for a CIFAR-10 classification task with a ResNet-8. Next, we show that the same method can be extended with an affine quantization scheme, dividing the communication cost by 18.6 times, while comparing it with the standard method, with still less than 1% of accuracy loss, tested with on a ResNet-18 model. Our formulation represents a strong baseline for message size reduction, even when compared to conventional model compression works, while also reducing the training memory requirements due to the low-rank adaptation.</description>

      <title>Zero field active shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambient field suppression is critical for accurate magnetic field measurements, and a requirement for certain low-field sensors to operate. The difference in magnitude between noise and signal (up to 10$^9$) makes the problem challenging, and solutions such as passive shielding, post-hoc processing, and most active shielding designs do not address it completely. Zero field active shielding (ZFS) achieves accurate field suppression with a feed-forward structure in which correction coils are fed by reference sensors via a matrix found using data-driven methods. Requirements are a sufficient number of correction coils and reference sensors to span the ambient field at the sensors, and to zero out the coil-to-reference sensor coupling. The solution assumes instantaneous propagation and mixing, but it can be extended to handle convolutional effects. Precise calculations based on sensor and coil geometries are not necessary, other than to improve efficiency and usability. The solution is simulated here but not implemented in hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning for human activity recognition have been relatively limited due to the lack of large labelled datasets. In this study, we leverage self-supervised learning techniques on the UK-Biobank activity tracker dataset--the largest of its kind to date--containing more than 700,000 person-days of unlabelled wearable sensor data. Our resulting activity recognition model consistently outperformed strong baselines across seven benchmark datasets, with an F1 relative improvement of 2.5%-100% (median 18.4%), the largest improvements occurring in the smaller datasets. In contrast to previous studies, our results generalise across external datasets, devices, and environments. Our open-source model will help researchers and developers to build customisable and generalisable activity classifiers with high performance.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a joint mechanical and electrical adjustment of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) for the performance improvements of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. In particular, we construct a three-dimensional (3D) MIMO channel model for the mechanically-tilted IRS in general deployment, and consider two types of scenarios with and without the direct path of LEO-ground user link due to the orbital flight. With the aim of maximizing the end-to-end performance, we jointly optimize tilting angle and phase shift of IRS along with the transceiver beamforming, whose performance superiority is verified via simulations with the Orbcomm LEO satellite using a real orbit data.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided RIS Communication: Robust Beamforming and Interference Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned to play a key role in future wireless communication networks. However, channel estimation in RIS-aided wireless networks is challenging due to their passive nature and the large number of reflective elements, leading to high channel estimation overhead. Additionally, conventional methods like beam sweeping, which do not rely on explicit channel state information, often struggle in managing interference in multi-user networks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages digital twins (DTs) of the physical environments to approximate channels using electromagnetic 3D models and ray tracing, thus relaxing the need for channel estimation and extensive over-the-air computations in RIS-aided wireless networks. To address the digital twins channel approximation errors, we further refine this approach with a DT-specific robust transmission design that reliably meets minimum desired rates. The results show that our method secures these rates over 90% of the time, significantly outperforming beam sweeping, which achieves these rates less than 8% of the time due to its poor management of transmitting power and interference.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the receiver to transmitter antenna coupling in near-field communications with massive arrays. Although most works in the literature consider that it is negligible and approximate it by zero, there is no rigorous analysis on its relevance for practical systems. In this work, we leverage multiport communication theory to obtain conditions for the aforementioned approximation to be valid in MISO and SIMO systems. These conditions are then particularized for arrays with fixed inter-element spacing and arrays with fixed size.</description>

      <title>A DRL Approach for RIS-Assisted Full-Duplex UL and DL Transmission: Beamforming, Phase Shift and Power Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for a full-duplex (FD) transmission that predicts the phase shifts of the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), base station (BS) active beamformers, and the transmit powers to maximize the weighted sum rate of uplink and downlink users. Existing methods require channel state information (CSI) and residual self-interference (SI) knowledge to calculate exact active beamformers or the DRL rewards, which typically fail without CSI or residual SI. Especially for time-varying channels, estimating and signaling CSI to the DRL agent is required at each time step and is costly. We propose a two-stage DRL framework with minimal signaling overhead to address this. The first stage uses the least squares method to initiate learning by partially canceling the residual SI. The second stage uses DRL to achieve performance comparable to existing CSI-based methods without requiring the CSI or the exact residual SI. Further, the proposed DRL framework for quantized RIS phase shifts reduces the signaling from BS to the RISs using $32$ times fewer bits than the continuous version. The quantized methods reduce action space, resulting in faster convergence and $7.1\%$ and $22.28\%$ better UL and DL rates, respectively than the continuous method.</description>

      <title>DOCTOR: A Multi-Disease Detection Continual Learning Framework Based on Wearable Medical Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05738v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern advances in machine learning (ML) and wearable medical sensors (WMSs) in edge devices have enabled ML-driven disease detection for smart healthcare. Conventional ML-driven methods for disease detection rely on customizing individual models for each disease and its corresponding WMS data. However, such methods lack adaptability to distribution shifts and new task classification classes. In addition, they need to be rearchitected and retrained from scratch for each new disease. Moreover, installing multiple ML models in an edge device consumes excessive memory, drains the battery faster, and complicates the detection process. To address these challenges, we propose DOCTOR, a multi-disease detection continual learning (CL) framework based on WMSs. It employs a multi-headed deep neural network (DNN) and a replay-style CL algorithm. The CL algorithm enables the framework to continually learn new missions where different data distributions, classification classes, and disease detection tasks are introduced sequentially. It counteracts catastrophic forgetting with a data preservation method and a synthetic data generation (SDG) module. The data preservation method preserves the most informative subset of real training data from previous missions for exemplar replay. The SDG module models the probability distribution of the real training data and generates synthetic data for generative replay while retaining data privacy. The multi-headed DNN enables DOCTOR to detect multiple diseases simultaneously based on user WMS data. We demonstrate DOCTOR's efficacy in maintaining high disease classification accuracy with a single DNN model in various CL experiments. In complex scenarios, DOCTOR achieves 1.43 times better average test accuracy, 1.25 times better F1-score, and 0.41 higher backward transfer than the naive fine-tuning framework with a small model size of less than 350KB.</description>

      <title>SuperM2M: Supervised and Mixture-to-Mixture Co-Learning for Speech Enhancement and Robust ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current dominant approach for neural speech enhancement is based on supervised learning by using simulated training data. The trained models, however, often exhibit limited generalizability to real-recorded data. To address this, this paper investigates training enhancement models directly on real target-domain data. We propose to adapt mixture-to-mixture (M2M) training, originally designed for speaker separation, for speech enhancement, by modeling multi-source noise signals as a single, combined source. In addition, we propose a co-learning algorithm that improves M2M with the help of supervised algorithms. When paired close-talk and far-field mixtures are available for training, M2M realizes speech enhancement by training a deep neural network (DNN) to produce speech and noise estimates in a way such that they can be linearly filtered to reconstruct the close-talk and far-field mixtures. This way, the DNN can be trained directly on real mixtures, and can leverage close-talk and far-field mixtures as a weak supervision to enhance far-field mixtures. To improve M2M, we combine it with supervised approaches to co-train the DNN, where mini-batches of real close-talk and far-field mixture pairs and mini-batches of simulated mixture and clean speech pairs are alternately fed to the DNN, and the loss functions are respectively (a) the mixture reconstruction loss on the real close-talk and far-field mixtures and (b) the regular enhancement loss on the simulated clean speech and noise. We find that, this way, the DNN can learn from real and simulated data to achieve better generalization to real data. We name this algorithm SuperM2M (supervised and mixture-to-mixture co-learning). Evaluation results on the CHiME-4 dataset show its effectiveness and potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of deep learning models across diverse tasks, their complexity poses challenges for interpretation. This challenge is particularly evident for audio signals, where conveying interpretations becomes inherently difficult. To address this issue, we introduce Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers (L-MAC), a posthoc interpretation method that generates faithful and listenable interpretations. L-MAC utilizes a decoder on top of a pretrained classifier to generate binary masks that highlight relevant portions of the input audio. We train the decoder with a loss function that maximizes the confidence of the classifier decision on the masked-in portion of the audio while minimizing the probability of model output for the masked-out portion. Quantitative evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain data demonstrate that L-MAC consistently produces more faithful interpretations than several gradient and masking-based methodologies. Furthermore, a user study confirms that, on average, users prefer the interpretations generated by the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>EEG-DBNet: A Dual-Branch Network for Temporal-Spectral Decoding in Motor-Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>

Abstract: Motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer significant advantages for individuals with restricted limb mobility. However, challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio and limited spatial resolution impede accurate feature extraction from EEG signals, thereby affecting the classification accuracy of different actions. To address these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end dual-branch network (EEG-DBNet) that decodes the temporal and spectral sequences of EEG signals in parallel through two distinct network branches. Each branch comprises a local convolutional block and a global convolutional block. The local convolutional block transforms the source signal from the temporal-spatial domain to the temporal-spectral domain. By varying the number of filters and convolution kernel sizes, the local convolutional blocks in different branches adjust the length of their respective dimension sequences. Different types of pooling layers are then employed to emphasize the features of various dimension sequences, setting the stage for subsequent global feature extraction. The global convolution block splits and reconstructs the feature of the signal sequence processed by the local convolution block in the same branch and further extracts features through the dilated causal convolutional neural networks. Finally, the outputs from the two branches are concatenated, and signal classification is completed via a fully connected layer. Our proposed method achieves classification accuracies of 85.84% and 91.60% on the BCI Competition 4-2a and BCI Competition 4-2b datasets, respectively, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models.

      <title>Log-Scale Quantization in Distributed First-Order Methods: Gradient-based Learning from Distributed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized strategies are of interest for learning from large-scale data over networks. This paper studies learning over a network of geographically distributed nodes/agents subject to quantization. Each node possesses a private local cost function, collectively contributing to a global cost function, which the proposed methodology aims to minimize. In contrast to many existing literature, the information exchange among nodes is quantized. We adopt a first-order computationally-efficient distributed optimization algorithm (with no extra inner consensus loop) that leverages node-level gradient correction based on local data and network-level gradient aggregation only over nearby nodes. This method only requires balanced networks with no need for stochastic weight design. It can handle log-scale quantized data exchange over possibly time-varying and switching network setups. We analyze convergence over both structured networks (for example, training over data-centers) and ad-hoc multi-agent networks (for example, training over dynamic robotic networks). Through analysis and experimental validation, we show that (i) structured networks generally result in a smaller optimality gap, and (ii) logarithmic quantization leads to smaller optimality gap compared to uniform quantization.</description>
