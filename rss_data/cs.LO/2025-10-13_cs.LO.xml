      <title>Modular Counting over 3-Element and Conservative Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP for short) the goal is to decide the existence of a homomorphism from a given relational structure $G$ to a given relational structure $H$. If the structure $H$ is fixed and $G$ is the only input, the problem is denoted $CSP(H)$. In its counting version, $\#CSP(H)$, the task is to find the number of such homomorphisms. The CSP and #CSP have been used to model a wide variety of combinatorial problems and have received a tremendous amount of attention from researchers from multiple disciplines.
  In this paper we consider the modular version of the counting CSPs, that is, problems of the form $\#_pCSP(H)$ of counting the number of homomorphisms to $H$ modulo a fixed prime number $p$. Modular counting has been intensively studied during the last decade, although mainly in the case of graph homomorphisms. Here we continue the program of systematic research of modular counting of homomorphisms to general relational structures. The main results of the paper include a new way of reducing modular counting problems to smaller domains and a study of the complexity of such problems over 3-element domains and over conservative domains, that is, relational structures that allow to express (in a certain exact way) every possible unary predicate.</description>

      <title>Proof Strategy Extraction from LLMs for Enhancing Symbolic Provers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One important approach to software verification is interactive theorem proving. However, writing formal proofs often requires substantial human effort, making proof automation highly important. Traditionally, proof automation has relied on symbolic provers. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in theorem proving, complementing symbolic provers. Nonetheless, prompting LLMs can be expensive and may pose security risks for confidential codebases. As a result, purely symbolic approaches remain important even in the LLM era, as they are cost-effective, secure, and complement the strengths of LLMs.
  Motivated by these considerations, we ask a new research question: can we extract the internal strategies of LLMs to enhance the capabilities of symbolic provers? As an initial attempt to answer this question, we propose Strat2Rocq, which extracts proof strategies from LLMs and formalizes them as lemmas in Rocq. These lemmas are accessible to symbolic provers such as CoqHammer. With the addition of these LLM-extracted lemmas, CoqHammer is able to prove more theorems. The knowledge extraction process involves analyzing the proof trajectories of LLMs on a training set of proved theorems. For each theorem, we prompt the LLM to generate a natural language proof, then ask it to summarize this proof into formalized lemmas with proofs. We also employ a standard agentic approach to mitigate errors during formalization. Our evaluation demonstrates that, on open-source Rocq projects for software verification, Strat2Rocq enhances the success rate of CoqHammer by 13.41%.</description>

      <title>Formally Verified Certification of Unsolvability of Temporal Planning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to unsolvability certification of temporal planning. Our approach is based on encoding the planning problem into a network of timed automata, and then using an efficient model checker on the network followed by a certificate checker to certify the output of the model checker. Our approach prioritises trustworthiness of the certification: we formally verify our implementation of the encoding to timed automata using the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL and we use an existing certificate checker (also formally verified in Isabelle/HOL) to certify the model checking result.</description>

      <title>Non-Expansive Fuzzy Coalgebraic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy logic extends the classical truth values "true" and "false" with additional truth degrees in between, typically real numbers in the unit interval. More specifically, fuzzy modal logics in this sense are given by a choice of fuzzy modalities and a fuzzy propositional base. It has been noted that fuzzy modal logics over the Zadeh base, which interprets disjunction as maximum, are often computationally tractable but on the other hand add little in the way of expressivity to their classical counterparts. Contrastingly, fuzzy modal logics over the more expressive Lukasiewicz base have attractive logical properties but are often computationally less tractable or even undecidable. In the basic case of the modal logic of fuzzy relations, sometimes termed fuzzy ALC, it has recently been shown that an intermediate non-expansive propositional base, known from characteristic logics for behavioural distances of quantitative systems, strikes a balance between these poles: It provides increased expressiveness over the Zadeh base while avoiding the computational problems of the Lukasiewicz base, in fact allowing for reasoning in PSpace. Modal logics, in particular fuzzy modal logics, generally vary widely in terms of syntax and semantics, involving, for instance, probabilistic, preferential, or weighted structures. Coalgebraic modal logic provides a unifying framework for wide ranges of semantically different modal logics, both two-valued and fuzzy. In the present work, we focus on non-expansive coalgebraic fuzzy modal logics, providing a criterion for decidability in PSpace. Using this criterion, we recover the mentioned complexity result for non-expansive fuzzy ALC and moreover obtain new PSpace upper bounds for various quantitative modal logics for probabilistic and metric transition systems.</description>

      <title>Cut-elimination for the alternation-free modal mu-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a syntactic cut-elimination procedure for the alternation-free fragment of the modal mu-calculus. Cut reduction is carried out within a cyclic proof system, where proofs are finitely branching but may be non-wellfounded. The structure of such proofs is exploited to directly transform a cyclic proof with cuts into a cut-free one, without detouring through other logics or relying on intermediate machinery for regularisation. Novel ingredients include the use of multicuts and results from the theory of well-quasi-orders, the later used in the termination argument.</description>

      <title>A Denotational Product Construction for Temporal Verification of Effectful Higher-Order Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a categorical framework for linear-time temporal verification of effectful higher-order programs, including probabilistic higher-order programs. Our framework provides a generic denotational reduction -- namely, a denotational product construction -- from linear-time safety verification of effectful higher-order programs to computation of weakest pre-conditions of product programs. This reduction enables us to apply existing algorithms for such well-studied computations of weakest pre-conditions, some of which are available as off-the-shelf solvers. We show the correctness of our denotational product construction by proving a preservation theorem under strong monad morphisms and an existence of suitable liftings along a fibration. We instantiate our framework with both probabilistic and angelic nondeterministic higher-order programs, and implement an automated solver for the probabilistic case based on the existing solver developed by Kura and Unno. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated verifier for linear-time temporal verification of probabilistic higher-order programs with recursion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formal analysis of automated systems is an important and growing industry. This activity routinely requires new verification frameworks to be developed to tackle new programming features, or new considerations (bugs of interest). Often, one particular property can prove frustrating to establish: completeness of the logic with respect to the semantics. In this paper, we try and make such developments easier, with a particular attention on completeness. Towards that aim, we propose a formal (meta-)model of software analysis systems (SAS), the eponymous Representations. This model requires few assumptions on the SAS being modeled, and as such is able to capture a large class of such systems. We then show how our approach can be fruitful, both to understand how existing completeness proofs can be structured, and to leverage this structure to build new systems and prove their completeness.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Verifying Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we first recall the connection between graph neural networks, Weisfeiler-Lehman tests and logics such as first-order logic and graded modal logic. We then present a modal logic in which counting modalities appear in linear inequalities in order to solve verification tasks on graph neural networks. We describe an algorithm for the satisfiability problem of that logic. It is inspired from the tableau method of vanilla modal logic, extended with reasoning in quantifier-free fragment Boolean algebra with Presburger arithmetic.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Reasoning: Flowing Logics in Representation Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes. We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature, enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows' velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.</description>

      <title>A Verified High-Performance Composable Object Library for Remote Direct Memory Access (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is a memory technology that allows remote devices to directly write to and read from each other's memory, bypassing components such as the CPU and operating system. This enables low-latency high-throughput networking, as required for many modern data centres, HPC applications and AI/ML workloads. However, baseline RDMA comprises a highly permissive weak memory model that is difficult to use in practice and has only recently been formalised. In this paper, we introduce the Library of Composable Objects (LOCO), a formally verified library for building multi-node objects on RDMA, filling the gap between shared memory and distributed system programming. LOCO objects are well-encapsulated and take advantage of the strong locality and the weak consistency characteristics of RDMA. They have performance comparable to custom RDMA systems (e.g. distributed maps), but with a far simpler programming model amenable to formal proofs of correctness. To support verification, we develop a novel modular declarative verification framework, called Mowgli, that is flexible enough to model multinode objects and is independent of a memory consistency model. We instantiate Mowgli with the RDMA memory model, and use it to verify correctness of LOCO libraries.</description>

      <title>Extended Triangular Method: A Generalized Algorithm for Contradiction Separation Based Automated Deduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI), underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning. Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018, proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and theorem proving.</description>

      <title>Semiframes: the algebra of semitopologies and actionable coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce semiframes (an algebraic structure) and investigate their duality with semitopologies (a topological one). Both semitopologies and semiframes are relatively recent developments, arising from a novel application of topological ideas to study decentralised computing systems.
  Semitopologies generalise topology by removing the condition that intersections of open sets are necessarily open. The motivation comes from identifying the notion of an actionable coalition in a distributed system -- a set of participants with sufficient resources for its members to collaborate to take some action -- with open set; since just because two sets are actionable (have the resources to act) does not necessarily mean that their intersection is.
  We define notions of category and morphism and prove a categorical duality between (sober) semiframes and (spatial) semitopologies, and we investigate how key well-behavedness properties that are relevant to understanding decentralised systems, transfer (or do not transfer) across the duality.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability Modulo Theories for Verifying MILP Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correctness of results from mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solvers is critical, particularly in the context of applications such as hardware verification, compiler optimization, or machine-assisted theorem proving. To this end, VIPR 1.0 is the first recently proposed general certificate format for answers produced by MILP solvers. We design a schema to encode VIPR's inference rules as a ground formula that completely characterizes the validity of the algorithmic check, removing any ambiguities and imprecisions present in the specification. We formally verify the correctness of our schema at the logical level using Why3's automated deductive logic framework. Furthermore, we implement a checker for VIPR certificates by expressing our formally verified ground formula with the Satisfiability Modulo Theory Library (SMT-LIB) and check its validity. Our approach is solver-agnostic, and we test its viability using benchmark instances found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Team Semantics for Temporal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present team semantics for two of the most important linear and branching time specification languages, Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Computation Tree Logic (CTL).
  With team semantics, LTL is able to express hyperproperties, which have in the last decade been identified as a key concept in the verification of information flow properties. We study basic properties of the logic and classify the computational complexity of its satisfiability, path, and model checking problem. Further, we examine how extensions of the basic logic react to adding additional atomic operators. Finally, we compare its expressivity to the one of HyperLTL, another recently introduced logic for hyperproperties. Our results show that LTL with team semantics is a viable alternative to HyperLTL, which complements the expressivity of HyperLTL and has partially better algorithmic properties.
  For CTL with team semantics, we investigate the computational complexity of the satisfiability and model checking problem. The satisfiability problem is shown to be EXPTIME-complete while we show that model checking is PSPACE-complete.</description>

Abstract: Behavioural distances provide a robust alternative to notions of equivalence such as bisimilarity in the context of probabilistic transition systems. They can be defined as least fixed points, whose universal property allows us to exhibit upper bounds on the distance between states, showing them to be at most some distance apart. In this paper, we instead consider the problem of bounding distances from below, showing states to be at least some distance apart. Contrary to upper bounds, it is possible to reason about lower bounds inductively. We exploit this by giving an inductive derivation system for lower bounds on an existing definition of behavioural distance for labelled Markov chains. This is inspired by recent work on apartness as an inductive counterpart to bisimilarity. Proofs in our system will be shown to closely match the behavioural distance by soundness and (approximate) completeness results. We further provide a constructive correspondence between our derivation system and formulas in a modal logic with quantitative semantics. This logic was used in recent work of Rady and van Breugel to construct evidence for lower bounds on behavioural distances. Our constructions provide smaller witnessing formulas in many examples.</description>

      <title>Curved Boolean Logic: A Contextual Generalization of Propositional Logic with Algorithmic Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curved Boolean Logic (CBL) generalizes propositional logic by allowing local truth assignments that do not extend to a single global valuation, analogous to curvature in geometry. We give equivalent sheaf and exclusivity-graph semantics and a context-aware proof calculus that is conservative in the flat limit. We formalize CBL-SAT and basic complexity (NP-complete in general) and present operational operators (CBL-AC and CBL-CONS) that prune contradictions earlier on classical hardware. We model noise with iid, AR(1)-correlated, and adversarial bounded perturbations and provide permutation-based significance with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control. A Colab-ready notebook (ancillary files) regenerates all figures and statistics. We position CBL relative to KCBS, CSW, and sheaf frameworks and outline links to SAT/CSP and robustness/adapter stability in large language models.</description>

      <title>Comparing and Contrasting Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incomputability results in formal logic and the Theory of Computation (i.e., incompleteness and undecidability) have deep implications for the foundations of mathematics and computer science. Likewise, Social Choice Theory, a branch of Welfare Economics, contains several impossibility results that place limits on the potential fairness, rationality and consistency of social decision-making processes. However, a relationship between G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorems in formal logic, and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in Social Choice Theory is lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a general mathematical object called a Self-Reference System. Impossibility in Social Choice Theory is demonstrated to correspond to the impossibility of a Self-Reference System to interpret its own internal consistency. We also provide a proof of G\"odel's First Incompleteness Theorem in the same terms. The two results are shown to arise out of self-referential paradoxes. Nevertheless, we show that the mechanisms generating Arrovian impossibility and G\"odelian incompleteness have subtle differences.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Substitution Basis for the Kalmar Elementary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the class of Kalmar elementary functions can be inductively generated from the addition, the integer remainder and the base-two exponentiation, hence improving previous results by Marchenkov and Mazzanti. We also prove that the substitution basis defined by these three operations is minimal. Furthermore, we discuss alternative substitution bases under arity constraints.</description>
