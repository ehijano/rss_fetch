      <title>Dynamical Axion Misalignment from the Witten Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a relaxation mechanism for the initial misalignment angle of the pre-inflationary QCD axion with a large decay constant. The proposal addresses the challenges posed to the axion dark matter scenario by an overabundance of axions overclosing the Universe, as well as by isocurvature constraints. Many state-of-the-art experiments are searching for QCD axion dark matter with a decay constant as large as $10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, motivating the need for a theoretical framework such as ours. In our model, hidden sector magnetic monopoles generated in the early Universe give the axion a large mass via the Witten effect, causing early oscillations that reduce the misalignment angle and axion abundance. As the hidden gauge symmetry breaks, its monopoles confine via cosmic strings, dissipating energy into the Standard Model and leading to monopole-antimonopole annihilation. This removes the monopole-induced mass, leaving only the standard QCD term. We consider the symmetry breaking pattern of $\mathrm{SU}(2)' \to \mathrm{U}(1)' \to 1$, leading to monopole and string formation respectively. We calculate the monopole abundance, their interactions with the axion field, and the necessary conditions for monopole-induced axion oscillations, while accounting for UV instanton effects. We present three model variations based on different symmetry breaking scales and show that they can accommodate an axion decay constant of up to $10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ with an inflationary scale of $10^{15}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. The required alignment between monopole-induced and QCD axion potentials is achieved through a modest Nelson-Barr mechanism, avoiding overclosure without anthropic reasoning.</description>

      <title>Testing the Neutrino Content of the Muon at Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collinear emission of $W$ bosons off a high-energy muon induces a large muon-neutrino component among the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) of a muon. In this paper we study the phenomenology related to the $\nu_\mu$ PDF at future high-energy muon colliders. We examine total rates and differential distributions of the $e \bar{\nu}_e$ and $W \gamma$ production processes, which receive a large, and often dominant, contribution from this PDF, allowing for a detailed experimental study. We then demonstrate that PDFs can have significant implications for the Higgs precision program envisioned at muon colliders. In particular, our results indicate that neutrino-initiated contributions constitute up to 10% (30%) corrections to the cross section for the production of a single Higgs via $Z$ boson fusion at a 3 TeV (10 TeV) muon collider.</description>

      <title>Sum rules for semi-leptonic $b \to c$ and $b \to u$ decays: accuracy checks and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-leptonic $b \to c l \nu$ processes are receiving a lot of attention, as the lepton flavor universality violation has been hinted by the measured ratios $R_{D^{(*)}} = \Gamma(B \to D^{(*)} \tau\nu)/\Gamma(B \to D^{(*)} \ell\nu)$ for $\ell = e,\mu$. Recently, it has also been pointed out that the baryonic counterpart, $R_{\Lambda_c} = \Gamma (\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \tau\nu)/\Gamma (\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \ell\nu)$, has a strong correlation with $R_{D^{(*)}}$, referred to as the R ratio sum rule in this paper. The correlation is almost independent of the new physics (NP) contributions and hence can predict $R_{\Lambda_c}$ from the measured $R_{D^{(*)}}$. On the other hand, we have fewer measurements and/or theoretical studies of the semi-leptonic $b \to u l \nu$ processes, although the same arguments can be applied to the ratios $R_\pi$, $R_\rho$, and $R_p$ as above. Since these processes are measurable at the ongoing LHCb run-3 and/or Belle~II experiments, precise studies on them are important as well. In this paper, we obtain the semi-analytic formulae for all the aforementioned $R_X$ ratios in the presence of model-independent NP contributions by using the available lattice QCD and/or light-cone sum rule fits to the form factors. Two novel points are highlighted: (i) We evaluate uncertainties of $R_X$ including both the Standard Model (SM) and NP terms, inherited from the form factor fits, and discuss how the uncertainties affect the $R$ ratio sum rules. (ii) We obtain the R ratio sum rule among the semi-leptonic $b \to u l \nu$ processes for the first time, which provides a complementary motivation for observing these processes. In addition, based on our model-independent results, we investigate how the different NP scenarios work in the $b\to c$ and $b\to u$ sectors and perform a combined study in the framework of SM effective field theory with specific flavor symmetries.</description>

      <title>Thermal Gravitational Waves During Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the generation of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from interactions in the thermal plasma. We extend the existing literature by incorporating the reheating phase into the thermal history. Our results show that the amplitude of the GW spectrum can be significantly enhanced because the temperature during reheating can be much higher than the reheating temperature. Furthermore, since the temperature evolution during reheating differs from that of free radiation, the peak frequency of the spectrum can also shift. Additionally, the morphology of the spectrum can present characteristic features. We also compute the contribution of the integrated GW spectrum to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, which can be substantially larger.</description>

      <title>Majorana CP Violation Insights from Decaying Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that within the standard three flavor neutrino oscillation formalism, the Majorana phases appearing in the neutrino mixing matrix cannot have any effect on neutrino oscillation probabilities thereby evading testability at neutrino oscillation experiments. We consider an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing three flavor neutrino oscillations with the possibility of neutrino decay and demonstrate that the two Majorana phases can entangle with the off-diagonal decay terms and appear at the level of oscillation probabilities. Using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we derive approximate analytical expressions for three flavor neutrino oscillation probabilities in the presence of neutrino decay, taking into account matter effects. In the context of a long baseline neutrino experiment, we then analyse the impact of Majorana phases on the oscillation probabilities for different channels as well as on observables related to CP violation effects in neutrino oscillations. Finally, we discuss the effect of Majorana phases on the parameter degeneracies in the neutrino oscillation framework.</description>

      <title>Determination of the strong coupling constant and the Collins-Soper kernel from the energy-energy correlator in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform, for the first time, a simultaneous global fit of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ and the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel in the back-to-back limit of energy-energy correlators in $e^+ e^-$ collisions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) accuracy. Our extracted value of $\alpha_s$ is consistent with the world average and has comparable accuracy. For the nonperturbative part of the CS kernel, we consider two different parameterizations, and the results align with those obtained from phenomenological fits of the transverse-momentum-dependent differential cross section in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan production.</description>

      <title>Probing third-generation New Physics with $K\to \pi \nu\bar\nu$ and $B\to K^{(*)} \nu\bar\nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of the $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu\bar\nu$ decay by NA62 is an important milestone in precision flavor physics. Together with evidence of $B^+ \to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ reported by Belle-II, they are the only FCNC decays involving third-family leptons where a precision close to the SM expectation has been reached. We study the implications of these recent results in the context of a new physics scenario aligned to the third generation, with an approximate $U(2)^5$ flavor symmetry acting on the light families. We find that the slight excess observed in both channels supports the hypothesis of non-standard TeV dynamics of this type, as also hinted at by other $B$-meson decays, consistently with bounds from colliders and electroweak observables. We further discuss how future improvements in precision could affect this picture, highlighting the discovery potential in these di-neutrino modes.</description>

      <title>On the Interplay of Nuclear and Higher-Twist Corrections in Nuclear Structure Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss results from our global QCD analyses including nuclear data off deuterium from various measurements, as well as off $\htri$ and $\hetri$ targets from the \mara{} experiment. We simultaneously determine the parton distribution functions of the proton, the higher-twist terms, and the nucleon off-shell correction functions responsible for the modifications of the partonic structure in bound protons and neutrons. In particular, we study the neutron-proton asymmetry of the off-shell correction and its interplay with the treatment of the higher-twist terms. We observe that the data on the $\hetri/\htri, \hetri/\hdeu$, and $\htri/\hdeu$ cross section ratio are in good agreement with the predictions based on a single isoscalar off-shell function. We provide the corresponding predictions on the ratio $F_2^n/F_2^p$, on the $d$ and $u$ quark distributions in the proton and in the $\htri$ and $\hetri$ nuclei, as well as for future measurements of the EMC effect with parity-violating Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarise the physics of first-order phase transitions in the early universe, and the possible ways in which they might come about. We then focus on gravitational waves, emphasising general qualitative features of stochastic backgrounds produced by early universe phase transitions and the cosmology of their present-day appearance. Finally, we conclude by discussing some of the ways in which a stochastic background might be detected.</description>

      <title>Energy-Enhanced Dimension Eight SMEFT Effects in VBF Higgs production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Higgs boson production via vector boson fusion at the LHC, focusing on the process $pp \to H + jj$ and capturing the leading energy-enhanced contributions within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) up to order $1/\Lambda^4$. Employing energy-scaling arguments, we predict the magnitude of each higher-dimensional operator's contribution. Utilizing the geometric formulation of SMEFT, our analysis incorporates dimension-eight operators not previously considered. We find that the kinematics of vector boson fusion - characterized by two highly forward jets - tend to suppress contributions from higher-dimensional operators, requiring a lower scale $\Lambda$ for SMEFT effects to become observable. This suggests that the SMEFT remains valid for lower $\Lambda$ than expected. Combined with the fact that LEP constrains the dimension-six operators with the most considerable impact on vector boson fusion, a regime exists where dimension-eight operators can have significant effects. In many cases, these dimension-eight operators also influence associated production processes like $pp \to H V(jj)$, though differences in analysis cuts and kinematics mean this is not always the case. Our findings provide insights that could refine the search for SMEFT signals in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Pi in the Sky: Neutron Stars with Exceptionally Light QCD Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of axion condensed neutron stars that arise in models of an exceptionally light axion that couples to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These axions solve the strong-charge-parity (CP) problem, but have a mass-squared lighter than that due to QCD by a factor of $\varepsilon&lt;1$. Inside dense matter, the axion potential is altered, and much of the matter in neutron stars resides in the axion condensed phase where the strong-CP parameter $\theta =\pi$ and CP remains a good symmetry. In these regions, masses and interactions of nuclei are modified, in turn changing the equation of state (EOS), structure and phenomenology of the neutron stars. We take first steps toward the study of the EOS of neutron star matter at $\theta =\pi$ within chiral effective field theory and use relativistic mean field theory to deduce the resulting changes to nuclear matter and the neutron star low-density EOS. We derive constraints on the exceptionally light axion parameter space based on observations of the thermal relaxation of accreting neutron stars, isolated neutron star cooling, and pulsar glitches, excluding the region up to $5 \times 10^{-7} \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 0.2$ for $ m_a \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-9}\,{\rm eV} $. We comment on potential changes to the neutron star mass-radius relationship, and discuss the possibility of novel, nuclear-density compact objects with $\theta =\pi$ that are stabilized not by gravity but by the axion potential.</description>

      <title>Transverse Orbital Angular Momentum in the Proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the equations of motion of QCD and Lorentz invariance relations, we show a new, more direct way of obtaining the decomposition of the proton's quark transverse angular momentum into its spin and orbital components. The new decomposition can be understood as a twist-three relation, with the quark transverse spin described by the parton distribution $g_T$. We find that the orbital component can be expressed in terms of a moment in the quark transverse momentum, $k_T$, of the generalized transverse momentum-dependent distribution $F_{12}$, or alternatively in terms of the twist-three generalized parton distributions $H_{2T}$ and $\widetilde{E}_{2T}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD running coupling costant is studied in the perturbative region, considering the existing experimental data, and also in the nonperurbative region, at low momentum transfer. A continous phenomenological function is determined by means of three different models also calculating the corresponding finite value of the vector quark self-energy. These two quantities are used for the vector interaction of a Dirac relativistic model for the charmonium spectrum. The process required to fit the spectrum is discussed and the relationship with previous models is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Is the finite temperature effective potential, effective for dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the applicability of the finite temperature effective potential in the equation of motion of a homogeneous ``misaligned'' scalar condensate $\varphi$, and find important caveats that severely restrict its domain of validity: \textbf{i:)} the \emph{assumption} of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is in general not warranted, \textbf{ii:)} we show a direct relation between the effective potential and the thermodynamic entropy density $\mathcal{S}= - \partial V_{eff}(T,\varphi)/\partial T$, which entails that for a dynamical $\varphi(t)$ the entropy becomes a non-monotonic function of time, \textbf{iii:)} parametric instabilities in both cases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking lead to profuse particle production with non-thermal distribution functions, \textbf{iv:)} in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking spinodal instabilities yield a complex effective potential, internal energy and \emph{entropy}, an untenable situation in thermodynamics. All these caveats associated with dynamical aspects, cannot be overcome by finite temperature equilibrium resummation schemes. We argue that the dynamics of the condensate leads to decoupling and freeze-out from (LTE), and propose a \emph{closed} quantum system approach based on unitary time evolution. It yields the correct equations of motion without the caveats of the effective potential, and provides a fully renormalized and thermodynamically consistent framework to study the dynamics of the ``misaligned'' condensate, with real and conserved energy and entropy amenable to numerical study. The evolution of the condensate leads to profuse \emph{stimulated particle production} with non-thermal distribution functions. Possible emergent asymptotic non-thermal states and eventual re-thermalization are conjectured.</description>

      <title>Detection of Dark Matter using levitated nanoparticles within a Bessel-Gaussian beam via Yukawa coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental approach to detect dark matter by probing Yukawa interactions, commonly referred to as a fifth force, between dark matter and baryonic matter. Our method involves optically levitating nanoparticles within a Bessel-Gaussian beam to detect minute forces exerted by potential dark matter interaction with test masses. The non-diffracting properties of Bessel-Gaussian beams, combined with feedback cooling techniques, provide exceptional sensitivity to small perturbations in the motion of the nanoparticles. This setup allows for precise control over trapping conditions and enhances the detection sensitivity to forces on the order of \(10^{-18}\) N. We explore the parameter space of the Yukawa interaction, focusing on the coupling strength (\(\alpha\)) and interaction range (\(\lambda\)), and discuss the potential of this experiment to place new constraints on dark matter couplings, complementing existing direct detection methods.</description>

      <title>Scalar dark matter multiplet of global $O(N)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two types of models involving a scalar dark matter multiplet of global $O(N)$ symmetry. These models are distinguished by the absence (Type I) or presence (Type II) of a scalar mediator with $Z_{2}$ symmetry. We derive the allowed regions for the dark matter mass and new scalar couplings based on constraints from Higgs invisible decay, the relic abundance of dark matter, and the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section. Within the allowed parameter space, we also discuss the vacuum stability of the Higgs potential and the perturbativity of the scalar couplings in both models. We find that the Type I model cannot achieve stable electroweak vacuum, whereas the Type II model can have both a stable vacuum and perturbative couplings up to the Planck scale.</description>

Abstract: The decay widths of $V \to K(\pi) l \bar{\nu}_l $ are calculated within the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, where $V=K^*, \rho, \omega, \phi$ and $l=\mu, e$. The results are obtained using the previously fixed model parameters without introducing any arbitrary parameters.

      <title>Probing the mass effect of heavy quark jets in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of heavy quark (HQ) jets provides a new arena to address the mass effect of jet quenching in heavy-ion physics. This paper presents a theoretical study of HQ jet yield suppression in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and focuses on the energy loss of HQ jets produced by different mechanisms. The p+p baseline is carried out by the SHERPA generator, and the jet-medium interactions are described by the SHELL transport model, which considers the elastic and inelastic partonic energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In p+p collisions, our numerical results indicate that the HQ jets from gluon splitting ($g \rightarrow Q$-jet) give the dominant contribution at high $p_T$, and it shows more dispersive structures than the HQ-initiated one ($Q \rightarrow Q$-jet). In nucleus-nucleus collisions, our calculations are consistent with the inclusive and b-jet $R_{AA}$ recently measured by the ATLAS collaboration, which suggests a remarkable manifestation of the mass effect of jet energy loss. As a result of the dispersive substructure, the $g \rightarrow Q$-jet will lose more energy than the $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet in the QGP. Due to the significant contribution of $g \rightarrow c$-jet, the $R_{AA}$ of c-jet will be comparable or even smaller than that of inclusive jet. To experimentally distinguish the $g \rightarrow Q$-jet and $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet, we propose the event selection strategies based on their topological features and test the performances. By isolating the $c \rightarrow c$-jet and $b \rightarrow b$-jet, the jets initiated by heavy quarks, we predict that the order of their $R_{AA}$ are in line with the mass hierarchy of energy loss. Future measurements on the $R_{AA}$ of $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet and $g \rightarrow Q$-jet will provide a unique chance to test the flavour/mass dependence of energy loss at the jet level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a radiatively induced linear seesaw model that is perfectly realized at leading order by a modular $A_4$ symmetry. Because this group also has a flavor symmetry, we obtain some predictions concentrating on two specific regions at nearby fixed points $\tau=\omega$ and $i$. Through our numerical chi square analysis, we show predictions for each the case depending on the neutrino mass ordering; normal and inverted one.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence between mass eigenstates of a neutrino can be destroyed by its mass-momentum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21850v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a neutrino or antineutrino produced in the decay of an unstable particle is not entangled to its accompanying particles, its mass is necessarily correlated with its momentum. In this note, I illustrate this entanglement would destroy the quantum coherence between the neutrino's mass eigenstates in both the momentum and position representations, which was overlooked by other authors in previous investigations of entanglement and coherence associated with neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Invisible Higgs decay from dark matter freeze-in at stronger coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21874v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Higgs boson decay into dark matter (DM) in the framework of freeze-in at stronger coupling. Even though the Higgs-DM coupling is significant, up to order one, DM does not thermalize due to the Boltzmann suppression of its production at low temperatures. We find that this mechanism leads to observable Higgs decay into invisible final states with the branching fraction of 10% and below, while producing the correct DM relic abundance. This applies to the DM masses down to the MeV scale, which requires a careful treatment of the hadronic production modes. For DM masses below the muon threshold, the Boltzmann suppression is not operative and the freeze-in nature of the production mechanism is instead guaranteed by the smallness of the electron Yukawa coupling. As a result, MeV DM with a significant coupling to the Higgs boson remains non-thermal as long as the reheating temperature does not exceed $\mathcal{O}(100)\;$MeV. Our findings indicate that there are good prospects for observing light non-thermal DM via invisible Higgs decay at the LHC and FCC.</description>

      <title>On the scalar $\pi K$ form factor beyond the elastic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pion-kaon ($\pi K$) final states, often appearing in heavy-particle decays at the precision frontier, are important for Standard-Model tests, to describe crossed channels with exotic states, and for spectroscopy of excited kaon resonances. We construct a representation of the $\pi K$ $S$-wave form factor using the elastic $\pi K$ scattering phase shift via dispersion relations in the elastic region and extend this model into the inelastic region using resonance exchange, while maintaining unitarity and the correct analytic structure. As a first application, we successfully described the $\tau \to K_S \pi \nu_\tau$ spectrum to not only achieve a better distinction between $S$- and $P$-wave contributions, but also to provide an improved estimate of the $CP$ asymmetry produced by a tensor operator as well as the forward-backward asymmetry, both of which can be confronted with future data at Belle II.</description>

      <title>Constraining the hidden-charm pentaquark predictions and discriminating the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ spins through the effective range expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weinberg compositeness criterion dictates that a pure shallow bound state is characterized by a large scattering length $a_0\gg\mathcal{O}(1/\beta)$ and a positive effective range $r_0$ that naturally scales to the size of $\mathcal{O}(1/\beta)$, where $1/\beta$ signifies the interaction range. In constructing the contact-range effective field theory (EFT) up to the next-to-leading order to describe the pentaquarks $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$ observed by the LHCb collaboration in 2019, we match the effective range $r_0$ for these pentaquarks with the low-energy couplings within the EFT framework. Three different schemes are used to connect the couplings with the effective range. We find positive effective ranges $r_0$ of the natural size of $\mathcal{O}(1/\beta)$ for the spin configurations $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ for $P_c(4440)$ and $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ for $P_c(4457)$ within the molecular $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ description. Additionally, predictions from the power counting for low-energy couplings or Wilsonian coefficients suggest that, under heavy quark spin symmetry, the broad $P_c(4380)$ resonance, discovered by the LHCb collaboration in 2015, when considered as part of the single-channel $\bar{D}^{(*)} \Sigma_c^{(*)}$ molecular system alongside $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$, has a mass of approximately $4376$ $\rm{MeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the limit of vanishing up, down and strange quark masses, QCD exhibits a chiral symmetry. This symmetry is broken spontaneously to its vector subgroup, giving rise to Goldstone bosons. These acquire a small mass through the explicit chiral symmetry breaking for non-vanishing quark masses. The consequences of these broken symmetries can be investigated in a suitably tailored effective field theory called chiral pertubation theory. It admits a perturbative expansion in the external momenta and the Goldstone boson masses and can be systematically analyzed in terms of a loop expansion. The appearing ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams can be dealt with order-by-order through the Goldstone boson contact interactions. Matter fields like the lowest-lying baryons can also included, leading to a rich and testable phenomenology of low-energy QCD.</description>

      <title>Testing tree level TeV scale tyep-I and type-II seesaw scenarios in $\mu$TRISTAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate TeV scale type-I and type-II seesaw scenarios at the tree level at the $\mu^+ e^-$ and $\mu^+ \mu^+$ colliders in the $\mu$TRISTAN experiment. In minimal type-I seesaw scenario we consider two generations of Standard Model (SM) singlet heavy Majorana type Right Handed Neutrinos (RHNs) which couples with SM gauge boson through light-heavy neutrino mixing. We consider a minimal scenario where one (other) generation of the RHN dominantly couples with electron (muon). Generating events for the signal and generic SM backgrounds for the final states $e^- \nu jj$ and $\mu^+ \nu jj$ from $\mu^+ e^-$ collision at $\sqrt{s}=346$ GeV and 1 ab$^{-1}$ luminosity, we estimate limits on the light-heavy neutrino mixing angles with respect to heavy neutrino mass for two generations of the heavy neutrinos. Comparing with the existing limits we find such limits could be two orders of magnitude stronger than electroweak precision data. Further, we study the effect of doubly charged scalar boson $(H^{++})$ from the type-II seesaw scenario in $\mu^+ \mu^+$ collision at $\sqrt{s}=2$ TeV. In this case we consider $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to \ell_i^+ \ell_j^+$ and $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to H^{++} Z/ \gamma$ processes followed by the same sign dilepton decay of $H^{++}$. We find that events involving $e^+ e^+$ among these final states could provide significant difference between the normal and inverted orderings of the neutrino mass which could be probed in $\mu$TRISTAN collider at 5$\sigma$ significance in future.</description>

      <title>NLO EW corrections to tau pair production via photon fusion in Pb-Pb ultraperipheral collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak (EW) corrections to the $\gamma \gamma \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ process in Pb-Pb ultraperipheral collision (UPC). We find that the EW correction $\delta \sigma_{\mathrm{EW}}$ decreases the total cross section $\sigma_{\mathrm{NLO}} = \sigma_{\mathrm{LO}} + \delta \sigma_{\mathrm{EW}}$ by -3% at Pb-Pb center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. The weak correction plays significant role whose contribution is about -4 times of that of QED. The CMS and ATLAS collaborations use the reaction $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ in Pb-Pb and proton-proton UPC to constrain tau's anomalous magnetic moment $a_\tau$. By parameterizing the $\gamma \tau \tau$ vertex with two form factors $F_{1,2}$, the cross section can be written as $\sigma_{a_\tau} = \sigma_{\mathrm{LO}} + \delta \sigma_{a_\tau}$, where $\delta \sigma_{a_\tau}$ is proportional to $a_\tau$. Under this $F_{1,2}$ parametrization scheme, it is found that there is some deviation between the NLO EW correction $\delta \sigma_{\mathrm{EW}}$ and $\delta \sigma_{a_\tau}$ which is derived either by the CMS constraint range on $a_\tau$ or from the precise SM prediction of $a_\tau$. We also find that various differential distributions of the two ratios $\mathrm{d} \sigma_{\mathrm{NLO}}/ \mathrm{d} \sigma_{\mathrm{LO}}$ and $\mathrm{d} \sigma_{a_\tau}/ \mathrm{d} \sigma_{\mathrm{LO}}$ have different lineshapes. This work is significant to precisely study the interaction of $\gamma \tau \tau$ via $\gamma \gamma \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ process.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of melting domain walls and their gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study domain walls (DWs) arising in field theories where $Z_2$-symmetry is spontaneously broken by a scalar expectation value decreasing proportionally to the Universe temperature. The energy density of such melting DWs redshifts sufficiently fast not to overclose the Universe. For the first time, evolution of melting DWs and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) is investigated numerically using lattice simulations. We show that formation of closed melting DWs during radiation domination is much more efficient compared to the scenario with constant tension DWs. This suggests that it can be the main mechanism responsible for reaching the scaling regime similarly to the case of cosmic strings. However, the scaling behaviour of melting DWs is observed, provided only that the initial scalar field fluctuations are not very large. Otherwise, simulations reveal violation of the scaling law, potentially of the non-physical origin. The spectrum of GWs emitted by melting DWs is also significantly different from that of constant tension DWs. Whether the system has reached scaling or not, the numerical study reveals a GW spectrum described in the infrared by the spectral index $n \approx 1.6$ followed by the causality tail. We attribute the difference from the value $n=2$ predicted in our previous studies to a finite lifetime of the DW network. Notably, the updated index is still in excellent agreement with the recent findings by pulsar timing arrays, which confirms that melting DWs can be responsible for the observed (GW) signal. We also point out that results for evolution of melting DWs in the radiation-dominated Universe are applicable to constant tension DW evolution in the flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Axion Dark Matter Searches at LISA-like Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion or axion-like particle has been one of the leading candidates for dark matter. Due to its tiny coupling with photon, axion dark matter in the background can induce distinct phase velocities of light with different parity, an effect known as axion-induced birefringence. Here, we propose a modification to the polarization state of the inter-spacecraft laser link in LISA-like interferometers in space to make them sensitive to this birefringence effect. We discuss the prospects of using Sagnac combinations to search for axion dark matter and derive the corresponding sensitivity. With this setup, we show that next-generation laser interferometers in space would have great sensitivities on the axion-photon coupling with axion mass around $10^{-19}~\text{eV}\sim 10^{-14}~\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Variational inference for pile-up removal at hadron colliders with diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for pile-up removal of pp interactions using variational inference with diffusion models, called Vipr. Instead of using classification methods to identify which particles are from the primary collision, a generative model is trained to predict the constituents of the hard-scatter particle jets with pile-up removed. This results in an estimate of the full posterior over hard-scatter jet constituents, which has not yet been explored in the context of pile-up removal. We evaluate the performance of Vipr in a sample of jets from simulated $t\bar{t}$ events overlain with pile-up contamination. Vipr outperforms SoftDrop in predicting the substructure of the hard-scatter jets over a wide range of pile-up scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The main goal of the paper is to show that we can treat the $1/N_c$ QCD corrections in the Pomeron calculus. We develop the one dimensional model which is a simplification of the QCD approach that includes $\pom \to 2 \pom$, $2 \pom \to \pom$ and $ 2 \pom \to 2 \pom$ vertices and gives the description of the high energy interaction, both in the framework of the parton cascade and in the Pomeron calculus. In this model we show that the scattering amplitude can be written as the sum of Green's function of $n$ Pomeron exchanges $G_{n \pom} \propto e^{ \omega_n \Y}$ with $\omega_n =\kappa\,n^2$ at $\kappa \ll 1$. This means that choosing $\kappa = 1/N^2_c$ we can reproduce the intercepts of QCD in $1/N_c$ order. The scattering amplitude is an asymptotic series that cannot be sum using Borel approach. We found a general way of summing such series. In addition to the positive eigenvalues we found the set of negative eigenvalues which corresponds to the partonic description of the scattering amplitude. Using Abramowsky, Gribov and Kancheli cutting rules we found the multiplicity distributions of the produced dipoles as well as their entropy $S_E$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sherpa is a general-purpose Monte Carlo event generator for the simulation of particle collisions in high-energy collider experiments. We summarise new developments, essential features, and ongoing improvements within the Sherpa 3 release series. Physics improvements include higher-order electroweak corrections, simulations of photoproduction and hard diffraction at NLO QCD, heavy-flavour matching in NLO multijet merging, spin-polarised cross section calculations, and a new model of colour reconnections. In addition, the modelling of hadronisation, the underlying event and QED effects in both production and decay has been improved, and the overall event generation efficiency has been enhanced.</description>

      <title>Ultraheavy multiscattering dark matter: DUNE, CYGNUS, kilotonne detectors, and tidal streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In direct searches of dark matter, multi-scatter signatures are now being sought to probe scattering cross sections that are large enough to make the detector optically thick to incident particles. We provide some significant updates to the multi-scatter program. Using considerations of energy deposition, we derive the reaches in cross section and mass of various proposed large-volume detectors: a kilotonne fiducial mass "module of opportunity" at DUNE, a kilotonne xenon detector suggested for neutrinoless double beta decay, the gaseous detector CYGNUS, and the dark matter detectors XLZD and Argo. Where the velocity vector can be reconstructed event-by-event, the Galactic dark matter velocity distribution may be inferred. We exploit this to show that halo substructure such as tidal streams can be picked up if they make up about 10% of the local dark matter density.</description>

      <title>Spin Trio: a dark matter scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a beyond Standard Model (SM) featuring four new fields. Three fields with different spins - scalar ($ S $), spinor ($ \psi $), and vector ($ V_{\mu} $) - together form the three-component dark matter (DM), while the fourth scalar field ($ \phi $) carries a unit charge under a dark $ U_{D}(1) $ gauge symmetry, enabling SM-DM interactions via the Higgs portal. Although the model maintains classical scale invariance, loop effects break electroweak symmetry. The parameter space is constrained by scale invariance, DM relic density, and direct detection results. Our study aims to identify feasible model regions and evaluate detectability in future experiments. We analyze processes like DM annihilations, semi-annihilations, and conversions, integrating them into Boltzmann equations to calculate DM abundances. Random parameter scans reveal regions compatible with current data, including constraints from direct detection experiments like XENONnT and PandaX-4T . Our results show the model's viability across a broad range of DM masses.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analyses of the A2HDM with low-mass scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-Higgs-doublet models come with an augmented parameter space which allows them to possibly solve some of the shortcomings of the Standard Model, and opens the window to a plethora of new phenomena to be discovered. The introduction of scalar-mediated tree-level flavour-changing neutral currents may be tackled with the imposition of extra symmetries on the model or, alternatively, by demanding a strict proportionality between the flavour-changing couplings and fermion mass matrices. The latter is the very idea behind the Aligned-Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (A2HDM). The coefficients that govern such proportionality are, in general, complex and, therefore, possible new sources of CP violation, a calling card of this class of models. We present here the results of new state-of-the-art analyses of the A2HDM where, in particular, we ascertain whether current data allows the A2HDM to accommodate extra scalars lighter than the 125 GeV Higgs boson. To this effect, we make use of theoretical constraints, bounds from Higgs searches at the LHC and LEP, electroweak precision observables, and a set of flavour observables, all globally combined within HEPfit, a software with a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to statistical inference. Focusing on the light-pseudoscalar scenario, we find a region of parameter space compatible with all the constraints we impose.</description>

      <title>Entanglement as a probe of hadronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was discovered that the proton structure at high energies exhibits maximal entanglement. This leads to a simple relation between the proton's parton distributions and the entropy of hadrons produced in high-energy inelastic interactions that has been experimentally confirmed. In this letter, we extend this approach to the production of jets. Here, the maximal entanglement predicts a relation between the jet fragmentation function and the entropy of hadrons produced in jet fragmentation. We test this relation using the ATLAS Collaboration data on jet production at the Large Hadron Collider and find good agreement between the prediction based on maximal entanglement within the jet and the data. This study represents the first use of the quantum entanglement framework in the experimental study of the hadronization process, offering a new perspective on the transition from perturbative to non-perturbative QCD. Our results open the door to a more comprehensive understanding of the quantum nature of hadronization.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Black-Hole-Forming Supernova Explosions on the Diffuse Neutrino Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13276v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flux spectrum, event rate, and experimental sensitivity are investigated for the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), which originates from past stellar collapses and is also known as a supernova relic neutrino background. For this purpose, the contribution of collapses that lead to successful supernova (SN) explosion and black hole (BH) formation simultaneously, which are suggested to be a non-negligible population from the perspective of Galactic chemical evolution, is taken into account. If the BH-forming SNe involve the matter fallback onto the protoneutron star for the long term, their total emitted neutrino energy becomes much larger than that of ordinary SNe and failed SNe (BH formation without explosion). Then, in the case of the normal mass hierarchy in neutrino oscillations and with half of all core-collapse SNe being BH-forming SNe, the expected event rate according to the current DSNB model is enhanced by up to a factor of two due to the BH-forming SNe. While substantial uncertainties exist regarding the duration of the matter fallback, which determines the total amount of emitted neutrinos, and the fraction of BH-forming SNe, the operation time required to detect the DSNB at Hyper-Kamiokande would be reduced by such contribution in any case.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Morphology of the Galactic Center Excess with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Descriptions of the Galactic Center using Fermi gamma-ray data have so far modeled the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) as a template with fixed spatial morphology or as a linear combination of such templates. Although these templates are informed by various physical expectations, the morphology of the excess is a priori unknown. For the first time, we describe the GCE using a flexible, non-parametric machine learning model -- the Gaussian process (GP). We assess our model's performance on synthetic data, demonstrating that the model can recover the templates used to generate the data. We then fit the \Fermi data with our model in a single energy bin from 2-20 GeV (leaving a spectral GP analysis of the GCE for future work) using a variety of template models of diffuse gamma-ray emission to quantify our fits' systematic uncertainties associated with diffuse emission modeling. We interpret our best-fit GP in terms of GCE templates consisting of an NFW squared template and a bulge component to determine which bulge models can best describe the fitted GP and to what extent the best-fit GP is described better by an NFW squared template versus a bulge template. The best-fit GP contains morphological features that are typically not associated with traditional GCE studies. These include a localized bright source at around $(\ell,b) = (20^{\circ}, 0^{\circ})$ and a diagonal arm extending Northwest from the Galactic Center. In spite of these novel features, the fitted GP is explained best by a template-based model consisting of the bulge presented in Coleman et al. (2020) and a squared NFW component. Our results suggest that the physical interpretation of the GCE in terms of stellar bulge and NFW-like components is highly sensitive to the assumed morphologies, background models, and the region of the sky used for inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on a recently proposed geometric framework for scalar effective field theories. Starting from the action, a metric can be identified that enables the construction of geometric quantities on the associated functional manifold. These objects transform covariantly under general field redefinitions that relate different operator bases, including those involving derivatives. We present a novel geometric formula for the amplitudes of the theory, where the vertices in Feynman diagrams are replaced by their geometrized counterparts. This makes the on-shell covariance of amplitudes manifest, providing the link between functional geometry and effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for radiative corrections to charged-current processes II: Axial-vector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the hadronic structure-dependent radiative corrections to the axial-vector coupling that controls single-nucleon weak charged-current processes -- commonly denoted by $g_A$. We match the Standard Model at the GeV scale onto chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order in the one-nucleon sector, in the presence of electromagnetic and weak interactions. As a result, we provide a representation for the corrections to $g_A$ in terms of infrared finite convolutions of simple kernels with the single-nucleon matrix elements of time-ordered products of two and three quark bilinears (vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar). We discuss strategies to determine the required non-perturbative input from data, lattice-QCD (+QED), and possibly hadronic models. This work paves the way for a precise comparison of the values of the ratio $g_A/g_V$ extracted from experiment and from lattice-QCD, which constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Towards alleviating the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions with Early Dark Energy - Dark Matter drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early dark energy, an additional component of dark energy active in the decade of redshift before recombination, has emerged as one of the most effective models at reducing the $H_0$ tension between direct measurement of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ in the late-universe and the $\Lambda$CDM prediction when calibrated on Planck. However, it requires a slight increase in the dark matter density $\omega_{\rm cdm}$ and primordial tilt $n_s$ that worsens the $S_8$ tension between measurements of weak gravitational lensing at low redshifts and the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM prediction. Using a phenomenological fluid model, we investigate whether the inclusion of a drag term between dark matter and early dark energy can compensate for the effect of the increase in power at small-scales, such that both $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are simultaneously alleviated. We find that this works if the drag term is dynamically relevant in the post-recombination universe. However, a drag term active before or just around the time at which the early dark energy contribution to the energy density is maximum is significantly constrained due to its impact on the matter perturbations before recombination, and the subsequent modifications to the cosmic microwave background power spectra.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity with purely virtual particles from asymptotically local quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21599v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the local limits of various classes of unitary, nonlocal quantum field theories. While it is easy to build nonlocal models with well-behaved asymptotics in Euclidean space, the Minkowskian correlation functions typically exhibit singular behaviors. We introduce "asymptotically local" quantum field theory (AL-QFT) as the class that encompasses unitary, nonlocal theories with well-defined local limits in Minkowski spacetime. The target models cannot propagate ghosts, but are allowed to contain purely virtual particles (PVPs). In the bubble diagram, the nonlocal deformation generates PVPs straightforwardly. In the triangle diagram, it does so possibly up to multi-threshold corrections, which may be adjusted by tuning the deformation itself. We build examples of AL-QFTs, including a deformation of quantum gravity with purely virtual particles. AL-QFT can serve various purposes, such as suggesting innovative approaches to off-shell physics, providing an alternative formulation for theories with PVPs, or smoothing out nonanalytic behaviors. We discuss its inherent arbitrariness and the implications for renormalizability.</description>

      <title>CaloChallenge 2022: A Community Challenge for Fast Calorimeter Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the "Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge 2022" - the CaloChallenge. We study state-of-the-art generative models on four calorimeter shower datasets of increasing dimensionality, ranging from a few hundred voxels to a few tens of thousand voxels. The 31 individual submissions span a wide range of current popular generative architectures, including Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Normalizing Flows, Diffusion models, and models based on Conditional Flow Matching. We compare all submissions in terms of quality of generated calorimeter showers, as well as shower generation time and model size. To assess the quality we use a broad range of different metrics including differences in 1-dimensional histograms of observables, KPD/FPD scores, AUCs of binary classifiers, and the log-posterior of a multiclass classifier. The results of the CaloChallenge provide the most complete and comprehensive survey of cutting-edge approaches to calorimeter fast simulation to date. In addition, our work provides a uniquely detailed perspective on the important problem of how to evaluate generative models. As such, the results presented here should be applicable for other domains that use generative AI and require fast and faithful generation of samples in a large phase space.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enhanced AC magnetometry in the presence of Markovian noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a resource to improve the sensitivity of quantum sensors. In an ideal case, using an entangled state as a probe to detect target fields, we can beat the standard quantum limit by which all classical sensors are bounded. However, since entanglement is fragile against decoherence, it is unclear whether entanglement-enhanced metrology is useful in a noisy environment. Its benefit is indeed limited when estimating the amplitude of DC magnetic fields under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence, where the noise operator is parallel to the target field. In this paper, on the contrary, we show an advantage to using an entanglement over the classical strategy under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence when we try to detect AC magnetic fields. We consider a scenario to induce a Rabi oscillation of the qubits with the target AC magnetic fields. Although we can, in principle, estimate the amplitude of the AC magnetic fields from the Rabi oscillation, the signal becomes weak if the qubit frequency is significantly detuned from the frequency of the AC magnetic field. We show that, by using the GHZ states, we can significantly enhance the signal of the detuned Rabi oscillation even under the effect of parallel Markovian decoherence. Our method is based on the fact that the interaction time between the GHZ states and AC magnetic fields scales as $1/L$ to mitigate the decoherence effect where $L$ is the number of qubits, which contributes to improving the bandwidth of the detectable frequencies of the AC magnetic fields. Our results open up the way for new applications of entanglement-enhanced AC magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Millilensing induced systematic biases in parameterized tests of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tests of general relativity (GR) can be systematically biased when our waveform models are inaccurate. We here study systematic biases in tests of general relativity induced by neglecting lensing effects for millilensed gravitational-wave signals, where the lens mass is typically in the $10^3M_\odot$--$10^5M_\odot$ range. In particular, we use a nested-sampling Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection analysis of a millilensed signal with an unlensed parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) recovery model. We find that the ppE model is significantly biased toward a detection of a deviation from general relativity at signal-to-noise ratios of 30 and higher, especially when the source is aligned with the lens mass (the lensing effect is pronounced) and when its total mass is low (the signal duration is long). We use a toy model and the linear signal and Laplace approximations to provide a semi-analytic explanation for the trends in the systematic errors found in the nested sampling analysis. Moreover, a Bayes factor analysis reveals that the (unlensed) ppE model is weakly favored over the (unlensed) GR model, and a fitting factor study shows there is a significant loss of signal-to-noise ratio when using the (unlensed) ppE model. This implies that although a parameter estimation study may incorrectly infer a deviation from general relativity, a residual signal-to-noise ratio test would reveal that the ppE model is not a good fit to the data. Thus, with current detectors, millilensing-induced systematic biases are unlikely to result in false positive detections of GR deviations.</description>

      <title>Probing nuclear liquid-gas phase transition with isospin correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuations of the net-baryon number near the critical point of the liquid-gas phase transition. We use the parity doublet model in the mean-field approximation fixed to the zero-temperature properties of nuclear matter to account for critical behavior. We explicitly calculate the fluctuations of the net-proton and net-neutron numbers as well as their correlations in the isospin-symmetric matter. We focus on the qualitative properties and systematics of the first- to fourth-order susceptibilities and their ratios. We demonstrate that the fluctuations of net-proton number do not reflect the total net-baryon number fluctuations in the vicinity of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition. We point to the importance of the non-trivial correlations between protons and neutrons.</description>

      <title>Redshift-Space Distortion constraints on neutrino mass and models to alleviate the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the neutrino mass and Hubble tension solutions and examine their effects on the Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) observations. An analysis with RSD data indicates smaller amplitude of perturbation. Including RSD data results in a slightly weaker upper limit on the neutrino mass than that derived for data without RSD, which is common in other extended models too. We have evaluated the impacts of RSD observations on some extended models, including the varying electron mass model, a time-dependent dark energy model with two parameter equations of state (EOS), and a model where the number of neutrino species is free. When we estimate the cosmological parameters for data including RSD, we found that the EOS parameter for dark energy is larger than that of the cosmological constant, and the effective number of neutrino species is smaller than the standard value, which infers a smaller present Hubble parameter $H_0$. From the viewpoint of cosmological tensions, the varying electron mass model with non-zero neutrino mass option looks promising to relax the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Dark Radiation production in axion misalignment mechanisms and the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production of dark radiation (DR) from axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) as potential origins of dark matter. Focusing on the dark matter misalignment mechanism, we examine non-thermal, pre-inflationary scenarios that could lead to the generation of DR. A key part of our analysis involves a Bayesian approach to confront ALP parameter space with current cosmological data. Additionally, we explore how DR production could offer solutions to persistent cosmological anomalies, particularly those related to the Hubble constant $H_0$ tension and the $S_8$ parameter discrepancy. Our findings aim to shed new light on the role of ALPs in addressing these open issues in cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a generative model for the nuclear matter equation of state at zero net baryon density using the Gaussian Process Regression method. We impose first-principles theoretical constraints from lattice QCD and hadron resonance gas at high- and low-temperature regions, respectively. By allowing the trained Gaussian Process Regression model to vary freely near the phase transition region, we generate random smooth cross-over equations of state with different speeds of sound that do not rely on specific parameterizations. We explore a collection of experimental observable dependencies on the generated equations of state, which paves the groundwork for future Bayesian inference studies to use experimental measurements from relativistic heavy-ion collisions to constrain the nuclear matter equation of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of quantum field theories with relativistic Luttinger fermions and local self-interaction in scalar channels. For an understanding of possible low-energy phases, we first classify the set of mass terms arising from scalar fermion bilinears. For large flavor numbers, we show that each of our models features a coupling branch in which the theory is asymptotically free. In order to address the long-range behavior, we use mean-field theory which is exact in the limit of large flavor numbers. We identify two models which undergo dimensional transmutation, interconnecting the asymptotically free high-energy regime with an ordered low-energy phase sustaining a vacuum condensate. We also study the analytic structure of the Luttinger-fermionic propagator in the various possible gapped phases.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis tests and model parameter estimation on data sets with missing correlation information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ideally, all analyses of normally distributed data should include the full covariance information between all data points. In practice, the full covariance matrix between all data points is not always available. Either because a result was published without a covariance matrix, or because one tries to combine multiple results from separate publications. For simple hypothesis tests, it is possible to define robust test statistics that will behave conservatively in the presence on unknown correlations. For model parameter fits, one can inflate the variance by factor to ensure that things remain conservative at least up to a chosen confidence level. This paper describes a class of robust test statistics for simply hypothesis tests, as well as an algorithm to determine the necessary inflation factor model parameter fits. It then presents some example applications of the methods to real neutrino interaction data and model comparisons.</description>

      <title>A model of light pseudoscalar dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.12934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The EW-$\nu_R$ model was constructed in order to provide a seesaw scenario operating at the Electroweak scale $\Lambda_{EW} \sim 246$ GeV, keeping the same SM gauge structure. In this model, right-handed neutrinos are non-sterile and have masses of the order of $\Lambda_{EW}$. They can be searched for at the LHC along with heavy mirror quarks and leptons, the lightest of which have large decay lengths. The seesaw mechanism requires the existence of a complex scalar which is singlet under the SM gauge group. The imaginary part of this complex scalar denoted by $A^{0}_s$ is proposed to be the sub-MeV dark matter candidate in this manuscript. We find that the sub-MeV scalar can serve as a viable non-thermal feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP)-DM candidate. This $A_s^0$ can be a naturally light sub-MeV DM candidate due to its nature as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (PNG) boson in the model. We show that the well-studied freeze out mechanism falls short in this particular framework producing DM overabundance. We identify that the freeze in mechanism produce the correct order of relic density for the sub-MeV DM candidate satisfying all applicable constraints. We then discuss the DM parameter space allowed by the current bounds from the direct and indirect searches for this sub-MeV DM. This model has a very rich scalar sector, consistent with various experimental constraints, predicts a $\sim 125$ GeV scalar with the SM Higgs characteristics satisfying the current LHC Higgs boson data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores the calculation of non-perturbative parameters present in the matrix element of semileptonic inclusive $B$ decays. These are important for the inclusive determination of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) parameters in the standard model. We focus on calculating the rate for radiative inclusive decay, $B\to X_c\ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}\gamma$, where $\gamma$ is hard. Both the radiative and non-radiative ($B\to X_c \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$) modes are found to require the same non-perturbative parameters. We propose forming ratios from $B\to X_c \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}\gamma$ and $B\to X_c \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ widths in different lepton energy ranges. Our results provide an efficient way to unambiguously calculate the non-perturbative parameters, especially when combined with total width calculations of $B\to X_c \ell \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$. This is shown explicitly by working to $\mathcal{O}(1/m_b)$ and determining $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$.</description>

Our study is done without any approximation, first analytically and then numerically. Current neutrino oscillation data are used in our analysis. Phenomenological implications of $M_\nu$ on the lepton CP violation and neutrino mass spectrum are explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the pseudo-scalar nature of the axion-like particle (ALP), the CP- conserving production of two Higgs bosons via the ALP necessarily involves an additional Z or $\gamma$ boson. We examine the existing constraints from di-Higgs searches at Run 2 of the LHC and find that, despite the presence of extra objects in the final state, these searches are sensitive to a combination of ALP couplings to gluons and three-bosons in the TeV scale range. Additionally, we propose a specialized search strategy incorporating an energetic leptonic Z boson. This refined ALP-induced production process would allow for the identification of the h h $\rightarrow$ 4 b-jet final state and could potentially probe the TeV scale using data from Run 2 of the LHC. This production process can also occur through a coupling between the top quark and the ALP. We translate the current constraints on di-Higgs production into new limits on the ALP-top coupling.</description>

Abstract: The helicity correlation of two back-to-back hadrons is a powerful tool that makes it possible to probe the longitudinal spin transfer, $G_{1L}$, in unpolarized hadronic collisions. In this work, we investigate the helicity correlation of back-to-back dihadrons produced in photon-nucleus collisions with both space-like and quasireal photons and explore its potential in understanding the flavor dependence of spin-dependent fragmentation functions. We present helicity amplitudes of partonic scatterings with both virtual and real photons and make numerical predictions for the dihadron helicity correlations at the future Electron Ion Collider experiment and the current RHIC/LHC ultra-peripheral collision experiment. Future experimental measurements can also illuminate the fragmentation function of circularly polarized gluons.</description>

Abstract: Sub-GeV neutrinos produced in a stellar core may emerge from main sequence stars, white dwarfs and brown dwarfs producing possible observable signals of dark matter capture. A distribution of these stars near the Milky Way galactic center will produce a neutrino flux that can be probed at Earth based neutrino observatories like Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande. We demonstrate that this can provide a handle to probe dark matter masses in the 200 MeV - 2 GeV mass scales that compares favourably with present day direct detection bounds.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the radiative decays of singly heavy baryons, a crucial aspect of their spectroscopic behavior. To enhance the accuracy of our calculations, we utilize numerical spatial wave functions for the singly heavy baryons obtained through the Gaussian expansion method, which also yields their mass spectrum. As hadron spectroscopy enters an era of high precision, we believe our study of the radiative decays of singly heavy baryons will provide valuable insights for further exploration of these particles.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino trident production of di-lepton pairs is well recognized as a sensitive probe of both electroweak physics and physics beyond the Standard Model. Although a rare process, it could be significantly boosted by such new physics, and it also allows the electroweak theory to be tested in a new regime. We demonstrate that the forward neutrino physics program at the Large Hadron Collider offers a promising opportunity to measure for the first time, dimuon neutrino tridents with a statistical significance exceeding $5\sigma$. We present predictions for various proposed experiments and outline a specific experimental strategy to identify the signal and mitigate backgrounds, based on "reverse tracking" dimuon pairs in the FASER$\nu$2 detector. We also discuss prospects for constraining beyond Standard Model contributions to neutrino trident rates at high energies.</description>

Abstract: We provide a description of the QCD phase diagram across different energy regimes. Without any adjustable free parameters fitted to lattice or experimental data, we demonstrate that the net-proton number cumulant ratios from the Beam Energy Scan-I (BES-I) central ($0-5\%$) Au+Au collision experiments at RHIC, for center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s} \geq 39\,\text{GeV}$, are well described by the $\textit{dynamical soft-wall}$ AdS black hole model, indicating the formation of a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) dominated by gluons in the large $N_c$ limit. We identify a critical point at $\mu_B = 247\,\text{MeV}$ or $\sqrt{s}=16\,\text{GeV}$ in this model, where net-proton cumulant ratios show non-monotonic variation. However, for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 39\,\text{GeV}$, the recent BES-II data does not exhibit the expected variation due to the critical point, suggesting instead a transition to a nearly-cold ($\mu_B \gg T$) weakly coupled QGP (wQGP), for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 7.7\,\text{GeV}$, dominated by valence quarks. This prediction can be tested by the upcoming STAR Fixed-Target experimental data.</description>

      <title>Vector Dark Matter from the 5-Dimensional Representation of $SU(2)_{L}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14010v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The introduction of electroweak multiplets that transform under any representation of the standard $SU(2)_L$ gauge group suggests the existence of electrically neutral stable particles capable of serving as cold dark matter in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This paradigm, known as minimal dark matter, has primarily focused on spin-$0$ and spin-$1/2$ particles. We extend this study to the spin-1 case using the 5-dimensional real representation. We address unitarity concerns arising from the model's interactions with electroweak and Higgs fields of the Standard Model, investigating implications for dark matter relic density, direct and indirect detection, including non-perturbative Sommerfeld enhancement for the latter. Collider signatures of the proposed model are also examined. Our findings suggest that the model remains consistent with experimental constraints, particularly for dark matter masses on the order of dozens of TeV, and could potentially be tested using $\gamma$-ray observatories such as CTA.</description>

      <title>Analytic amplitudes for a pair of Higgs bosons in association with three partons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pair production of Higgs bosons at the LHC can give information about the triple Higgs boson coupling. We perform an analytic one-loop calculation of the amplitudes for a pair of Higgs bosons in association with three partons, retaining the exact dependence on the quark mass circulating in the loop. These amplitudes constitute the real radiation corrections in the calculation of Higgs boson pair production at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. The results of an analytic generalised-unitarity computation are simplified via analytic reconstruction in spinor variables. Compact ans\"atze for kinematic pole residues are iteratively fitted via $p$-adic evaluations near said poles and subtracted until no pole remains. A new ansatz construction is introduced to minimally parametrise coefficients of amplitudes with multiple massive external legs. The simplified expressions are faster to evaluate than automatic codes and can lead to more stable results near singular regions.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent flavour ratios in neutrino telescopes from charm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the observed diffuse neutrino flux is not yet known. Studies of the relative flavour content of the neutrino flux detected at Earth can give information on the production mechanisms at the sources and on flavour mixing, complementary to measurements of the spectral index and normalisation. Here we demonstrate the effects of neutrino fluxes with different spectral shapes and different initial flavour compositions dominating at different energies, and we study the sensitivity of future measurements with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Where one kind of flux gives way to another, this shows up as a non-trivial energy dependence in the flavour compositions. We explore this in the context of slow-jet supernovae and magnetar-driven supernovae -- two examples of astrophysical sources where charm production may be effective. Using current best-fit neutrino mixing parameters and their projected 2040 uncertainties, we use event ratios of different event morphologies at IceCube to illustrate the possibilities of distinguishing the energy dependence of neutrino flavour ratios.</description>

      <title>Highlights of recent BESIII results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report highlights the recent BESIII results related to the measurement of the $R$ value, radiative decays of $J/\psi$ and the polarization of $D^0 \to \omega \phi$ decay. BESIII, a symmetric electron-positron collider experiment, has collected a large data sample at several energy points in the tau-charm region, including the $J/\psi$ and $\psi(3770)$ resonances. Based on the data samples collected at 14 center-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s}$) points between 2.2323 and 3.671 GeV, BESIII has achieved a measurement of the $R$ value with an accuracy down to the level of $2.6\%$ for $\sqrt{s} &lt; 3.1$ GeV and $3.0\%$ for $\sqrt{s} &gt; 3.1$ GeV. BESIII has also observed the $X(2600)$ resonance in radiative $J/\psi$ decay and the polarization of $D^0 \to \omega \phi$ for the first time. The polarization of $D^0 \to \omega \phi$ saturates with completely transverse polarization, which is inconsistent with the existing theoretical models. These results are useful in testing the predictions of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions and obtain a general theory of gravity with Weyl gauge symmetry of dilatations (Weyl-DBI). This is done in the {\it Weyl gauge covariant} formulation of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, suitable for a gauge theory, which renders this geometry {\it metric}. The Weyl-DBI action has the same gauge invariant expression with {\it dimensionless} couplings in any dimension $d$, so it has no need of a UV regulator (be it an additional field, higher derivative operator or DR subtraction scale) for which reason we argue it is Weyl-anomaly free. For $d=4$, the leading order of a series expansion of the Weyl-DBI action recovers exactly the gauge invariant Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that is Weyl anomaly-free; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda&gt;0$. The series expansion of Weyl-DBI action also contains additional terms of non-perturbative nature that can however be recovered by quantum corrections in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$ in a gauge invariant (geometric) regularisation automatically provided by the Weyl-DBI action. If the Weyl gauge boson is not dynamical the Weyl-DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action. All fields and scales are of {\it geometric origin}, with no added matter, scalar field compensators or UV regulators.</description>

      <title>Event Horizon Telescope observations exclude compact objects in baseline mimetic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mimetic gravity has gained significant appeal in cosmological contexts, but static spherically symmetric space-times within the baseline theory are highly non-trivial: the two natural solutions are a naked singularity and a black hole space-time obtained through an appropriate gluing procedure. We study the shadow properties of these two objects, finding both to be pathological. In particular, the naked singularity does not cast a shadow, whereas the black hole casts a shadow which is too small. We argue that the Event Horizon Telescope images of M87$^{\star}$ and Sgr A$^{\star}$ rule out the baseline version of mimetic gravity, preventing the theory from successfully accounting for the dark sector on cosmological scales. Our results highlight an interesting complementarity between black hole imaging observations and modified gravity theories of cosmological interest.</description>
