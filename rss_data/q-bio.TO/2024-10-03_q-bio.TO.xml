      <title>The effect of moving heat source in DPL model on viscoelastic biological tissues during during thermal treatment applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes mathematical modeling to offer computational insights into biological heat transfer within elastic skin tissues. This heat transfer is driven by a moving heat source that relies on various relaxation times. Time delay parameters were incorporated based on these relaxation times, highlighting the importance of understanding heat transfer mechanisms and thermo-mechanical interactions to ensure the effectiveness of thermal treatment procedures. Given the significant impact of different variables on thermal relaxation times, their effects were analyzed on the distributions of displacement, thermal stress, and temperature in living tissues. By applying advanced mathematical techniques such as Laplace transforms, precise evaluations of these distributions were achieved. The results are presented graphically, with a focus on enhancing treatment outcomes by deepening our understanding of the behavior of living tissues in thermal environments.</description>

      <title>ZIF-8 offers an anti-inflammatory and antifungal strategy for treating Aspergillus fungus keratitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Fungal keratitis is a serious blinding eye disease. Traditional drugs used to treat fungal keratitis commonly have the disadvantages of low bioavailability, poor dispersion, and limited permeability. Purpose: To develop a new drug for the treatment of fungal keratitis with improved bioavailability, dispersion, and permeability. Methods: ZIF-8 was formed by zinc ions and 2-methylimidazole linked by coordination bonds and characterized by SEM, XRD, and Zeta potential. The safety of ZIF-8 on HCEC cells and RAW 264.7 cells was detected by CCK-8. Safety evaluation of ZIF-8 on mice corneal epithelium was conducted using the Driaze corneal toxicity test. The effects of ZIF-8 on fungal growth, biofilm formation, and hyphae structure were detected by MIC, crystal violet staining, PI testing, calcofluor white staining, and SEM. The anti-inflammatory effects of ZIF-8 on RAW 246.7 cells were evaluated by qPCR and Elisa. Clinical score, CFU, HE staining, and immunofluorescence were conducted to verify the therapeutic effect of ZIF-8 on C57BL/6 female mice with fungal keratitis. Elisa confirmed the regulatory effect of ZlF-8 on protein expression of TNF-{\alpha} and IL-6 in the cornea of mice. Results: In vitro, ZIF-8 showed outstanding antifungal effects, including inhibiting the growth of Aspergillus fumigatus, restraining the formation of biofilm, and destroying cell membranes. In vivo, treatment with ZIF-8 reduced corneal fungal load and mitigated neutrophil infiltration in fungal keratitis, which effectively reduced the severity of keratitis in mice and alleviated the infiltration of inflammatory factors in the mouse cornea. In addition, ZIF-8 reduces the inflammatory response by downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-{\alpha}, IL-6, and IL-1\b{eta} after Aspergillus fumigatus infection in vivo and in vitro.</description>

      <title>A Computational Fluid Dynamics study of drug-releasing ocular implants for glaucoma treatment: Comparison of implant size and locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-releasing implants are gaining momentum in the treatment of glaucoma. Implants present however several limitations. Among these limitations, there is the inability to provide an even distribution of the drug in the trabecular meshwork. CFD simulations were used in this work to study the interplay between ocular fluid dynamics and drug diffusion to explore the options to achieve a homogeneous drug distribution. The analysis finds that the balance between convection and diffusion flux hinders mixing within the eye's anterior chamber. This results in highly localized drug delivery in the trabecular meshwork when using a gravity-driven location implant. The results also show that varying the size of the implant can help to solve the issue. Given the natural variability of the trabecular meshwork size amongst patients, implants with personalized size may become a potential solution. The location of the implant within the eye is also key to effective drug delivery. Natural laminar flow of aqueous humor within the eye's anterior chamber prevents achieving an even drug distribution at the target tissue for gravity-driven location implants. However, the iris-lens gap can be utilized as a natural mixer when placing the implant in the eye's posterior chamber, thus helping with effective delivery.</description>

      <title>A novel ultrasonic device for monitoring implant condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every year more than 2.3 million joint replacement is performed worldwide. Around 10% of these replacements fail those results in revisions at a cost of $8 billion per year. In particular patients younger than 55 years of age face higher risks of failure due to greater demand on their joints. The long-term failure of joint replacement such as implant loosening significantly decreases the life expectancy of replacement. One of the main challenges in understanding and treatment of implant loosening is lack of a low-cost screening device that can detect or predict loosening at very early stages. In this work we are proposing a novel method of screening implant condition via ultrasonic signals. In this method we are applying ultrasonic signals to the joint via several piezoresistive discs while reading signals with several other piezoresistive sensors. We are introducing a new approachin interpreting ultrasonic signals and we prove in a finite element environment that our method can be used to assess replacement condition. We show how our new concept can detect and distinguish between different implant fixation failure types sizes and even locate the position of the failure. We believe this work can be a foundation for development of a new generation of ultrasonic diagnosis wearable devices.</description>

      <title>Regional End-Systolic Circumferential Strain Demonstrates Reduced Function in Remote Myocardium after Anterior STEMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with severe adverse remodeling and increased mortality rates. In this study, anterior STEMI patients were treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention and then imaged with cardiac magnetic resonance 1-2 days later. The cine images were analyzed with computational feature-tracking algorithms to assess end-systolic circumferential (ESC) strain. It was found that contractile function is not only depressed in the infarct and border zone regions, but also in the remote myocardium. This is contrary to other types of infarctions where remote myocardium shows enhanced compensatory function. Quantifying ESC could help identify high risk patients.</description>
