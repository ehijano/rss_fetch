      <title>Multi-level Nonstandard Analysis and the Axiom of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-theoretic frameworks for Nonstandard Analysis depend on the existence of nonprincipal ultrafilters, a strong form of the Axiom of Choice (AC). Hrbacek and Katz, APAL 72 (2021) formulate axiomatic nonstandard set theories SPOT and SCOT that are conservative extensions of respectively ZF and ZF + ADC (the Axiom of Dependent Choice), and in which a significant part of Nonstandard Analysis can be developed. The present paper extends these theories to theories with many levels of standardness, called respectively SPOTS and SCOTS. It shows that Jin's recent nonstandard proof of Szemer\'{e}di's Theorem can be carried out in SPOTS, which is conservative over ZF + ACC (the Axiom of Countable Choice). The theory SCOTS is a conservative extension of ZF + ADC.</description>

      <title>Intersection Types via Finite-Set Declarations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lambda-cube is a famous pure type system (PTS) cube of eight powerful explicit type systems that include the simple, polymorphic and dependent type theories. The lambda-cube only types Strongly Normalising (SN) terms but not all of them. It is well known that even the most powerful system of the lambda-cube can only type the same pure untyped lambda-terms that are typable by the higher-order polymorphic implicitly typed lambda-calculus Fomega, and that there is an untyped {\lambda}-term U' that is SN but is not typable in Fomega or the lambda-cube. Hence, neither system can type all the SN terms it expresses. In this paper, we present the f-cube, an extension of the lambda-cube with finite-set declarations (FSDs) like y\in{C1,...,Cn} : B which means that y is of type B and can only be one of C1,..., Cn. The novelty of our FSDs is that they allow to represent intersection types as Pi-types. We show how to translate and type the term U' in the f-cube using an encoding of intersection types based on FSDs. Notably, our translation works without needing anything like the usual troublesome intersection-introduction rule that proves a pure untyped lambda-term M has an intersection of k types using k independent sub-derivations. As such, our approach is useful for language implementers who want the power of intersection types without the pain of the intersection-introduction rule.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable structures in infinite tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a strong dichotomy result for countably-infinite oriented graphs; that is, we prove that for all countably-infinite oriented graphs $G$, either (i) there is a countably-infinite tournament $K$ such that $G\not\subseteq K$, or (ii) every countably-infinite tournament contains a \emph{spanning} copy of $G$. Furthermore, we are able to give a concise characterization of such oriented graphs. Our characterization becomes even simpler in the case of transitive acyclic oriented graphs (i.e. strict partial orders).
  For uncountable oriented graphs, we are able to extend the dichotomy result mentioned above to all regular cardinals $\kappa$; however, we are only able to provide a concise characterization in the case when $\kappa=\aleph_1$.</description>
