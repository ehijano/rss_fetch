      <title>Shape uncertainty quantification of Maxwell eigenvalues and -modes with application to TESLA cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Maxwell eigenvalue problems on uncertain shapes with perfectly conducting TESLA cavities being the driving example. Due to the shape uncertainty the resulting eigenvalues and eigenmodes are also uncertain and it is well known that the eigenvalues may exhibit crossings or bifurcations under perturbation. We discuss how the shape uncertainties can be modelled using the domain mapping approach and how the deformation mapping can be expressed as coefficients in Maxwell's equations. Using derivatives of these coefficients and derivatives of the eigenpairs, we follow a perturbation approach to compute approximations of mean and covariance of the eigenpairs. For small perturbations these approximations are faster and more accurate than sampling or surrogate model strategies. For the implementation we use an approach based on isogeometric analysis, which allows for straightforward modelling of the domain deformations and computation of the required derivatives. Numerical experiments for a three-dimensional 9-cell TESLA cavity are presented.</description>

      <title>AIGB: Generative Auto-bidding via Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auto-bidding plays a crucial role in facilitating online advertising by automatically providing bids for advertisers. Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained popularity for auto-bidding. However, most current RL auto-bidding methods are modeled through the Markovian Decision Process (MDP), which assumes the Markovian state transition. This assumption restricts the ability to perform in long horizon scenarios and makes the model unstable when dealing with highly random online advertising environments. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), a novel paradigm for auto-bidding through generative modeling. In this paradigm, we propose DiffBid, a conditional diffusion modeling approach for bid generation. DiffBid directly models the correlation between the return and the entire trajectory, effectively avoiding error propagation across time steps in long horizons. Additionally, DiffBid offers a versatile approach for generating trajectories that maximize given targets while adhering to specific constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world dataset and online A/B test on Alibaba advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffBid, achieving 2.81% increase in GMV and 3.36% increase in ROI.</description>
