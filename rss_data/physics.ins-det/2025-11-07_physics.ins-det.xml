      <title>Quadrature-witness readout for backscatter mitigation in gravitational-wave detectors limited by back-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disturbances in gravitational wave (GW) observational data are often caused by non-stationary noise in the detector itself, such as back-scattering of laser stray light into the signal field. Unlike GW signals, non-stationary noise can appear in both the GW-signal quadrature and the orthogonal quadrature, which is usually not measured. Simultaneous sensing of this orthogonal quadrature provides a witness channel that can be used to reconstruct the disturbance in the signal quadrature enabling a subtraction of non-stationary noise. Here, we present the concept of quadrature witness that is compatible with frequency-dependent squeezing, which is already used to simultaneously reduce photon shot noise and photon radiation pressure noise. We demonstrate that implementing this approach in a GW detector could reduce noise caused by loud back-scatter events, thereby improving the overall sensitivity and robustness of GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Challenges and strategies in verification of FastRICH ASIC for the LHCb RICH detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FastRICH ASIC provides high-precision, triggerless readout for the LS3 Enhancements and Upgrades II of the LHCb RICH detector. The demands of continuous data acquisition and varying hit rates across the detector impose unique challenges on the ASIC's design and verification. This work presents the verification strategy for FastRICH, focusing on functional correctness, timing performance, and operational robustness. The methodology includes simulations across occupancy scenarios, validation of timing precision, and stress testing under pile-up and high-rate conditions. Results demonstrate that FastRICH meets its performance requirements over the full range of expected occupancies. Key design and verification challenges specific to triggerless, fast-timing ASICs are discussed, along with lessons learned for future developments.</description>

      <title>Upgrade of Super-Kamiokande with Gadolinium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Kamiokande [SK] was upgraded through the addition of gadolinium sulfate to its ultrapure water, initiating the SK-Gd program. This development enables efficient neutron tagging via the large capture cross section of gadolinium, greatly improving the identification of inverse beta decay events, the primary channel for detecting the diffuse supernova neutrino background [DSNB]. The upgrade also enhances sensitivity to galactic and pre-supernova neutrinos, as well as atmospheric neutrino interactions. To realize this capability, extensive work was performed, including the construction and operation of the EGADS demonstrator, the refurbishment of the SK tank, the development of radiopure gadolinium production methods, and the validation of the loading and uniformity of gadolinium in solution. Early SK-Gd operation has demonstrated high neutron-tagging efficiency, reduced backgrounds, and world-leading limits on the DSNB flux. With these advances, SK-Gd now stands at the threshold of discovering the DSNB and opens a wide range of new opportunities in astrophysics and neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Robust electron counting for direct electron detectors with the Back-Propagation Counting method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron microscopy (EM) is a foundational tool for directly assessing the structure of materials. Recent advances in direct electron detectors have improved signal-to noise ratios via single-electron counting. However, accurately counting electrons at high fluence remains challenging. We developed a new method of electron counting for direct electron detectors, Back-Propagation Counting (BPC). BPC uses machine learning techniques designed for mathematical operations on large tensors but does not require large training datasets. In synthetic data, we show BPC is able to count multiple electron strikes per pixel and is robust to increasing occupancy. In experimental data, frames counted with BPC are shown to reconstruct diffraction peaks corresponding to individual nanoparticles with relatively higher intensity and produce images with improved contrast when compared to a standard counting method. Together, these results show that BPC excels in experiments where pixels see a high flux of electron irradiation such as in situ TEM movies and diffraction.</description>

      <title>Performance study of 4-MU-loaded water for Cherenkov light detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on R&amp;D study to improve the photon detection efficiency of water Cherenkov detectors by doping ultra-pure water with 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), a wavelength shifting additive. Cherenkov light yields from cosmic-ray muons were measured for various 4-MU concentrations and compared with those from pure water. At a concentration of 1 ppm, the detected light yield increased by approximately a factor of three. This enhancement can be attributed to wavelength shifting and improved photon collection efficiency. No noticeable degradation in optical transparency was observed across the tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 ppm with different concentration of ethanol. These results suggest that 4-MU is a promising additive for improving the performance of water Cherenkov detectors.</description>

      <title>Advancements and future expansions of the Caribou DAQ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Caribou is a versatile data acquisition (DAQ) system developed within several collaborative frameworks (CERN EP R&amp;D, DRD3, AIDAinnova, and Tangerine) to support laboratory and test-beam characterization of novel silicon pixel detectors. It combines a custom Control and Readout (CaR) board with a Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC) running project-wide shared firmware and software stacks. The system architecture emphasizes reusability, flexibility, and ease of integration. The CaR board provides essential interfaces such as programmable power supplies, voltage and current references, high-speed ADCs, and configurable I/O lines for detector control and readout. The SoC runs an embedded Linux distribution built with PetaLinux and integrates two main components: Peary, a C++ embedded DAQ application providing hardware abstraction, configuration management, logging, and multi-device control through Command Line (CLI) and Python interfaces; and Boreal, a common Caribou FPGA firmware framework offering reusable modules and automated build workflows for user-specific bit files. The next major milestone in Caribou's evolution is the transition to version 2.0, based on a Zynq UltraScale+ System-on-Module (SoM) architecture. This paper presents the recent progress and future prospects of the project and describes recent hardware, firmware, and software developments preparing the system for the upcoming CaR board v2.0.</description>

      <title>Mitigating effects of nonlinearities in homodyne quadrature interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homodyne Quadrature interferometers (HoQI) are an interferometric displacement sensing scheme proven to have excellent noise performance, making them a strong candidate for sensing and control schemes in gravitational wave detector seismic isolation. Like many interferometric schemes, HoQIs are prone to nonlinear effects when measuring displacements. These nonlinearities, if left unsuppressed, would substantially limit the use cases of HoQIs. This paper first shows a means of measuring and quantifying nonlinearities using a working HoQI and a mechanical resonator. We then demonstrate a method for real-time correction of these nonlinearities and several approaches for accurately calibrating the correction technique. By correcting in real time, we remove one of the biggest obstacles to including HoQIs in upgrades to future gravitational wave detectors. Finally, we discuss how to post correct data from HoQIs, suppressing even further the nonlinearity-induced errors, broadening the appeal of such sensors to other applications where measurement data can be reconstructed after the fact. We demonstrate all of this on a working HoQI system and show the measured suppression of nonlinear effects from each of these methods. Our work makes HoQIs a more broadly applicable tool for displacement sensing.</description>

      <title>First order statistic of afterpulsing and crosstalk events in SiPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper briefly presents an order statistic approach to the time distribution of the first detected event after a primary avalanche breakdown from a mixture of correlated and dark counting processes. The well-known order statistic method, commonly used to describe the time resolution of scintillation detectors, is applied to the arrival times of correlated events. The established model of crosstalk as a branching Poisson process is extended to afterpulsing, and correlated events are considered starting from their seeds -- free (de-trapped or diffused) charge carriers capable of triggering secondary avalanche breakdowns. The proposed approach enables the extraction of timing information for delayed crosstalk and afterpulsing events mixed with dark counts and predicts that the distribution of the first arrival time narrows as the number of seeds increases, corresponding to a higher probability of correlated events.</description>

      <title>The Moving Beam Diffraction Geometry: the DIAD Application of a Diffraction Scanning-Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between microstructure, strain, phase, and material behavior is crucial in many scientific fields. However, quantifying these correlations is challenging, as it requires the use of multiple instruments and techniques, often separated by space and time. The Dual Imaging And Diffraction (DIAD) beamline at Diamond is designed to address this challenge. DIAD allows its users to visualize internal structures, identify compositional/phase changes, and measure strain. DIAD provides two independent beams combined at one sample position, allowing quasi-simultaneous X-ray Computed Tomography and X-ray Powder Diffraction. A unique functionality of the DIAD configuration is the ability to perform image-guided diffraction, where the micron-sized diffraction beam is scanned over the complete area of the imaging field of view without moving the specimen. This moving beam diffraction geometry enables the study of fast-evolving and motion-susceptible processes and samples. Here, we discuss the novel moving beam diffraction geometry presenting the latest findings on the reliability of both geometry calibration and data reduction routines used. Our measures confirm diffraction is most sensitive to the moving geometry for the detector position downstream normal to the incident beam. The observed data confirm that the motion of the KB mirror coupled with a fixed aperture slit results in a rigid translation of the beam probe, without affecting the angle of the incident beam path to the sample. Our measures demonstrate a nearest-neighbour calibration can achieve the same accuracy as a self-calibrated geometry when the distance between calibrated and probed sample region is smaller or equal to the beam spot size. We show the absolute error of the moving beam diffraction geometry remains below 0.0001, which is the accuracy we observe for the beamline with stable beam operation.</description>

      <title>Caribou - A versatile data acquisition system for silicon pixel detector prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Caribou is a versatile data acquisition system used in multiple collaborative frameworks (CERN EP R&amp;D, DRD3, AIDAinnova, Tangerine) for laboratory and test-beam qualification of novel silicon pixel detector prototypes. The system is built around a common hardware, firmware and software stack shared accross different projects, thereby drastically reducing the development effort and cost. It consists of a custom Control and Readout (CaR) board and a commercial Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC) platform. The SoC platform runs a full Yocto distribution integrating the custom software framework (Peary) and a custom FPGA firmware built within a common firmware infrastructure (Boreal). The CaR board provides a hardware environment featuring various services such as powering, slow-control, and high-speed data links for the target detector prototype. Boreal and Peary, in turn, offer firmware and software architectures that enable seamless integration of control and readout for new devices. While the first version of the system used a SoC platform based on the ZC706 evaluation board, migration to a Zynq UltraScale+ architecture is progressing towards the support of the ZCU102 board and the ultimate objective of integrating the SoC functionality directly into the CaR board, eliminating the need for separate evaluation boards. This paper describes the Caribou system, focusing on the latest project developments and showcasing progress and future plans across its hardware, firmware, and software components.</description>

      <title>Upgrades of the ATLAS Zero Degree Calorimeter System for Run 3 at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental studies of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) depend crucially on Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs) that measure neutrons produced at near-beam rapidity in nucleus-nucleus collisions. In hadronic nuclear collisions these neutrons are mainly spectator neutrons, those that do not scatter from opposing nucleons during the collision. As a result, the ZDCs provide a vital probe of heavy ion collision geometry. The ZDCs are also essential in the study of ultra-peripheral collisions that are initiated by photons associated with the electric fields of one or both nuclei. Coherent photon emission typically leaves the photon emitter intact, making the observation of no ZDC signal, on one or both sides, a tag of such processes. The ATLAS ZDCs, built prior to Run 1 were substantially upgraded for LHC Run 3. The primary upgrades included replacement of the quartz Cherenkov radiator with $\text{H}_2$-doped fused silica rods; installation of fast air-core signal cables between the ZDC and the ATLAS USA15 cavern; new LED-based calibration system; and new electronics implemented for readout and fully-digital triggering. The ZDCs were also augmented with new "Reaction Plane Detectors" (RPDs) designed to measure the transverse centroid of multi-neutron showers to allow event-by-event reconstruction of the directed-flow plane in nuclear collisions. The Run~3 ZDC detectors, including the RPDs, are described in detail with emphasis on aspects that are new for Run~3.</description>
