      <title>Criticality in memristor devices and the creation of deep memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we describe a way to assess memory capability of real devices, while proposing to the engineering community what to pursue to create devices with deep associated memory capability. The study of the signal produced by a real memristor nano-device focused on the description in terms of the Landau {\phi}4 theory for the critical phenomena in finite systems. This further allowed the utilization of the property of the anomalous enhancement of the autocorrelation function when a system is on the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), for improving the quantity of the demonstrated memory, while simultaneously maintaining a very good quality, as this is expressed by the stability of the autocorrelation function. In this proof-of-concept case, the morphology of the signal allowed us to impose the appropriate modifications on the signal so that we finally show how to get very close to the characteristics of the SSB and thus achieve our goal to get as close as possible to the ideal behavior of a Memristor that yields deep memory. Finally, we provide proof of the stability of memristor's operation by showing that solitons "follow" as a skeleton structure the experimentally derived time series.</description>

      <title>Wada Boundaries in Generic Polynomial PP-Wave Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the geodesics of pp-wave spacetimes with polynomial profiles of degrees $3\leq n\leq10$, which are dynamically equivalent to the motion of a classical particle in a two-dimensional harmonic polynomial potential. By analysing the escape basins associated with different asymptotic outcomes, we show that all basins exhibit the Wada property for every polynomial degree considered. We further compute the basin entropy $S_{b}$, finding that it increases monotonically with the polynomial degree, indicating enhanced unpredictability of the final state of the system. The boundary basin entropy $S_{bb}$ is also evaluated, and the $\ln(2)$ criterion confirms that the basin boundaries are fractal for $n&gt;3$. We conjecture that the Wada property persists for polynomial degrees $n&gt;10$.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization and Spectral Imprints of the Hamiltonian in Local Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis explains thermalization in isolated quantum systems through the statistical properties of observables in the energy eigenbasis. We investigate the crossover from integrability to chaos in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, establishing a direct correspondence between the spectral correlations of the Hamiltonian and local observables expressed in the energy eigenbasis as a signature of ergodicity breaking. By introducing a local perturbation that drives the system from integrability to chaos, we track the standard ETH indicators and the eigenstate entanglement entropy. We introduce a submatrix-based framework for analyzing local observables in the energy eigenbasis. By extracting real-symmetric blocks along the diagonal of the local observables represented in eigenbasis, we show that these submatrices exhibit both the short-range and long-range spectral features of the Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this correspondence persists even in a partially ergodic regime, indicating that the emergence of chaos is already encoded locally within the observables' matrix structure and that small blocks are sufficient to capture the underlying spectral correlations.</description>

      <title>Finite-system size effects in gravity-capillary wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the effects of finite-system size on the dynamics of weakly nonlinear random gravity-capillary surface waves. Experiments are conducted in rectangular tanks with varying aspect ratios, in which the fluid surface is perturbed locally and erratically by small, partially submerged magnets. Driven by an oscillating vertical electromagnetic field, these magnets generate a statistically homogeneous and isotropic random wave field. This setup enables us to probe finite-size effects without the dominant influence of global forcing present in horizontally oscillated tanks. Spatiotemporal measurements of the wave field reveal multiple branches in the wave-energy spectrum along the unconfined direction, corresponding to sloshing modes in the confined direction. We show that the spectral properties of these modes can be tuned by varying either the wave steepness or the confinement. Signatures of discrete wave turbulence in the confined direction and mesoscopic continuous wave turbulence in the unconfined direction are observed. As the confinement is gradually relaxed, we further demonstrate a smooth transition from discrete to continuous wave turbulence, consistent with the nonlinear-to-discreteness timescale ratio. Using high-order correlation analysis, we also show that finite-size effects alter wave dynamics by depleting two-dimensional three-wave resonant interactions along the confined direction.</description>

      <title>A simple chaos indicator based on the Lagrangian descriptor difference of neighboring orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a chaos indicator derivable from Lagrangian descriptors (LDs), defined as the difference in LD values between two neighboring trajectories. This difference LD is remarkably easy to implement and interpret, offering a direct and intuitive measure of dynamical behavior. We provide a heuristic argument linking its growth to the regularity or chaoticity due to the underlying initial condition, considering the arclength-based formulation of LDs. To evaluate its effectiveness, we benchmark it against more elaborate LD-based chaos indicators and the Smaller Aligment Index (SALI) using two prototypical systems: the H\'enon-Heiles system and the Chirikov Standard Map. Our results show that, despite its simplicity, the difference LD matches the accuracy of more sophisticated methods, making it a robust and accessible tool for chaos detection in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for classifying dynamical states from time series via recurrence plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is a widely used method for capturing the dynamical structure embedded in time series data, relying on the analysis of recurrence patterns in the reconstructed phase space via recurrence plots (RPs). Although RQA proves effective across a range of applications, it typically requires the computation of multiple quantitative measures, making it both computationally intensive and sensitive to parameter choices. In this study, we adopt an alternative approach that bypasses computation of recurrence measures by directly using images of RP as input to a deep learning model. We propose a new dual-branch deep learning model named DBResNet-50 built on the ResNet-50 architecture. We compare its performance with standard ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2. Our DBResNet-50 model, trained exclusively on simulated time series, accurately classifies seven dynamical regimes: periodic, quasi-periodic, chaotic, hyperchaotic, white noise, pink noise, and red noise. Further, to assess its generalizability, we test the trained model on RP images generated from standard dynamical systems not included in the training set, as well as experimental datasets from a Chua circuit, X-ray light curves from the black-hole system GRS 1915+105, and observational light curves of the variable stars AC Her, SX Her, and Chi Cygni. In all cases, DBResNet-50 outperforms the baselines and correctly predicts the known dynamics of these systems. The model further used to infers the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic components within a signal, as observed in temperature data from Ladakh and Ranchi. These results demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our deep learning framework and underscore the potential of RP image-based models as fast, accurate, and scalable tools for classifying dynamical states in both synthetic and real-world time series data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Data Assimilation in Turbulent Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of Data-Assimilation (DA) within the multi-scale framework of a shell model of turbulence, with a focus on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The central objective is to understand how measuring mesoscales (i.e., inertial-range scales) enhances the prediction of both large-scale and small-scale intermittent variables, by systematically varying observation frequency and the set of measured scales. We demonstrate that measurements conducted at frequencies that exceed those of the observed scales enable full synchronization of larger scales, provided that at least two adjacent mesoscale are measured. In addition, we benchmark the EnKF against two other DA methods, namely Nudging and Ensemble 4D-Var. EnKF is clearly superior to the former, and comparable with the latter but achieving the result with a lower computational complexity. Moreover, our results underscore the need for a tailored, scale-aware inflation technique to stabilize the assimilation process, preventing filter divergence and ensuring robust convergence.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of Global Bifurcations and Chaos in a Mechanical System under Delayed and Quantized Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We illustrate how the recent theory of Spectral Submanifolds (SSM) can capture global bifurcations and complex dynamics in mechanical systems even under delay and spatial discretization. Specifically, we build a parameter-dependent SSM-reduced model that predicts global heteroclinic and local bifurcations in a Furuta pendulum under control with delay, and verify these predictions numerically. Under additional spatial discretization of the digital controller, we also obtain an SSM-reduced model that correctly reproduces a numerically and experimentally observed microchaotic attractor in the system.</description>
