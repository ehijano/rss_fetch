      <title>Equivalence of Lagrangian and Multisymplectic Hamiltonian Formalisms for the Description of Classical Fields Interacting with Point Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalism is a generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism that is known to manifestly preserve Lorentz covariance in the description of fields and has been suggested as a possible path for developing a covariant canonical quantization process. However, since this formalism allows for multiple definitions of Poisson brackets, its practical use in field theory has been very limited. In this paper, we demonstrate the equivalence between the Lagrangian and the multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalisms in the momentum representation for describing classical fields interacting with point particles by deriving the image in that representation of the de Donder-Weyl function for a general tensor representation of the Lorentz group. The calculation is performed explicitly for a complex scalar field, the electromagnetic field, and the classical Dirac field. The obtained results allow us to propose a Lorentz covariant bilinear form as a Poisson bracket with respect to the canonical variables of the fields, thus opening the possibility of studying the complete system in a canonical and relativistic coherent way.</description>

      <title>Stability of oscillations in the spatially extended May-Leonard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The May-Leonard model for three competing species, symmetric with respect to
  cyclic permutation of the variables and extended by diffusive terms, is considered.
  Exact time-periodic solutions of the system have been found, and their stability
  with respect to spatially periodic disturbances is studied. The stability of solu tions with respect to longwave spatial modulations is revealed. A period doubling
  instability breaking the spatial uniformity is found.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Lorentz symmetry from an almost-commutative twisted spectral triple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article demonstrates how the transition from a twisted spectral triple to a pseudo-Riemannian spectral triple arises within an almost-commutative spectral triple. This suggests that the noncommutative part itself is responsible for the signature change. This opens a new perspective on the signature problem, suggesting that the almost-commutative structure at the heart of the noncommutative standard model of particle physics could be the origin of the emergence of a Lorentzian spectral triple, starting from self-adjoint Dirac operators and conventional inner product structures, within the framework of twisted spectral triples.</description>

      <title>Symplectic (Non-)Invariance of the Free Energy in Topological Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F_g$ be the free energy derived from Topological Recursion for a given spectral curve on a compact Riemann surface, and let $F_g^\vee$ be its $x$-$y$ dual, that is, the free energy derived from the same spectral curve with the roles of $x$ and $y$ interchanged. $F_g$ is sometimes called a symplectic invariant due to its invariance under certain symplectomorphisms of the formal symplectic form $dx\wedge dy$. However, the free energy is not generally invariant under the swap of $x$ and $y$; thus, the difference $F_g - F_g^\vee$ is nonzero.
  We derive a new formula for this difference for all $g\geq 2$ in terms of a residue calculation at the singularities of $x$ and $y$, including cases where $x$ and $y$ have logarithmic singularities. For the derivation, we apply recent developments from $x$-$y$ duality within the theory of (Logarithmic) Topological Recursion. The derived formulas are particularly useful for spectral curves with a trivial $x$-$y$ dual side, meaning those with vanishing $F_g^\vee$. In such cases, one obtains an explicit result for $F_{g\geq 2}$ itself.
  We apply this to several classes of spectral curves and prove, for instance, a recent conjecture by Borot et al. that the free energies $F_g$ computed by Topological Recursion for the "Gaiotto curve" coincide with the perturbative part (in the $\Omega$-background) of the Nekrasov partition function of $\mathcal{N}=2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory. Similar computations also provide $F_g$ for the CDO curve related to Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <title>Controllability and Displacement Analysis of a Three-Link Elastic Microswimmer: A Geometric Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics and controllability of a Purcell three-link microswimmer equipped with passive elastic torsional coils at its joints. By controlling the spontaneous curvature, we analyse the swimmers motion using both linear and weakly nonlinear approaches. Linear analysis reveals steady harmonic solutions for small-amplitude controls but does not predict any net displacement, whereas weakly nonlinear analysis predicts translation along the orientation of the central link. Using geometric control theory, we prove that the system is small time locally controllable near equilibrium and derive displacement estimates for periodic piecewise constant controls, which are validated through numerical simulations. These findings indicate that oscillatory controls can enable motion in all directions near equilibrium. This work offers foundational insights into the controllability of elastic microswimmers, paving the way for advanced motion planning and control strategies.</description>

      <title>Split Two-Periodic Aztec Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have been made to understand the statistics of the Aztec diamond dimer model under general periodic weights. In this work we define a model that breaks periodicity in one direction by combining two different two-periodic weightings. We compute the correlation kernel for this Aztec diamond dimer model by extending the methods developed by Berggren and Duits (2019), which utilize the Eynard-Mehta theorem and a Wiener-Hopf factorization. From a form of the correlation kernel that is suitable for asymptotics, we compute the local asymptotics of the model in the different macroscopic regions present. We prove that the local asymptotics of the model agree with the typical two-periodic model in the highest order, however the sub-leading order terms are affected.</description>

      <title>A Representation Transformation of Parametric Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12427v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A transformation on homogeneous polynomials is proposed, which is further applied to parametric Feynman integrals. The two representations related through this transformation are dual to each other. It naturally leads to dualities of Landau equations and linear integral relations between the two representations. For integrals with momentum-space correspondences, the dual representation is equivalent to the Baikov representation.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Monopoles, (Semi-)Holomorphic Chern-Simons Theories, and Generalized Chiral Potts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relation between spectral data of magnetic monopoles in hyperbolic space and the curve of the spectral parameter of generalized chiral Potts models (gCPM) through the lens of (semi-)holomorphic field theories. We realize the identification of the data on the two sides, which we call the hyperbolic monopole/gCPM correspondence. For the group $\text{SU}(2)$, this correspondence had been observed by Atiyah and Murray in the 80s. Here, we revisit and generalize this correspondence and establish its origin. By invoking the work of Murray and Singer on hyperbolic monopoles, we first generalize the observation of Atiyah and Murray to the group $\text{SU}(n)$. We then propose a technology to engineer gCPM within the 4d Chern-Simons (CS) theory, which explains various features of the model, including the lack of rapidity-difference property of its R-matrix and its peculiarity of having a genus$\,\ge 2$ curve of the spectral parameter. Finally, we investigate the origin of the correspondence. We first clarify how the two sides of the correspondence can be realized from the 6d holomorphic CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(M)$, the projective spinor bundle of the Minkowski space $M=\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, for hyperbolic $\text{SU}(n)$-monopoles, and the Euclidean space $M=\mathbb{R}^4$, for the gCPM. We then establish that $\mathbb{P}S(M)$ can be holomorphically embedded into $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$, the projective spinor bundle of $\mathbb{C}^{1,3}$, of complex dimension five with a fixed complex structure. We finally explain how the 6d CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(M)$ can be realized as the dimensional reduction of the 10d holomorphic CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$. As the latter theory is only sensitive to the complex structure of $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$, which has been fixed, we realize the correspondence as two incarnations of the same physics in ten dimensions.</description>

      <title>Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem via Different Quantum Computing Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the application of emerging photonic and quantum computing architectures to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a well-known NP-hard optimization problem. We investigate several approaches: Simulated Annealing (SA), Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO-Ising) methods implemented on quantum annealers and Optical Coherent Ising Machines, as well as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm on gate-based quantum computers.
  QAOA and QPE were tested on the IBM Quantum platform. The QUBO-Ising method was explored using the D-Wave quantum annealer, which operates on superconducting Josephson junctions, and the QCI Dirac machine, a nonlinear optoelectronic Ising machine. Gate-based quantum computers demonstrated accurate results for small TSP instances in simulation. However, real quantum devices are hindered by noise and limited scalability. Circuit complexity grows with problem size, restricting performance to TSP instances with a maximum of 6 nodes.
  In contrast, Ising-based architectures show improved scalability for larger problem sizes. SQUID-based Ising machines can handle TSP instances with up to 12 nodes, while nonlinear optoelectronic Ising machines extend this capability to 18 nodes. Nevertheless, the solutions tend to be suboptimal due to hardware limitations and challenges in achieving ground state convergence as the problem size increases. Despite these limitations, Ising machines demonstrate significant time advantages over classical methods, making them a promising candidate for solving larger-scale TSPs efficiently.</description>

      <title>Dynamical spectrum of power-free integers in quadratic number fields and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power-free integers and related lattice subsets give rise to interesting dynamical systems. They are revisited from a spectral perspective, in the setting of the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. With respect to the natural patch frequency measure, also known as the Mirsky measure, many of these systems have pure-point dynamical spectrum, but trivial topological point spectrum. We calculate the spectra explicitly, in additive notation, and derive their group structure, both for a large class of $\mathcal{B}$-free lattice systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and for power-free integers in quadratic number fields. Further, in all cases, the eigenfunctions can be given in closed form, via the Fourier--Bohr coefficients on the dense translation orbit of a generic element. Based on a simple argument via Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers, we show that they are also the eigenfunctions for the unique measure of maximal entropy.</description>

      <title>Multiplier modules of Hilbert C*-modules revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of multiplier modules of Hilbert C*-modules is reconsidered to obtain more properties of these special Hilbert C*-modules. The property of a Hilbert C*-module to be a multiplier C*-module is shown to be an invariant with respect to the consideration as a left or right Hilbert C*-module in the sense of a C*-correspondence in strong Morita equivalence theory. The interrelation of the C*-algebras of ''compact'' operators, the Banach algebras of bounded module operators and the Banach spaces of bounded module operators of a Hilbert C*-module to its C*-dual Banach C*-module are characterized for pairs of Hilbert C*-modules and their respective multiplier modules. The structures on the latter are alwas isometricall embedded into the respective structures on the former. Examples for which continuation of these kinds of bounded module operators from the initial Hilbert C*-module to its multiplier module fails are given, however existing continuations turn out to be always unique. Similarly, bounded modular functionals from both kinds of Hilbert C*-modules to their respective C*-algebras of coefficients are compared, and eventually existing continuations are shown to be unique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss variable-sample strategies and consensus- and kinetic-based particle optimization methods for problems where the cost function represents the expected value of a random mapping. Variable-sample strategies replace the expected value by an approximation at each iteration of the optimization algorithm. We introduce a novel variable-sample inspired time-discrete consensus-type algorithm and demonstrate its computational efficiency. Subsequently, we present an alternative time-continuous kinetic-based description of the algorithm, which allows us to exploit tools of kinetic theory to conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Finally, we test the consistency of the proposed modelling approaches through several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Calculus for Finite Parts and Residues of some Divergent Complex Geometric Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider divergent integrals $\int_X \omega$ of certain forms $\omega$ on a reduced pure-dimensional complex space $X$. The forms $\omega$ are singular along a subvariety defined by the zero set of a holomorphic section $s$ of some holomorphic vector bundle $E$. Equipping $E$ with a smooth Hermitian metric allows us to define a finite part $\mathrm{fp}\,\int_X \omega$ of the divergent integral as the action of a certain current extension of $\omega$. We introduce a current calculus to compute finite parts for a special class of $\omega$. Our main result is a formula that decomposes the finite part of such an $\omega$ into sums of products of explicit currents. Lastly, we show that, in principle, it is possible to reduce the computation of $\mathrm{fp}\,\int_X \omega$ for a general $\omega$ to this class.</description>

      <title>Existence and Stability of Ground States for the Defocusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation on Quantum Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and stability of ground states for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on non-compact metric graphs. We establish a sharp criterion for the existence of action ground states, linking it to the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian operator. In particular, we show that ground states exist if and only if the bottom of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is negative and the frequency lies in a suitable range. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between action and energy ground states, proving that while every action minimizer is an energy minimizer, the converse may not hold and the energy minimizer may not exist for all masses. To illustrate this phenomenon, we analyze explicit solutions on star graphs with $\delta$ and $\delta'$-couplings, showing that for mass subcritical exponents of the nonlinearity, there exists a large interval of masses for which no energy ground state exists while in the opposite case, they exist for all masses.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a general quantization procedure for square integrable functions on well-behaved connected exponential Lie groups. The Lie groups in question should admit at least one co-adjoint orbit of maximal possible dimension. The construction is based on composing the Fourier-Wigner transform with another Fourier transform we call the Fourier-Kirillov transform. This quantization has many desirable properties including respecting function translations and inducing a well-behaved Wigner distribution.
  Moreover, we investigate the connection to the operator convolutions of quantum harmonic analysis. This is intricately connected to Weyl quantization in the Weyl-Heisenberg setting. We find that convolution relations in quantum harmonic analysis can be written as group convolutions of Weyl quantizations. This implies that the squared modulus of the wavelet transform of the representation can be written as a convolution between two Wigner distributions. Lastly, we look at how we can extend known results based on Weyl quantization to wider classes of groups using our quantization procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and study a bicategory of super 2-line bundles over graded Lie groupoids, providing a unified framework for geometric models of twistings of (Real) K-theory. The core of our work is to exhibit a wide range of models from the literature as special cases, among them several variants of bundle gerbes (Real/equivariant/Jandl), Freed-Moore's twisted groupoid extensions, Freed-Hopkins-Teleman's K-theory twistings, Moutuou's Real twistings, Freed's invertible algebra bundles, and Distler-Freed-Moore's orientifold twistings.</description>

      <title>An improved upper bound for the Froude number of irrotational solitary water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical and central problem in the theory of water waves is to classify parameter regimes for which nontrivial solitary waves exist. In the two-dimensional, irrotational, pure gravity case, the Froude number $Fr$ (a non-dimensional wave speed) plays the central role. So far, the best analytic result $Fr &lt; \sqrt{2}$ was obtained by Starr (1947), while the numerical evidence of Longuet-Higgins &amp; Fenton (1974) states $Fr \le 1.294$. On the other hand, as shown recently by Kozlov (2023), the upper bound $Fr &lt; 1.399$ is related to the existence of subharmonic bifurcations of Stokes waves. In this paper, we develop a new strategy utilizing the flow force function and rigorously establish the improved upper bound $Fr &lt; 1.37838$.</description>

Abstract: The convergence of scalar-tensor gravity to general relativity, or the departure from it, are described in a new analogy with heat dissipation in a viscous fluid. This new thermal picture is applied to cosmology, shedding light on whether gravity deviates from general relativity early on and approaches it later in the cosmic history.</description>

      <title>A microlocal pathway to spectral asymmetry: curl and the eta invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of eta invariant is traditionally defined by means of analytic continuation. We prove, by examining the particular case of the operator curl, that the eta invariant can equivalently be obtained as the trace of the difference of positive and negative spectral projections, appropriately regularised. Our construction is direct, in the sense that it does not involve analytic continuation, and is based on the use of pseudodifferential techniques. This provides a novel approach to the study of spectral asymmetry of non-semibounded (pseudo)differential systems on manifolds which encompasses and extends previous results.</description>

      <title>Trotter error and gate complexity of the SYK and sparse SYK models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a prominent model of strongly interacting fermions that serves as a toy model of quantum gravity and black hole physics. In this work, we study the Trotter error and gate complexity of the quantum simulation of the SYK model using Lie-Trotter-Suzuki formulas. Building on recent results by Chen and Brandao (arXiv:2111.05324), we derive bounds on the first- and higher-order Trotter error of the SYK model, and subsequently find near-optimal gate complexities for simulating these models using Lie-Trotter-Suzuki formulas. For the $k$-local SYK model on $n$ Majorana fermions, our gate complexity estimates for the first-order Lie-Trotter-Suzuki formula scales with $O(n^{k+\frac{5}{2}}t^2)$ for even $k$ and $O(n^{k+3}t^2)$ for odd $k$, and the gate complexity of simulations using higher-order formulas scales with $O(n^{k+\frac{1}{2}}t)$ for even $k$ and $O(n^{k+1}t)$ for odd $k$. Given that the SYK model has $\Theta(n^k)$ terms, these estimates are close to optimal. These gate complexities can be further improved when simulating the time-evolution of an arbitrary fixed input state $|\psi\rangle$, leading to a $O(n^2)$-reduction in gate complexity for first-order formulas and $O(\sqrt{n})$-reduction for higher-order formulas.
  We also apply our techniques to the sparse SYK model, a simplified variant of the SYK model obtained by deleting all but a $\Theta(n)$ fraction of the terms in a uniformly i.i.d. manner. We compute the average (over the random term removal) gate complexity for simulating this model using higher-order formulas to be $O(n^2 t)$, a bound that also holds for a general class of sparse Gaussian random Hamiltonians. Similar to the full SYK model, we obtain a $O(\sqrt{n})$-reduction simulating the time-evolution of an arbitrary fixed input state $|\psi\rangle$.</description>

      <title>Quadratic solitons in higher-order topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) created in chi(2) nonlinear medium and based on two-dimensional generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide array, where transition between trivial and topological phases is achieved by shift of the four waveguides in the unit cell towards its center or towards its periphery. Such HOTI can support linear topological corner states that give rise to rich families of quadratic topological solitons bifurcating from linear corner states. The presence of phase mismatch between parametrically interacting fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) waves drastically affects the bifurcation scenarios and domains of soliton existence, making the families of corner solitons much richer in comparison with those in HOTIs with cubic nonlinearity. For instance, the internal soliton structure strongly depends on the location of propagation constant in forbidden gaps in spectra of both FF and SH waves. Two different types of corner solitons are obtained, where either FF or SH wave dominates in the bifurcation point from linear corner state. Because the waveguides are two-mode for SH wave, its spectrum features two groups of forbidden gaps with corner states of different symmetry appearing in each of them. Such corner states give rise to different families of corner solitons. Stability analysis shows that corner solitons in quadratic HOTI may feature wide stability domains and therefore are observable experimentally. These results illustrate how parametric nonlinear interactions enrich the behavior of topological excitations and allow to control their shapes.</description>

Abstract: The Lie algebra of symmetries generated by the left-moving current $j=\partial_-\phi$ in the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory is infinite dimensional, exhibiting mutually commuting subalgebras. The infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras define integrable deformations of the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory which preserve the Poisson bracket structure. We study these mutually commuting subalgebras, finding general properties that the generators of such a subalgebra must satisfy. In so doing, we find constraints on all possible integrable equations of the Korteweg-de Vries type.</description>

      <title>Blobbed topological recursion from extended loop equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $N\times N$ Hermitian matrix model with measure $d\mu_{E,\lambda}(M)=\frac{1}{Z} \exp(-\frac{\lambda N}{4} \mathrm{tr}(M^4)) d\mu_{E,0}(M)$, where $d\mu_{E,0}$ is the Gaussian measure with covariance $\langle M_{kl}M_{mn}\rangle=\frac{\delta_{kn}\delta_{lm}}{N(E_k+E_l)}$ for given $E_1,...,E_N&gt;0$. It was previously understood that this setting gives rise to two ramified coverings $x,y$ of the Riemann sphere strongly tied by $y(z)=-x(-z)$ and a family $\omega^{(g)}_{n}$ of meromorphic differentials conjectured to obey blobbed topological recursion due to Borot and Shadrin. We develop a new approach to this problem via a system of six meromorphic functions which satisfy extended loop equations. Two of these functions are symmetric in the preimages of $x$ and can be determined from their consistency relations. An expansion at $\infty$ gives global linear and quadratic loop equations for the $\omega^{(g)}_{n}$. These global equations provide the $\omega^{(g)}_{n}$ not only in the vicinity of the ramification points of $x$ but also in the vicinity of all other poles located at opposite diagonals $z_i+z_j=0$ and at $z_i=0$. We deduce a recursion kernel representation valid at least for $g\leq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a connection between twisted spectral triples and pseudo-Riemannian spectral triples, rooted in the fundamental interplay between twists and Krein products. A concept of morphism of spectral triples is introduced, transforming one spectral triple into its dual. In the case of even-dimensional manifolds, we demonstrate how this construction implements a local signature change via the parity operator induced by the twist. Consequently, the signature change transformation is governed solely by the unitary operator that implements the twist. This unitary is a central element of our approach, as it is directly linked to the Krein product, the twist, and the parity operator that implement the signature change.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Construction of Equilibrium States for Interacting Fermionic Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to extend to interacting massive and massless fermionic theories the recent perturbative construction of equilibrium states developed within the framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory on Lorentzian spacetime. We analyze the case of interactions which depend on time by a smooth switch-on function and on space by a suitably bounded function that multiplies an interaction Lagrangian density constructed with the field of the theory. The construction is achieved by first considering the case of compact support and, in a second step, by removing the space cutoff with a suitable limit (adiabatic limit). As an application, we consider a Dirac field interacting with a classical stationary background electromagnetic potential, and we compute at first perturbative order (linear response) the expectation value of the conserved current on the equilibrium state for the interacting theory. The resulting expectation value is written as a convolution, in the space coordinates, between the electromagnetic potential and an integral kernel which, at vanishing conjugate momentum, gives the inverse of the square Debye screening length at finite temperature. The corresponding Debye screening effect is visible in the backreaction treated semiclassically of this current on the classical background electromagnetic potential sourced by a classical external current.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06276v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The past decades have seen substantial interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, driven largely by its diverse range of applications. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with decomposing the angular momentum of massless particles, such as photons, into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While the angular momentum of massive particles has a natural splitting into the Wigner SAM and OAM, there are numerous proposed splittings for photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here, we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, such as photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. We prove two further generalizations of this result, showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator generates non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-SO(3) symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grobe--Eberly doublet phenomenon occurs in photoelectron distributions when a field dresses the remaining ion. Its manifestation is due to entanglement between a free electron and a hybrid state of light and matter. Direct detection of such entanglement is however not possible by coincidence schemes due to the dressing mechanism having an inconspicuous phase correlation effect on the ion. Here, it is shown that odd envelopes fundamentally alter the entanglement, such that channel-resolved photoelectron distributions become identifiable in coincidence with the internal state of the field-free ion. This constitutes a first usage of the parity of time symmetry in strong-field interactions.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of $q$-hypergeometric equations describing the quantum difference equation for the cotangent bundles over projective spaces $X=T^{*}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ . We show that over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ these equations are equipped with the Frobenius action $(q,z)\to (q^p,z^p)$. We obtain an explicit formula for the constant term of the Frobenius intertwiner in terms of the $p$-adic $q$-gamma function of Koblitz. In the limit $q\to 1$ we arrive at the Frobenius structures for the $p$-adic hypergeometric and Bessel differential equations studied by Dwork. In particular, we find closed formulas for $p$-adic constants appearing in works of Dwork and Sperber in terms of $p$-adic zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Embedding formalism for AdS superspaces in five dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard geometric description of $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space is a quadric in ${\mathbb R}^{d-1,2}$ defined by $(X^0)^2 - (X^1)^2 - \dots - (X^{d-1})^2 + (X^d)^2 = \ell^2 = \text{const}$. In this paper we provide a supersymmetric generalisation of this embedding construction in the $d=5$ case. Specifically, a bi-supertwistor realisation is given for the ${\cal N}$-extended AdS superspace $\text{AdS}^{5|8\cal N}$, with ${\cal N}\geq 1$. The proposed formalism offers a simple construction of AdS super-invariants. As an example, we present a new model for a massive superparticle in $\text{AdS}^{5|8\cal N}$ which is manifestly invariant under the AdS isometry supergroup $\mathsf{SU}(2,2|{\cal N})$ and involves two independent two-derivative terms.</description>

      <title>Dirac Equation with Space Contributions Embedded in a Quantum-Corrected Gravitational Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirac equation is considered with the recently proposed generalized gravitational interaction (Kepler or Coulomb), which includes post-Newtonian (relativistic) and quantum corrections to the classical potential. The general idea in choosing the metric is that the spacetime contributions are contained in an external potential or in an electromagnetic potential which can be considered as a good basis for future studies of quantum physics in space. The forms considered for the scalar potential and the so-called vector (magnetic) potential, can be viewed as the multipole expansion of these terms and therefore the approach includes a simultaneous study of multipole expansions to both fields. We also discuss several known generalizations of the Coulomb potential within this formulation in terms of certain Heun functions. The impossibility of solving our equation for the quantum-corrected Coulomb terms using known exact or quasi-exact nonperturbative analytical techniques is discussed, and finally the Bethe-ansatz approach is proposed to overcome this challenging problem.</description>

      <title>Kinetic dynamics of neutral spin particles in a spacetime with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A kinetic model for the dynamics of collisionless spin neutral particles in a spacetime with torsion is proposed. The fundamental matter field is the kinetic density $f(x,u,s)$ of particles with four-velocity $u$ and four-spin $s$. The stress-energy tensor and the spin current of the particles distribution are defined as suitable integral moments of $f$ in the $(u,s)$ variables. By requiring compatibility with the contracted Bianchi identity in Einstein-Cartan theory, we derive a transport equation on the kinetic density $f$ that generalizes the well-known Vlasov equation for spinless particles. The total number of particles in the new model is not conserved. To restore this important property we assume the existence in spacetime of a second species of particles with the same mass and spin magnitude. The Vlasov equation on the kinetic density $\overline{f}$ of the new particles is derived by requiring that the sum of total numbers of particles of the two species should be conserved.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Bohmian Mechanics fails to compute multi-time correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The violation of Bell type inequalities in quantum systems manifests that quantum states cannot be described by classical probability distributions. Yet, Bohmian mechanics is a realistic, non-local theory of classical particle trajectories that is claimed to be indistinguishable by observations from more traditional approaches to quantum mechanics. We set up a spatial version of the GHZ system with qubits realised as positional observables that demonstrates that the Bohmian theory fails to match predictions of textbook quantum mechanics (and most likely experients) unless enlarged by a microscopic theory of collapse of the wave function after observation. For this discrepancy to occur it is essential that positions at different times do not commute.</description>
