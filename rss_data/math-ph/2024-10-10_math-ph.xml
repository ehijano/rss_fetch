      <title>Graded Poisson and Graded Dirac structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been several attempts in recent years to extend the notions of symplectic and Poisson structures in order to create a suitable geometrical framework for classical field theories, trying to achieve a success similar to the use of these concepts in Hamiltonian mechanics. These notions always have a graded character, since the multisymplectic forms are of a higher degree than two. Another line of work has been to extend the concept of Dirac structures to these new scenarios. In the present paper we review all these notions, relate them and propose and study a generalization that (under some mild regularity conditions) includes them and is of graded nature. We expect this generalization to allow us to advance in the study of classical field theories, their integrability, reduction, numerical approximations and even their quantization.</description>

      <title>On the extension of singular linear infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Hamiltonian flows in a real separable Hilbert space endowed with a symplectic structure. Measures on the Hilbert space that are invariant with respect to the flows of completely integrable Hamiltonian systems are investigated. These construction gives the opportunity to describe Hamiltonian flows in the phase space by means of unitary groups in the space of functions that are quadratically integrable by the invariant measure. Invariant measures are applied to the study of model linear Hamiltonian systems that admit features of the type of unlimited increase in kinetic energy over a finite time. Due to this approach solutions of Hamilton equations that admit singularities can be described by means of the phase flow in the extended phase space and by the corresponding Koopman representation of the unitary</description>

      <title>A two-boson lattice Hamiltonian with interactions up to next-neighboring sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of two identical spinless bosons on the two-dimensional lattice is considered under the assumption that on-site and first and second nearest-neighboring site interactions between the bosons are only nontrivial and that these interactions are of magnitudes $\gamma$, $\lambda$, and $\mu$, respectively. A partition of the $(\gamma,\lambda,\mu)$-space into connected components is established such that, in each connected component, the two-boson Schroedinger operator corresponding to the zero quasi-momentum of the center of mass has a definite (fixed) number of eigenvalues, which are situated below the bottom of the essential (continuous) spectrum and above its top. Moreover, for each connected component, a sharp lower bound is established on the number of isolated eigenvalues for the two-boson Schr\"odinger operator corresponding to any admissible nonzero value of the center-of-mass quasimomentum.</description>

      <title>Computing ground states of Bose-Einstein condensation by normalized deep neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a normalized deep neural network (norm-DNN) for computing ground states of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) via the minimization of the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional under unitary mass normalization. Compared with the traditional deep neural network for solving partial differential equations, two additional layers are added in training our norm-DNN for solving this kind of unitary constraint minimization problems: (i) a normalization layer is introduced to enforce the unitary mass normalization, and (ii) a shift layer is added to guide the training to non-negative ground state. The proposed norm-DNN gives rise to an efficient unsupervised approach for learning ground states of BEC. Systematical investigations are first carried out through extensive numerical experiments for computing ground states of BEC in one dimension. Extensions to high dimensions and multi-component are then studied in details. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of norm-DNN for learning ground states of BEC. Finally, we extend the norm-DNN for computing the first excited states of BEC and discuss parameter generalization issues as well as compare with some existing machine learning methods for computing ground states of BEC in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian Dysthe equation for hydroelastic waves in a compressed ice sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear hydroelastic waves along a compressed ice sheet lying on top of a two-dimensional fluid of infinite depth are investigated. Based on a Hamiltonian formulation of this problem and by applying techniques from Hamiltonian perturbation theory, a Hamiltonian Dysthe equation is derived for the slowly varying envelope of modulated wavetrains. This derivation is further complicated here by the presence of cubic resonances for which a detailed analysis is given. A Birkhoff normal form transformation is introduced to eliminate non-resonant triads while accommodating resonant ones. It also provides a non-perturbative scheme to reconstruct the ice-sheet deformation from the wave envelope. Linear predictions on the modulational instability of Stokes waves in sea ice are established, and implications for the existence of solitary wavepackets are discussed for a range of values of ice compression relative to ice bending. This Dysthe equation is solved numerically to test these predictions. Its numerical solutions are compared to direct simulations of the full Euler system, and very good agreement is observed.</description>

      <title>Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. The volume of this separable ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the separable ball proposed in previous works, due to the large hierarchy of eigenvalues occurring in typical states. We further refine this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula, generalize it to characterize the separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criterion will help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability. We apply the procedure for separability detection on three-qubit X state in a dephasing environment, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</description>

      <title>On the local convergence of integer-valued Lipschitz functions on regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study random integer-valued Lipschitz functions on regular trees. It was shown by Peled, Samotij and Yehudayoff that such functions are localized, however, finer questions about the structure of Gibbs measures remain unanswered. Our main result is that the weak limit of a uniformly chosen 1-Lipschitz function with 0 boundary condition on a $d$-ary tree of height $n$ exists as $n \to \infty$ if $2 \le d \le 7$, but not if $d \ge 8$, thereby partially answering a question posed by Peled, Samotij and Yehudayoff. For large $d$, the value at the root alternates between being almost entirely concentrated on 0 for even $n$ and being roughly uniform on $\{-1,0,1\}$ for odd $n$, leading to different limits as $n$ approaches infinity along evens or odds. For $d \ge 8$, the essence of this phenomenon is preserved, which obstructs the convergence. For $d \le 7$, this phenomenon ceases to exist, and the law of the value at the root loses its connection with the parity of $n$. Along the way, we also obtain an alternative proof of localization. The key idea is a fixed point convergence result for a related operator on $\ell^\infty$, and a procedure to show that the iterations get into a `basin of attraction' of the fixed point. We also prove some accompanying analogous `even-odd phenomenon' type results about $M$-lipschitz functions on general non-amenable graphs with high enough expansion (this includes for example the large $d$ case for regular trees). We also prove a convergence result for 1-Lipschitz functions with $\{0,1\}$ boundary condition. This last result relies on an absolute value FKG for uniform 1-Lipschitz functions when shifted by $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic safe nonassociative quantum gravity with star R-flux products, Goroff-Sagnotti counter-terms, and geometric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonassociative modifications of general relativity, GR, defined by star products with R-flux deformations in string gravity consist of an important subclass of modified gravity theories, MGTs. A longstanding criticism for elaborating quantum gravity, QG, argue that the asymptotic safety does not survive once certain perturbative terms (in general, nonassociative and noncommutative) are included in the projection space. The goal of this work is to prove that a generalized asymptotic safety scenario allows us to formulate physically viable nonassociative QG theories using effective models defined by generic off-diagonal solutions and nonlinear symmetries in nonassociative geometric flow and gravity theories. We elaborate on a new nonholonomic functional renormalization techniques with parametric renormalization group, RG, flow equations for effective actions supplemented by certain canonical two-loop counter-terms. The geometric constructions and quantum deformations are performed for nonassociative phase spaces modelled as R-flux deformed cotangent Lorentz bundles. Our results prove that theories involving nonassociative modifications of GR can be well defined both as classical nonassociative MGTs and QG models. Such theories are characterized by generalized G. Perelman thermodynamic variables which are computed for certain examples of nonassociative geometric and RG flows.</description>

      <title>Modelling Signals as Mild Distributions</title>

Abstract: This note gives a summary of ideas concerning Applied Fourier Analysis, mostly formulated for those who have to give such courses to engineers or mathematicians interested in real life applications. It tries to answer recurrent questions arising regularly after my talks on the subject. It outlines alternative ways of presenting the core material of Fourier Analysis in a way which is supposed to help students to grasp the relevance of this transform in the context of applications. Essentially we consider functions in $S_0(R^d)$ (known as Feichtinger's algebra) as possible measurements, and the elements of the dual space (which can be also described by various completion procedures) is thus the collection of all "things" (in the spirit of signals) which can be measured in a reasonable way. We call them mild distributions. In other words, we want to base signal analysis on the mathematical theory of mild distributions. They do not need to be defined in a pointwise sense. Dirac's Delta or Dirac combs are natural examples. The are "as real as point masses in physics". Various equivalent approaches (including a sequential approach) help to verify the relevant results. The material is based on the experiences gained by the author in the last 30 years by teaching the subject in an abstract or application oriented manner, at different universities, and to audiences with quite different background.

      <title>Quantum kinetic theory of photons in degenerate plasmas: a field-theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, many practical results are often derived using classical or semiclassical approximations, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing novel couplings absent in classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both the kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity field, which are important in degenerate conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reminiscent of physical phase transitions separatrices divide the phase space of dynamical systems with multiple equilibria into regions of distinct flow behavior and asymptotics. We introduce complex time in order to study corresponding Riemann surface solutions of holomorphic and meromorphic flows, explicitly solve their sensitivity differential equation and identify a related Hamiltonian structure and an associated geometry in order to study separatrix properties. As an application we analyze complex-time Newton flow of Riemann's $\xi$-function on the basis of a compactly convergent polynomial approximation of its Riemann surface solution defined as zero set of polynomials, e.g. algebraic curves over $\mathbb{C}$ (in the complex projective plane respectively), that is closely related to a complex-valued Hamiltonian system. Its geometric properties might contain information on the global separatrix structure and the root location of $\xi$ and $\xi'$.</description>

      <title>Balancing chemical equations: form the perspective of Hilbert basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The balancing of chemical equations is a basic problem in chemistry. A commonly employed method is to convert the task to a linear algebra problem, and then solve the null space of the constructed formula matrix. However, in this method, the directly obtained solution may be invalid, and there is no canonical choice of independent basis reactions. Here, we show that these drawbacks originate from the fact that the fundamental structure of solutions here is not a linear space but a positive affine monoid. This new understanding enables a systematic approach and a complete description of all possible reactions by a unique set of independent elementary reactions, called Hilbert-basis reactions. By clarifying its underlying mathematical structure, our work offers a new perspective on this old problem of balancing chemical equations.</description>

      <title>Stability of diverse dodecagonal quasicrystals in T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06048v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are intriguing ordered structures characterized by the lack of translational symmetry and the existence of rotational symmetry. The tiling of different geometric units such as triangles and squares in two-dimensional space can result in a great variety of quasicrystals that could be realized by the self-assembly of liquid crystalline molecules. In this study, we introduce three self-similar dodecagonal tilings, including a novel Diamond-Square-Triangle pattern, composed of triangular and quadrangular tiles and examine their thermodynamic stability by using the self-consistent field theory applied to T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules. Specifically, we detail the inflation rules for the construction of these dodecagonal tilings and analyze their self-similarity, and show that these tilings can be viewed as projections of higher-dimensional periodic lattice points with projection windows. Using these dodecagonal tilings as initial configurations of the SCFT results in solutions corresponding to quasicrystals that could form from the T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules. The relative stability of these aperiodic phases is analyzed to obtain design rules that could stabilize quasicrystals. Meanwhile, we provide two criteria for distinguishing three dodecagonal quasicrystals and their approximants by analyzing their diffraction peaks. These findings shed new lighten on the discovery of new quasicrystals in soft materials.</description>

      <title>Modular Properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the modular properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles (GGEs) in two dimensional conformal field theories. These are obtained by inserting higher spin charges in the expressions for the partition function of the theory. We investigate the particular case where KdV charges are inserted in the GGE. We first determine an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE. This expression is an expansion in terms of the zero modes of all the quasi-primary fields in the theory, not just the KdV charges. While these charges are non-commuting they can be re-exponentiated to give an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE in terms of another GGE. As an explicit example we focus on the Lee-Yang model. We use the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz in the Lee-Yang model to first replicate the asymptotic results, and then find additional energies that need to be included in the transformed GGE in order to find the exact modular transformation.</description>

      <title>Recovery of piecewise smooth parameters in an acoustic-gravitational system of equations from exterior Cauchy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an inverse problem for an acoustic-gravitational system whose principal symbol is identical to that of an acoustic wave operator. The displacement vector of a gas or liquid between the unperturbed and perturbed flow is denoted by $u(t,x)$. It satisfies a partial differential equation (PDE) system with a principal symbol corresponding to an acoustic wave operator, but with additional terms to account for a global gravitational field and self-gravitation. These factors make the operator nonlocal, as it depends on the wave speed and density of mass. We assume that all parameters are piecewise smooth in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (i.e., smooth everywhere except for jump discontinuities across closed hypersurfaces called interfaces) but unknown inside a bounded domain $\Omega$. We are given the solution operator for this acoustic-gravitational system, but only outside $\Omega$ and only for initial data supported outside $\Omega$. Using high-frequency waves, we prove that the piecewise smooth wave speed and density are uniquely determined by this map under certain geometric conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two results on geometric consequences of the representation of restricted holonomy group of a Hermitian connection. The first result concerns when such a Hermitian manifold is K\"ahler in terms of the torsion and the irreducibility of the holonomy action. As a consequence we obtain a criterion of when a Hermitian manifold (and connection) is a generalized Calabi-Yau (in the sense that the Chern Ricci vanishes or equivalently that the restricted holonomy is inside $\mathsf{SU}(m)$). The second result concerns when a compact K\"ahler manifold with a generic restricted holonomy group is projective.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics and the sub-limit at $L^{2}$-criticality of higher moments for the SHE in dimension $d\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the $d$-dimensional mollified stochastic heat equation (SHE) when the mollification parameter is turned off. Here, we concentrate on the high-dimensional case $d \geq 3$. Recently, the limiting higher moments of the two-dimensional mollified SHE have been established. However, this problem in high dimensions remains unexplored to date. The main theorems of this article aim to answer this question and prove some related properties: (1) Our first main result, based on the spectral theorem for the unbounded operator, proves the divergence of the higher moments of the high-dimensional mollified SHE even when the system is strictly inside the $L^{2}$-regime. This phenomenon is completely opposite to its two-dimensional counterpart; (2) To further differentiate the nature of the high-dimensional case from the case in two dimensions, our second main result proves the unboundedness of the sub-limiting higher moments of the three-dimensional mollified SHE at the $L^{2}$-criticality. Here, the sub-limiting higher moment is a natural limit of the higher moment of the three-dimensional mollified SHE at the $L^{2}$-criticality; (3) As an application, we provide partial results for the conjecture about the high-order critical regimes of the continuous directed polymer. The other byproduct of the above results gives a proper estimate for the critical exponent of the polymer in the $L^{2}$-regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a double shifted power analog of free fermion fields to introduce current operators, Hamiltonians, and vertex operators which are deformed by two families of parameters and satisfy analogous formulas to the classical case. We show that the deformed half vertex operators correspond to the row transfer matrices of a solvable six vertex model recently given by Naprienko [arXiv:2301.12110], which under a specialization yields the factorial Schur functions (up to a reindexing of parameters). As a consequence, we show that under the boson-fermion correspondence using our deformed half vertex operators, the natural basis (under this specialization) maps to the factorial Schur functions. Furthermore, the image of the natural basis vectors are tau function solutions to the 2D Toda lattice.</description>

      <title>Oppenheimer-Snyder type collapse for a collisionless gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1939, Oppenheimer and Snyder showed that the continued gravitational collapse of a self-gravitating matter distribution can result in the formation of a black hole, cf.~ \cite{OS}. In this paper, which has greatly influenced the evolution of ideas around the concept of a black hole, matter was modeled as dust, a fluid with pressure equal to zero. We prove that when the corresponding initial data are suitably approximated by data for a collisionless gas as modeled by the Vlasov equation, then a trapped surface forms before the corresponding solution to the Einstein-Vlasov system can develop a singularity and again a black hole arises. As opposed to the dust case the pressure does not vanish for such solutions. As a necessary starting point for the analysis, which is carried out in Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand coordinates, we prove a local existence and uniqueness theorem for regular solutions together with a corresponding extension criterion. The latter result will also become useful when one perturbs dust solutions containing naked singularities in the Vlasov framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory, Gravity and Second order Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that a consistent coupling of a quantum theory to gravity requires an extension of ordinary `first order' Riemannian geometry to second order Riemannian geometry, which incorporates both a line element and an area element. This extension results in a misalignment between the dimension of the manifold and the dimension of the tangent spaces. In particular, we find that for a 4-dimensional spacetime, tangent spaces become 18-dimensional. We then discuss the construction of physical theories within this framework, which involves the introduction of terms that are quadratic in derivatives in the action. On a flat spacetime, the quadratic sector is perpendicular to the first order sector and only affects the normalization of the path integral, whereas in a curved spacetime the quadratic sector couples to the first order sector. Moreover, we show that, despite the introduction of higher order derivatives, the Ostragradski instability can be avoided, due to an order mixing of the two sectors. Finally, we comment on extensions to higher order geometry and on relations with non-commutative and generalized geometry.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of fluctuations of discretized SHE and KPZ equations in the subcritical weak disorder regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of discretized versions of the stochastic heat equation (SHE) and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in spatial dimensions $d&gt;2$ in the weak disorder regime. The discretization is defined using the directed polymer model. Previous research has identified the scaling limit of both equations under a suboptimal moment condition and, in particular, it was established that both converge to the same limit in law. We extend this result by showing that the fluctuations of both equations are close in probability in the subcritical weak disorder regime, indicating that they share the same scaling limit (the existence of which remains open). Our result applies under a moment condition that is expected to be valid throughout the interior of the weak disorder phase, which is currently only known under a technical assumption on the environment. We also prove a lower tail concentration of the partition functions.</description>

      <title>Cusp Universality for Correlated Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For correlated real symmetric or complex Hermitian random matrices, we prove that the local eigenvalue statistics at any cusp singularity are universal. Since the density of states typically exhibits only square root edge or cubic root cusp singularities, our result completes the proof of the Wigner-Dyson-Mehta universality conjecture in all spectral regimes for a very general class of random matrices. Previously only the bulk and the edge universality were established in this generality [arXiv:1804.07744], while cusp universality was proven only for Wigner-type matrices with independent entries [arXiv:1809.03971, arXiv:1811.04055]. As our main technical input, we prove an optimal local law at the cusp using the Zigzag strategy, a recursive tandem of the characteristic flow method and a Green function comparison argument. Moreover, our proof of the optimal local law holds uniformly in the spectrum, thus also re-establishing universality of the local eigenvalue statistics in the previously studied bulk [arXiv:1705.10661] and edge [arXiv:1804.07744] regimes.</description>

      <title>Gaussian to log-normal transition for independent sets in a percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent sets in graphs, i.e., subsets of vertices where no two are adjacent, have long been studied, for instance as a model of hard-core gas. The $d$-dimensional hypercube, $\{0,1\}^d$, with the nearest neighbor structure, has been a particularly appealing choice for the base graph, owing in part to its many symmetries. Results go back to the work of Korshunov and Sapozhenko who proved sharp results on the count of such sets as well as structure theorems for random samples drawn uniformly. Of much interest is the behavior of such Gibbs measures in the presence of disorder. In this direction, Kronenberg and Spinka [KS] initiated the study of independent sets in a random subgraph of the hypercube obtained by considering an instance of bond percolation with probability $p$. Relying on tools from statistical mechanics they obtained a detailed understanding of the moments of the partition function, say $\mathcal{Z}$, of the hard-core model on such random graphs and consequently deduced certain fluctuation information, as well as posed a series of interesting questions. In particular, they showed in the uniform case that there is a natural phase transition at $p=2/3$ where $\mathcal{Z}$ transitions from being concentrated for $p&gt;2/3$ to not concentrated at $p=2/3$.
  In this article, developing a probabilistic framework, as well as relying on certain cluster expansion inputs from [KS], we present a detailed picture of both the fluctuations of $\mathcal{Z}$ as well as the geometry of a randomly sampled independent set. In particular, we establish that $\mathcal{Z}$, properly centered and scaled, converges to a standard Gaussian for $p&gt;2/3$, and to a sum of two i.i.d. log-normals at $p=2/3$. A particular step in the proof which could be of independent interest involves a non-uniform birthday problem for which collisions emerge at $p=2/3$.</description>

Abstract: Given an autonomous second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE), we define a Riemannian metric on an open subset of the first-order jet bundle. A relationship is established between the solutions of the ODE and the geodesic curves with respect to the defined metric. We introduce the notion of energy foliation for autonomous ODEs, and highlight its connection to the classical energy concept. Additionally, we explore the geometry of the leaves of the foliation. Finally, the results are applied to the analysis of Lagrangian mechanical systems. In particular, we provide an autonomous Lagrangian for the damped harmonic oscillator.</description>

Abstract: We prove that all nice holomorphic vertex operator superalgebras (VOSAs) with central charge at most 24 and with non-trivial odd part are unitary, apart from the hypothetical ones arising as fake copies of the shorter moonshine VOSA or of the latter tensorized with a real free fermion VOSA. Furthermore, excluding the ones with central charge 24 of glueing type III and with no real free fermion, we show that they are all strongly graded-local. In particular, they naturally give rise to holomorphic graded-local conformal nets. In total, we are able to prove that 910 of the 969 nice holomorphic VOSAs with central charge 24 and with non-trivial odd part are strongly graded-local, without counting hypothetical fake copies of the shorter moonshine VOSA tensorized with a real free fermion VOSA.</description>

Abstract: Using the relation between four manifolds and topological modular form (TMF) from the six dimensional approach, we exhibit fiber sum formulas for infinite families of smooth spin four manifolds associated to compactifications of free and interacting 6d (1,0) SCFTs. We find that even the free theories have nontrivial fiber sum formulas and their forms are sensitive to an individual theory and parameters of four-manifolds. Furthermore, we reinforce the conjecture of Stolz and Teichner by expanding its evidence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the Steklov problem for the modified Helmholtz equation $(p-\Delta) u = 0$ in the exterior of a compact set, for which the positive parameter $p$ ensures exponential decay of the Steklov eigenfunctions at infinity. We obtain the small-$p$ asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and discuss their features for different space dimensions. These results find immediate applications to the theory of stochastic processes and unveil the long-time asymptotic behavior of probability densities of various first-passage times in exterior domains. Theoretical results are validated by solving the exterior Steklov problem by a finite-element method with a transparent boundary condition.</description>

      <title>On the long-time statistical behavior of smooth solutions of the weakly damped, stochastically-driven KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.12942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the damped periodic Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in the presence of a white-in-time and spatially smooth stochastic source term and studies the long-time behavior of solutions. We show that the integrals of motion for KdV can be exploited to prove regularity and ergodic properties of invariant measures for damped stochastic KdV. First, by considering non-trivial modifications of the integrals of motion, we establish Lyapunov structure by proving that moments of Sobolev norms of solutions at all orders of regularity are bounded globally-in-time; existence of invariant measures follows as an immediate consequence. Next, we prove a weak Foias-Prodi type estimate for damped stochastic KdV, for which the synchronization occurs in expected value. This estimate plays a crucial role throughout our subsequent analysis. As a first novel application, we combine the Foias-Prodi estimate with the Lyapunov structure to establish that invariant measures are supported on smooth functions provided that the external driving forces are smooth. We then establish ergodic properties of invariant measures, treating the regimes of arbitrary damping and large damping separately. For arbitrary damping, we demonstrate that the framework of `asymptotic coupling' can be implemented for a compact proof of uniqueness of the invariant measure provided that sufficiently many directions in phase space are stochastically forced. Our proof is paradigmatic for SPDEs for which a weak Foias-Prodi type property holds. Lastly, for large damping, we establish the existence of a spectral gap with respect to a Wasserstein-like distance, and exponential mixing and uniqueness of the invariant measure follows.</description>

Abstract: While volume violation of area law has been exhibited in several quantum spin chains, the construction of a corresponding ground state in higher dimensions, entangled in more than one direction, has been an open problem. Here we construct a 2D frustration-free Hamiltonian with maximal violation of the area law. We do so by building a quantum model of random surfaces with color degree of freedom that can be viewed as a collection of colored Dyck paths. The Hamiltonian may be viewed as a 2D generalization of the Fredkin spin chain. It relates all the colored random surface configurations subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition and hard wall constraint from below to one another, and the ground state is therefore a superposition of all such classical states and non-degenerate. Its entanglement entropy between subsystems undergoes a quantum phase transition as the deformation parameter is tuned. The area- and volume-law phases are similar to the one-dimensional model, while the critical point scales with the linear size of the system $L$ as $L\log L$. Further it is conjectured that similar models with entanglement phase transitions can be built in higher dimensions with even softer area law violations at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Extending the planar theory of anyons to quantum wire networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The braiding of the worldlines of particles restricted to move on a network (graph) is governed by the graph braid group, which can be strikingly different from the standard braid group known from two-dimensional physics. It has been recently shown that imposing the compatibility of graph braiding with anyon fusion for anyons exchanging at a single wire junction leads to new types of anyon models with the braiding exchange operators stemming from solutions of certain generalised hexagon equations. In this work, we establish these graph-braided anyon fusion models for general wire networks. We show that the character of braiding strongly depends on the graph-theoretic connectivity of the given network. In particular, we prove that triconnected networks yield the same braiding exchange operators as the planar anyon models. In contrast, modular biconnected networks support independent braiding exchange operators in different modules. Consequently, such modular networks may lead to more efficient topological quantum computer circuits. Finally, we conjecture that the graph-braided anyon fusion models will possess the (generalised) coherence property where certain polygon equations determine the braiding exchange operators for an arbitrary number of anyons. We also extensively study solutions to these polygon equations for chosen low-rank multiplicity-free fusion rings, including the Ising theory, quantum double of Z2, and Tambara-Yamagami models. We find numerous solutions that do not appear in the planar theory of anyons.</description>

      <title>Every real-rooted exponential polynomial is the restriction of a Lee-Yang polynomial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Lee-Yang polynomial $ p(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n}) $ is a polynomial that has no zeros in the polydisc $ \mathbb{D}^{n} $ and its inverse $ (\mathbb{C}\setminus\overline{\mathbb{D}})^{n} $. We show that any real-rooted exponential polynomial of the form $f(x) = \sum_{j=0}^s c_j e^{\lambda_j x}$ can be written as the restriction of a Lee-Yang polynomial to a positive line in the torus. Together with previous work by Olevskii and Ulanovskii, this implies that the Kurasov-Sarnak construction of $ \mathbb{N} $-valued Fourier quasicrystals from stable polynomials comprises every possible $ \mathbb{N} $-valued Fourier quasicrystal.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum complexity of bosonic oscillator systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the pioneering work of Nielsen and collaborators, the length of the minimal geodesic in a geometric realization of a suitable operator space provides a measure of the quantum complexity of an operation. Compared with the original concept of complexity based on the minimal number of gates required to construct the desired operation as a product, this geometrical approach amounts to a more concrete and computable definition, but its evaluation is nontrivial in systems with a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The geometrical formulation can more easily be evaluated by considering the geometry associated with a suitable finite-dimensional group generated by a small number of relevant operators of the system. In this way, the method has been applied in particular to the harmonic oscillator, which is also of interest in the present paper. However, subtle and previously unrecognized issues of group theory can lead to unforeseen complications, motivating a new formulation that remains on the level of the underlying Lie algebras for most of the required steps. Novel insights about complexity can thereby be found in a low-dimensional setting, with the potential of systematic extensions to higher dimensions as well as interactions. Specific examples include the quantum complexity of various target unitary operators associated with a harmonic oscillator, inverted harmonic oscillator, and coupled harmonic oscillators. The generality of this approach is demonstrated by an application to an anharmonic oscillator with a cubic term.</description>

      <title>Effects of Chromatic Dispersion on Single-Photon Temporal Wave Functions in Quantum Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effects of chromatic dispersion on single-photon temporal wave functions (TWFs) in the context of quantum communications. Departing from classical beam analysis, we focus on the temporal shape of single photons, specifically exploring generalized Gaussian modes. From this foundation, we introduce chirped and unchirped Gaussian TWFs, demonstrating the impact of the chirp parameter in mitigating chromatic dispersion effects. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to time-bin qubits, a topic of ongoing research relevance. By exploring the interplay of dispersion effects on qubit interference patterns, we contribute essential insights to quantum information processing. This comprehensive analysis considers various parameters, introducing a level of complexity not previously explored in the context of dispersion management. We demonstrate the relationships between different quantities and their impact on the spreading of TWFs. Our results not only deepen the theoretical understanding of single-photon TWFs but also offer practical guidelines for system designers to optimize symbol rates in quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Fate of $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time in non-relativistic (Galilean) and ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05769v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we present an algebraic and kinematical analysis of non-commutative $\kappa$-Minkowski spaces within Galilean (non-relativistic) and Carrollian (ultra-relativistic) regimes. Utilizing the theory of Wigner-In\"{o}nu contractions, we begin with a brief review of how one can apply these contractions to the well-known Poincar\'e algebra, yielding the corresponding Galilean (both massive and mass-less) and Carrollian algebras as $c \to \infty$ and $c\to 0$, respectively. Subsequently, we methodically apply these contractions to non-commutative $\kappa$-deformed spaces, revealing compelling insights into the interplay among the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$ (with $|a^\nu|$ being of the order of Planck length scale) and the speed of light $c$ as it approaches both infinity and zero. Our exploration predicts a sort of "branching" of the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$, leading to the emergence of a novel length scale and time scale in either limit. Furthermore, our investigation extends to the examination of curved momentum spaces and their geodesic distances in appropriate subspaces of the $\kappa$-deformed Newtonian and Carrollian space-times. We finally delve into the study of their deformed dispersion relations, arising from these deformed geodesic distances, providing a comprehensive understanding of the nature of these space-times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the mollified stochastic heat equation with flat initial data and the corresponding Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in dimension $d \geq 3$ when the mollification parameter is turned off. In addition, we assume that the strength of the space-time white noise is small enough, such that the solution of the mollified stochastic heat equation has a finite limiting second moment. In this case, with regard to the mollified KPZ equation, we show that the fluctuation of the mollified KPZ equation about its stationary solution converges in the sense of finite dimensional distributions towards a Gaussian free field. On the other hand, about the mollified stochastic heat equation, we show that the fluctuation of the mollified stochastic heat equation about its stationary solution converges in the sense of finite dimensional convergence towards the product of an i.i.d random field and an independent Gaussian free field. Here the i.i.d random field is generated by the limiting partition function of the continuous directed polymer. As an application, we prove the limiting fluctuations of the partition function and the free energy of the continuous directed polymer.</description>

      <title>The Massless Dirac Equation in Three Dimensions: Dispersive estimates and zero energy obstructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate dispersive estimates for the massless three dimensional Dirac equation with a potential. In particular, we show that the Dirac evolution satisfies a $\langle t\rangle^{-1}$ decay rate as an operator from $L^1$ to $L^\infty$ regardless of the existence of zero energy eigenfunctions. We also show this decay rate may be improved to $\langle t\rangle ^{-1-\gamma}$ for any $0\leq \gamma &lt; 1/2$ at the cost of spatial weights. This estimate, along with the $L^2$ conservation law allows one to deduce a family of Strichartz estimates in the case of a threshold eigenvalue. We classify the structure of threshold obstructions as being composed of zero energy eigenfunctions. Finally, we show the Dirac evolution is bounded for all time with minimal requirements on the decay of the potential and smoothness of initial data.</description>

      <title>Martingale Suitable Weak Solutions of $3$-D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations with Vorticity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct martingale suitable weak solutions for $3$-dimensional incompressible stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with generally non-linear noise. In deterministic setting, as widely known, ``suitable weak solutions'' are Leray-Hopf weak solutions enjoying two different types of local energy inequalities (LEIs). In stochastic setting, we apply the idea of ``martingale solution", avoid transforming to random system, and show new stochastic versions of the two local energy inequalities. In particular, in additive and linear multiplicative noise case, OU-processes and the exponential formulas DO NOT play a role in our formulation of LEIs. This is different to \cite{FR02,Rom10} where the additive noise case is dealt. Also, we successfully apply the concept of ``a.e. super-martingale'' to describe this local energy behavior. For further regularity of solutions, we are able to bound the $L^\infty\big([0,T];L^1(\Omega\times\mathbb T^3)\big)$ norm of the vorticity and $L^{\frac{4}{3+\delta}}\big(\Omega\times[0,T]\times\mathbb T^3\big)$ norm of the gradient of the vorticity, in case that the initial vorticity is a finite regular sign measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09325v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a series representation for the Virasoro fusion and modular kernels at any irrational central charge. Two distinct, yet closely related formulas are needed for the cases $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ and $c &lt;1$. Our proposal for $c &lt;1$ agrees numerically with the fusion transformation of the four-point spherical conformal blocks, whereas our proposal for $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ agrees numerically with Ponsot and Teschner's integral formula for the fusion kernel. The case of the modular kernel is studied as a special case of the fusion kernel.</description>

      <title>Explicit gate construction of block-encoding for Hamiltonians needed for simulating partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation is an emerging technology with important potential for solving certain problems pivotal in various scientific and engineering disciplines. This paper introduces an efficient quantum protocol for the explicit construction of block-encoding for an important class of Hamiltonians. Using the Schrodingerisation technique -- which converts non-conservative PDEs into conservative ones -- this particular class of Hamiltonians is shown to be sufficient for simulating any linear partial differential equations that have coefficients which are polynomial functions. The class of Hamiltonians consist of discretisations of polynomial products and sums of position and momentum operators. This construction is explicit and leverages minimal one- and two-qubit operations. The explicit construction of this block-encoding forms a fundamental building block for constructing the unitary evolution operator for this Hamiltonian. The proposed algorithm exhibits polynomial scaling with respect to the spatial partitioning size, suggesting an exponential speedup over classical finite-difference methods. This work provides an important foundation for building explicit and efficient quantum circuits for solving partial differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We obtain rigorous large time asymptotics for the Landau-Lifshitz equation in the soliton free case by extending the nonlinear steepest descent method to genus 1 surfaces. The methods presented in this paper pave the way to a rigorous analysis of other integrable equations on the torus and enable asymptotic analysis on different regimes of the Landau-Lifshitz equation.</description>

      <title>Explicit Construction of Hermitian Yang-Mills Instantons on Coset Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In four dimensions, 't Hooft symbols offer a compact and powerful framework for describing the self-dual structures fundamental to instanton physics. Extending this to six dimensions, the six-dimensional 't Hooft symbols can be constructed using the isomorphism between the Lorentz group $Spin(6)$ and the unitary group $SU(4)$. We demonstrate that the six-dimensional self-dual structures governed by the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations can be elegantly organized using these generalized 't Hooft symbols. We also present a systematic method for constructing Hermitian Yang-Mills instantons from spin connections on six-dimensional manifolds using the generalized 't Hooft symbols. We provide a thorough analysis of the topological invariants such as instanton and Euler numbers.</description>

      <title>Radial 3D Focusing Energy Critical INLS equations with defocusing perturbation: Ground states, Scattering, and Blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the following inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with focusing energy critical nonlinearity and a defocusing perturbation in the radial regime, $$
  i \partial_t u +\Delta u =|x|^{-a} |u|^{p-2} u - |x|^{-b} |u|^{4-2b}u \quad \mbox{in} \quad \mathbb{R}_t \times \mathbb{R}_x^3, $$ where $0&lt;a$, $b&lt;2$ and ${ 2+\frac{4-2a}{3}&lt; p\leq 6-2a}$. First, we prove the existence/nonexistence and quantitative properties of ground states. Subsequently, we establish the scattering versus blow-up below the ground-state energy threshold. Our methodology hinges on Tao's scattering criterion and Dodson-Murphy's Virial/Morawetz inequalities.
  An intriguing aspect of our study is the absence of scaling invariance within the equation, attributed to the interplay of the competing inhomogeneous nonlinearities. Moreover, the presence of singular weights serves as a barrier to translation invariance in the spatial variable, adding more complexity to the analysis.
  To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the inaugural exploration of the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a leading-order focusing energy critical inhomogeneous nonlinearity and a defocusing perturbation.</description>

      <title>$SLE_6$ and 2-d critical bond percolation on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Gaussian Testing and Non-Gaussian Measures via Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define fermionic convolution and demonstrate its utility in characterizing fermionic non-Gaussian components, which are essential to the computational advantage of fermionic systems. Using fermionic convolution, we propose an efficient protocol that tests the fermionic Gaussianity of pure states using three copies of the input state. We also introduce "Non-Gaussian Entropy," an experimentally accessible resource measure that quantifies fermionic non-Gaussianity. These results provide new insights into the study of fermionic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Entropy, cocycles, and their diagrammatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of the paper explains how to encode a one-cocycle and a two-cocycle on a group $G$ with values in its representation by networks of planar trivalent graphs with edges labelled by elements of $G$, elements of the representation floating in the regions, and suitable rules for manipulation of these diagrams. When the group is a semidirect product, there is a similar presentation via overlapping networks for the two subgroups involved.
  M. Kontsevich and J.-L. Cathelineau have shown how to interpret the entropy of a finite random variable and infinitesimal dilogarithms, including their four-term functional relations, via 2-cocycles on the group of affine symmetries of a line.
  We convert their construction into a diagrammatical calculus evaluating planar networks that describe morphisms in suitable monoidal categories. In particular, the four-term relations become equalities of networks analogous to associativity equations. The resulting monoidal categories complement existing categorical and operadic approaches to entropy.</description>

      <title>Dirac Operators on Configuration Spaces and Yang-Mills Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a connection between Dirac operators on configuration spaces and Yang-Mills quantum field theory. We first show that the Hamilton operators of the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory emerge from unitary transformations of a Dirac equation formulated on a configuration space of gauge connections. Secondly, we formulate a Bott-Dirac operator on the configuration space and demonstrate how the Hamilton operator of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory coupled to a fermionic sector emerges from its square. Finally, we discuss a spectral invariant that emerges in this framework.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Algebra Made Simple for Thermoelectric Generator Module Performance Prediction under Constant Seebeck-Coefficient Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While thermoelectric material performances can be estimated using the ZT, predicting the performance of thermoelectric generator modules (TGMs) is complex due to the non-linearity and non-locality of the thermoelectric differential equations. Here, we present a simplified thermoelectric algebra framework for predicting TGM performance within the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation (CSA). First, we revisit the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Model (CSM) to transform the differential equations into exact algebraic equations for thermoelectric heat flux and conversion efficiency in terms of the load resistance ratio and relative Fourier heat flux. Next, we introduce the CSA, where the Thomson term is neglected, and the device parameters are assumed to be fixed. We define average thermoelectric properties and device parameters at the zero-current condition using a simple temperature integral. Finally, we derive approximate thermoelectric algebraic equations for voltage, resistance, heat flux, and conversion efficiency as functions of current. We numerically validate that the CSA formalism is superior to other single-parameter theories, such as peak-ZT, integral-ZT, and the generic engineering-ZT, in predicting efficiency. The relative standard error in optimal efficiency is less than 11% for average ZT values not exceeding 2. By combining CSM and CSA, TGM performance can be easily estimated without the need for calculus or solving differential equations.</description>
