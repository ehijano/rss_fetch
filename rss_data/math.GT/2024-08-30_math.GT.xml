      <title>The Benard-Conway invariant of two-component links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Benard-Conway invariant of links in the 3-sphere is a Casson-Lin type invariant defined by counting irreducible SU(2) representations of the link group with fixed meridional traces. For two-component links with linking number one, the invariant has been shown to equal a symmetrized multivariable link signature. We extend this result to all two-component links with non-zero linking number. A key ingredient in the proof is an explicit calculation of the Benard-Conway invariant for (2, 2l)-torus links with the help of the Chebyshev polynomials.</description>

      <title>A classification of SU(2)-abelian graph manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 3-manifold is called \emph{SU(2)}-abelian if every SU(2)-representation of its fundamental group has abelian image. We classify, in terms of the Seifert coefficients, SU(2)-abelian 3-manifolds among the family of graph manifolds obtained by gluing two Seifert spaces both fibred over a disk and with two singular fibers. Finally, we prove that these SU(2)-abelian manifolds are Heegaard Floer homology L-spaces.</description>

      <title>A geometric proof of the flyping theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.06490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1898, Tait asserted several properties of alternating knot diagrams. These assertions became known as Tait's conjectures and remained open until the discovery of the Jones polynomial in 1985. The new polynomial invariants soon led to proofs of all of Tait's conjectures, culminating in 1993 with Menasco--Thistlethwaite's proof of Tait's flyping conjecture. In 2017, Greene (and independently Howie) answered a longstanding question of Fox by characterizing alternating links geometrically. Greene then used his characterization to give the first {\it geometric} proof of part of Tait's conjectures. We use Greene's characterization, Menasco's crossing ball structures, and a hierarchy of isotopy and {\it re-plumbing} moves to give the first entirely geometric proof of Menasco--Thistlethwaite's flyping theorem.</description>

      <title>End-essential spanning surfaces for links in thickened surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a cellular alternating link diagram on a closed orientable surface $\Sigma$. We prove that if $D$ has no removable nugatory crossings then each checkerboard surface from $D$ is $\pi_1$-essential and contains no essential closed curve that is $\partial$-parallel in $\Sigma\times I$. Our chief motivation comes from technical aspects of a companion paper, where we prove that Tait's flyping conjecture holds for alternating virtual links. We also describe possible applications via Turaev surfaces.</description>

      <title>Primeness of alternating virtual links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a new tool called lassos, we establish a new correspondence between cellular link {diagrams} on closed surfaces and equivalence classes of virtual link {diagrams}. This is analogous to a well-known correspondence among the links represented by these diagrams, but with a crucial subtlety. We explain how, under these correspondences, the traditional notion of primeness for virtual links is stricter than the one for links in thickened surfaces. We extend a classical result of Menasco by proving that an alternating link in a thickened surface is prime in the stricter sense unless it is ``obviously" composite. (Adams et al and Howie--Purcell previously extended Menasco's result for the other notion of primeness.) We describe, given an alternating virtual link diagram, how to determine by inspection whether the virtual link it represents is prime in either sense.</description>

      <title>The virtual flyping theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the flyping theorem to alternating links in thickened surfaces and alternating virtual links. The proof of the former result uses work of Boden--Karimi to adapt the author's geometric proof of Tait's 1898 flyping conjecture (first proved in 1993 by Menasco--Thistlethwaite), while the proof of the latter involves a diagrammatic correspondence recently introduced by the author in a related paper. In the process, we also extend a classical result of Gordon--Litherland, establishing an isomorphism between their pairing on a spanning surface and the intersection form on a 4-manifold constructed as a double-branched cover using that surface.</description>

      <title>Higher rank series and root puzzles for plumbed 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct plumbed three-manifold invariants in the form of Laurent series twisted by root lattices. Specifically, given a triple consisting of a weakly negative definite plumbing tree, a root lattice, and a generalized $\mathrm{Spin}^c$-structure, we construct a family of Laurent series which are invariant up to Neumann moves between plumbing trees and the action of the Weyl group of the root lattice. We show that there are infinitely many such series for irreducible root lattices of rank at least $2$, with each series depending on a solution to a combinatorial puzzle defined on the root lattice. Our invariants recover certain related series recently defined by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park, and Ri as special cases. Explicit computations are given for Brieskorn homology spheres, for which the series may be expressed as modified higher rank false theta functions.</description>

      <title>Homotopy groups and quantitative Sperner-type lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of Sperner's lemma for a triangulation $T$ of $(m+1)$-discs $D$ whose vertices are colored in $c=n+2$ colors. A proper coloring of $T$ on the boundary of $D$ determines a simplicial mapping $f:S^m \to S^n$ and the element $x=[f]$ in $\pi_m(S^n)$. For any element $x$ in this homotopy group we define a non--negative integer $\mu(x)$. For some cases this invariant can be found explicitly. Namely, if $m=n$ then this number is the Brouwer degree of the mapping $f$. For the case $m=3, n=2$ we found a lower bound for $\mu(x)$, where $x$ is the Hopf invariant, and proved that $\mu(1)=\mu(2)=9$. The main result of this paper is the theorem that the number of fully colored $n$-simplexes in $T$ is not less than $\mu([f])$. To prove this theorem, we use an extension of the Pontryagin theorem for relative framed cobordisms</description>

      <title>Geometry and arithmetic of semi-arithmetic Fuchsian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-arithmetic Fuchsian groups is a wide class of discrete groups of isometries of the hyperbolic plane which includes arithmetic Fuchsian groups, hyperbolic triangle groups, groups admitting a modular embedding, and others. We introduce a new geometric invariant of a semi-arithmetic group called stretch. Its definition is based on the notion of the Riemannian center of mass developed by Karcher and collaborators. We show that there exist only finitely many conjugacy classes of semi-arithmetic groups with bounded arithmetic dimension, stretch and coarea. The proof of this result uses the arithmetic Margulis lemma. We also show that when stretch is not bounded there exist infinite sequences of such groups.</description>
