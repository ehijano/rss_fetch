      <title>Hall MHD waves: A fundamental departure from their MHD counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is demonstrated through a succinct derivation as to how the linear waves in Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) constitute a fundamental departure from the standard MHD waves. Apart from modifying the conventional MHD spectrum, the Hall current induces a distinct and new branch consisting of purely circularly polarized waves that may become the representative shear waves.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of X-point collapse in an extended magnetohydrodynamics framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of X-point collapse in magnetic reconnection has witnessed extensive study in the context of space and laboratory plasmas. In this paper, a recently derived mathematical formulation of X-point collapse applicable in the regime of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) is shown to possess a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure composed of five dynamical variables inherited from its parent model. The Hamiltonian and the noncanonical Poisson bracket are both derived, and the latter is shown to obey the requisite properties of antisymmetry and the Jacobi identity (an explicit proof of the latter is provided). In addition, the governing equations for the Casimir invariants are presented, and one such solution is furnished. The above features can be harnessed and expanded in future work, such as developing symplectic integrators for this dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Tracing Rayleigh-Taylor instability from measured periodic modulation in laser driven proton beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability occurs in a variety of scenario as a consequence of fluids of different densities pushing against the density gradient. For example, it is expected to occur in the ion acceleration of solid density targets driven by high intensity lasers and is crucial for the acceleration process. Yet, it is essential to understand the dynamics of the RT instability, a typical way to measure this phenomenon requires sophisticated diagnostics such as streak X ray radiography. Here, we report on experimental observation on periodic modulation in the energy spectrum of laser accelerated proton beams. Interestingly, theoretical model and two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, in good agreement with the experimental finding, indicated that such modulation is associated with periodic modulated electron density induced by transverse Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability. Furthermore, the correlation between the RT instability and the ion acceleration provides an interpretation to trace the development of the RT instability from the modulated proton spectrum. Our results thus suggest a possible tool to diagnose the evolution of the RT instability, and may have implications for further understanding for the accelerating mechanisms as well as optimization strategies for laser driven ion acceleration.</description>

      <title>Merging dynamics of plasma blobs in the Scrape-off Layer of a tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence and merging of high-density coherent structures - plasma blobs - is a recurrent phenomenon in the Scrape-off layer (SOL) of a tokamak plasma that has a significant impact on the rate of convective transport in that region. We report on a model study of the merging of two electromagnetically interacting blobs in a high beta plasma. Our detailed numerical simulations show that the merging process is akin to the coalescence instability between two magnetic islands but with important differences due to the density perturbation. The blobs are found to rotate about each other during merging and the merging occurs with an acceleration in the poloidal direction that is directly proportional to the square of the current density of the blobs and inversely proportional to its density. The separation distance between two high current density blobs is also seen to oscillate indicating a sloshing behavior.</description>

      <title>Observation of Chaotic fluctuations in Turbulent Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a prevalent phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas, often characterized by stochastic fluctuations. While laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have revealed chaotic behavior, in-situ observations of turbulent plasmas in natural environments have predominantly shown highly stochastic signatures. Here, we present unprecedented in-situ evidence of chaotic fluctuations in the turbulent solar wind plasma downstream of the Earth's bow shock. By analyzing the relative location of magnetic-field fluctuations on the permutation entropy-complexity plane (C-H plane), we demonstrate that turbulence in the magnetosheath plasma exhibits characteristics of chaotic fluctuations rather than stochastic behavior, diverging from the expected traits of well-developed turbulence. This finding challenges established notions of plasma turbulence and reveals the need for caution when using the magnetosheath as a laboratory for studying plasma turbulence.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing effect of surface tension for the linearized MHD-Maxwell free interface problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an interface with surface tension that separates a perfectly conducting inviscid fluid from a vacuum. The fluid flow is governed by the equations of ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), while the electric and magnetic fields in vacuum satisfy the Maxwell equations. With boundary conditions on the interface this forms a nonlinear hyperbolic problem with a characteristic free boundary. For the corresponding linearized problem we derive an energy a priori estimate in a conormal Sobolev space without assuming any stability conditions on the unperturbed flow. This verifies the stabilizing effect of surface tension because, as was shown in [Mandrik and Trakhinin, in Commun. Math. Sci. 12 (2014), 1065-1100], a sufficiently large vacuum electric field can make the linearized problem ill-posed for the case of zero surface tension. The main ingredients in proving the energy estimate are a suitable secondary symmetrization of the Maxwell equations in vacuum and making full use of the boundary regularity enhanced from the surface tension.</description>

      <title>A multi-dimensional, robust, and cell-centered finite-volume scheme for the ideal MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new multi-dimensional, robust, and cell-centered finite-volume scheme for the ideal MHD equations. This scheme relies on relaxation and splitting techniques and can be easily used at high order. A fully conservative version is not entropy satisfying but is observed experimentally to be more robust than standard constrained transport schemes at low plasma beta. At very low plasma beta and high Alfv\'en number, we have designed an entropy-satisfying version that is not conservative for the magnetic field but preserves admissible states and we switch locally a-priori between the two versions depending on the regime of plasma beta and Alfv\'en number. This strategy is robust in a wide range of standard MHD test cases, all performed at second order with a classic MUSCL-Hancock scheme.</description>

      <title>Electrical Conductivity of Warm Dense Hydrogen from Ohm's Law and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the electrical conductivity of warm dense hydrogen is critical for both fundamental physics and applications in planetary science and inertial confinement fusion. We demonstrate how to calculate the electrical conductivity using the continuum form of Ohm's law, with the current density obtained from real-time time-dependent density functional theory. This approach simulates the dynamic response of hydrogen under warm dense matter conditions, with temperatures around 30,000 K and mass densities ranging from 0.02 to 0.98 g/cc. We systematically address finite-size errors in real-time time-dependent density functional theory, demonstrating that our calculations are both numerically feasible and reliable. Our results show good agreement with other approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of this method for modeling electronic transport properties from ambient to extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Acceleration and focusing of multispecies ion beam using a converging laser-driven shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate an ion acceleration scheme capable of simultaneously focusing and accelerating a multispecies ion beam with monoenergetic spectra to a few micron radius. The focal length and ion mean energy can be independently controlled: the former by using a different front-surface shape and the latter by tuning the laser-plasma parameters. We interpret the results using simple models and validate the results using first-principles simulations. The scheme is applicable to different laser transverse profiles and multi-ion species target, and limiting factors for the ion focusing are delineated. The generated ion beam exhibits high charge, low emittance, and high energy flux and is of interest to various applications including Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF), high flux neutron generation, and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Resonant emittance mixing of flat beams in plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear colliders rely on high-quality flat beams to achieve the desired event rate, while avoiding potentially deleterious beamstrahlung effects. Here, we show that flat beams in plasma accelerators can be subject to quality degradation due to emittance mixing. This effect occurs when the beam particles' betatron oscillations in a nonlinearly coupled wakefield become resonant in the horizontal and vertical planes. Emittance mixing can lead to a substantial decrease of the luminosity, the main quantity determining the event rate. In some cases, the use of laser drivers or flat particle beam drivers may decrease the fraction of resonant particles and, hence, mitigate emittance deterioration.</description>
