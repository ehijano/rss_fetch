      <title>On Rapid mixing for random walks on nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove rapid mixing for almost all random walks generated by $m$ translations on an arbitrary nilmanifold under mild assumptions on the size of $m$. For several classical classes of nilmanifolds, we show $m=2$ suffices. This provides a partial answer to the question raised in \cite{D02} about the prevalence of rapid mixing for random walks on homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>The hat polykite as an Iterated Function System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the celebrated aperiodic hat tiling by Smith et al. [Comb. Theory 8 (2024), 6] as generated by an overlapping iterated function system. We briefly introduce and study infinite sequences of iterated function systems that converge uniformly in each component, and use this theory to model the hat tiling's associated imperfect substitution system.</description>

      <title>Remotely Almost Periodic Solutions of Scalar Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the problem of existence of remotely almost periodic solutions for the scalar differential equation $x'=f(t,x),$ where $f:\mathbb R\times \mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ is a continuous, monotone in $x$ and remotely almost periodic in $t$ function. We prove that every solution $\varphi$ of this equation bounded on the semi-axis $\mathbb R_{+}$ is remotely almost periodic. This statement is a generalization of the well-known Opial's theorem for remotely almost periodic scalar differential equations. We also establish a similar statement for scalar difference equations.</description>

      <title>Cluster Analysis for Globally Coupled Map using Optimal Transport Distance and Complexity of Attractor-ruin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the results of the strength of attractorruins for a globally coupled map. The globally coupled map (GCM) is a discrete dynamical system, and here we consider a model in which the logistic map is globally coupled. An attractor-ruin is a set in which the attractor is destabilized by a change in parameters, which is characterized by a Milnor attractor. Intermittent phenomena called chaotic itinerancy, in which orbits transition between attractor-ruin, have been observed in various complex systems, and their onset mechanisms and statistical properties have attracted attention. In this study, the instability of orbits of GCM is analyzed from the perspective of clustering using the optimal transport distance, and the strength of attractor-ruins is numerically evaluated by applying this method. As a result, it was found that the strength of various attractor-ruins is high in the parameter region called the partially ordered phase, where chaotic itinerancy occurs.</description>

      <title>On convergence of normal form transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss various aspects concerning transformations of local analytic, or formal, vector fields to Poincare-Dulac normal form, and the convergence of such transformations. We first review A.D. Bruno's approach to formal normalization, as well as convergence results in presence of certain (simplified) versions of Bruno's ``Condition A'', and along the way we also identify a large class of systems that satisfy Bruno's diophantine ``Condition omega''. We retrace the proof steps in Bruno's work, using a different formalism and variants in the line of arguments. We then proceed to show how Bruno's approach naturally extends to an elementary proof of L. Stolovitch's formal and analytic simultaneous normalization theorems for abelian Lie algebras of vector fields. Finally we investigate the role of integrability for convergence, sharpening some existing and adding new results. In particular we give a characterization of formally meromorphic first integrals, and their relevance for convergence.</description>

      <title>Local large deviation principle for Smale spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large deviation principles for hyperbolic systems are well studied and provide exponential rates for the deviations of Birkhoff averages from their limit. This short article presents a local large deviation principle for Smale spaces, in particular studying the rate functions of deviations with respect to conditional Gibbs measures supported on local unstable manifolds. The proof builds on a result due to Kifer and pressure growth estimates due to Parmenter and Pollicott.</description>

      <title>Modelling road mortality risks to persistence to a Western Toad ({\it Anaxyrus boreas}) population in British Columbia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Road mortality may be a significant factor in the global decline of amphibian populations, yet rigorous assessments of its effect on long-term population persistence are lacking.
  Here, we investigate population persistence through a field study and mathematical model of a western toad ({\textit{Anaxyrus Boreas}} {\RR(Baird and Girard, 1852)}) population within a highway corridor in the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia.
  The analysis shows traffic levels strongly correlate with toad mortality, with each additional vehicle causing a 3.1\% $\pm$ 1.3\% ($p=0.020$) increase in toad deaths.
  Although the current risk of the population becoming threatened or endangered is low, it rises to 50\% if baseline road mortality increases from 10\% to 30\%. Gravid female mortality is higher than the baseline mortality and can increase the probability of endangerment by nearly two-fold at higher baseline mortality levels.
  We make the case that a small increase in vehicle traffic resulting from future development and recreational pressures
  could destabilize this apparently healthy toad population. The high sensitivity to traffic levels and rapid transition from healthy to endangered raises concerns for similar populations worldwide. Compensatory structures such as amphibian underpasses (toad tunnels) should be given high priority.</description>

      <title>Exponential Dichotomies in Higher-Dimensional Spatial Dynamics for Elliptic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponential dichotomies, when they exist, provide powerful information about the structure of bounded solutions even in the case of an ill-posed evolutionary equation. The method of spatial dynamics, in which one views a spatial variable as a time-like evolutionary variable, allows for the use of classical dynamical systems techniques, such as exponential dichotomies, in broader contexts. This has been utilized to study stationary, traveling wave, time-periodic, and spiral wave solutions of PDEs on spatial domains with a distinguished unbounded direction (e.g. the real line or a channel of the form $\mathbb{R}\times\Omega$). Recent work has shown how to extend the spatial dynamics framework to elliptic PDEs posed on general multi-dimensional spatial domains. In this paper, we show that, in the same context, exponential dichotomies exist, thus allowing for their use in future analyses of coherent structures, such as spatial patterns in reaction-diffusion equations on more general domains.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of stochastic dissipative differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of dissipative stochastic differential equations driven by nonlinear multiplicative fractional Brownian noise with Hurst index $H \in \left(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})\cup(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right) $. We establish the well-posedness of the associated coupled stochastic differential equations and prove synchronization in the sense of trajectories. Our approach relies on the Doss-Sussmann transformation, which enables us to extend existing results for additive and linear noise to the case of nonlinear multiplicative fractional Brownian noise. The findings provide new insights into the synchronization of dissipative systems under fractional noise perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of rough differential equations (RDEs) has recently received a lot of interest. For example, the existence of local random center manifolds for RDEs has been established. In this work, we present an approximation for local random center manifolds for RDEs driven by geometric rough paths. To this aim, we combine tools from rough path and deterministic center manifold theory to derive Taylor-like approximations of local random center manifolds. The coefficients of this approximation are stationary solutions of RDEs driven by the same geometric rough path as the original equation. We illustrate our approach for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with linear and nonlinear multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>Recurrence and Stickiness in the Noisy Harper Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When three types of noise are introduced to the area-preserving Harper map, the Poincar\'e recurrence statistic (PRS) exhibits an extended tail, corresponding to an increased probability of longer recurrence times. For a deterministic case with a mixture of regular and chaotic orbits, regular islands are responsible for a power-law decay in the recurrence distribution. Noise perturbations allow trajectories to access the interior of the islands, and this can enhance their trapping effect, causing many orbits to take longer to return to a neighborhood of their initial conditions and resulting in a slower power-law decay on an intermediate time scale. On a longer time scale, however, the noisy PRS exhibits exponential decay, eventually falling below the deterministic PRS. We compare distributions of trapping and visit times to islands with recurrence times to show the importance of noise in creating tails in the PRS. A simple model of the dynamics -- a Markov chain with three states -- demonstrates how the slower decay can be caused by noise allowing entry to a previously inaccessible island.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04207v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a partially hyperbolic attracting set for a C2 vector field, having slow recurrence to equilibria, supports an ergodic physical/SRB measure if, and only if, the trapping region admits non-uniform sectional expansion on a positive Lebesgue measure subset. Moreover, in this case, the attracting set supports at most finitely many ergodic physical/SRB measures, which are also Gibbs states along the central-unstable direction.
  This extends to continuous time systems a similar well-known result obtained for diffeomorphisms, encompassing the presence of equilibria accumulated by regular orbits within the attracting set. In codimension two the same result holds, assuming only the trajetories on the trapping region admit a sequence of times with asymptotical sectional expansion, on a positive volume subset.
  We present several examples of application, including the existence of physical measures for asymptotically sectional hyperbolic attracting sets, and obtain physical measures in an alternative unified way for many known examples: Lorenz-like and Rovella attractors, and sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets (including the multidimensional Lorenz attractor).</description>

      <title>Combinatorial structures of the space of gradient vector fields on compact surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient vector fields are fundamental objects from both theoretical and practical perspectives, since various phenomena can be modeled within this framework. The ``moduli space'' of such vector fields provides the foundation for describing these phenomena. However, little is known about the topology of the space of gradient vector fields. For instance, it remains unknown whether a connected component of this space can fail to be simply connected. This paper aims to lay the foundation for describing the possible generic time evolution of gradient vector fields on surfaces, with or without constraints, under the assumption that no creation or annihilation of singular points occurs, by using combinatorics and simple homotopy theory. In fact, the space of gradient vector fields on a closed annulus contains a non-contractible connected component, which is weakly homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of two two-dimensional spheres.</description>

      <title>Short-range and long-range order: a transition in block-gluing behavior in Hom shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hom shifts form a class of multidimensional shifts of finite type (SFT) and consist of colorings of the grid Z2 where adjacent colours must be neighbors in a fixed finite undirected simple graph G. This class includes several important statistical physics models such as the hard square model. The gluing gap measures how far any two square patterns of size n can be glued, which can be seen as a measure of the range of order, and affects the possibility to compute the entropy (or free energy per site) of a shift. This motivates a study of the possible behaviors of the gluing gap. The class of Hom shifts has the interest that mixing type properties can be formulated in terms of algebraic graph theory, which has received a lot of attention recently. Improving some former work of N. Chandgotia and B. Marcus, we prove that the gluing gap either depends linearly on n or is dominated by log(n). We also find a Hom shift with gap {\Theta}(log(n)), infirming a conjecture formulated by R. Pavlov and M. Schraudner. The physical interest of these results is to better understand the transition from short-range to long-range order (respectively sublogarithmic and linear gluing gap), which is reflected in whether some parameter, the square cover, is finite or infinite.</description>

Abstract: We consider a sequence of $C^2$ (or $C^3$) Anosov maps of the two-dimensional torus that satisfy a common cone condition, and show that if their $C^2$ (respectively, $C^3$) norms are uniformly bounded, then the non-stationary stable foliation must be of class $C^1$ (respectively, $C^{1+\text{H\"older}}$). This generalizes the classical results on smoothness of the invariant foliations of Anosov maps. We also provide an example that shows that an assumption on boundedness of the norms cannot be removed, which is a phenomenon that does not have an analog in the stationary setting.
  The main motivation stems from a standing conjecture concerning the dimension properties of the spectra of Sturmian Hamiltonian operators, and this result serves as a first step towards addressing this conjecture. A detailed appendix is provided showing the potential argument and connection between this theory of non-stationary hyperbolic dynamics and the spectral dimension of these operators.
  We also provide an addendum demonstrating that a similar result holds for a sequence of Anosov maps of the $d$-dimensional torus whose stable directions have codimension $1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the periodic points for continuous self-maps on the wedge sum of topological manifolds, exhibiting a particular combinatorial structure. We compute explicitly the Lefschetz numbers, the Dold coefficients and consider its set of algebraic periods. Moreover, we study the special case of maps on the wedge sum of tori, and show some of the homological obstructions present in defining these maps.</description>

      <title>Structural stability in piecewise M\"obius transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural stability of piecewise M\"obius transformations (PMTs) is examined from various perspectives. A result concerning structural stability, restricted to the space of PMTs, is derived using hyperbolic characteristics of the component functions and the pre-singularities set, which facilitates a holomorphic motion. The analogous concept of J-stability for rational maps is defined and analyzed for PMTs, revealing some connections to general structural stability. The definitions of hyperbolic and expansive PMTs are introduced, demonstrating that they are not equivalent and that neither implies structural stability. By synthesizing the previous results and analyses, sufficient conditions for structural stability are established. Lastly, an example of structural stability within the tent maps family, extended to the complex plane, is presented.</description>

      <title>Uniform a priori bounds for neutral renormalization. Variation II: $\psi^\bullet$-ql Siegel maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend uniform pseudo-Siegel bounds for neutral quadratic polynomials to $\psi^\bullet$-quadratic-like Siegel maps. In this form, the bounds are compatible with the $\psi$-quadratic-like renormalization theory and are easily transferable to various families of rational maps. The main theorem states that the degeneration of a Siegel disk is equidistributed among combinatorial intervals. This provides a precise description of how the $\psi^\bullet$-quadratic-like structure degenerates around the Siegel disk on all geometric scales except on the ``transitional scales'' between two specific combinatorial levels.</description>

      <title>Weak Gibbs measures for the natural extension of $(1/\beta, \beta)$-shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the weak Gibbs measures for $(\alpha, \beta)$-shifts. In the case of $\alpha=0$, Pfister and Sullivan have given a necessary and sufficient condition on $\beta$ such that any equilibrium measure for a function of bounded total oscillations is a weak Gibbs measure in the natural extension of a $\beta$-shift. So it is natural to ask what happens when $\alpha&gt;0$. However, their proof cannot be applied to general $(\alpha, \beta)$-shifts in a similar way. In this paper we consider the case of $\alpha=1/\beta$ and give a criterion for the weak Gibbs property of equilibrium measures for $(1/\beta, \beta)$-shifts.</description>

      <title>Computability of extender sets in multidimensional subshifts: asymptotic growths, dynamical constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subshifts are sets of colorings of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ defined by families of forbidden patterns. In a given subshift, the extender set of a finite pattern is the set of all its admissible completions. Since soficity of $\mathbb{Z}$ subshifts is equivalent to having a finite number of extender sets, it had been conjectured that the number of extender sets could provide a way to separate the classes of sofic and effective subshifts in higher dimensions. We investigate some computational characterizations of extender sets in multidimensional subshifts, and in particular their growth, in terms of extender entropies (arXiv:1711.07515) and extender entropy dimensions. We prove here that sofic and effective subshifts have the same possible extender entropies (exactly the $\Pi_3$-computable real numbers of $[0,+\infty)$) and extender entropy dimensions, and investigate the computational complexity of these growth-type quantities under various dynamical and combinatorial constraints.</description>

      <title>An Invariance Principle for a Random Walk Among Moving Traps via Thermodynamic Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a random walk among a Poisson cloud of moving traps on ${\mathbb Z}^d$, where the walk is killed at a rate proportional to the number of traps occupying the same position. In dimension $d=1$, we have previously shown that under the annealed law of the random walk conditioned on survival up to time $t$, the walk is sub-diffusive. Here we show that in $d\geq 6$ and under diffusive scaling, this annealed law satisfies an invariance principle with a positive diffusion constant if the killing rate is small. Our proof is based on the theory of thermodynamic formalism, where we extend some classic results for Markov shifts with a finite alphabet and a potential of summable variation to the case of an uncountable non-compact alphabet.</description>

      <title>The size of the sync basin resolved</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparsely coupled Kuramoto oscillators offer a fertile playground for exploring high-dimensional basins of attraction due to their simple yet multistable dynamics. For $n$ identical Kuramoto oscillators on cycle graphs, it is well known that the only attractors are twisted states, whose phases wind around the circle with a constant gap between neighboring oscillators ($\theta_j = 2\pi q j/n$). It was conjectured in 2006 that basin sizes of these twisted states scale as $e^{-kq^2}$ to the winding number $q$. Here, we provide new numerical and analytical evidence supporting the conjecture and uncover the dynamical mechanism behind the Gaussian scaling. The key idea is that, when starting with a random initial condition, the winding number of the solution stabilizes rapidly at $t \propto \log n$, before long-range correlation can develop among oscillators. This timescale separation allows us to calculate the winding number as a sum of weakly-dependent random variables, leading to a Central Limit Theorem derivation of the basin scaling.</description>

      <title>The Kuramoto model on the Sierpinski Gasket II: Twisted states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Kuramoto model (KM) of coupled phase oscillators on graphs approximating the Sierpinski gasket (SG). As the size of the graph tends to infinity, the limit points of the sequence of stable equilibria in the KM correspond to the minima of the Dirichlet energy, i.e., to harmonic maps from the SG to the circle. We provide a complete description of the stable equilibria of the continuum limit of the KM on graphs approximating the SG, under both Dirichlet and free boundary conditions. We show that there is a unique stable equilibrium in each homotopy class of continuous functions from the SG to the circle. These equilibria serve as generalizations of the classical twisted states on ring networks. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the KM on post-critically finite fractals. The results of this work reveal the link between self-similar organization and network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Divisibility by $p$ for Markoff-like Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study orbits in a family of Markoff-like surfaces with extra off-diagonal terms over prime fields $\mathbb{F}_p$. It is shown that, for a typical surface of this form, every non-trivial orbit has size divisible by $p$. This extends a theorem of W.Y. Chen from the Markoff surface itself to others in this family. The proof closely follows and elaborates on a recent argument of D.E. Martin. We expect that there is just one orbit generically. For some special parameters, we prove that there are at least two or four orbits. Cayley's cubic surface plays a role in parametrising the exceptional cases and dictating the number of solutions mod $p$.</description>

      <title>On the verification of a Nicolas inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11182v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nicolas inequality we deal can be written as \begin{equation}\label{Nicineq} e^\gamma \log\log N_x &lt; \dfrac{N_x}{\varphi(N_x)}\,, \end{equation} where $x\ge 2$, $N_x$ denotes the product of the primes less or equal than $x$, $\gamma$ is the Euler constant and $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. We see that verification of such an inequality depends on the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that. Then we analyze the sign of such an error term.</description>
