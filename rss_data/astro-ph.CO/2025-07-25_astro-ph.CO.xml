      <title>Probing the ionizing photon output of galaxies near cosmic dawn with the patchy kSZ effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key result from JWST's first cycles is that galaxy formation was well underway by $z=10$. The implications of these early galaxies for reionization are less clear, however. The CMB is one of the few windows into the ionization state of the IGM during reionization's first half, providing an important probe of the ionizing photon sources at those times. Meanwhile, measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of high-$z$ quasars have improved to the level of tightly constraining the timing of reionization's end. In this paper, we use radiative transfer simulations to explore how measurements of the patchy kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pkSZ) effect, when combined with Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements, can be used to constrain the early stages of reionization and the nature of its sources. For a given source model, we find that the amplitude of the pkSZ power spectra strongly correlates with the start time of reionization, and constrains the number of ionizing photons produced by the high-$z$ source population. Allowing for variations in the source model, this correlation is weakened by a degeneracy between the reionization history and the effects of source clustering. However, we demonstrate two potential ways of breaking this degeneracy using: (1) measurements of large-scale fluctuations in the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity at $z=5-6$, and/or; (2) the shape of the pkSZ power spectrum measured in future CMB surveys. Models with highly clustered sources yield steeper slopes in the pkSZ power around $\ell = 3,000$, so measurements at additional angular scales can be used to break the history-clustering degeneracy. Our results highlight how future pkSZ measurements will complement JWST observations to improve our understanding of the ionizing sources near cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>Not-quite-primordial black holes seeded by cosmic string loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \, M_{\odot}$ at high redshifts. Interestingly, for reasonable values of the string parameters, one can reproduce the abundance of ``Little Red Dots" as inferred by JWST.</description>

      <title>DESIgning concordant distances in the age of precision cosmology: the impact of density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrepancies between distance measurements and $\Lambda$CDM predictions reveal notable features in the distance-redshift relation, possibly suggesting the presence of an evolving dark energy component. Given the central role of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in modeling cosmological distances, we investigate here whether these features instead point to a possible departure from the fundamental FLRW symmetries. Exploiting the transverse and line-of-sight distances provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations, we demonstrate that observed distances hint at a slight but systematic preference for an anisotropic expansion rate emerging regardless of the dark energy model considered. Leveraging this non-FLRW feature, we investigate an inhomogeneous extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model that naturally provides an anisotropic expansion rate. Our analysis demonstrates that models featuring spherical overdensities can explain BAO, supernova, and cosmic microwave background data, providing fits statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with a phantom dark energy scenario. When Pantheon+ data is considered, our analysis challenges the FLRW framework at $2.8\sigma$ and yields scenarios that can be interpreted as subtle but non-negligible deviations from the FLRW metric. When DESY5 supernovae are considered instead, deviations are notably more significant, yielding scenarios that mildly violate the Copernican principle and exclude the FLRW assumption at $5.2\sigma$. Overall, our results motivate a more in-depth investigation of whether the perfectly homogeneous and isotropic FLRW paradigm can still be assumed to accurately predict cosmological distances in the era of precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Variational autoencoder for generating realistic $N$-body simulations for dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a variational autoencoder (VAE), a deep generative model, to compress and generate images of dark matter density fields from $\Lambda$CDM like cosmological simulations. The VAE learns a compact, low-dimensional representation of the large-scale structure, enabling both accurate reconstruction and generation of statistically realistic samples. We evaluated the generated images by comparing their power spectra to those of real simulations and the theoretical $\Lambda$CDM prediction, finding strong agreement with the state-of-the-art simulations. In addition, the VAE provides a fast and scalable method for generating synthetic cosmological data, making it a valuable tool for data augmentation. These capabilities can accelerate the development and training of more advanced machine learning models for cosmological analysis, particularly in scenarios where large-scale simulations are computationally expensive. Our results highlight the potential for generative artificial intelligence as a practical bridge between physical modeling and modern deep learning in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Optimising the sample selection for photometric galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining cosmological parameters with high precision, as well as resolving current tensions in their values derived from low and high redshift probes, is one of the main objectives of the new generation of cosmological surveys. The combination of complementary probes in terms of parameter degeneracies and systematics is key to achieving these ambitious scientific goals. In this context, determining the optimal survey configuration for an analysis that combines galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing, the so-called 3x2pt analysis, remains an open problem. In this paper, we present an efficient and flexible end-to-end pipeline to optimise the sample selection for 3x2pt analyses in an automated way. Our pipeline is articulated in two main steps: we first consider a self-organising map to determine the photometric redshifts of a simulated galaxy sample. As a proof of method for stage-IV surveys, we use samples from the DESC Data Challenge 2 catalogue. This allows us to classify galaxies into tomographic bins based on their colour phenotype clustering. We then explore different redshift-bin edge configurations for weak lensing only as well as 3x2pt analyses in a novel way. Our method explores multiple configurations of perturbed redshift-bin edges with respect to the fiducial case in an iterative manner. In particular, we sample tomographic configurations for the source and lens galaxies separately. We show that, using this method we quickly converge into an optimised configuration for different numbers of redshift bins and cosmologies. Our analysis demonstrates that for stage-IV surveys an optimal tomographic sample selection can increase the figure of merit of the dark energy (DE) equation of state by a factor of $\sim$2, comparable to an effective increase in survey area of $\sim$4 for non-optimal photometric survey analyses.</description>

      <title>Phantom crossing or dark interaction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from DESI BAO measurements, together with Planck CMB and Pantheon+ data, suggest that there may be a `phantom' phase ($w_{\rm de}&lt;-1$) in the expansion of the Universe. This inference follows when the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$ is used to fit the data. Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but effective -- due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \emph{effective} equation of state of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\sigma$ at $z\sim0.3$. The energy flows from dark matter to dark energy at early times and reverses at later times.</description>

      <title>A continuity equation compatible basis for Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Effective Field Theory (EFT) of Dark Energy (DE) is a model independent framework that allows for the description of a wide class of dark energy and modified gravity models. This is achieved by extending the Hilbert Einstein action through the introduction of time dependent functions. However, the choice of these functions and thus the operator basis is not unique. In this paper, we propose a physically motivated constraint based on the continuity equation, leading to a continuity equation compatible (CEC) basis that ensures a clear physical interpretation of the background EFT operators.</description>

      <title>On the Energy Distribution of the Galactic Center Excess' Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources. Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier point-source analyses of the GCE.</description>

      <title>A Metal-Free Galaxy at $z = 3.19$? Evidence of Late Population III Star Formation at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx822$ Angstrom and EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $\approx2814$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, are currently detected at statistically significant level, placing a 2-$\sigma$ abundance upper limit of 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.52 ($Z &lt; 8\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$). The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratio is $\approx13.9$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young ($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.</description>

      <title>Ultralight dark matter detection with trapped-ion interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how recent advances in the manipulation of single-ion wave packets open new avenues for detecting weak magnetic fields sourced by ultralight dark matter. A trapped ion in a ``Schr\"odinger cat'' state can be prepared with its spin and motional degrees of freedom entangled and be used as a matter-wave interferometer that is sensitive to the Aharonov-Bohm-like phase shift accumulated by the ion over its trajectory. The result of the spin-motion entanglement is a parametrically-enhanced sensitivity to weak magnetic fields as compared with an un-entangled ion in a trap. Taking into account the relevant boundary conditions, we demonstrate that a single trapped ion can probe unexplored regions of kinetically-mixed dark-photon dark matter parameter space in the $10^{-15}~\text{eV} \lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 10^{-14}$~eV mass window. We also show how such a table-top quantum device will also serve as a complementary probe of axion-like particle dark matter in the same mass window.</description>

      <title>Multiple Populations of Same Sterile Neutrino as Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos produced in the early Universe that mix with active neutrinos of the Standard Model are typically considered to consist of a single population resulting from one dominant production mechanism. We show that the same sterile neutrino species can naturally emerge with multiple population components, yielding a multi-modal relic momentum spectrum. We consider this with four distinct production scenarios: active-sterile non-resonant oscillations following resonant oscillations in the presence of a primordial lepton asymmetry, gravitational production through sterile neutrinogenesis from populations of evaporating primordial black holes, and heavy singlet Higgs or inflaton decays combined with non-resonant active-sterile oscillations or neutrinogenesis. We identify sterile neutrino mass ranges where a colder and a hotter population can be present with similar contributions and can also contribute non-negligibly to the dark matter relic abundance. We discuss some potential consequences of such a multi-population framework.</description>

      <title>Updated constraints on modified gravity from binary pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary pulsars offer a unique natural laboratory to test General Relativity (GR) and probe for deviations from its paradigm, as predicted by alternative theories of gravity. In this paper, we study two such possible deviations: a time variation of Newton's constant $G$ and the emission of dipolar gravitational radiation. We use updated data for some well-known pulsars, namely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the Keplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital dynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian parameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We do this via the TEMPO2 software, the MCMC4Tempo2 plugin, and a unified python pipeline to analyze the data. We then perform a combined analysis of different binary systems to constrain both the time evolution of Newton's constant and the dipolar emission parameter $\kappa_D$. For the best of our three pulsars (PSR J1713+0747), we obtain $\dot{G}/G = (0.32 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{-12}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence, along with a stringent constraint on the dipolar emission parameter, $\kappa_D = (-0.04 \pm 0.14) \times 10^{-4}$. Thanks to the recent high-precision timing data sets, we provide updated bounds on key parameters relevant to modified gravity theories, and we find that our results are consistent with GR.</description>

      <title>Topological dark energy from spacetime foam: A challenge for $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using only the standard considerations of spacetime foam and the Euclidean Quantum Gravity techniques known long ago, we result to a model of Topological Dark Energy (TDE) that outperforms the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm with regard to data fitting efficiency. Specifically, it is known that at the foam level, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the particular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective dynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the latter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can immediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of the topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this TDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic evolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We confront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with Pantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets. By applying standard model selection methods (AIC and DevIC information criteria), we find a moderate but statistically significant preference over $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Finally, we show that the TDE scenario passes constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and thus does not spoil the thermal history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Galaxy quenching across the Cosmic Web: disentangling mass and environment with SDSS DR18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of large-scale cosmic web environments on galaxy quenching using a volume-limited, stellar mass-matched galaxy sample from SDSS DR18. Galaxies are classified as residing in sheets, filaments, or clusters based on the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor derived from the smoothed density field. The quenched fraction increases with stellar mass and is highest in clusters, intermediate in filaments, and lowest in sheets, reflecting the increasing efficiency of environmental quenching with density. A flattening of the quenched fraction beyond $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 10.6$ across all environments signals a transition from environment-driven to mass-driven quenching. In contrast, the bulge fraction continues to rise beyond this threshold, indicating a decoupling between star formation suppression and morphological transformation. At the high-mass end ($\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \gtrsim 11.5$), both quenched and bulge fractions bifurcate, increasing in clusters but declining in sheets, suggesting a divergent evolutionary pathway where massive galaxies in sheets retain cold gas and disk-like morphologies, potentially sustaining or rejuvenating star formation. The AGN fraction also increases with stellar mass and is somewhat higher in sheets than in clusters, indicating enhanced AGN activity in low-density, gas-rich environments. The high-mass trends are independently corroborated by our analysis of specific star formation rate, $(u-r)$ colour, concentration index, and D4000 in the stellar mass-density plane, which show that massive galaxies in sheets remain bluer, younger, more star-forming, and structurally less evolved than their cluster counterparts. Our results highlight the cosmic web as an active driver of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>A New Gravitational Wave Probe to the Nature of Dark Energy from the Aging of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most dominant energy budgets in the Universe is Dark Energy, which remains enigmatic since its existence was first claimed based on observations of late-time cosmic acceleration. We propose a new way of inferring the dark energy equation of state (EoS) by measuring the aging of the Universe using only gravitational wave (GW) signals from coalescing binary compact objects of any masses. We show that the behavior of dark energy as the Universe ages will lead to a change in the observed chirp mass of GW sources inferred from observations of different stages of their coalescence. This change can be studied by monitoring a coherent source over a few years, with two well-separated GW frequencies. With a coordinated network of GW detectors that can reach a sensitivity of Big Bang Observer, we can reach a $5\sigma$ detection of the dark energy EoS parameter $w_0=-1$ and its variation with cosmic time by using stellar origin binary black holes and binary neutron stars up to high redshift over 10 years of observation time without using any external calibrator. If the next generation of GW detectors can achieve this precision, then it can open a new window to discover the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Non-linear effects on the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background anisotropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) anisotropies contain valuable information about the physics of the early universe. Given that General Relativity is intrinsically nonlinear, it is important to look beyond first-order contributions in cosmological perturbations. In this work, we present a non-perturbative approach for the computation of CGWB anisotropies at large scales, providing the extension of the initial conditions and the Sachs-Wolfe effect for the CGWB, which encodes the full non-linearity of the scalar metric perturbations. We also derive the non-perturbative expression for three-point correlation of the gravitational wave energy density perturbation in the case of an inflationary CGWB with a scale-invariant power spectrum and negligible primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that, under such conditions, the gravitational wave energy density perturbations are lognormally distributed, leading to an interesting effect such as intermittency.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Bias due to non-Gaussian Foregrounds in an Optimal Reconstruction of CMB Lensing and Temperature Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the magnitude of the bias due to non-Gaussian extragalactic foregrounds on the optimal reconstruction of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing potential and temperature power spectra. The reconstruction is performed using a Bayesian inference method known as the marginal unbiased score expansion (MUSE). We apply MUSE to a minimum variance combination of multifrequency maps drawn from the Agora publicly available simulations of the lensed CMB and correlated extragalactic foreground emission. Taking noise levels appropriate to the SPT-3G D1 release, we find non-Gaussian foregrounds may bias the MUSE reconstruction of the lensing potential amplitude at the level of $(0.7\pm 0.3)\,\sigma$ when using modes up to $\ell_{max}=3500$. We do not detect a statistically significant bias, finding a value of $(-0.4\pm 0.3)\,\sigma$, when restricted to lower angular multipoles, $\ell_{max}=3000$. This work is a first step toward understanding the impact of extragalactic foregrounds on optimal reconstructions of CMB temperature and lensing potential power spectra.</description>

      <title>In search of an interaction in the dark sector through Gaussian Process and ANN approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether the current observational data indicate any evidence of interaction between the dark sector is a matter of supreme interest at the present moment. This article searched for an interaction in the dark sector between a pressure-less dark matter and a dark energy fluid with constant equation of state, $w_{\rm DE}$. For this purpose, two non-parametric approaches, namely, the Gaussian Process (GP) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been employed and using the Hubble data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Pantheon+ from Supernovae Type Ia and their combination we have reconstructed the interaction function. We find that for $w_{\rm DE} =-1$, the interaction in the dark sector is not prominent while for $w_{\rm DE} \neq -1$, evidence of interaction is found depending on the value of $w_{\rm DE}$. In particularly, we find that if we start deviating from $w_{\rm DE} = -1$ either in the quintessence ($w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$) or phantom ($w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$) direction, an emergence of dark interaction is observed from both GP and ANN reconstructions. We further note that ANN which is applied for the first time in this context seems to play a very efficient role compared to GP.</description>

      <title>Attention-based Neural Network Emulators for Multi-Probe Data Vectors Part III: Modeling The Next Generation Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning can accelerate cosmological inferences that involve many sequential evaluations of computationally expensive data vectors. Previous works in this series have examined how machine learning architectures impact emulator accuracy and training time for optical shear and galaxy clustering 2-point function. In this final manuscript, we explore neural network performance when emulating Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization power spectra. We maximize the volume of applicability in the parameter space of our emulators within the standard $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter model while ensuring that errors are below cosmic variance. Relative to standard multi-layer perceptron architectures, we find the dot-product-attention mechanism reduces the number of outliers among testing cosmologies, defined as the fraction of testing points with $\Delta \chi^2 &gt; 0.2$ relative to \textsc{CAMB} outputs, for a wide range of training set sizes. Such precision enables attention-based emulators to be directly applied to real data without requiring any additional correction via importance sampling. Combined with pre-processing techniques and optimized activation and loss functions, attention-based models can meet the precision criteria set by current and future CMB and lensing experiments. For each of Planck, Simons Observatory, CMB S4, and CMB HD, we find the fraction of outlier points to be less than $10\%$ with around $2\times10^5$ to $4\times10^5$ training data vectors. We further explore the applications of these methods to supernova distance, weak lensing, and galaxy clustering, as well as alternative architectures and pre-processing techniques.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Bursts Calibrated by Using Artificial Neural Networks from the Pantheon+ Sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we calibrate the luminosity relation of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) which is employed to analyze the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in a manner independent of cosmological assumptions. The A219 GRB dataset are used to calibrate the Amati relation (\(E_{\rm p}\)-\(E_{\rm iso}\)) at low redshift with the ANN framework, facilitating the construction of the Hubble diagram at higher redshifts. Cosmological models are constrained with GRBs at high-redshift and the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical approach. For the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model within a flat universe, we obtain \(\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.321^{+0.078}_{-0.069}\), \(h = 0.654^{+0.053}_{-0.071}\), \(w_0 = -1.02^{+0.67}_{-0.50}\), and \(w_a = -0.98^{+0.58}_{-0.58}\) at the 1-\(\sigma\) confidence level, which indicating a preference for dark energy with potential redshift evolution (\(w_a \neq 0\)). These findings by using ANN align closely with those derived from GRBs calibrated by using Gaussian Processes.</description>

      <title>Whispers from the Early Universe: The Ringdown of Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by the ringdown phase of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. As the ringdown signal is independent of the PBH formation mechanism, the resulting SGWB offers a model-independent probe of PBHs. We numerically compute the ringdown waveform and derive the corresponding SGWB. We show that such a signal could be detected by future pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) for PBHs heavier than the solar mass. Additionally, we evaluate the SGWB from binary PBH mergers and demonstrate that it lies within the sensitivity bands of next-generation ground-based interferometers such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, suggesting a multi-band observational strategy for probing the PBH dark matter scenario.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincar\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Tidal adaptive softening and artificial fragmentation in cosmological simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional N-body methods introduce localised perturbations in the gravitational forces governing their evolution. These perturbations lead to an artificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale Structure, often referred to as "beads-on-a-string." This issue is particularly apparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at small spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations induced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the suppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian perturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown to minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we investigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for dark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the severity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly improves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a fixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious haloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial conditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo formation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening counterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore, initialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in z=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This sphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying spurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology. We propose potential strategies for reducing spurious haloes without abandoning current N-body methods.</description>

      <title>21 Balmer Jump Street: The Nebular Continuum at High Redshift and Implications for the Bright Galaxy Problem, UV Continuum Slopes, and Early Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the physical origin and spectroscopic impact of extreme nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies. The nebular continuum, which can appear during an extreme starburst, is of particular importance as it tends to redden UV slopes and has a significant contribution to the UV luminosities of galaxies. Furthermore, its shape can be used to infer the gas density and temperature of the interstellar medium. First, we provide a theoretical background, showing how different stellar populations (SPS models, initial mass functions (IMFs), and stellar temperatures) and nebular conditions impact observed galaxy spectra. We demonstrate that, for systems with strong nebular continuum emission, 1) UV fluxes can increase by up to 0.7~mag (or more in the case of hot/massive stars) above the stellar continuum, which may help reconcile the surprising abundance of bright high-redshift galaxies and the elevated UV luminosity density at $z&gt;10$, 2) at high gas densities, UV slopes can redden from $\beta&lt;-2.5$ to $\beta\sim-1$, 3) observational measurements of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ are gross underestimates, and 4) UV downturns from two-photon emission can masquerade as damped Ly$\alpha$ systems. Second, we present a dataset of 58 galaxies observed with NIRSpec on JWST at $2.5&lt;z&lt;9.0$ that are selected to have strong nebular continuum emission via the detection of the Balmer jump. Five of the 58 spectra are consistent with being dominated by nebular emission, exhibiting both a Balmer jump and a UV downturn consistent with two-photon emission. For some galaxies, this may imply the presence of hot massive stars and a top-heavy IMF. We conclude by exploring the properties of spectroscopically confirmed $z&gt;10$ galaxies, finding that UV slopes and UV downturns are in some cases redder or steeper than expected from SPS models, which may hint at more exotic (e.g. hotter/more massive stars or AGN) ionizing sources.</description>

      <title>The rise of the galactic empire: luminosity functions at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$ estimated with the MIDIS$+$NGDEEP ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as $16&lt;z&lt;25$ galaxy candidates using the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date (5$\sigma$ depths $\sim31.5$ mag at $\geq2$ $\mu$m), provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP). We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$. The number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes $-19&lt;M_\mathrm{UV}&lt;-18$ at $z\sim17$ ($z\sim25$) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at $z\sim12$; the luminosity density presents a similar evolution. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at $z=17-25$ in $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{DM}=10^{8.5-9.5}$ M$_\odot$ dark matter halos, provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense compact starbursts with enhanced emissivity linked to strong burstiness, low or primordial gas metallicities, and/or a top-heavy initial mass function. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above $z\sim20$ in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function would predict a more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our $z&gt;16$ candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations $\mathrm{A(V)}&lt;0.1$ mag. Their average stellar mass is $\mathrm{M}_\bigstar\sim10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, implying a stellar-to-baryon mass fraction around 10% if the emissivity increases with redshift, or significantly higher otherwise. Three candidates present very blue UV spectral slopes ($\beta\sim-3$) compatible with Pop III young ($\lesssim10$ Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons; the rest have $\beta\sim-2.5$ similar to $z=10-12$ samples.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework to study the relation between the stellar mass of a galaxy and the total mass of its host dark matter halo using galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We model a wide range of scales, roughly from $\sim 100 \; {\rm kpc}$ to $\sim 100 \; {\rm Mpc}$, using a theoretical framework based on the Halo Occupation Distribution and data from Year 3 of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset. The new advances of this work include: 1) the generation and validation of a new stellar mass-selected galaxy sample in the range of $\log M_\star/M_\odot \sim 9.6$ to $\sim 11.5$; 2) the joint-modeling framework of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing that is able to describe our stellar mass-selected sample deep into the 1-halo regime; and 3) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) constraints from this dataset. In general, our SHMR constraints agree well with existing literature with various weak lensing measurements. We constrain the free parameters in the SHMR functional form $\log M_\star (M_h) = \log(\epsilon M_1) + f\left[ \log\left( M_h / M_1 \right) \right] - f(0)$, with $f(x) \equiv -\log(10^{\alpha x}+1) + \delta [\log(1+\exp(x))]^\gamma / [1+\exp(10^{-x})]$, to be $\log M_1 = 11.559^{+0.334}_{-0.415}$, $\log \epsilon = -1.689^{+0.333}_{-0.220}$, $\alpha = -1.637^{+0.107}_{-0.096}$, $\gamma = 0.588^{+0.265}_{-0.220}$ and $\delta = 4.227^{+2.223}_{-1.776}$. The inferred average satellite fraction is within $\sim 5-35\%$ for our fiducial results and we do not see any clear trends with redshift or stellar mass. Furthermore, we find that the inferred average galaxy bias values follow the generally expected trends with stellar mass and redshift. Our study is the first SHMR in DES in this mass range, and we expect the stellar mass sample to be of general interest for other science cases.</description>
