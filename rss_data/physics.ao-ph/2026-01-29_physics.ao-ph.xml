      <title>StormDiT: A generative AI model bridges the 2-6 hour 'gray zone' in precipitation nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate short-term warnings for extreme precipitation are critical for global disaster mitigation but are hindered by a persistent predictability barrier at the 2-6 hour horizon -- the "nowcasting gray zone." In this window, traditional observation-based extrapolation fails due to error accumulation, while numerical weather prediction is computationally too slow to resolve storm-scale dynamics. Recent generative AI approaches attempt to bridge this gap by decomposing precipitation into separate deterministic advection and stochastic diffusion components. However, this decomposition can sever fundamental causal links between entangled atmospheric processes, such as the dynamic initiation of convection triggered by boundary advection. Here we present StormDiT, a unified generative model that treats weather evolution as a holistic spatiotemporal problem, learning the coupled physics of the gray zone without human-imposed structural priors. Trained on a massive dataset of 7,720 precipitation events from China, our model achieves a breakthrough in long-horizon stability. On a heavy-rainfall test set, it maintains skillful prediction for strong convection ($\ge$ 35 dBZ) with a Critical Success Index (CSI) near 0.2 across the full 6-hour forecast at 6-minute resolution. Crucially, the model exhibits superior probabilistic calibration, accurately quantifying operational risks. On the public SEVIR benchmark, our unified paradigm more than doubles the state-of-the-art 1-hour performance for heavy rain and establishes the first robust baseline for 3-hour forecasting. Furthermore, interpretability analysis reveals that the model attends to non-local physical precursors, such as outflow boundaries, explicitly validating its emergent understanding of convective organization.</description>

      <title>Evolving beyond collapse: An adaptive particle batch smoother for cryospheric data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new adaptive particle-based data assimilation scheme for cryospheric applications that leverages promising developments in importance sampling. The proposed approach seeks to combine some of the advantages of two widely used classes of schemes: particle methods and iterative ensemble Kalman methods. Specifically, it extends the PBS that is commonly used in cryospheric data assimilation, with the AMIS algorithm. This adaptive formulation transforms the PBS into an iterative scheme with improved resilience against ensemble collapse and the ability to implement early-stopping strategies. As such, computational cost is automatically adapted to the complexity of the problem at hand, even down to the grid-cell and water year level in distributed multiyear simulations. In homage to the schemes that it builds on, we coin this new algorithm the Adaptive Particle Batch Smoother (AdaPBS) and we test it across a range of scenarios. First, we conducted an intercomparison of some of the most commonly used cryospheric data assimilation algorithms using MCMC simulation as a costly gold-standard benchmark in a simplified temperature index model assimilating snow depth observations. We further evaluated AdaPBS by assimilating snow depth observations from the ESMSnowMIP project at 6 different sites spanning 3 continents, using an ensemble of simulations generated with the more complex FSM2. Our results demonstrate that AdaPBS is a robust and reliable tool, outperforming or at least matching the performance of other commonly used algorithms and successfully handling complex cases with dense observational datasets. All experiments were carried out using the open-source MuSA toolbox, which now includes AdaPBS and MCMC among the growing list of available cryospheric data assimilation methods.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Muon Measurements Near Tornadic and Non-Tornadic Storms in the US Central Plains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tornadoes and other severe weather hazards affect thousands of people every year. Despite this, the details surrounding tornadic processes including formation, decay, and longevity are not well understood, partially due to limitations of available instrumentation. Measurements of atmospheric pressure within tornadic systems currently rely almost entirely on in-situ instrumentation, and no existing techniques can provide two-dimensional spatial information of the atmospheric density field. Atmospheric muons may hold a solution to this problem: muons are attenuated by matter, and tornadic storms are large regions of low atmospheric density, suggesting that tornadic storms induce a directional perturbation on the atmospheric muon flux. Measurements of this perturbation could then be used to infer the density field associated with severe weather. Simulations of these systems indicate that a robust measurement of the atmospheric density field would require a relatively large muon detector, however smaller detectors may be able to detect ambient muon flux perturbations if the storm is large and intense enough. This paper presents results from a pilot field study that measured the atmospheric muon flux near tornadic storms during May 2025, including directional measurements of the muon flux near tornadic mesocyclones and a measurement of the muon flux near the base of a forming tornado.</description>

      <title>On the possible role of condensation-related hydrostatic pressure adjustments in intensification and weakening of tropical cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that condensation and precipitation do not disturb the hydrostatic equilibrium if the local pressure sink (condensation rate expressed in pressure units) is proportional to the local pressure, with a proportionality coefficient $k$ that is independent of altitude. In the real atmosphere, however, the condensation rate depends, among other factors, on the vertical velocity, which varies with height. As a result, condensation generally disturbs hydrostatic equilibrium and induces pressure adjustments through air-mass redistribution. We propose that a profile in which $k$ is maximized in the upper atmosphere leads to additional upward motion and cyclone intensification, whereas a maximum closer to the surface induces downward motion and cyclone weakening. The magnitude of both effects is expected to be set by the strength of the precipitation mass sink. Using observational data, we find that the median intensification and weakening rates -- $12$ and $8$~hPa~day$^{-1}$, respectively, measured over six-hour intervals in Atlantic tropical cyclones -- amount to about three quarters of the maximum concurrent precipitation rate (multiplied by gravity) in the core precipitation region. This implies intensification under conditions of positive vertically integrated air convergence, a regime impossible in modeled dry hurricanes, with the negative pressure tendency arising because precipitation exceeds the vertically integrated moisture convergence by absolute magnitude. The implications of these results for recent studies that evaluate tropical cyclone (de-)intensification using mass continuity equations that neglect the precipitation mass sink are discussed.</description>

      <title>Near-Inertial Pollard Waves Modeling the Arctic Halocline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit and exact solution to the governing equations describing the vertical structure of the Arctic Ocean region centred around the North Pole. The solution describes a stratified water column with three constant-density regions: a motionless bottom layer, a middle layer - the halocline - described by nonhydrostatic, near-inertial Pollard waves, and an upper layer presenting a mean current and a wave motion associated with the one in the halocline layer.</description>

      <title>ArchesClimate: Probabilistic Decadal Ensemble Generation With Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate projections have uncertainties related to components of the climate system and their interactions. A typical approach to quantifying these uncertainties is to use climate models to create ensembles of repeated simulations under different initial conditions. Due to the complexity of these simulations, generating such ensembles of projections is computationally expensive. In this work, we present ArchesClimate, a deep learning-based climate model emulator that aims to reduce this cost. ArchesClimate is trained on decadal hindcasts of the IPSL-CM6A-LR climate model at a spatial resolution of approximately 2.5x1.25 degrees. We train a flow matching model following ArchesWeatherGen, which we adapt to predict near-term climate. Once trained, the model generates states at a one-month lead time and can be used to auto-regressively emulate climate model simulations of any length. We show that for up to 10 years, these generations are stable and physically consistent. We also show that for several important climate variables, ArchesClimate generates simulations that are interchangeable with the IPSL model. This work suggests that climate model emulators could significantly reduce the cost of climate model simulations.</description>
