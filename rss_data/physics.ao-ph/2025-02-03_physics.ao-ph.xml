      <title>Probabilistic Joint Recovery Method for CO$_2$ Plume Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing CO$_2$ emissions is crucial to mitigating climate change. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one of the few technologies capable of achieving net-negative CO$_2$ emissions. However, predicting fluid flow patterns in CCS remains challenging due to uncertainties in CO$_2$ plume dynamics and reservoir properties. Building on existing seismic imaging methods like the Joint Recovery Method (JRM), which lacks uncertainty quantification, we propose the Probabilistic Joint Recovery Method (pJRM). By estimating posterior distributions across surveys using a shared generative model, pJRM provides uncertainty information to improve risk assessment in CCS projects.</description>

      <title>Disentangling discrete and continuous spectra of tidally forced internal waves in shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation of internal waves driven by barotropic tides over seafloor topography is a central issue in developing mixing and wave drag parameterizations. Traditional analytical methods for calculating the energy conversion rate from barotropic tides to internal waves rely on expanding a wave field into discrete eigenmodes. However, this modal expansion becomes inadequate when a sheared background current is present, as singular solutions accompanied by critical levels emerge. To uncover the distinct roles of regular eigenmodes and singular solutions in tidal energy conversion, this study analytically investigates wave generation over a localized bottom obstacle in the presence of shear flow under a basic irrotational condition. Using horizontal Fourier and temporal Laplace transforms, we identify regions in the topographic wave number and forcing frequency space where unbounded energy growth occurs. These regions coincide with the spectrum of an operator governing free wave propagation and comprise the discrete and continuous parts, which correspond to regular eigenmodes and singular solutions, respectively. Asymptotic evaluation of the Fourier integral reveals that the flow field far from the obstacle consists of standing wave trains associated with the discrete spectrum and evolving wave packets associated with the continuous spectrum. Away from the obstacle, the velocity amplitudes of wave packets decay, but their vertical gradients grow in the horizontal direction--in contrast to a single-wave number solution attracted towards a particular critical level. Finally, we derive a formula for the net barotropic-to-baroclinic energy conversion rate, extending the classical one by incorporating the contributions from both the discrete and continuous spectra.</description>

      <title>Fixing the Double Penalty in Data-Driven Weather Forecasting Through a Modified Spherical Harmonic Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in data-driven weather forecasting models have delivered deterministic models that outperform the leading operational forecast systems based on traditional, physics-based models. However, these data-driven models are typically trained with a mean squared error loss function, which causes smoothing of fine scales through a "double penalty" effect. We develop a simple, parameter-free modification to this loss function that avoids this problem by separating the loss attributable to decorrelation from the loss attributable to spectral amplitude errors. Fine-tuning the GraphCast model with this new loss function results in sharp deterministic weather forecasts, an increase of the model's effective resolution from 1,250km to 160km, improvements to ensemble spread, and improvements to predictions of tropical cyclone strength and surface wind extremes.</description>
