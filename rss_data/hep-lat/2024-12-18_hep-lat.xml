      <title>Hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$ using twisted-mass fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on our preliminary results from the lattice-QCD computation of the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We use twisted-mass $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ gauge ensembles at the physical point generated by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC).</description>

      <title>Measurement of the TMD soft function on the lattice using the auxiliary field representation of the Wilson line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse momentum dependent (TMD) soft function and Collins-Soper (CS) kernel may be obtained by formulating the Wilson line in terms of auxiliary one-dimensional fermion fields on the lattice. Our computation takes place in the region of the lattice that corresponds to the "spacelike" region in Minkowski space in order to obtain the Collins soft function. The matching of our result to the Collins soft function is achieved through the mapping of the auxiliary field directional vector that to the Wilson line rapidity. In Euclidean space, this directional vector is complex, having a purely imaginary time component. We present some exploratory numerical results of our lattice calculation, and discuss the methodology employed.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolving Normalising Flows for Lattice Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a renormalisation group inspired normalising flow that combines benefits from traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and standard normalising flows to sample lattice field theories. Specifically, we use samples from a coarse lattice field theory and learn a stochastic map to the targeted fine theory. The devised architecture allows for systematic improvements and efficient sampling on lattices as large as $128 \times 128$ in all phases when only having sampling access on a $4\times 4$ lattice. This paves the way for reaping the benefits of traditional MCMC methods on coarse lattices while using normalising flows to learn transformations towards finer grids, aligning nicely with the intuition of super-resolution tasks. Moreover, by optimising the base distribution, this approach allows for further structural improvements besides increasing the expressivity of the model.</description>

      <title>Constraining fermionic condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theories with fermionic order parameters and construct, for the first time in the literature, the constraint effective potential for it. The Grassmann-valued constraint we encounter is handled using its large-volume expansion, corresponding to a saddle-point approximation. We test the method in the chiral Gross-Neveu model and demonstrate its consistency with the standard approach. The machinery we developed opens up a new avenue to investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking and restoration in field theories, in particular for the chiral symmetry breaking in the strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Nucleon sigma terms with a variational analysis from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the nucleon-sigma terms from lattice QCD. We find that the dominant excited state contamination in the nucleon three-point function with a scalar current is due to the transition between the nucleon and a S-wave scattering state of a nucleon and a scalar (sigma) meson. In this proof-of-concept study, we analyse a single $N_f=3$ ensemble with the unphysically large pion mass $M_\pi=429$~MeV. Excited state contamination is substantially reduced compared to the standard method when employing nucleon-sigma type interpolating operators within a generalised eigenvector analysis.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Fermion Cartography: from confinement and chiral symmetry breaking to conformality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study, for the first time, the interplay between colour-confining and chiral symmetry-breaking dynamics in gauge-fermion systems with a general number of flavours and colours. Specifically, we work out the flavour dependence of the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking scales. We connect the QCD-like regime, in quantitative agreement with lattice data, with the perturbative conformal limit, thereby exploring uncharted region of theory space. This analysis is done within the first-principles functional renormalisation group approach to gauge-fermion systems and is facilitated by a novel approximation scheme introduced here. This novel scheme enables a relatively simple access to the confining dynamics. This allows us to investigate the whole landscape of many-flavour theories and to provide a cartography of their phase structure. In particular, we uncover a novel phase with the locking of confining and chiral dynamics at intermediate flavour numbers. We also explore the close-conformal region that displays a walking behaviour. Finally, we provide a quantitative estimate for the lower boundary of the conformal Caswell-Banks-Zaks window, with a $N^{\rm crit}_f(N_c=3)= 9.60^{+0.55}_{-0.53}$. This work offers a self-consistent framework for charting the landscape of strongly interacting gauge-fermion theories necessary to reliably study strongly coupled extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Aharonov-Bohm cages and tight meson confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-loop gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-density phases of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) of interconnected loops and dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges. The gauge-invariant Wilson terms, accounting for the magnetic flux threading each loop, correspond to simple two-body Ising interactions in this setting. Such terms control the interference of charges tunneling around the loops, leading to dynamical Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cages that are delimited by loops threaded by a $\pi$-flux. The latter can be understood as $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortices, the analog of visons in two dimensional LGTs, which become mobile by adding quantum fluctuations through an external electric field. In contrast to a semi-classical regime of static and homogeneous AB cages, the mobile visons can self-assemble leading to AB cages of different lengths depending on the density of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges and the interplay of magnetic and electric terms. Inside these cages, the individual charges get confined into tightly-bound charge-neutral pairs, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ analogue of mesons. Depending on the region of parameter space, these tightly-bound mesons can propagate within dilute AB-dimers that virtually expand and contract, or else move by virtually stretching and compressing an electric field string. Both limits lead to a Luttinger liquid described by a constrained integrable model. This phase is separated from an incompressible Mott insulator where mesons belong to closely-packed AB-trimers. In light of recent trapped-ion experiments for a single $\mathbb{Z}_2$ loop, these phases could be explored in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state via the $Z_c(3900)$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain the existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.</description>

      <title>Using massless fields for observing black hole features in the collapsed phase of Euclidean dynamical triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07081v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on an old computation of propagators of massless scalar fields on an ensemble of configurations in 4D Euclidean dynamical triangulations in the collapsed (crumpled) phase. The resulting quantum average is used to construct the scale factor of a 4-D rotational invariant metric. This new scale factor is non-zero at the origin, which we assume to be caused the presence of the well-known singular structure in the collapsed phase. The scale factor depends on an overall integration constant, which is determined by comparison with the implied volume at intermediate distances. We construct a transformation to a 3-D rotational invariant metric, which reveals Euclidean black hole features at an instant in time, with a horizon separating interior and exterior parts. Effective Einstein equations in the presence of a `geometric condensate' are assumed, and computed with the software OGRe. Also explored briefly is a qualitatively different (not preferred) interpretation of the data which follows from comparison with an inversely transformed Euclidean regular black hole metric.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD meets phase quenching: The pressure of cold quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonperturbative inequalities constrain the thermodynamic pressure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with its phase-quenched version, a Sign-Problem-free theory amenable to lattice treatment. In the perturbative regime with a small QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$, one of these inequalities manifests as an $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference between the phase-quenched and QCD pressures at large baryon chemical potential. In this work, we generalize state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques used in collider physics in vacuum quantum field theory to address large-scale multiloop computations at finite chemical potential, by direct numerical integration of Feynman diagrams in momentum space. Using this novel approach, we evaluate this $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference and show that it is a gauge-independent and small positive number compared to the known perturbative coefficients at this order. This implies that at high baryon densities, phase-quenched lattice simulations can provide a complementary nonperturbative method for accurately determining the pressure of cold quark matter at $O(\alpha_s^3)$.</description>

      <title>How the QCD trace anomaly behaves at the core of twin stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the dense and cold (normalized) QCD trace anomaly, $\Delta$, in the interior of twin neutron stars (obtained from several sets of equations of state in agreement with modern compact-star and multimessenger data) satisfying static and dynamic stability conditions. We scan the formed twin-star parameter space in order to look for effects caused by the presence of a strong first-order phase transition connecting hadron and quark phases by means of a Maxwell construction. We found robustly that $\Delta$ suffers an abrupt decrease around the transition point, even reaching large negative values ($\Delta\simeq-0.35$), in marked contrast to current studies pointing out a smooth behavior with $\Delta\gtrsim 0$ at all densities. Besides, we characterize the behavior of {the recently defined} conformal factor, $d_{c}$, in our four categories of twin stars for which we perform comparisons with theoretical constraints put, e.g. by Bayesian studies sometimes adjusted to agree with perturbative QCD at high densities. These analyses allow us to hypothesize modifications in the strong QCD coupling in dense nuclear matter with a strong thermodynamic discontinuity.</description>

      <title>A dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model and holographic quarkonium melting in a magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the potential reconstruction method to set up a dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model, which we then use to study holographic quarkonium melting in an external magnetic field. The non-linear nature of the model allows to couple the magnetic field to the quarkonium inner structure without having to introduce back-reacting charged flavour degrees of freedom. The magnetic field dependent melting temperature is computed from the spectral functions and suggests a switch from inverse magnetic to magnetic catalysis when the magnetic field increases. We also discuss the differences due to the anisotropy brought in by the external field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the weak semileptonic decay of the $ \Omega^{+}_{ccb} \rightarrow \Xi^{++}_{cc} ~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$, where a triply heavy baryon with spin 1/2 decays into the observed doubly heavy baryon with spin 1/2, using QCD sum rule method in all lepton channels. We compute the six relevant vector and axial vector form factors entering the low energy matrix elements in full theory. The invariant form factors are building blocks, using the fit faction of which in terms of $ q^2 $ in whole physical region, we calculate the exclusive widths in three lepton channels. Our predictions may help the present and future experiments in the course of their search for doubly and triply heavy baryons.</description>
