      <title>Optimal dynamical stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability is a fundamental concept that refers to a system's ability to return close to its original state after disturbances. The minimal conditions for stability when system parameters vary in time, though common in physics, have been largely overlooked. Here, we study the minimal amount of periodic stiffness a linear mass-spring system requires to remain stable and apply our findings to optimally trap the upside-down state of a compass in a time-varying magnetic field. We show that the ability to return close to its original state only needs to be ensured over small but precisely defined durations within each period for the system to achieve dynamic stability. These precise durations form a discrete set, remarkably predicted by rules analogous to those of quantum mechanics. This unexpected connection opens new avenues for controlling dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how complex quantum systems emulate randomness is central to quantum chaos, thermalization, and information theory. In one setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe asymptotic freeness between Heisenberg operators: the non-commutative generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct research direction, the concept of approximate unitary designs have led to efficient constructions of unitaries that look random according to forward-in-time protocols. Bridging these two concepts, in this work we study the emergence of freeness from a random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely the observables that lead to thermal correlations in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The RMPU ensemble provably forms a unitary design, but, we argue, this does not account for average OTOC behavior and therefore the emergence of freeness. We further compute the ensemble's frame potential exactly to second order, showing convergence to Haar values also with polynomial deviations, indicating that freeness is also reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand, to reproduce the Haar-like OTOC value for local, traceless observables, the considered ensemble requires volume-law operator entanglement. Such correlations therefore lie beyond the paradigm of random unitary features which can be replicated efficiently. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary designs in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for genuine quantum advantage while shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Remarkable similarities in distributions of dynamical observables in chaotic systems</title>

Abstract: The study of chaotic systems, where rare events play a pivotal role, is essential for understanding complex dynamics due to their sensitivity to initial conditions. Recently, tools from large deviation theory, typically applied in the context of stochastic processes, have been used in the study of chaotic systems. Here, we study dynamical observables, $A = \sum_{n=1}^N g(\textbf{x}_n)$, defined along a chaotic trajectory $\{\textbf{x}_1, \textbf{x}_2, \ldots, \textbf{x}_N\}$. For most choices of $g(\textbf{x})$, $A$ satisfies a central limit theorem: At large sequence size $N \gg 1$, typical fluctuations of $A$ follow a Gaussian distribution with a variance that scales linearly with $N$. Large deviations of $A$ are usually described by the large deviation principle, that is, $P(A) \sim e^{- N I(A/N)}$, where $I(a)$ is the rate function. We find that certain dynamical observables exhibit a remarkable statistical similarity: even when constructed with distinct functions $g_1(\textbf{x})$ and $g_2(\textbf{x})$, different observables are described by the same rate function. We provide a physical interpretation for this striking similarity by showing that $g_1(\textbf{x})-g_2(\textbf{x})$ belongs to a class of functions that we call ``derived''. Furthermore, we show that if $g(\textbf{x})$ itself is ``derived'', then the distribution of $A$ becomes independent of $N$ in the large-$N$ limit, and is generally non-Gaussian (although it is mirror-symmetric). We demonstrate that the position observable for certain open maps, used to model random walks and the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) for the logistic map are of this derived form, thus providing a simple explanation for some existing results.</description>

      <title>Stable synchronised states of coupled Tchebyscheff maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0110007</link>
      <description>arXiv:nlin/0110007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled Tchebyscheff maps have recently been introduced to explain parameters in the standard model of particle physics, using the stochastic quantisation of Parisi and Wu. This paper studies dynamical properties of these maps, finding analytic expressions for a number of periodic states and determining their linear stability. Numerical evidence is given for nonlinear stability of these states, and also the presence of exponentially slow dynamics for some ranges of the parameter. These results indicate that a theory of particle physics based on coupled map lattices must specify strong physical arguments for any choice of initial conditions, and explain how stochastic quantisation is obtained in the many stable parameter regions.</description>
