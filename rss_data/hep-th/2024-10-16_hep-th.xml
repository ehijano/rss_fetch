      <title>The Feyn-Structure of Yangian Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yangian-type differential operators are shown to constrain Feynman integrals beyond the restriction to integrable graphs. In particular, we prove that all position-space Feynman diagrams at tree level feature a Yangian level-one momentum symmetry as long as their external coordinates are distinct. This symmetry is traced back to a set of more elementary bilocal operators, which annihilate the integrals. In dual momentum space, the considered Feynman graphs represent multi-loop integrals without `loops of loops', generalizing for instance the family of so-called train track or train track network diagrams. The extension of these results to integrals with massive propagators on the boundary of the Feynman graph is established. When specializing to the dual conformal case, where propagator powers sum up to the spacetime dimension at each position-space vertex, the symmetry extends to the full dual conformal Yangian. Hence, our findings represent a generalization of the statements on the Yangian symmetry of Feynman integrals beyond integrability and reveal its origin lying in a set of more elementary bilocal annihilators. Previous applications of the Yangian suggest to employ the resulting differential equations for bootstrapping multi-loop integrals beyond the dual conformal case. The considered bilocal constraints on Feynman integrals resemble the definition of conformal partial waves via Casimir operators, but are based on a different algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>A Background-Independent Closed String Action at Tree Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an off-shell bosonic string action that removes the renormalization window constraint of [1]. To all orders in conformal perturbation theory, this action allows for deformations of the worldsheet theory by any primary or descendant irrelevant deformation. Non-perturbatively, this action has no spurious solutions on the space of all worldsheet theories with a unitary matter sector that flows from a UV fixed point. We find that non-minimal couplings dressed with more than one factor of the Ricci curvature behave as gauge redundancies. As part of our investigation of this action, we find non-smooth behavior in the Zamolodchikov $C$-function. Our results mostly apply to Euclidean-signature target spaces, but can be extended to Lorentzian backgrounds which are invariant under time translations and CTO symmetry.</description>

      <title>Soft Metric Fluctuations During Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conservation of the long wavelength fluctuations of the metric plays a vital role in cosmology as the link between quantum fluctuations during inflation and late time observations. This is a well-known property of the classical evolution equations, but demonstrating that it is robust to quantum correction involves a number of technical arguments. In this paper, we will use effective field theory (EFT) techniques to demonstrate the all orders conservation of the super-horizon scalar and tensor fluctuations of the metric during inflation. We show how to construct an EFT for these soft modes, in analogy with Soft de Sitter Effective Theory. We pay particular attention to how the breaking of time-diffeomorphisms by the inflationary background introduces new time scales that alter the structure of the EFT. In this description, the all orders conservation of the metric fluctuations is a direct consequence of symmetries and power counting that cannot be altered by loop corrections. We further show that this holds when the inflaton (or metric fluctuations) is coupled to additional heavy fields, as in quasi-single field inflation. We match this behavior to several calculations in the ultraviolet (UV) theory and show how the Mellin representation enables a more transparent connection between the UV and the EFT descriptions.</description>

      <title>Exact relations between running of $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha$ in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric QCD-like theories we derive the (all-order) exact equations relating the renormalization group behaviour of the strong and electromagnetic couplings and prove that they are valid in the HD+MSL renormalization prescription. In particular, the $\beta$-function of ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD can be expressed in terms of the Adler $D$-function. If all favors have the same absolute value of the electromagnetic charges, it is also possible to write a simple relation between the $\beta$-functions for the strong and electromagnetic coupling constants. In this particular case there is a special renormalization group invariant relation.</description>

      <title>Dualities from dualities in 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ dualities between SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental and antisymmetric chiral matter and Landau-Ginzburg theories with chiral and Fermi multiplets. Many of these dualities can be derived by topologically twisting 4d s-confining gauge theories on a two-sphere, with integer non-negative $R$ charges. We provide various checks of the dualities, showing that they descend from more "basic" dualities, similarly to analogous derivations in higher dimensions. The proof are based on the fact that the antisymmetric tensors can be traded with USp(2n) gauge theories with fundamental chirals, mimicking the higher dimensional mechanism known as tensor deconfinement. The quivers obtained in this way can be shown to be dual to LG models after applying other elementary "basic" dualities.</description>

      <title>Unifying error-correcting code/Narain CFT correspondences via lattices over integers of cyclotomic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) that correspond to code lattices for quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) over integers of cyclotomic fields $Q(\zeta_p)$ $(\zeta_p=e^{\frac{2\pi i}p})$ for general prime $p\geq 3$. This code-lattice construction is a generalization of more familiar ones such as Construction A${}_C$ for ternary codes and (after the generalization stated below) Construction A for binary codes, containing them as special cases. This code-lattice construction is redescribed in terms of root and weight lattices of Lie algebras, which allows to construct lattices for codes over rings $Z_q$ with non-prime $q$. Corresponding Narain CFTs are found for codes embedded into quotient rings of root and weight lattices of $ADE$ series, except $E_8$ and $D_k$ with $k$ even. In a sense, this provides a unified description of the relationship between various QECCs over $F_p$ (or $Z_q$) and Narain CFTs.</description>

      <title>A Hodge Theory for Entanglement Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <title>Poincare field theory for massive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is ambitious pretension formulated by Weinberg \cite{W} that {\it any relativistic quantum theory will look at sufficiently low energy like a quantum field theory.} It is based on the observation that for formulation of quantum field theory {\it ... much better starting point is Wigner's definition of particles as representations of inhomogeneous Lorentz group} \cite{Wi, BW}.
  To achieve that Ref.\cite{W} starts with particles and get to the field equations later. Here we propose a complementary approach and directly introduce field equations as Casimir eigenvalue problem. Note that Casimir invariants commute with all group elements and therefore commute between each other. So, they have common eigenvalues (for Poincare group mass and spin ) and common eigenstates (here irreducible representation of Poincare group).
  We use derivatives as standard representation for momenta $P_a \to i \partial_a$ and introduce representation for arbitrary spin operator $ S_{a b} $ with the help of recurrence relations. To solve eigenvalue problem for Casimir operators we will go to the formulation with standard momentum, where differential equations turn to algebraic ones. Then for arbitrary field $\Psi^A $ we construct projection operators on particular spins. The irreducible representations, have a role of equations of motion.
  For fermions we can go to linear form of equations of motion and obtain Dirac equation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational instantons and the quality problem of the QCD axion: Facts, speculations, and statements in between</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we critically reanalyze the explicit breaking of the Peccei-Quinn global symmetry -- and the corresponding corrections to the QCD axion potential -- induced by gravity. Specifically, we examine the role of gravitational instantons, which are non-perturbative, finite-action solutions to the Euclidean Einstein equations. These instantons represent topologically nontrivial configurations of spacetime and are analogous to instantons in gauge theory. The amount of symmetry breaking induced by gravitational instantons can be computed in a controlled way within the framework of semi-classical gravity, using 't Hooft operators, in full analogy to the computation of the axion potential arising from QCD small instanton effects. Contrary to previous results in the literature, we find that the effects of gravitational instantons are extremely small and therefore do not give rise to a significant quality problem for the axion solution to the strong CP problem, both within the Standard Model and in beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios that involve multiple copies of the Standard Model. In conclusion, we argue that, assuming the ultraviolet completion of gravity is weakly coupled, the axion solution to the strong CP problem remains free from any quality issues due to gravity. Along the way, we derive the effective Lagrangian of the QCD axion, including its gravitational coupling.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing inflationary potential from NANOGrav 15-year Data: A robust study using Non-Bunch Davies initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the theoretical framework behind reconstruction of a generic class of inflationary potentials for canonical single-field slow-roll inflation in a model-independent fashion. The Non-Bunch Davies (NBD) initial condition is an essential choice to determine the structure of potential and to accommodate the blue-tilted tensor power spectrum feature recently observed in NANOGrav. Using the reconstruction technique we found the favoured parameter space which supports blue tilted tensor power spectrum. The validity of the EFT prescription in inflation is also maintained through the use of a new field excursion formula while keeping the necessary and sufficient conditions on the sub-Planckian field values in check. We find that the reconstructed potential display inflection point behaviour, which has deeper connection with high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring a novel Einstein--Rosen BTZ wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Einstein-Rosen BTZ wormhole metric as a solution to the Einstein field equations with a negative cosmological constant and explore in detail its various phenomenological aspects. We show that the wormhole metric is characterized by a horizon at the throat, resembling a black hole horizon. This implies that our wormhole metric describes a one-way traversable wormhole at the throat, with Hawking radiation observed by an observer located at some distance from the wormhole. It is also found the same Hawking temperature using the BTZ-like coordinates and Kruskal-like coordinates. This temperature is invariant not only on the type of coordinates but also the nature of the spin of quantum fields. Importantly, we find that at the wormhole throat, the spacetime is not a pure vacuum solution, but rather contains an exotic string matter source with negative tension, which may stabilize the wormhole geometry. To this end, we found that the size of the wormhole throat is proportional to the number of quantum bits suggesting a possible implications on ER=EPR. Further we studied the particle dynamics and, finally, we tested the ANEC with a test scalar and vector fields. For the double null-component computed in BTZ coordinates, we found an apparent divergence at the wormhole throat, which is then shown to be regularized by means of Kruskal-like coordinates. The ANEC for such a scalar/vector field is violated at the wormhole throat.</description>

      <title>Stationary BTZ space-time in Ricci-Inverse and $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore stationary BTZ space-time within the framework of modified gravity theory, specifically focusing on Ricci-inverse gravity. It is important to clarify that ``Ricci-inverse" refers to the inverse of the Ricci tensor, not the Ricci scalar. We consider a general class of this gravity theory, where the function $f$ is defined by $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$, with $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ representing the Ricci and anti-curvature scalars, respectively and $A^{\mu\nu}$ is the anti-curvature tensor. We demonstrate that stationary BTZ space-time is a valid solution in this novel gravity theory, wherein the cosmological constant undergoes modifications due to the coupling constants. Moreover, we study another modified gravity theory known as $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity and analyze the stationary BTZ space-time. Subsequently, we fully integrate the geodesic equations for BTZ space-time constructed within the Ricci-Inverse gravity, expressing the solutions in terms of elementary functions and compared with the GR result. We classify different types of geodesics, including null and time-like geodesics, under three conditions: (i) nonzero mass and angular momentum, $M \neq 0, J\neq 0$, (ii) massless $M=0$ and $J=0$, and (iii) $M=-1, J=0$, that is $AdS_3$-type, and analyze the results in modified gravity theories and compare with the general relativity case.</description>

      <title>Fake Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions describing a fake Schwarzschild black hole that cannot be distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole by observations. They are constructed by attaching a spherically symmetric dynamical interior solution with a matter field to the Schwarzschild exterior solution at the event horizon without a lightlike thin shell. The dynamical region inside a Killing horizon of a static spherically symmetric perfect-fluid solution obeying an equation of state $p=\chi\rho$ for $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$ can be the interior of a fake Schwarzschild black hole. The matter field inside such a black hole is an anisotropic fluid that violates at least the weak energy condition and can be interpreted as a spacelike (tachyonic) perfect fluid. While the author constructed the first model of fake Schwarzschild black holes using Semiz's solution for $\chi=-1/5$, we present another one using Whittaker's solution for $\chi=-1/3$ in this paper. We also present a model of fake Kerr black holes whose interior is filled with a different matter field violating only the dominant energy condition near the event horizon. Whether a fake Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole can be realized under the dominant energy condition is an open question.</description>

      <title>Inflationary and Gravitational Wave Signatures of Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that the semi-classical description of a black hole breaks down at the latest after losing an O(1) fraction of its mass. As a result, effects such as memory burden can slow down evaporation so that small primordial black holes (PBHs), in particular those in the mass range 10^6 g to 10^9 g, become viable dark matter candidates. In this paper, we investigate the production of PBHs from a prototype model of polynomial inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. We show that a sufficiently small PBH mass alleviates any tension with CMB observations. Moreover, we develop efficient numerical procedures to identify model parameters and evolve Mukhanov-Sasaki modes to place bounds on the scalar-induced stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Whilst we identify some prospects for observation with future GW detectors, our results highlight the need to develop new experiments for high-frequency GW detection in the ~kHz to ~MHz range. Finally, we demonstrate that previously-used ans\"atze for modelling the power spectrum only yield a reliable approximation for the GW signal if some input from inflation is used.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of charged black holes embedded in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical environments are ubiquitous in the Universe; from accretion disks around black holes to galactic dark matter halos, distributions of astrophysical material veil the vast majority of Cosmos. Including environmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a rather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena. Here, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of superradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar waves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged black hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively generic, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of massless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged black holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black holes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar wave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of mass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant amplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction' that the mass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently large scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly affected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational interaction between the dense halo and the wave's mass grows, thus further suppressing the superradiant amplification.</description>

      <title>A third law of black hole mechanics for supersymmetric black holes and a quasi-local mass-charge inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that a third law of black hole mechanics does not hold for Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a massless charged scalar field: there exist solutions that describe gravitational collapse to form an exactly extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in finite time. In this paper it is proved that such solutions do not exist in theories with matter fields satisfying a local mass-charge inequality. In such a theory, if a 2-surface has the same metric, extrinsic curvature, and Maxwell field as a cross-section of an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om horizon then this surface cannot have a compact interior and so cannot be a horizon cross-section of a black hole formed in gravitational collapse. This result is proved using spinorial techniques, which are also used to prove a mass-charge inequality for a modified version of the Dougan-Mason quasi-local mass.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle and the Zeeman Effect: Relativistic Corrections Unveiled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the relativistic corrections to the Zeeman effect for hydrogen-like atoms based on the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We propose a relativistic GUP algebra using the Stetsko and Tkachuk approximation and incorporate these corrections into the Zeeman effect. In the relativistic limit, our results recover previously derived GUP corrections as well as the standard Lande energy shift expression when GUP effects are absent. This work presents a generalized expression that accounts for both relativistic and GUP corrections to the Zeeman effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety is a promising framework towards the understanding, in a non-perturbative way, of Quantum Gravity. It treats the Newton's constant G_N and the cosmological constant \Lambda as running coupling of an effective action. At the phenomenological point of view the values of G_N and \Lambda depend on the energy density of the system under consideration. This fact has interesting astrophysical and cosmological consequences. The present work discusses the effects on the distance measurements from SNIa light curves and on the strong and weak gravitational lensing measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the gravitational signatures of a static nonlinear electromagnetic extension of the Kerr-Newman solution. We conduct an analysis of light propagation, focusing on the photon sphere, shadow formation, and geodesic trajectories in this spacetime. The deflection angle and the time delay effects are also considered. In the thermodynamic analysis, we examine the Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, and the emission of Hawking radiation via the tunneling process. The remnant mass and evaporation time of the black hole at its final stage are estimated. Lastly, we calculate the quasinormal modes using the WKB approximation to capture the characteristic oscillations of the system.</description>

      <title>Warm non-minimally coupled Peccei-Quinn Inflation and de Sitter Swampland Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the dynamics of warm inflation within a non-minimally coupled Peccei-Quinn (PQ) framework and evaluate its compatibility with the de Sitter Swampland Conjecture. Our model incorporates a PQ scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity, facilitating inflation through a dissipative process that sustains a thermal bath, thereby distinguishing it from conventional cold inflation. We analyze the dissipation coefficient defined as $\Gamma(T, \sigma) = C_n T^n \sigma^p M^{1-n-p}$, where $C_n$ is a dimensionless constant, $M$ is a mass scale, and $n$ and $p$ are numerical powers. Our investigation focuses on three specific cases: (a) A temperature-dependent dissipation coefficient with an inverse relation, $\Gamma = C_{-1}\,\sigma^2/T$, where $n=-1$ and $p=2$; (b) A dissipation coefficient linear in field $\phi$, $\Gamma = C_{0} \sigma$, where $n=0$ and $p=1$; and (c) A dissipation coefficient linear in temperature $T$, $\Gamma = C_{1} T$, where $n=1$ and $p=0$. By examining the slow-roll dynamics in these inflationary scenarios, we derive essential cosmological parameters, including the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We compare our results with the latest observational data from Planck 2018. Our findings suggest that the model is consistent with observational constraints while simultaneously satisfying the de Sitter Swampland conditions.</description>

      <title>Finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole and its perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole possesses nontrivial Lorentz charges compared with the standard one. This may impact the quasinormal modes of the supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole. Since the Einstein's equations are generally covariant, the quasinormal modes of a supertranslated black hole can be obtained by supertranslating the familiar results for a standard black hole. It turns out that the supertranslated quasinormal modes can be obtained by simply shifting the retarded time of the standard modes by an angle-dependent function parameterizing the supertranslation. Therefore, the supertranslated quasinormal modes oscillate at the same frequencies and decay at the same rates as the corresponding standard ones. Although a supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole shares the same exact symmetries of the standard one, its metric does not explicitly respect these symmetries. However, one can define an asymptotic parity transformation, such that any perturbation can be decomposed into the even and odd parity parts. Then, one may conclude that the isospectrality still holds. To detect such supertranslated quasinormal modes, one has to place multiple gravitational wave interferometers around the supertranslated black hole, and measure the differences in the time shifts between interferometers. Gravitational lensing may also be helpful in the same spirit.</description>

      <title>Particle production rate for a dynamical system using the path integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the particle creation rate in a dynamical (Vaidya) spacetime using Feynman's path integral formalism within the framework of the effective action approach. We analyze particle production rates in the region of dynamical horizons, revealing an initial high rate followed by a rapid decline in all cases. Additionally, we explore the thermodynamic properties by calculating the surface gravity and corresponding Hayward-Kodama temperatures for each scenario. Graphical representations show the variation of surface gravity over time for the three cases, offering insights into the system's thermodynamic evolution. Our research investigates the connection between background geometry and the particle creation process, placing it within the broader context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The non-stationary nature of Vaidya geometry is highlighted as a valuable framework for examining the dynamic aspects of particle creation. This in-depth analysis enhances our understanding of quantum processes in curved spacetime and may offer insights relevant to thermodynamics and studies of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Fifth Force Using the Earth as a Spin and Mass Source from the Chinese Space Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of conducting an experiment on the Chinese Space Station (CSS) to constrain beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) long-range spin- and velocity-dependent interactions, which are mediated by the exchange of an ultralight $\left(m_{z^{\prime}}&lt;10^{-10}\text{eV}\right)$ or massless intermediate vector boson. We demonstrate that the proposed experiment on the CSS offers several advantages compared to ground-based experiments. The high speed can enhance the sensitivity to velocity-dependent interactions. The periodicity allows efficient extraction of signals from background noises, thereby strengthening the experiment's accuracy. Combining these advantages, one can improve the existing bounds on such interactions by up to five orders of magnitude. With advancements in sensor technology, we anticipate a further enhancement of four orders of magnitude, resulting in a total potential improvement of up to nine orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: We construct a simple model of a closed FLRW spacetime by starting from a flat five dimensional scalar field space with a quartic potential. The action contains no curvature terms. The spacetime metric is uniquely determined from the dynamical equations of the metric tensor. An SO(4) invariant ansatz for the scalar fields is shown to lead to a linearly expanding universe provided that the cosmological constant is negative.</description>

      <title>Modified $f(R,T)$ theory in light of gravitational wave standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we ponder observational constraints on the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity, where the gravitational action is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ plus the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. For this purpose, we utilize recently available data, including cosmic microwave background, weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions measurements, together with future gravitational wave data from Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In particular, we create three LISA mock catalogs, namely Pop III, Delay, and No Delay, to improve the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters from current observations. Numerical analysis reveals that LISA standard sirens (SS) make improvements on constraining $f(R,T)$ model cosmological parameters. Moreover, MCMC results based on mock LISA SS denote strong evidence in favor of $f(R,T)$ gravity. Thereupon, we perceive that LISA SS are capable to provide novel constraints on modified theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Interacting hypersurfaces and multiple scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to construct ghostfree multiple scalar-tensor theory. The idea is to use geometric quantities of hypersurfaces specified by the scalar fields, instead of covariant derivatives of the scalar fields or spacetime curvature, to construct the theory. This approach has been proved useful in building ghostfree scalar-tensor theory in the single field case. In the presence of multiple scalar fields, each scalar field specifies a foliation of spacelike hypersurfaces, on which the normal vector, induced metric, extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures as well as extrinsic (Lie) and intrinsic (spatial) derivatives can be defined respectively. By using these hypersurface geometric quantities as building blocks, we can construct the Lagrangian for interacting hypersurfaces, which describes multiple scalar-tensor theory. Since temporal (Lie) and spatial derivatives are separated, it is relatively easier to control the order of time derivatives in order to evade ghostlike or unwanted degrees of freedom. In this work, we take bi-scalar-field theory as an example and focus on polynomial-type Lagrangians. We construct monomials built of the hypersurface geometric quantities up to $d=3$, with $d$ the number of derivatives in each monomial. We also present the correspondence between expressions in terms of hypersurface quantities and the expressions of covariant bi-scalar-tensor theory. By performing a cosmological perturbation analysis of a simple model as an example, we show that the theory indeed propagates two tensor and two scalar degrees of freedom at the linear order in perturbations, and is thus free of any extra degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to compute real-time path integrals numerically, by Monte-Carlo sampling on near-Lefschetz thimbles. We present a collection of new tools, which together provide an alternative to existing methods such as the Generalised thimble. These involve a convenient coordinate parameterization of the thimble, direct numerical integration along a radial coordinate into an effective path integral weight and locally deforming the Lefschetz thimble using its Gaussian (non-interacting theory) counterpart in a region about the critical point. We apply this to quantum mechanics, identify possible pitfalls and benefits, and benchmark its efficiency.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? Electromagnetic and Gravitational Mode Mixing in NSBH Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of electromagnetic fields leaving imprints on gravitational wave (GW) signals from Neutron Star-Black hole (NSBH) mergers, specifically in the context of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Using black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) in the context of a minimally coupled Einstein-Maxwell system, we demonstrate that electromagnetic quasi normal modes(QNMs) can excite gravitational QNMs with frequencies that are linear or quadratic in the electromagnetic QNMs, at first level of mixing. Moreover, We then study the electromagnetism-gravity coupling by approximating the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli potentials with Dirac delta functions. In this example, we examine gravitational perturbations induced by the electromagnetic field of an ideal dipole radially free fall towards the blackhole, building on calculations from a companion paper [1]. Our results show that both linear and quadratic electromagnetic QNMs appear in gravitational perturbations. In addition, linear gravitational QNMs are also excited due to the electromagnetic source, with their amplitudes depending on the details of the electromagnetic and gravitational potentials, analogous to gravitational mode mixing analysis. Furthermore, at late stages, gravitational perturbations might exhibit polynomial tails induced by electromagnetic perturbations. This article sets the stage for future numerical investigations aimed at identifying such modes in various scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of Abelian topological order described by $p$-form BF theory in arbitrary dimensions. We do so directly in the low-energy topological quantum field theory by considering the algebra of topological surface operators. We define two appropriate notions of subregion operator algebras which are related by a form of electric-magnetic duality. To each subregion algebra we assign an entanglement entropy which we coin essential topological entanglement. This is a refinement to the traditional topological entanglement entropy. It is intrinsic to the theory, inherently finite, positive, and sensitive to more intricate topological features of the state and the entangling region. This paper is the first in a series of papers investigating entanglement and topological order in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the general method presented by Mohammedi \cite{NM} for the integrability of a sigma model on a manifold, we investigate the conditions for having an integrable deformation of the general sigma model on a manifold with a complex structure. On a Lie group, these conditions are satisfied by using the zeros of the Nijenhuis tensor. We then extend this formalism to a manifold, especially a Lie group, with a generalized complex structure. We demonstrate that, for the examples of integrable sigma models with generalized complex structures on the Lie groups $\mathbf{A_{4,8}}$ and $\mathbf{A_{4,10}}$, under special conditions, the perturbed terms of the actions are identical to the WZ terms.</description>

      <title>Algebras and Hilbert spaces from gravitational path integrals: Understanding Ryu-Takayanagi/HRT as entropy without AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works by Chandrasekaran, Penington, and Witten have shown in various special contexts that the quantum-corrected Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) entropy (or its covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) generalization) can be understood as computing an entropy on an algebra of bulk observables. These arguments do not rely on the existence of a local holographic dual field theory. We show that analogous-but-stronger results hold in any UV-completion of asymptotically AdS quantum gravity with a Euclidean path integral satisfying a simple and (largely) familiar set of axioms. We consider a quantum context in which a standard Lorentz-signature classical bulk limit would have Cauchy slices with asymptotic boundaries $B_L \sqcup B_R$ where both $B_L$ and $B_R$ are compact manifolds without boundary. Our main result is that (the UV-completion of) the quantum gravity path integral defines type I von Neumann algebras ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L$, ${\cal A}^{B_R}_{R}$ of observables acting respectively at $B_L$, $B_R$ such that ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L$, ${\cal A}^{B_R}_{R}$ are commutants. The path integral also defines entropies on ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L, {\cal A}^{B_R}_R$. Positivity of the Hilbert space inner product then turns out to require the entropy of any projection operator to be quantized in the form $\ln N$ for some $N \in {\mathbb Z}^+$ (unless it is infinite). As a result, our entropies can be written in terms of standard density matrices and standard Hilbert space traces. Furthermore, in appropriate semiclassical limits our entropies are computed by the RT-formula with quantum corrections. Our work thus provides a Hilbert space interpretation of the RT entropy. Since our axioms do not severely constrain UV bulk structures, it is plausible that they hold equally well for successful formulations of string field theory, spin-foam models, or any other approach to constructing a UV-complete theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete classification of 6D supergravities</title>

Abstract: The constraints arising from anomaly cancellation are particular strong for chiral theories in six dimensions. We make progress towards a complete classification of 6D supergravities with minimal supersymmetry and non-abelian gauge group. First, we generalize a previously known infinite class of anomaly-free theories which has $T\gg 9$ to essentially any semi-simple gauge group and infinitely many choices for hypermultiplets. The construction relies on having many decoupled sectors all selected from a list of four simple theories which we identify. Second, we use ideas from graph theory to rephrase the task of finding anomaly-free theories as constructing cliques in a certain multigraph. A branch-and-bound type algorithm is described which can be used to explicitly construct, in a $T$-independent way, anomaly-free theories with an arbitrary number of simple factors in the gauge group. We implement these ideas to generate an ensemble of $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ irreducible cliques from which anomaly-free theories may be easily built, and as a special case obtain a complete list of $19,\!847$ consistent theories for $T=0$, for which the maximal gauge group rank is $24$. Modulo $\mathrm{U}(1)$, $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ simple factors and the new infinite families, we give a complete characterization of anomaly-free theories and show that the bound $T\leq 273$ is sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covariant (Lorentz invariant) fracton matter, minimally coupled and charged under a symmetric rank two gauge tensor, is considered. The gauge transformations correspond to linearized longitudinal diffeomorphisms. Consistent possible anomalies are computed using the BRST cohomology method. They depend only on the gauge field, treated as a background field, and on the gauge parameter, promoted to an anticommuting scalar ghost field. The problem is phrased in terms of polyforms, whose total degree is the sum of the form degree and of the ghost number. The most general anomaly in two dimensions and in four dimensions is computed and an anomaly in arbitrary dimensions is individuated. In conclusion, it is shown that a simple higher-derivative scalar field theory is an example of covariant fracton matter.</description>

Abstract: We study scalar-tensor gravitational theories using on-shell amplitude methods. We focus on theories with gravity coupled to a massless scalar via the Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons terms. In this framework, we calculate the waveforms for classical scalar radiation emitted in scattering of macroscopic objects, including spin effects. To this end, we use the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, with the 5-particle amplitude for scalar emission in matter scattering calculated at tree level using the unitarity-factorization bootstrap techniques. We also discuss in detail the dependence of that amplitude on the contact terms of the intermediate 4-particle scalar-graviton-matter amplitude. Finally, we discuss the conditions for resolvability of classical scalar radiation.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Spinning (A)dS Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massless spinning correlators in cosmology are extremely complicated. In contrast, the scattering amplitudes of massless particles with spin are very simple. We propose that the reason for the unreasonable complexity of these correlators lies in the use of inconvenient kinematic variables. For example, in de Sitter space, consistency with unitarity and the background isometries imply that the correlators must be conformally covariant and also conserved. However, the commonly used kinematic variables for correlators do not make all of these properties manifest. In this paper, we introduce twistor space as a powerful way to satisfy all kinematic constraints. We show that conformal correlators of conserved currents can be written as twistor integrals, where the conservation condition translates into holomorphicity of the integrand. The functional form of the twistor-space correlators is very simple and easily bootstrapped. For the case of three-point functions, we verify explicitly that this reproduces known results in embedding space. We also perform a half-Fourier transform of the twistor-space correlators to obtain their counterparts in momentum space. We conclude that twistors provide a promising new avenue to study conformal correlation functions that exposes their hidden simplicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work I study the Casimir effect caused by a charged and massive scalar field that violates Lorentz symmetry in an aether-like and CPT even manner, by direct coupling between the field derivatives and two fixed orthogonal unit vectors. I call this a "double" Lorentz violation. The field will satisfy either Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions on a pair of plane parallel plates. I use the generalized zeta function technique to examine the effect of a uniform magnetic field, perpendicular to the plates, on the Casimir energy and pressure. Three different pairs of mutual directions of the unit vectors are possible: timelike and spacelike perpendicular to the magnetic field, timelike and spacelike parallel to the magnetic field, spacelike perpendicular and spacelike parallel to the magnetic field. I fully examine all of them for both types of boundary conditions listed above and, in all cases and for both types of boundary conditions, I obtain simple expressions of the zeta function, Casimir energy and pressure in the three asymptotic limits of strong magnetic field, large mass, and small plate distance.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectrum of meson masses in large $N_c$ QCD$_2$ governed by celebrated 't Hooft's integral equation. We generalize analytical methods proposed by Fateev, Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov to the case of arbitrary, but equal quark masses $m_1=m_2.$ Our results include analytical expressions for spectral sums and systematic large-$n$ expansion. We also study the spectral sums in the chiral limit and the heavy quark limit and find a complete agreement with known results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated systems offers some of the most intriguing physics challenges such as competing orders or the emergence of dynamical composite degrees of freedom. Often, the resolution of these physics challenges is computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the physical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or minimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the physics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of freedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within the functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which accommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state.
  In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate transformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective flows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions, formulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG flows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational applications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the dynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the most rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational effort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a given expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content within a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows can be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows within a given approximation.</description>

Abstract: It has long been known that the moduli space of hyperbolic metrics on the disc can be identified with the Virasoro coadjoint orbit $\mathrm{Diff}^+(S^1) / \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. The interest in this relationship has recently been revived in the study of two-dimensional JT gravity and it raises the natural question if all Virasoro orbits $\mathcal{O}$ arise as moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics. In this article, we give an affirmative answer to this question using $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge theory on a cylinder $S$: to any $L\in\mathcal{O}$ we assign a flat $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge field $A_L = (g_L)^{-1} dg_L$, and we explain how the global properties and singularities of the hyperbolic geometry are encoded in the monodromies and winding numbers of $g_L$, and how they depend on the Virasoro orbit. In particular, we show that the somewhat mysterious geometries associated with Virasoro orbits with no constant representative $L$ arise from large gauge transformations acting on standard (constant $L$ ) funnel or cuspidal geometries, shedding some light on their potential physical significance: e.g. they describe new topological sectors of two-dimensional gravity, characterised by twisted boundary conditions. Using a gauge theoretic gluing construction, we also obtain a complete dictionary between Virasoro coadjoint orbits and moduli spaces of hyperbolic metrics with specified boundary projective structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study universal solutions to reflection equations with a spectral parameter, so-called K-operators, within a general framework of universal K-matrices - an extended version of the approach introduced by Appel-Vlaar. Here, the input data is a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra $H$, its comodule algebra $B$ and a pair of consistent twists. In our setting, the universal K-matrix is an element of $B\otimes H$ satisfying certain axioms, and we consider the case $H$ is the quantum loop algebra for $sl_2$, and $B={\cal A}_q$ is the alternating central extension of the $q$-Onsager algebra. Considering tensor products of evaluation representations of $H$ in "non-semisimple" cases, the new set of axioms allows us to introduce and study fused K-operators of spin-$j$; in particular, to prove that for all $j\in\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{N}$ they satisfy the spectral-parameter dependent reflection equation. We provide their explicit expression in terms of elements of the algebra ${\cal A}_q$ for small values of spin-$j$. The precise relation between the fused K-operators of spin-$j$ and evaluations of a universal K-matrix for ${\cal A}_q$ is conjectured based on supporting evidences. Independently, we study K-operator solutions of the twisted intertwining relations associated with the comodule algebra ${\cal A}_q$, and expand them in the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt basis of ${\cal A}_q$. With a reasonably general ansatz, we found a unique solution for first few values of $j$ which agrees with the fused K-operators, as expected. We conjecture that in general such solutions are uniquely determined and match with the expressions of the fused K-operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves offer a potent mean to test the underlying theory of gravity. In general theories of gravity, such as scalar-tensor theories, one expects modifications in the friction term and the sound speed in the gravitational wave equation. In that case, rapid oscillations in such coefficients, e.g. due to an oscillating scalar field, may lead to narrow parametric resonances in the gravitational wave strain. We perform a general analysis of such possibility within DHOST theories. We use disformal transformations to find the theory space with larger resonances, within an effective field theory approach. We then apply our formalism to a non-minimally coupled ultra-light dark matter scalar field, assuming the presence of a primordial gravitational wave background, e.g., from inflation. We find that the resonant peaks in the spectral density may be detectable by forthcoming detectors such as LISA, Taiji, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we show how to build bridges between field-theoretic models that have kink solutions with different asymptotic behavior. We study transformational properties of kinks in models with a real scalar field in two-dimensional space-time. We show how to obtain new models with solitons having different asymptotic behavior, using deformations with specific functions. In particular, starting from the well-known $\varphi^4$ model, we obtain kinks with super-exponential, super-super-exponential, power-law, and logarithmic asymptotics. We also comment on how asymptotic behavior of stability potential and zero mode can be obtained for deformed kinks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit optimization of functional renormalization group flows by analyzing regularized loop integrals. This leads us to a principle, the Principle of Strongest Singularity, and a corresponding order relation which allows to order existing regularization schemes with respect to the stability of renormalization group flows. Moreover, the order relation can be used to construct new regulators in a systematic fashion. For studies of critical behavior, which require to follow renormalization group flows down to the deep infrared regime, such new regulators may turn out to be particularly useful. The general application of this principle is demonstrated with the aid of a scalar field theory which is solved over a wide range of scales with novel methods borrowed from numerical fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Clocking the End of Cosmic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making observable predictions for cosmic inflation requires determining when the wavenumbers of astrophysical interest today exited the Hubble radius during the inflationary epoch. These instants are commonly evaluated using the slow-roll approximation and measured in e-folds $\Delta N=N-N_\mathrm{end}$, in reference to the e-fold $N_\mathrm{end}$ at which inflation ended. Slow roll being necessarily violated towards the end of inflation, both the approximated trajectory and $N_\mathrm{end}$ are determined at, typically, one or two e-folds precision. Up to now, such an uncertainty has been innocuous, but this will no longer be the case with the forthcoming cosmological measurements. In this work, we introduce a new and simple analytical method, on top of the usual slow-roll approximation, that reduces uncertainties on $\Delta N$ to less than a tenth of an e-fold.</description>

      <title>Systematic input scheme of many-boson Hamiltonians with applications to the two-dimensional $\phi ^4$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel, systematic input scheme for many-boson Hamiltonians in order to solve field theory problems within the light-front Hamiltonian formalism via quantum computing. We present our discussion of this input scheme based on the light-front Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional $\phi ^4$ theory. In our input scheme, we employ a set of quantum registers, where each register encodes the occupation of a distinct boson mode as binaries. We squeeze the boson operators of each mode and present the Hamiltonian in terms of unique combinations of the squeezed boson operators. We design the circuit modules for these unique combinations. Based on these circuit modules, we block encode the many-boson Hamiltonian utilizing the idea of quantum walk. For demonstration purposes, we present the spectral calculations of the Hamiltonian utilizing the hybrid quantum-classical symmetry-adapted quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization algorithm based on our input scheme, where the quantum computations are performed with the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. The results of the hybrid calculations agree with exact results.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of Asymptotically Hot and Dense QCD Matter: AMY Formalism vs. A Modified Relaxation Time Approximation in 0-flavor SU(3) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16856v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AMY formalism is widely used to describe the transport coefficients of asymptotically hot and dense QCD matter, such as shear viscosity $\eta$. In literature prior to AMY, the viscosity of an asymptotically hot QCD plasma was expressed by a $q^2$ momentum transfer-weighted relaxation time approximation. Recent studies that compared numerical transport calculations and analytical expressions for $\eta$ demonstrated that asymptotically high temperatures and densities induce anisotropic scatterings, which are exhibited in the quark-gluon plasma produced by relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these studies, the QGP was treated as a Maxwell-Boltzmann-distributed gluon gas with added (anti-)quark degrees of freedom. One such method used in the comparison was the "modified" $q^2$ transport-weighted RTA. In this study, a comparison between the AMY formalism (both numerical calculations and next-leading-log expression) and the modified RTA expression for $\eta$ is made in 0-flavor SU(3) theory. The comparison between numerical AMY calculations and the modified RTA method shows perfect agreement under the temperatures associated with collider-produced QGP. Additionally, AMY is compared with the Chapman-Enskog method, which is well understood to better describe anisotropic collider-produced QGP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Radiated Gravitational Wave Energy via Relativistic Kinetic Theory: A Kinetic Gas Model of an Idealized Coalescing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The final pulse of gravitational wave emission is released in the chirp phase of binary coalescence. This proposes that the radiated energy of the GW is proportional to the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, with detection reports revealing the approximate scaling of $E_{\mathrm{GW}}\approx\mathcal{M}/10$. While this scaling is evident in numerical relativity, there lacks an analytical expression supporting the relation. This study utilizes a heuristic application of relativistic kinetic theory and massless Bose-Einstein statistics for an entropic graviton gas to GW formation throughout binary coalescence. This approach to GW formation obtains an expression of an effective thermal energy as the radiated GW energy, which extracts the nearly one-tenth scaling of the chirp mass, namely at the chirp phase. Furthermore, it agrees well with the detected energies with 1:1 ratio values ranging from 0.932 for GW150914 to 0.998 for one of three waveform models of GW190521, with 0.851 as an outlier for GW170104. Utilization of a quantum-classical correspondence enabled discussions regarding the usage of equilibrium noise analysis on the graviton gas and kinetic characteristics of the graviton gas during and after coalescence. The latter topic includes, but is not limited to, GW/graviton wave-particle duality, a calculation of the high-energy graviton-graviton total cross section as 1.16% of the chirp mass surface area $A=16\pi G^2\mathcal{M}^2$, and humoring the thought experiment of black hole gravitons.</description>

      <title>Newman-Penrose formalism and exact vacuum solutions to conformal Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the exterior solution for a static, spherically symmetric source in Weyl conformal gravity in terms of the Newman--Penrose formalism. We first show that both the static, uncharged black hole solution of Mannheim and Kazanas and the static, charged Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m-like solution can be found more easily in this formalism than in the traditional coordinate-basis approach, where the metric tensor components are taken as the basic variables. Second, we show that the Newman-Penrose formalism offers a particularly convenient framework that is well suited for the discussion of conformal gravity solutions corresponding to Petrov ''type-D'' spacetimes. This is illustrated with a two-parameter class of wormhole solutions that includes the Ellis--Bronnikov wormhole solution of Einstein's gravity as a limiting case. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of solutions and the inclusion of the electromagnetic field are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Searching for small primordial black holes in planets, asteroids and here on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small primordial black holes could be captured by rocky planets or asteroids, consume their liquid cores from inside and leave hollow structures. We calculate the surface density and surface tension of a hollow structure around a black hole and compare them with the density and compressive strength of various materials that appear in nature to find the allowed parameter space. For example, granite or iron can support a hollow asteroid/planetoid/moon of the size of up to $0.1 R_\oplus$. Along the same lines, future civilizations might build spherical structures around black holes to harvest their energy. Using the strongest material that we currently know how to make (multiwall carbon nanotube), to withstand gravity of one solar mass black hole, the shell must be constructed at distances larger than $10^4 R_\odot$. Alternatively, a fast black hole can leave a narrow tunnel in a solid object while passing through it. For example, a $10^{22}$g black hole should leave a tunnel with a radius of $0.1$ micron, which is large enough to be seen by an optical microscope. We could look for such micro-tunnels here on Earth in very old rocks, or even glass or other solid structures in very old buildings. While our estimate gives a very small probability of finding such tunnels, looking for them does not require expensive equipment and long preparation, and the payoff might be significant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Knots that Never Come Untied</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin proposed that atoms form hydrodynamic vortex knots. However, they typically untie through reconnections, i. e., local cut-and-slice events, unlike stable vortex unknots such as smoke rings. The same holds in superfluids--quantum fluids with zero viscosity--where vortices have quantized circulation, making them topologically stable. For over 150 years, hydrodynamically stable vortex knots have been sought both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we present the first demonstration of hydrodynamically stable vortex knots and links in experimentally realizable Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atomic gases and confirm it through dynamic simulations. Our method creates stable knotted vortex structures in systems where reconnections are prohibited, with potential relevance to neutron star interiors. Additionally, we anticipate our mathematical framework could have applications in quantum computation, quantum turbulence, and DNA dynamics, particularly where reconnections are restricted.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Multi-Metric Gravity II: Hairy Solutions and Linear Stability of the Non- and Partially Proportional Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Owing to our work in part I of this series of papers, it is understood that the analytically known black hole solutions in the theory of ghost free multi-metric gravity can be split into three distinct classes, and that one of these classes - the proportional branch - exhibits the Gregory-Laflamme instability at linear level in the metric perturbations, whenever the black hole horizon size is smaller than (roughly) the Compton wavelength of the theory's lightest massive graviton. In this first of two sequels, we determine the linear stability of the two remaining classes of black hole solutions - the non-proportional and partially proportional branches - and discuss how our results likely differ at nonlinear level. We also give a general prescription to construct multi-metric solutions describing black holes endowed with massive graviton hair, which may constitute the end state of the instability in the proportional branch. We utilise a tractable example model involving 3 metrics to see how this works in practice, and determine the asymptotic form of its corresponding hairy solutions at infinity, where one can clearly see the individual contributions from each of the graviton mass modes.</description>
