      <title>Closed-form evaluations of log-sine integrals and Ap\'ery-like sums in terms of polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new systematic method for evaluating generalized log-sine integrals in terms of polylogarithms. Our approach is based on an identity connecting ordinary generating functions of polylogarithms to integrals involving the sine function. This method provides closed-form expressions for log-sine integrals of weight up to 4 using only classical polylogarithms, while higher weights require Nielsen polylogarithms. Later we generalize this identity and show how it gives rise to numerous Ap\'ery-like formulae extending results of Koecher, Leshchiner and others. We also derive hyperbolic analogues and recover several functional equations between Nielsen polylogarithms. In the process, we derive new parametric identities similar to those given by Saha and Sinha.</description>

      <title>On the factorization of iterates of $x^d+c$ in large degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a function field of a curve in characteristic zero or a number field over which the $abc$-conjecture holds, fix $\alpha\in K$, and let $f_{d,c}(x)=x^d+c$ for some $d\geq2$ and some $c\in K$. Then for many $c$ and $d$, we prove that $f_{d,c}^n(x)-\alpha$ has at most $d$ factors in $K[x]$ for all $n\geq1$. For example, when $\alpha=0$ we prove that the set \[\Big\{d\,:\, f_{d,c}^n(x)\;\text{has at most $d$ factors in $K[x]$ for all $n\geq1$ and all $h(c)&gt;0$}\Big\}\] has positive asymptotic density. We then apply this result to compute the density of prime divisors in certain forward orbits and to establish the finiteness of integral points in certain backward orbits.</description>

      <title>Replacement dynamics of binary quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $S$-valued function $f$ of $m \geq 1$ variables we define a dynamical process in which the output $f(\overline{v})$ replaces exactly one entry of the input $\overline{v} \in S^m$ at each step in the iterative process. Our study focuses on periodic vectors with respect to this process. We define a stratification of periodic vectors according to their type, and characterize types for which the determination of periodic vectors comes down to dynamics of univariate polynomials. We then restrict to the case of a diagonal binary quadratic form $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and classify rational periodic vectors for all types of period up to $5$. This includes two types which do not arise from the univariate case.</description>

      <title>A congruence family modulo powers of 5 for generalized cubic partitions via the localization method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh introduced a new infinite family of partition functions called generalized cubic partitions. Given a positive integer $d$, they let $a_d(n)$ be the counting function for partitions of $n$ in which the odd parts are unrestricted and the even parts are $d$-colored. These partitions are natural generalizations of Chan's notion of cubic partitions, as they coincide when $d=2.$ Many Ramanujan-like congruences exist in the literature for cubic partitions, and in their work Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh proved a collection of congruences satisfied by $a_d(n)$ for various $d \geq 1$, including an infinite family with prime moduli. Our goal in this paper is to prove a family of congruences modulo powers of 5 for $a_3(n)$. More specifically, our main theorem asserts \[a_3\left(5^{2\alpha}n +\gamma_{\alpha} \right) \equiv 0 \pmod{5^\alpha},\] where \[\gamma_{\alpha} = 20 + \frac{19 \cdot 25 (25^{\alpha-1}-1)}{24}.\] In order to prove these congruences, we use an approach centered around modular functions, as in the seminal work of Watson and Atkin on proving Ramanujan's congruences for the partition function $p(n)$. However, due to the complexity of the modular curve $X_0(10)$ associated to our modular functions, the classical method cannot be directly applied. Rather, we utilize the very recently developed localization method of Banerjee and Smoot, which is designed to treat congruence families over more complicated modular curves, such as $X_0(10).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K/F$ be a CM extension satisfying the ordinary assumption for an odd prime $p$
  and let $\psi$ be a finite order anticyclotomic Hecke character
  of $K$.
  When $K$ has a place above $p$ of degree one,
  we apply Urban's method
  and the results from our previous work to construct
  an anticyclotomic Euler system for $\psi$
  under minor assumptions
  and prove one side o the divisibility of
  the anticyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for $\psi$
  when $p$ is inverted.</description>

      <title>General Boyd-Lawton Theorems with Multivariable Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Boyd-Lawton theorem concerning Mahler measures has recently been extended to multivariable limits by Brunault, Guilloux, Mehrabdollahei, and Pengo. In another direction, the single-variable Boyd-Lawton theorem has been generalized to various extensions of Mahler measure by Issa and Lal\'in. The goal of this paper is to present a cohesive framework for extending single-variable Boyd-Lawton theorems to multivariable Boyd-Lawton theorems. With this, we broaden the single-variable Boyd-Lawton theorems of Issa and Lal\'in to multivariable versions in the direction of Brunault, Guilloux, Mehrabdollahei, and Pengo, providing a generalization of both works.</description>

      <title>Generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski and Riesel numbers of the form $tb^t+\alpha$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $b\geq 2$ be an integer. We call an integer $k$ a $b$-Sierpi\'{n}ski number if $\gcd(k+1,b-1)=1$ and $k\cdot b^n+1$ is composite for all positive integers $n$. We similarly call $k$ a $b$-Riesel number if $\gcd(k-1,b-1)=1$ and $k\cdot b^n-1$ is composite for all positive integers $n$. An integer that is simultaneously $b$-Sierpi\'{n}ski and $b$-Riesel is called a $b$-Brier number. In this article, we show that for any integer $\alpha\neq 0$, there are infinitely many $b$-Sierpi\'{n}ski numbers and infinitely many $b$-Riesel numbers of the form $tb^t+\alpha$. We further show that when $b+1$ is not a power of $2$, there are infinitely $b$-Brier number of this form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we improve upon bounds on the functions $G$ and $H$, due to (Silverberg, 1992), and the function $\Phi$, due to (Ozeki, 2024). These functions are of interest in the study of the dimension of $p$-primary torsion subgroups of Mordell--Weil groups of CM abelian varieties over certain infinite extensions of $p$-adic fields.</description>

      <title>The Hardy--Ramanujan inequality for sifted sets and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known Hardy--Ramanujan inequality states that if $\omega(n)$ denotes the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer $n$, then there is an absolute constant $C&gt;0$ such that uniformly for $x\ge2$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, \[\#\{n\le x\colon\omega(n)=k\}\ll\frac{x(\log\log x+C)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!\log x}.\] A myriad of generalizations and variations of this inequality have been discovered. In this paper, we establish a weighted version of this inequality for sifted sets, which generalizes an earlier result of Hal\'asz and implies Timofeev's theorems on shifted primes. We then explore its applications to a variety of intriguing problems, such as large deviations of $\omega$ on subsets of integers, the Erd\H{o}s multiplication table problem, divisors of shifted primes, and the image of the Carmichael $\lambda$-function. Building on the same circle of ideas, we also generalize Troupe's result on the normal order of $\omega(s(n))$ for the sum-of-proper-divisors function $s(n)$, confirming for the first time the weighted version of a special case of a 1992 conjecture by Erd\H{o}s, Granville, Pomerance, and Spiro.</description>

      <title>Collision of orbits for families of polynomials defined over fields of positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a field of positive characteristic $p$ with a fixed algebraic closure $\overline{L}$, and let $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta\in L$. For an integer $d\ge 2$, we consider the family of polynomials $f_{\lambda}(z) := z^d+\lambda$, parameterized by $\lambda\in\overline{L}$. Define $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ to be the set of all $\lambda\in\overline{L}$ for which there exist $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $f_{\lambda}^m(\alpha_1)=f_{\lambda}^n(\alpha_2)=\beta$. In other words, $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ consists of all $\lambda\in\overline{L}$ with the property that the orbit of $\alpha_1$ collides with the orbit of $\alpha_2$ under the same polynomial $f_{\lambda}$ precisely at the point $\beta$. Assuming $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta$ are not all contained in a finite subfield of $L$, we provide explicit necessary and sufficient conditions under which $C(\alpha_1,\alpha_2;\beta)$ is infinite. We also discuss the remaining case where $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta\in \overline{\mathbb F}_p$ and provide ample computational data that suggest a somewhat surprising conjecture. Our problem fits into a long series of questions in the area of unlikely intersections in arithmetic dynamics, which have been primarily studied over fields of characteristic $0$. Working in characteristic $p$ adds significant difficulties, but also reveals the subtlety of our problem, especially when some of the points lie in a finite field or when $d$ is a power of $p$.</description>

      <title>A Generalisation of Niven's Theorem for Trigonometric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niven's Theorem asserts that $\{\cos(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}\}\cap\mathbb{Q} = \{0, \pm 1, \pm\frac{1}{2}\}$. This paper uses elementary methods to classify all elements in the sets $\{\cos^n(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}, n \in \mathbb{N}\}\cap\mathbb{Q}$ and $\{\sin^n(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}, n \in \mathbb{N}\}\cap\mathbb{Q}$. Using some algebraic number theory, we extend this to a classification of all elements in $\{\tan^n(r\pi)|r\in \mathbb{Q}, n \in \mathbb{N}\}\cap\mathbb{Q}$. Finally, we present a short Galois theoretic argument to provide a more conceptual understanding of the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a number field. Let $\pi_1,\pi_2$ be unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of $GL_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$, and let $\pi$ be a unitary cuspidal automorphic representation of either $GL_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$ or $GL_3(\mathbb{A}_F)$. When $(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi)$ is of general type, we show that the triple product $L$-function $L(s,\pi_1 \times \pi_2 \times \pi)$ on either $GL(2) \times GL(2) \times GL(2)$ or $GL(2) \times GL(2) \times GL(3)$ has no Siegel zero. Moreover, when $(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi)$ is not of general type, we give precise conditions when $L(s,\pi_1 \times \pi_2 \times \pi)$ could possibly have Siegel zeros.</description>

      <title>Rough numbers between consecutive primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a sieve-theoretic argument, we show that almost all gaps $(p_n, p_{n+1})$ between consecutive primes $p_n, p_{n+1}$ contain a natural number $m$ whose least prime factor $p(m)$ is at least the length $p_{n+1} - p_n$ of the gap, confirming a prediction of Erd\H{o}s. In fact the number $N(X)$ of exceptional gaps with $p_n \in [X,2X]$ is shown to be at most $O(X/\log^2 X)$. Assuming a form of the Hardy--Littlewood prime tuples conjecture, we establish a more precise asymptotic $N(X) \sim c X / \log^2 X$ for an explicit constant $c&gt;0$, which we believe to be between $2.7$ and $2.8$. To obtain our results in their full strength we rely on the asymptotics for singular series developed by Montgomery and Soundararajan.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By introducing the totally uniqueness condition for maps, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the family of invariant sets for the $q x{+}d$-function (e.g. the $3 x{+}1$-map, also known as the Collatz map), where $q$ and $d$ are arbitrary positive odd numbers, and the family of reducing subspaces for the associated $C^{*}$-algebra. This extends the connection between the Collatz conjecture (also known as the $3 n{+}1$-problem) and the irreducibility of its associated $C^{*}$-algebra. We also introduce homomorphisms between dynamical systems with bounded conditions that preserve the structures of these dynamical systems. We prove the existence of an isomorphism between their associated $C^{*}$-algebras is proven for every isomorphism between dynamical systems with bounded condition.</description>

      <title>The modified diagonal cycles of Hypergeometric curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each $N\geq 2$, Asakura and Otsubo have recently introduced a smooth family of algebraic curves $\{X_{N,\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \mathbb{P}^1\setminus \{0, 1, \infty\}}$ in characteristic 0 that is closely related to hypergeometric functions and the Fermat curve of degree $N$. In this paper, we study the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal 1-cycles of these curves. We prove that if $p \ge 3$ is a prime, then for every $\lambda$ the Griffiths Abel-Jacobi image of the modified diagonal cycle of $X_{p,\lambda}$ is nontrivial for every cuspidal choice of a base point. On the other hand, we show that the modified diagonal cycle and hence the Ceresa cycle of $X_{3,\lambda}$ is torsion in the Chow group for every $\lambda$ and every choice of a base point.</description>

      <title>Short Hardy fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially algebraic Hardy field extensions of short Hardy fields are short. This is proved in the more general setting of $H$-fields. As an application we extend a theorem of Rosenlicht (1981) by showing that each short asymptotic couple of Hardy type with small derivation is isomorphic to the asymptotic couple of an analytic Hardy field.</description>

      <title>Convolutions of Goss and Pellarin $L$-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish special value results of convolutions of Goss and Pellarin $L$-series attached to Drinfeld modules that take values in Tate algebras. Applying the class module formula of Demeslay to certain rigid analytic twists of one Drinfeld module by another, we extend the special value formula for the Pellarin $L$-function associated to the Carlitz module and the Anderson-Thakur function to Drinfeld modules of arbitrary rank and their rigid analytic trivializations. By way of the theory of Schur polynomials these identities take the form of specializations of convolutions of Rankin-Selberg type. These convolution $L$-series are also identified with covolumes of Stark units.</description>

      <title>Hida family of theta lift from U(1) to definite U(2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let K/F be a CM extension satisfying the ordinary assumption for an odd prime p. In this article, we construct Hida families that interpolate theta lifts of algebraic Hecke characters to a definite unitary group U(2) defined from skew-Hermitian spaces over K, and show that the Hida family is primitive when the central L-value of the branch character of the family satisfies certain non-vanishing modulo p conditions.</description>

      <title>Elementary Proofs of Two Congruences for Partitions with Odd Parts Repeated at Most Twice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent article on overpartitions, Merca considered the auxiliary function $a(n)$ which counts the number of partitions of $n$ where odd parts are repeated at most twice (and there are no restrictions on the even parts). In the course of his work, Merca proved the following: For all $n\geq 0$, \begin{align*} a(4n+2) &amp;\equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \textrm{\ \ and} \\ a(4n+3) &amp;\equiv 0 \pmod{2}. \end{align*} Merca then indicates that a classical proof of these congruences would be very interesting. The goal of this short note is to fulfill Merca's request by providing two truly elementary (classical) proofs of these congruences.</description>

      <title>A Formal Proof of the Irrationality of $\zeta(3)$ in Lean 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formalize a proof of the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$ in Lean 4, using Beukers' method. To support this, we extend the Lean mathematical library (Mathlib) by formalizing shifted Legendre polynomials and important results in analytic number theory that were previously missing. As part of the Lean 4 PrimeNumberTheoremAnd project, we also formalize the asymptotic behavior of the prime counting function, giving the first formal proof in Lean 4 of a version of the Prime Number Theorem with an error term which is stronger than what had previously been formalized. This result is a crucial ingredient in proving the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$. Our complete Lean 4 formalization is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Prime Ideal Races With Several Competitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate races among prime ideals in number fields when there are two or more competing conjugacy classes. In their work [4], Fiorilli and Jouve studied two-way races in number fields and showed that-unlike the classical setting of primes in arithmetic progressions-these biases can approach the extreme values of 0 and 1. They also identified when these biases tend toward one-half (as the degree of the extension grows), which we call ''moderate biases'' because that behavior mirrors the classical case.  In this paper, we extend their analysis to races with r competing conjugacy classes (rway races) and precisely study the cases where these biases are moderate (meaning they tend to 1/r! as the discriminant of the extension grows). Our first main result is an explicit formula for the bias in any r-way race (for all r $\ge$ 2), generalizing the two-way formula of Fiorilli and Jouve [4] and Lamzouri's r-way expression in the classical case of residue classes modulo q [12], under the same hypotheses. Using this formula, we give a criterion characterizing completely, in the abelian case, r-moderate races. Surprisingly, once r $\ge$ 3 this criterion is independent of r, making the two-way race exceptional. We also construct families of number fields exhibiting such moderacy, we prove density results for the values of logarithmic densities and exhibit different behaviors of those densities between the cases r = 3 and r $\ge$ 4.  </description>

      <title>Purmutation--invariant Niven numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces permutation-invariant Niven numbers--a novel class of Niven numbers where all digit permutations (with leading zeros automatically ignored) must retain the Niven property. We demonstrate that there exist infinitely many such numbers and that their magnitude is unbounded. Furthermore, we present an exhaustive search method for identifying permutation--invariant Niven numbers.</description>
