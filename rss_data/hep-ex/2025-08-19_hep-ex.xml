      <title>IsoDAR@Yemilab: Preliminary Design Report -- Volume II: Medium Energy Beam Transport, Neutrino Source, and Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Preliminary Design Report (PDR) describes the IsoDAR electron-antineutrino source in two volumes which are mostly site-independent and describe the cyclotron driver providing a 60 MeV, 10 mA proton beam (Volume I); and the medium energy beam transport line (MEBT) and target (this Volume). The IsoDAR driver and target will produce about $1.15\cdot10^{23}$ electron-antineutrinos over five calendar years. Paired with a kton-scale liquid scintillator detector, this will enable a broad particle physics program including searches for new symmetries, new interactions and new particles. Here in Volume II, we describe the medium energy beam transport line, the antineutrino source beam-target and surrounding sleeve, shielding, and plans for monitoring and installation.</description>

      <title>LDMX -- The Light Dark Matter EXperiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LDMX, The Light Dark Matter EXperiment, is a missing momentum search for hidden sector dark matter in the MeV to GeV range. It will be located at SLAC in End Station A, and will employ an 8 GeV electron beam parasitically derived from the SLAC LCLS-II accelerator. LDMX promises to expand the experimental sensitivity of these searches by between one and two orders of magnitude depending on the model. It also has sensitivity in visible ALP searches as well as providing unique data on electron-nucleon interactions.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Two-Photon Exchange in proton Form Factors at BESIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton and neutron make up over 99.9\% of visible matter in the universe. The internal structure of protons, governed by ElectroMagnetic Form Factors (EMFFs), has been probed in both space-like (SL) and time-like (TL) regions. The BESIII experiment has achieved the most precise TL proton FF measurements to date, providing new insights into proton structure. However, higher-order effects in EMFFs, especially the impact of Two-Photon Exchange (TPE), remain poorly understood due to experimental challenges in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation. In this work, we analyze high-statistics BESIII data across a wide c.m. energy range and observe, for the first time, a significant angular asymmetry (8.6$\sigma$) in proton production. We demonstrate that this asymmetry arises from TPE, using a Born-like event selection, and extract the corresponding TPE-related EMFF properties. The observed interference between two-photon and one-photon exchanges (OPE$\otimes$TPE) is consistent with expectations at the level of the fine-structure constant relative to the OPE.</description>

      <title>Log Gaussian Cox Process Background Modeling in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background modeling is one of the most critical components in high energy physics data analyses, and for smooth backgrounds it is often performed by fitting using an analytic functional form. In this paper a novel method based on Log Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCP) is introduced to model smooth backgrounds while making minimal assumptions on the underlying shape. In LGCP, samples are assumed to be drawn from a non-homogeneous Poisson process, with an intensity function drawn from a Gaussian process. Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used for optimizing the hyper parameters and drawing the final fit for the background estimate from the posterior. Synthetic experiments comparing background modeling from functional forms and the LGCP are used to compare the different methods.</description>

      <title>Real-time alpha-ray track imaging using a synthetic diamond scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrated real-time imaging of alpha-ray tracks using a high-pressure, high-temperature synthetic diamond scintillator. The optical microscopy system consisted of a magnification objective lens and an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) to detect luminescence from the diamond substrate irradiated with alpha-rays from a 241Am source. Optical images of alpha-ray tracks were successfully captured under ambient conditions, and image processing methods were performed to enable automatic event recognition and track length detection. These results demonstrate that diamond is a promising scintillator material for alpha-ray imaging, representing an important step toward exploiting the potential of diamond scintillators</description>

      <title>QCD Sum Rule Study of the Tensor $\Delta^0\Delta^0$ Dibaryon State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the exotic $\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}$ dibaryon state with quantum numbers $J^{P} = 2^{+}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. A tensor interpolating current is constructed to determine the mass and residue of this state, including explicit calculations of contributions from quark, gluon, and mixed vacuum condensates up to dimension nine. The numerical analysis yields a mass of $m_{\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}} = 2426^{+101}_{-108}~\mathrm{MeV}$ and a residue of $f_{\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}} = \left( 2.30^{+0.49}_{-0.45} \right) \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{GeV}^{8}$. The predicted mass lies about $38~\mathrm{MeV}$ below the $2m_{\Delta^{0}}$ threshold, which indicates the possible existence of a bound molecular configuration. Consequently, the tensor $\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}$ dibaryon may serve as a promising candidate for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Resolution of spin crisis, and notes on the Bjorken sum rule, anomaly and constituent quark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the widely used parton model expression for $ g_1$ in polarized proton-lepton scattering is incorrect as it ignores gluon-quark spin entanglement. Therefore, there is no spin crisis. A brief summary of results of the theoretical evaluation of non-octet axial vector current renormalization constants and anomaly -anomaly vacuum correlator is given. It suggests that anomaly plays an important role in the transformation of current quarks to constituent quarks and chiral symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Prospects for $P$ and $C\!P$ violation in $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ decays with polarized beam at Super Tau-Charm Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak decays of the charmed baryons offer an ideal platform to study parity ($P$) and charge conjugation-parity ($C\!P$) violation in quark sector, to stringently test the Standard Model and search for new physics. It is a key goal in the next-generation positron-electron collider, such as the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF). Thanks to the quantum-entangled pair production with super high luminosity and the possibility of beam polarization, STCF provides a unique environment to probe such symmetry violations with unprecedented sensitivity. In this paper, we evaluate the precisions of the $P$-violating parameters and subsequently obtain the expected sensitivity of the $C\!P$-violating parameters in charmed baryon decays of $\Lambda_{c}^{+}\to p\pi^0$, $p\eta$, $\Lambda K^+$, $\Sigma^0 K^+$, and $\Sigma^+ K^0_S$, regarding to different polarization setups in STCF. The study suggests that the implementation of longitudinal beam polarization in STCF would greatly enhance the experimental capability in studying $P$ and $C\!P$ violation.</description>

      <title>Triple-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possible existence of triple-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquark states in the off-shell coupled-channel formalism. The open-charm meson-baryon $\bar{D}_s\Omega_c$, $\bar{D}_s\Omega_c^*$, $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c$, and $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c^*$ channels are considered, together with the hidden-charm $J/\psi\Omega$ channel. The two-body kernel Feynman amplitudes are constructed from an effective Lagrangian based on hidden local symmetry and heavy-quark spin symmetry. The coupled Blankenbecler-Sugar equation is solved in the partial-wave helicity basis. We observe two triple-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquark states: $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4787)$ and $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4841)$, both with $J^P=1/2^-$. The $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4787)$ couples dominantly to the $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c$ and $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c^*$ channels, while the $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4841)$ couples almost exclusively to the $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c^*$ channel. The total transition cross sections of $\bar{D}_s^{(\ast)}\Omega_c^{(\ast)}\to J/\psi\,\Omega$ indicate that the $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4787)$ is clearly visible in the $J/\psi\,\Omega$ invariant mass spectrum, whereas the $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4841)$ is obscured by cusp structures and background contributions.</description>

      <title>Scaling behaviour of charged particles generated in Xe$-$Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.44 TeV using the AMPT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial configurations of particles produced in the kinematic phase space during a heavy-ion collision reflect the characteristics of the system created in the collision. The scaling behaviour of the multiplicity fluctuations is studied for the charged particles generated in Xe--Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.44 TeV using the String Melting (SM) mode of the AMPT (A Multi-Phase Transport) model. The scaling behaviour of the normalized factorial moments ($F_\text{q}$) give significant information about the dynamics of the systems under study. A linear power-law growth of the $F_\text{q}$ with the increasing phase space resolution, termed as intermittency, is investigated. The anomalous fractal dimension $D_\text{q}$ is determined, which is linked to the self-similarity and fractal nature of the particle emission spectra, a dependence of which on the order of the moment ($q$) is characterised by the intermittency index ($\varphi_{\text{q}}$). Relating $q^{\rm{th}}$ order Normalised Factorial Moment (NFM) with $F_{2}$, the scaling exponent ($\nu$) is determined that quantifies the dynamics of the system created by these collisions and is analyzed for its dependence on the transverse momentum bin width ($\Delta p_\text{T}$). A comparative study of experimental and model results may help to understand the dynamics of multiparticle production in the heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Neutrino Scattering: Domain Adaptation with GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize transfer learning to extrapolate the physics knowledge encoded in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on synthetic charged-current (CC) neutrino-carbon inclusive scattering data. This base model is adapted to generate CC inclusive scattering events (lepton kinematics only) for neutrino-argon and antineutrino-carbon interactions. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of transfer learning in re-optimizing a custom model when new data comes from a different neutrino-nucleus interaction model. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms training generative models from scratch. To study this, we consider two training data sets: one with 10,000 and another with 100,000 events. The models obtained via transfer learning perform well even with smaller training data. The proposed method provides a promising approach for constructing neutrino scattering event generators in scenarios where experimental data is sparse.</description>

Abstract: The hidden-charm pentaquark states $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4312\right)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4380\right)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4440\right)^+$, and $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4457\right)^+$, all with isospin $I = 1/2$, were discovered by the LHCb collaboration in the decay process $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi p K^-$. Although their quantum numbers remain undetermined, these states have generated significant theoretical interest. We analyze their spectrum and decay patterns-including those of their spin partners-within the Born--Oppenheimer effective field theory (BOEFT), a framework grounded in QCD. At leading order in BOEFT, we identify these pentaquark states as bound states in BO potentials that exhibit at short-distance a repulsive octet behavior and a nonperturbative shift due to the adjoint baryons masses, while asymptotically approaching the $\Sigma_c\bar{D}$ threshold. We further incorporate ${\cal O}(1/m_Q)$ spin-dependent corrections to compute pentaquark multiplet spin splittings. Based on the spectrum, semi-inclusive decay widths to $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$, and the decay width ratios to $\Lambda_c\bar{D}$ and $\Lambda_c\bar{D}^*$, we provide the first theoretical predictions for the adjoint baryon masses, which can be confirmed by future lattice QCD studies. Moreover, our analysis supports the quantum number assignments: $J^{P} = (1/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4312\right)^+$, $(3/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4380\right)^+$, $(1/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4457\right)^+$, and $(3/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4440\right)^+$. We also present results for the lowest bottom pentaquarks.</description>

      <title>Experimentally distinguishable origin for electroweak symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a classically conformal $U(1)$ gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM), in which the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is radiatively broken by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. This breaking triggers the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking through a mixed quartic coupling between the $U(1)$ Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet. For two Higgs boson mass eigenstates after the symmetry breaking, $h_1$ (SM-like Higgs boson) and $h_2$ (SM singlet-like Higgs boson), we calculate the Higgs boson trilinear coupling ($g_{h_{1} h_{2} h_{2}}$) in the model by setting the Higgs boson mass spectrum to be $M_{h_1} &gt; 2 M_{h_2}$. For a common Higgs mass spectrum and mixing angle between two Higgs fields, we find that $g_{h_{1} h_{2} h_{2}}$ in the classically conformal model is highly suppressed compared to that calculated for the conventional Higgs potential, where the $U(1)$ and EW symmetry breaking originate from the negative squared masses for the Higgs fields at the tree-level. Thus, this coupling suppression is a striking nature of the radiative origin of EW symmetry breaking. We then consider how to distinguish this origin at the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) via precise measurements of anomalous SM Higgs boson couplings and the search for anomalous SM Higgs boson decay $h_1 \rightarrow h_2 h_2$ followed by $h_2 \to b \bar{b}$. We conclude that once the anomalous couplings are measured at the ILC, the observation of the anomalous Higgs boson decay is promising in the conventional Higgs potential, while this decay process is highly suppressed and undetectable for the classically conformal model.</description>

      <title>Novel azimuthal observables from two-photon collision at $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we advocate a set of novel azimuthal-angle-related observables associated with exclusive hadron production from two-photon fusion at $e^+ e^-$ colliders, taking the $\gamma\gamma\to \pi\pi$ as a benchmark process. As a direct consequence of the linearly polarized quasi-real photons emitted off the electron and positron beams, the $\cos 2\phi$ azimuthal asymmetry in dipion production is predicted within the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization framework. In numerical analysis, we take the helicity amplitudes of $\gamma\gamma\to \pi\pi$ determined from the partial wave solutions in dispersion relation as input, and find that the predicted $\cos2\phi$ azimuthal modulation may reach 40\% for the typical kinematical setup of {\tt Belle 2} and {\tt BESIII} experiments. Future accurate measurement of this azimuthal asymmetry may facilitate the direct extraction of the relative phase between two helicity amplitudes with photon helicity configurations $++$ and $+-$. This knowledge provides a valuable input for the dispersive determination of the hadronic light-by-light (Hlbl) contributions.</description>

      <title>Magnon cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit system via two-magnon driving and dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new, state-of-the-art predictions for the associated production of the SM Higgs boson with top quarks, computed in accordance with the recommendations of the LHC Higgs Working Group. The NNLO QCD predictions, derived through suitable approximations of the two-loop virtual contribution, are supplemented with soft-gluon resummation up to NNLL accuracy. Two distinct resummation frameworks are employed - one based on direct QCD and the other on soft-collinear effective theory - and their features are compared in detail. These results are further combined with the complete-NLO corrections, yielding the most precise SM predictions for this process to date. The relevant sources of theoretical uncertainties are thoroughly estimated and discussed.</description>

      <title>Relaxing constraints on a broad dark photon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the exclusion constraints on the parameters of a narrow dark photon set by direct experimental searches. We investigate how a dark photon with a larger decay width impacts these limits, in particular, in the case where the dark photon also decays into light dark matter. As an example, taking the upper limits on the mixing parameter, $\epsilon$, reported by the CMS collaboration, we find that they could be significantly relaxed. Indeed, even a very modest coupling of the dark photon to dark matter can lead to an increase in the bound on the mixing parameter by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>CP Violation in Hadronic Weak Decays of Charmed Baryons in the Topological Diagrammatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CP violation in the charmed baryon sector is generally expected to be very small, of order $10^{-4}$ or even smaller. Nevertheless, large long-distance penguin topologies can be induced through final-state rescattering. At the hadron level, they are manifested as the triangle and bubble diagrams. However, these diagrams consist of not only the penguin but also other tree topologies. Therefore, we focus on the flavor structure of the these diagrams and project out their contributions to penguin and tree topologies. The analysis is performed within the framework of the topological diagram approach and the irreducible SU(3) approach in which the SU(3) flavor symmetry of QCD is realized to describe the nonleptonic decays of charmed baryons. CP violation at the per mille level is found in the following decay modes: $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \pi^0,~\Lambda_c^+ \to p \eta', ~\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^0\eta$ and $\Xi_c^+ \to \Sigma^+ \eta$. CP asymmetries in the last three modes receive sizable contributions from the SU(3)-flavor-singlet hairpin diagram.</description>

      <title>Study of $B_c \to \chi_{cJ}\ (P, V)$ decays in the improved perturbative QCD formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent LHCb measurements of the ratios between the branching ratios (BRs), $R_{\chi_{c2}/J/\psi} \equiv {\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c2} \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+)$ and $R_{\chi_{c1}/\chi_{c2}} \equiv {\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c1} \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c2} \pi^+)$, we analyze the decays $B_c^+ \to \chi_{cJ} (P, V)^+$ in the improved perturbative QCD (iPQCD) formalism, where $\chi_{cJ}$ denotes the $p$-wave charmonia with $J=0, 1, 2$, and $P (V)$ denotes the pseudoscalars $\pi$ and $K$ (the vectors $\rho$ and $K^*$). Our results $R_{\chi_{c2}/J/\psi} = 0.32 \pm 0.05$ and $R_{\chi_{c1}/\chi_{c2}}= 0.11 \pm 0.01$ at leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ agree well with the data within uncertainties. The result $R_{\chi_{c0}/J/\psi} \equiv {\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c0} \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+) = 0.17 \pm 0.02$ is lower than $1.41^{+0.50}_{-0.45}$ inferred by the $B_c^+ \to \chi_{c0} \pi^+$ measurement. The large longitudinal polarization fractions imply that these components dominate the $B_c^+ \to \chi_{c1,c2} \rho^+$ BRs. A peculiar constructive (destructive) interference between the twist-2 and twist-3 contributions is identified in the $B_c^+\to \chi_{c1} \rho^+$ ($B_c^+\to \chi_{c1} \pi^+$) mode, but not in the corresponding ones with $\chi_{c0,c2}$ mesons. Inputting the BRs of the strong decays $\chi_{c0,c2} \to \pi^+ \pi^- / K^+ K^-$ and $\chi_{cJ} \to \pi^+\pi^-(\pi^+ \pi^-/K^+K^-)$ reported by the BESIII Collaboration, we obtain those of $B_c^+ \to \chi_{cJ} (\rho, \pi)^+$ followed by secondary decay chains under the narrow-width approximation. All the above iPQCD predictions can be confronted by more precise experiments in the future to deepen our understanding of QCD dynamics in $B_c\to\chi_{cJ}$ transitions.</description>

      <title>SPLENDOR: a novel detector platform to search for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter direct detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin and Lifetime Correlations in Entangled Hyperon-AntiHyperon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement has now been demonstrated in several hadronic systems, revealing that non-classical spin correlations survive even through the strong-interaction hadronization process. To date, however, all studies have focused exclusively on angular observables, leaving the possibility untouched that quantum coherence might also influence the decay times of entangled partners. In this work we propose data-driven tests of spin-lifetime and lifetime-lifetime correlations for Lambda-antiLambda pairs produced in high-energy collisions. By examining the opening-angle distribution in slices of Delta t, constructing a pair-wise spin-lifetime correlator, and testing a simple lifetime-lifetime covariance, we search for deviations from independent exponential decay that align with known spin correlations. Observation of nonzero lifetime correlations would compel a reassessment of how entanglement manifests in decaying systems, revealing hitherto unexplored temporal coherence.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Analysis of Unstructured Data with Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the particle physics community needs higher and higher precisions in order to test our current model of the subatomic world, larger and larger datasets are necessary. With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.</description>
