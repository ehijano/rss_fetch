      <title>ChemReservoir -- An Open-Source Framework for Chemically-Inspired Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive recycled plastic architecture: Vacuum-Sealed Chainmail Structures Through Computational Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction industry is a major consumer of raw materials, accounting for nearly half of global material usage annually, while generating significant waste that poses sustainability challenges. This paper explores the untapped potential of recycled plastics as a primary construction material, leveraging their lightweight, flexible, and customizable properties for advanced applications in modular chainmail systems. Through a computational workflow, the study optimizes the design, testing, and fabrication of vacuum-sealed chainmail structures composed of recycled plastic filaments, demonstrating their adaptability and structural performance for architectural use.
  Key contributions include a novel methodology for integrating recycled plastic filaments into chainmail geometries, validated through 2D sectional testing, 3D shell structure generation, and physical modeling under vacuum constraints. The research identifies the rectangular chainmail configuration as the most efficient and adaptable, achieving superior deformation capacity, material efficiency, and load-bearing performance. Optimization strategies for temporary structures highlight practical deployment potential, balancing material savings, usable area, and water drainage efficiency.
  The findings offer a foundation for innovative applications in extreme conditions, including disaster-prone areas, high-altitude environments, underwater platforms, and extraterrestrial habitats. These applications leverage the lightweight, adaptable, and durable properties of recycled plastics and modular chainmail systems, bridging the gap between waste management and high-performance design while addressing unique challenges in harsh and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear elastodynamic material identification of heterogeneous isogeometric Bernoulli-Euler beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Finite Element Model Updating framework for identifying heterogeneous material distributions in planar Bernoulli-Euler beams based on a rotation-free isogeometric formulation. The procedure follows two steps: First, the elastic properties are identified from quasi-static displacements; then, the density is determined from modal data (low frequencies and mode shapes), given the previously obtained elastic properties. The identification relies on three independent discretizations: the isogeometric finite element mesh, a high-resolution grid of experimental measurements, and a material mesh composed of low-order Lagrange elements. The material mesh approximates the unknown material distributions, with its nodal values serving as design variables. The error between experiments and numerical model is expressed in a least squares manner. The objective is minimized using local optimization with the trust-region method, providing analytical derivatives to accelerate computations. Several numerical examples exhibiting large displacements are provided to test the proposed approach. To alleviate membrane locking, the B2M1 discretization is employed when necessary. Quasi-experimental data is generated using refined finite element models with random noise applied up to 4%. The method yields satisfactory results as long as a sufficient amount of experimental data is available, even for high measurement noise. Regularization is used to ensure a stable solution for dense material meshes. The density can be accurately reconstructed based on the previously identified elastic properties. The proposed framework can be straightforwardly extended to shells and 3D continua.</description>

      <title>FinMultiTime: A Four-Modal Bilingual Dataset for Financial Time-Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure time series forecasting tasks typically focus exclusively on numerical features; however, real-world financial decision-making demands the comparison and analysis of heterogeneous sources of information. Recent advances in deep learning and large scale language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in capturing sentiment and other qualitative signals, thereby enhancing the accuracy of financial time series predictions. Despite these advances, most existing datasets consist solely of price series and news text, are confined to a single market, and remain limited in scale. In this paper, we introduce FinMultiTime, the first large scale, multimodal financial time series dataset. FinMultiTime temporally aligns four distinct modalities financial news, structured financial tables, K-line technical charts, and stock price time series across both the S&amp;P 500 and HS 300 universes. Covering 5,105 stocks from 2009 to 2025 in the United States and China, the dataset totals 112.6 GB and provides minute-level, daily, and quarterly resolutions, thus capturing short, medium, and long term market signals with high fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) scale and data quality markedly boost prediction accuracy; (2) multimodal fusion yields moderate gains in Transformer models; and (3) a fully reproducible pipeline enables seamless dataset updates.</description>

      <title>Benchmark for Antibody Binding Affinity Maturation and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate, standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza, anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein models including masked language models, autoregressive language models, inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result, structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.</description>

      <title>ReXVQA: A Large-scale Visual Question Answering Benchmark for Generalist Chest X-ray Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000 questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation, and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment, location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200 randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems, offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA</description>

      <title>Tensor-based multivariate function approximation: methods benchmarking and comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we evaluate the performances, the features and the user-experience of some methods (and their implementations) designed for tensor- (or data-) based multivariate function construction and approximation. To this aim, a collection of multivariate functions extracted from contributive works coming from different communities, is suggested. First, these functions with varying complexity (e.g. number and degree of the variables) and nature (e.g. rational, irrational, differentiable or not, symmetric, etc.) are used to construct tensors, each of different dimension and size on the disk. Second, grounded on this tensor, we inspect performances of each considered method (e.g. the accuracy, the computational time, the parameters tuning impact, etc.). Finally, considering the "best" parameter tuning set, we compare each method using multiple evaluation criteria. The purpose of this note is not to rank the methods but rather to evaluate as fairly as possible the different available strategies, with the idea in mind to guide users to understand the process, the possibilities, the advantages and the limits brought by each tools. The contribution claimed is to suggest a complete benchmark collection of some available tools for tensor approximation by surrogate models (e.g. rational functions, networks, etc.). In addition, as contributors of the multivariate Loewner Framework (mLF) approach (and its side implementation in MDSPACK), attention and details of the latter are more explicitly given, in order to provide readers a digest of this contributive work and some details with simple examples.</description>

      <title>A Private Smart Wallet with Probabilistic Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a privacy-preserving smart wallet with a novel invitation-based private onboarding mechanism. The solution integrates two levels of compliance in concert with an authority party: a proof of innocence mechanism and an ancestral commitment tracking system using bloom filters for probabilistic UTXO chain states. Performance analysis demonstrates practical efficiency: private transfers with compliance checks complete within seconds on a consumer-grade laptop, and overall with proof generation remaining low. On-chain costs stay minimal, ensuring affordability for all operations on Base layer 2 network. The wallet facilitates private contact list management through encrypted data blobs while maintaining transaction unlinkability. Our evaluation validates the approach's viability for privacy-preserving, compliance-aware digital payments with minimized computational and financial overhead.</description>

      <title>BRC20 Pinning Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BRC20 tokens are a type of non-fungible asset on the Bitcoin network. They allow users to embed customised content within Bitcoin's satoshis. The token frenzy reached a market size of US\$2.811\,b (2023Q3--2025Q1). However, this intuitive design has not undergone serious security scrutiny.
  We present the first analysis of BRC20's \emph{transfer} mechanism and identify a new attack vector. A typical BRC20 transfer involves two "bundled" on-chain transactions with different fee levels: the first (i.e., \textbf{Tx1}) with a lower fee inscribes the \textsf{transfer} request, while the second (i.e., \textbf{Tx2}) with a higher fee finalizes the actual transfer. An adversary can send a manipulated fee transaction (falling between the two fee levels), which causes \textbf{Tx1} to be processed while \textbf{Tx2} is pinned in the mempool. This locks BRC20 liquidity and disrupts normal withdrawal requests from users. We term this the \emph{BRC20 pinning attack}.
  We validated the attack in real-world settings in collaboration with Binance researchers. With their knowledge and permission, we conducted a controlled test against Binance's ORDI hot wallet, resulting in a temporary suspension of ORDI withdrawals for 3.5 hours. Recovery was performed shortly after. Further analysis confirms that the attack can be applied to over \textbf{90\%} of inscription-based tokens within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08435v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.
