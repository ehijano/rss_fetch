      <title>Neural association between musical features and shared inter-subject emotional perception while movie-watching: fMRI study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing use of naturalistic stimuli, such as feature films, brings research on emotions closer to ecologically valid settings within brain scanners, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Music is another cultural artifact known to evoke emotions, and film soundtracks are often designed to enhance the emotional impact of the narrative. However, the neural basis of shared emotional perception during movie-watching, and its relationship to the soundtrack, remains unclear. In this study, participants watched Forrest Gump in a 3T fMRI scanner. The reported shared arousal and valence (positive and negative) was correlated with the spectrogram and tempo information extracted from the soundtrack. For neuroimaging, four regions of interest (ROIs) related to audiovisual input and narrative content were examined: the superior temporal sulcus (STS), amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. Results: Strong correlations between spectral and tempo, and emotional features (Bonferroni corr). BOLD responses associated with shared positive and negative valence and high-arousal moments were compared to film events with low emotional agreement. Significant activations were found in the STS and precuneus (pFWE &lt; 0.05 peak level). No significant responses were observed in the amygdala or inferior frontal gyrus, but whole-brain analysis (pFWE &lt; 0.05 cluster extent) revealed frontal activity linked to negative valence, alongside expected occipito-temporal lobe responses to the audiovisual stimuli. The STS and precuneus were particularly active during shared emotional perception of valenced and high-arousal events, with the precuneus encoding valence from auditory information. Naturalistic stimuli show promise as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for emotion regulation deficits although challenges may arise when crafting an experimental control.</description>

      <title>Holistic structure of neural pathways underlies brain perceptual rivalry: A physical perspective of auditory stream segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the brain perceptual functions as emerging from complex neural connections, rather than only the behavior of specific neural groups, is increasingly recognized today. Taking the auditory stream segregation, a classical issue in the field of perceptual behaviors, as an example, we demonstrate its emergence from the topological structure of neural pathways, by constructing a holistic neural circuit model based solely on existing neurophysiological data. Combining quantification of deterministic neural dynamics, potential landscape and probability flux, this model accurately reproduces the nonequilibrium phase transition process from integrated stream to completely segregated streams. The mean duration time (MDT) of the auditory perceptions from the simulation accords with the reported experimental results, and its inverse Gaussian distribution is suggested to complement the original Gamma or Lognormal distributions of the MDT. Further, using average probability flux and entropy production rate, we reveal the dynamical and thermodynamical origins, and the cost of the auditory phase transition process, highlighting the role of time irreversibility and detailed balance breaking as bridges between theory and neurophysiological experiment. Moreover, we propose a fundamental principle for attentional modulation and successfully apply this theoretical framework to an attention-modulated system. Finally, two psychoacoustic experiments are conducted to validate the constructed model and the proposed attention mechanism. Our results highlight that the neural basis of a perceptual and cognitive behavior is not limited to a localized brain neural region, but has a holistic and systematic origin.</description>

      <title>Fitting, Evaluating, and Comparing Cognitive Architecture Models Using Likelihood: A Primer With Examples in ACT-R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive architectures are influential, integrated computational frameworks for modeling cognitive processes. Due to a variety of factors, however, researchers using cognitive architectures to explain and predict human performance rarely employ model validation, comparison, and selection techniques based on likelihood. This paper provides a primer on how to implement maximum likelihood techniques and its derivatives to fit and compare models at the individual and group level, using models implemented in the ACT-R cognitive architecture as examples. The paper covers the most common ways in which likelihood measures can be applied, under different scenarios, for models of different complexity, and provides further technical references for the interested reader. An accompanying notebook in Python provides the code to implement all of the suggestions.</description>

      <title>Learning Graph Filters for Structure-Function Coupling based Hub Node Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, tools from network science have been leveraged to characterize the organization of both structural and functional networks of the brain. One such measure of network organization is hub node identification. Hubs are specialized nodes within a network that link distinct brain units corresponding to specialized functional processes. Conventional methods for identifying hub nodes utilize different types of centrality measures and participation coefficient to profile various aspects of nodal importance. These methods solely rely on the functional connectivity networks constructed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ignoring the structure-function coupling in the brain. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing (GSP) based hub detection framework that utilizes both the structural connectivity and the functional activation to identify hub nodes. The proposed framework models functional activity as graph signals on the structural connectivity. Hub nodes are then detected based on the premise that hub nodes are sparse, have higher level of activity compared to their neighbors, and the non-hub nodes' activity can be modeled as the output of a graph-based filter. Based on these assumptions, an optimization framework, GraFHub, is formulated to learn the coefficients of the optimal polynomial graph filter and detect the hub nodes. The proposed framework is evaluated on both simulated data and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from Human Connectome Project (HCP).</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Causal Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on causal reasoning and longitudinal analysis. For example, for a patient with Alzheimer's disease (AD), how will the brain grey matter atrophy in a year if intervened on the A-beta level in cerebrospinal fluid? The answer is fundamental to diagnosis and follow-up treatment. However, this kind of inquiry involves counterfactual medical images which can not be acquired by instrumental or correlation-based image synthesis models. Yet, such queries require counterfactual medical images, not obtainable through standard image synthesis models. Hence, a causal longitudinal image synthesis (CLIS) method, enabling the synthesis of such images, is highly valuable. However, building a CLIS model confronts three primary yet unmet challenges: mismatched dimensionality between high-dimensional images and low-dimensional tabular variables, inconsistent collection intervals of follow-up data, and inadequate causal modeling capability of existing causal graph methods for image data. In this paper, we established a tabular-visual causal graph (TVCG) for CLIS overcoming these challenges through a novel integration of generative imaging, continuous-time modeling, and structural causal models combined with a neural network. We train our CLIS based on the ADNI dataset and evaluate it on two other AD datasets, which illustrate the outstanding yet controllable quality of the synthesized images and the contributions of synthesized MRI to the characterization of AD progression, substantiating the reliability and utility in clinics.</description>

      <title>Self-organized transport in noisy dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of multi-commodity transport in a noisy, nonlinear network. The nonlinearity determines the dynamics of the edge capacities, which can be amplified or suppressed depending on the local current flowing across an edge. We consider network self-organization for three different nonlinear functions: For all three we identify parameter regimes where noise leads to self-organization into more robust topologies, that are not found by the sole noiseless dynamics. Moreover, the interplay between noise and specific functional behavior of the nonlinearity gives rise to different features, such as (i) continuous or discontinuous responses to the demand strength and (ii) either single or multi-stable solutions. Our study shows the crucial role of the activation function on noise-assisted phenomena.</description>
