      <title>Hidden Structural Control of Solvent Transport under Soft Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport in soft jammed materials is often described as fluid motion through a fixed structure, leading naturally to capillary based descriptions. This picture appears particularly appropriate in strongly jammed systems, where structural rearrangements are suppressed and little visible motion is observed. Here we investigate solvent transport in foam and show that this intuition fails to capture key aspects of the transport process. By directly observing both liquid penetration and bubble motion under controlled boundary conditions, we demonstrate that solvent transport is strongly influenced by the mechanical response of the foam structure, even though the intrinsic imbibition relative to the foam matrix remains purely capillary-driven. In closed systems, the jammed structure resists penetration and leads to a pronounced slowdown that cannot be accounted for by purely capillary descriptions. In contrast, in open systems, collective bubble motion accompanies solvent invasion, resulting in an apparent acceleration of transport. These results indicate that the lack of structural motion does not guarantee a purely capillary description of transport. Our findings reveal a boundary controlled coupling between flow and structure, and highlight the need to reconsider transport processes in soft jammed systems, including foams, dense colloids, and biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Virtual ultrasound machine operating in a GHz to MHz frequency range for particle-based biomedical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound-matter interactions underpin numerous biomedical and soft-matter applications, yet simulating these phenomena is challenging due to the large separation of viscous and sonic time scales. Continuum methods capture large-scale wave propagation but cannot resolve microscale interactions, while particle-based approaches offer molecular resolution but struggle with efficiency and stability at larger scales. We introduce a particle-based virtual ultrasound machine that uses a novel smoothed dissipative particle dynamics variant with an implicit pressure solver and a negative-pressure stabilization scheme, required to mimic acoustic propagation across MHz-GHz frequencies. We demonstrate its capabilities by modeling the acoustophoresis of encapsulated microbubbles, a key mechanism in ultrasound-mediated drug delivery. Beyond this application, the approach establishes a generalizable platform for simulating wave-matter interactions in soft and biological materials, opening new directions for computational studies of acoustics-driven phenomena in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>The physics of cr\^epes: Elasto-gravity control of soft folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like a cr\^epe resting on a plate, a thin elastic sheet can fold smoothly under its own weight, forming reversible shapes without creases or imposed hinges. Such soft folds arise from a balance between elastic bending and gravity, yet their stability, packing limits, and dynamics remain poorly understood. Here we show that these behaviors are governed by a single physical length scale, the elasto-gravity length $\ell_{eg}$. Using experiments and heavy-elastica theory, we demonstrate that $\ell_{eg}$ sets the characteristic fold geometry, determines when a fold becomes unstable and unfolds, and limits how many reversible folds can be stacked in rectangular and circular sheets. In particular, when lengths are rescaled by $\ell_{eg}$, fold shapes and stability thresholds collapse across materials and thicknesses. We further show that unfolding follows a universal speed scaling $v \sim \sqrt{g\,\ell_{eg}}$, revealing a gravity-controlled time scale for the release of stored bending energy. Together, these results establish a unified physical framework for reversible folding, compact storage, and gravity-assisted deployment of thin elastic sheets.</description>

      <title>Deformation and orientation of a capsule with viscosity contrast in linear flows: a theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a perturbation theory to study the shape and the orientation of an initially spherical capsule of radius R with a viscosity contrast, a surface tension {\sigma} and a bending rigidity $\kappa$ in linear flows. The elastic mechanical response of membrane to deformations is described by three elastic constitutive law which are either Hookean, Neohookean or Skalak type leading to the introduction of a surface shear elastic modulus $G_s$ and the Poisson ratio (or analog quantities). At the leading order, the deformation, i.e. the so-called Taylor parameter is proportional to the elastic capillary number Ca which evaluates the ratio between the external viscous stress and the elastic membrane response. In this linear regime, the results do not depend on the elastic constitutive law as expected. Without surface tension and bending rigidity, we recover the results of Barthes-Biesel &amp; Rallison (1981) and notably the fact that the Taylor parameter does not depend on the viscosity contrast $\lambda$ contrary to the case of a viscous droplet. In our more general model, the deformation does no longer depend on $\lambda$ at the upper order. Now, the Taylor parameter also depends on two other dimensionless numbers: the surface elastocapillary ratio $\sigma/G_s$ and the dimensionless bending rigidity $B= \kappa/G_sR^2$. At the further order, the angle of inclination of the capsule with the direction of the shear flow, the analog of the Chaffey and Brenner equation for droplets is determined in each case. The results are in excellent agreement with the numerical ones performed with a code based on the boundary integral method providing an useful method to valid numerical developments.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectricity-driven softening of bend elasticity leads to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in a polar fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15687v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of recently observed spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in polar fluids is an unsolved problem, and poses fundamental questions as to how heliconical structures emerge in systems composed of achiral molecules. We report on the softening of bend elasticity close to such phase transition, showing that flexoelectric coupling between the electric polarization and the bend deformation is the responsible mechanism, presumably arising from the bent shape of the constituent highly polar molecules.</description>

      <title>A sequence of elastic patterns in a sheared bent sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We document a sequence of bifurcations and elastic patterns in sheared bent sheets of intermediate aspect ratio. The sheets undergo inversion of curvature through the passage of localized features, often in S-shaped pairs. Nested force-displacement hysteresis loops provide experimental evidence for snaking. Several mechanisms for coarsening and refinement of the patterns are observed, including splitting, merging, and escape through open boundaries. While most forces, including that required for full snap-through, scale with the length of the sheet, the initial drop in force upon pattern nucleation decreases rapidly with length.</description>

      <title>Surface Block Identity Controls Transport of Symmetric Diblock Copolymer Through Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how polymer architecture governs transport through nanopores is essential for nanocomposite fabrication, membrane design, and polymer upcycling. However, the effect of the nanoscale structure of copolymers on chain transport through nanoporous media remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that simply inverting the surface orientation of lamellar poly(styrene-block-2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) diblock copolymers, composed of two monomers with strongly contrasting affinities for SiO2, at the entrance of nanoporous silica significantly alters the kinetics of capillary rise infiltration. Using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry, we find that infiltration of symmetric PS-b-P2VP into silica nanoparticle (SiO2 NP) packings is significantly faster when the P2VP domain is the top layer of the film and first contacts the nanoparticles, compared to when the PS domain is the top layer. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this difference originates from block-specific adsorption pathways that reorganize the nanophase structure around nanoparticles: P2VP-first infiltration forms thin adsorbed layers that drive PS into the pore interiors, generating continuous interfacial pathways that enable rapid, interface-mediated transport. In contrast, PS-first infiltration produces thicker P2VP layers that isolate PS domains and disrupt pathway connectivity, forcing chains to rely on a slower, connectivity-limited transport mechanism through P2VP-rich interstitial regions. Above the order-disorder transition, or upon silanizing nanoparticles to neutralize surface affinity, the rate difference disappears. These findings demonstrate how the interplay between nanoscale domain configuration and polymer-surface affinity governs infiltration dynamics, providing mechanistic insight into tuning transport in nanostructured block copolymers.</description>

      <title>A Robust Truncated-Domain Approach for Cone--Jet Simulations in Electrospinning and Electrospraying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of electrospinning and electrospraying are computationally demanding due to large-scale separation between the needle and the tip-to-collector distance. The cone-jet mode that occurs in the vicinity of the needle arises from a delicate balance between surface tension, viscous stresses, inertia, and electric stresses. This mode has a central role in determining the subsequent instabilities of the jet and the eventual outcomes on the collector. Truncated-domain simulations offer a viable alternative but depend critically on the accuracy of far-field electrostatic boundary conditions. Existing truncated-domain approaches based on analytical expressions for the electric potential systematically underestimate the electric field near the needle tip and require empirical tuning informed by prior experiments or full-domain simulations, thereby limiting their predictive capability. Here, we present a general truncated-domain framework for electrohydrodynamic (EHD) simulations of the cone-jet mode that avoids these limitations. Our approach exploits inexpensive full-domain electrostatic simulations to obtain the exact electric field and potential distributions near the needle, which are then imposed as boundary conditions in an EHD simulation carried out on a truncated domain. Comparisons with full-domain EHD simulations and experimental data demonstrate that the proposed approach accurately reproduces cone-jet shapes as well as key physical quantities, including electric currents, charge distributions, velocity fields, and Maxwell stresses, while converging at substantially smaller domain sizes. The formulation eliminates tunable parameters, does not require prior knowledge of the cone-jet configuration, and significantly reduces computational cost, providing a reliable and predictive framework for studying electrohydrodynamic cone-jet flows.</description>

      <title>LEMONS: An open-source platform to generate non-circuLar, anthropometry-based pEdestrian shapes and simulate their Mechanical interactiONS in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To model dense crowds, the usual recourse to oversimplified (circular) pedestrian shapes and contact forces shows limitations. To help modellers overcome these limitations, we propose an open-source numerical tool. It consists of a Python library that generates 2D and 3D pedestrian crowds based on anthropometric data, and a C++ library that computes mechanical contacts with other agents and with obstacles, and evolves the crowd's configuration. Additionally, we provide an online platform with a user-friendly graphical interface for the Python library, and scripts to call the C++ library from Python. The tool enables users to implement their own decisional layer, i.e., to control the agents' choices of desired velocities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robophysics investigates the physical principles that govern living-like robots operating in complex, realworld environments. Despite remarkable technological advances, robots continue to face fundamental efficiency limitations. At the level of individual units, locomotion remains a challenge, while at the collective level, robot swarms struggle to achieve shared purpose, coordination, communication, and cost efficiency. This perspective article examines the key challenges faced by bio-inspired robotic collectives and highlights recent research efforts that incorporate principles from active-matter physics and biology into the modeling and design of robot swarms.</description>

      <title>Scaling of poroelastic coarsening and elastic arrest in crosslinked gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on crosslinked gels quenched from solvent-rich to solvent-poor conditions show solvent-rich domains embedded in a gel-rich matrix. These domains coarsen and then undergo kinetic arrest at micron scales for hours, before macroscopic drainage to equilibrium over an even longer time. Motivated by these observations, we develop a minimal model that couples capillarity-driven Darcy permeation to the viscoelastic-to-elastic crossover of the polymer network. In the viscoelastic regime, the Young--Laplace boundary traction (due to surface tension) at curved solvent--gel interfaces generates an isotropic pressure gradient in the solvent pores of the gel that drives solvent flow and coarsening. In the elastic regime, the same interfacial traction is balanced by a long-ranged deviatoric (non-isotropic) stress field, and the elastic equilibrium solution yields a spatially uniform pore pressure outside a domain, eliminating the Darcy driving force and arresting coarsening. Using the kinetic criterion $t(\lambda_{\rm arrest})\sim\tau_{\rm el}$, we predict stiffness-dependent growth laws and arrest lengths. For melt-like, polymer-rich gels, $\lambda(t)\sim G^{-1/2}t^{1/4}$ and $\lambda_{\rm arrest}\sim G^{-1/2}$. For low polymer fractions where the mesh size controls transport, $\lambda(t)\sim G^{-1/3}t^{1/3}$ and $\lambda_{\rm arrest}\sim G^{-1/3}$. The predicted $G^{-1/2}$ arrest scaling for melt-like gels is consistent with measurements.</description>

      <title>Linking the pressure dependence of the structure and thermal stability to {\alpha}- and \b{eta}-relaxations in metallic glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glasses derive their functional properties from complex relaxation dynamics that remain enigmatic under extreme conditions. While the temperature dependence of these relaxation processes is well-established, their behavior under high-pressure conditions remains poorly understood due to significant experimental difficulties. In this study, we employ cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe the pressure evolution of the relaxation spectrum in a Zr46.8Ti8.2Cu7.5Ni10Be27.5 metallic glass across gigapascal pressure ranges. Our findings reveal two distinct relaxation mechanisms under high pressure: In the \b{eta}-relaxation regime, compression drives the system with reduced atomic mobility and enhanced structural disorder, without significant density changes. Conversely, {\alpha}-relaxation under pressure promotes density-driven structural ordering that improves thermal stability. Notably, the transition between these regimes occurs at a constant T/Tg,P ratio, independent of applied pressure. These results provide crucial insights for decoupling the competing structural and relaxation contributions to glass stability, establishing a systematic framework for tailoring glass properties through controlled thermo-mechanical processing.</description>

      <title>A cell-level model to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of neurodegenerative disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in modeling neurodegenerative diseases is connecting cellular-level mechanisms to tissue-level pathology, in particular to determine whether pathology is driven primarily by cell-autonomous triggers or by propagation from cells that are already in a pathological, runaway aggregation state. To bridge this gap, we here develop a bottom-up physical model that explicitly incorporates these two fundamental cell-level drivers of protein aggregation dynamics. We show that our model naturally explains the characteristic long, slow development of pathology followed by a rapid acceleration, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the model reveals the existence of a critical switch point at which the system's dynamics transition from being dominated by slow, spontaneous formation of diseased cells to being driven by fast propagation. This framework provides a robust physical foundation for interpreting pathological data and offers a method to predict which class of therapeutic strategies is best matched to the underlying drivers of a specific disease.</description>
