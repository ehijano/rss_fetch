      <title>MuMeNet: A Network Simulator for Musical Metaverse Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Metaverse, a shared and spatially organized digital continuum, is transforming various industries, with music emerging as a leading use case. Live concerts, collaborative composition, and interactive experiences are driving the Musical Metaverse (MM), but the requirements of the underlying network and service infrastructures hinder its growth. These challenges underscore the need for a novel modeling and simulation paradigm tailored to the unique characteristics of MM sessions, along with specialized service provisioning strategies capable of capturing their interactive, heterogeneous, and multicast-oriented nature. To this end, we make a first attempt to formally model and analyze the problem of service provisioning for MM sessions in 5G/6G networks. We first formalize service and network graph models for the MM, using "live audience interaction in a virtual concert" as a reference scenario. We then present MuMeNet, a novel discrete-event network simulator specifically tailored to the requirements and the traffic dynamics of the MM. We showcase the effectiveness of MuMeNet by running a linear programming based orchestration policy on the reference scenario and providing performance analysis under realistic MM workloads.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for the Dynamic VNE with Alternatives Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) is a key enabler of network slicing, yet most formulations assume that each Virtual Network Request (VNR) has a fixed topology. Recently, VNE with Alternative topologies (VNEAP) was introduced to capture malleable VNRs, where each request can be instantiated using one of several functionally equivalent topologies that trade resources differently. While this flexibility enlarges the feasible space, it also introduces an additional decision layer, making dynamic embedding more challenging. This paper proposes HRL-VNEAP, a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for VNEAP under dynamic arrivals. A high-level policy selects the most suitable alternative topology (or rejects the request), and a low-level policy embeds the chosen topology onto the substrate network. Experiments on realistic substrate topologies under multiple traffic loads show that naive exploitation strategies provide only modest gains, whereas HRL-VNEAP consistently achieves the best performance across all metrics. Compared to the strongest tested baselines, HRL-VNEAP improves acceptance ratio by up to \textbf{20.7\%}, total revenue by up to \textbf{36.2\%}, and revenue-over-cost by up to \textbf{22.1\%}. Finally, we benchmark against an MILP formulation on tractable instances to quantify the remaining gap to optimality and motivate future work on learning- and optimization-based VNEAP solutions.</description>

      <title>AIORA: An AI-Native Multi-Stakeholder Orchestration Architecture for 6G Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper elaborates on a novel AI-native architecture for emerging 6G systems harnessing open APIs, along with supporting mechanisms to empower intelligent and coordinated orchestration of edge-cloud continuum resources. The AIORA architecture facilitates a seamless creation, life-cycle management, and exposure of services in multi-segment heterogeneous environments. It integrates new breeds of tools and advanced technologies to enable zero-touch management of an edge-cloud continuum, building on top of the 3GPP Edge Enablement Layer and the respective connectivity models, allowing to cater to the high flexibility, availability, efficiency, reliability, and resilience needs of the future 6G services and applications. Several ongoing industry initiatives -- such as ETSI MEC for edge computing platforms, the GSMA Operator Platform for multi-operator service federation, and CAMARA for cross-operator API standardization -- demonstrate the growing momentum towards integrated frameworks where edge, cloud, and network resources can be seamlessly orchestrated. Our proposed AIORA architecture not only aligns with these initiatives but also extends them by leveraging a multi-segment virtual continuum concept and nested AI-driven closed loops for real-time optimization.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Empowered Task Offloading in V2I Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge computing plays an essential role in the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks, where vehicles offload their intensive computation tasks to the road-side units for saving energy and reduce the latency. This paper designs the optimal task offloading policy to address the concerns involving processing delay, energy consumption and edge computing cost. Each computation task consisting of some interdependent sub-tasks is characterized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In such dynamic networks, a novel hierarchical Offloading scheme is proposed by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The inter-dependencies among the DAGs of the computation tasks are extracted using a graph neural network with attention mechanism. A parameterized DRL algorithm is developed to deal with the hierarchical action space containing both discrete and continuous actions. Simulation results with a real-world car speed dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the system overhead.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Layerwise Microservice Management in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small cells with edge computing are densely deployed in 5G mobile networks to provide high throughput communication and low-latency computation. The flexibility of edge computation is empowered by the deployment of lightweight container-based microservices. In this paper, we take the first step toward optimizing the microservice management in small-cell networks. The prominent feature is that each microservice consists of multiple image layers and different microservices may share some basic layers, thus bringing deep coupling in their placement and service provision. Our objective is to minimize the expected total latency of microservice requests under the storage, communication and computing constraints of the sparsely interconnected small cell nodes. We formulate a binary quadratic program (BQP) with the multi-dimensional strategy of the image layer placement, the access selection and the task assignment. The BQP problem is then transformed into an ILP problem, and is solved by use of a novel sphere-box alternating direction multipliers method (ADMM) with reasonable complexity $O(q^{4})$, where $q$ is the number of variables in the transformed problem. Trace-driven experiments show that the gap between our proposed algorithm and the optimal is reduced by 35$\%$ compared with benchmark algorithms.</description>
