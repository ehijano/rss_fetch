      <title>How Much of the United States Can Still Host New Hyperscale Data Centers? A Constraint-Based Feasibility Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of hyperscale data centers, primarily driven by cloud computing and generative AI is placing growing pressure on electricity systems, land, and climate-sensitive infrastructure. While existing maps document where data centers are currently located, a major unanswered question remains: where can hyperscale data centers still be built under present-day physical, infrastructural, and environmental constraints?
  Here we address this question, focusing on the United States, using a national-scale, constraint-first geospatial framework that infers feasibility from revealed hyperscale siting patterns rather than from demand forecasts or optimization assumptions. By combining power-grid adjacency, environmental limits, land-use constraints, and climatic constraints within a uniform hexagonal spatial system, we estimate the feasible hyperscale hosting capacity.
  Our presented approaches converge on a limited feasible land envelope, implying a substantial contraction relative to naive land-availability assumptions. Based on observed build-out patterns, we estimate that total physically feasible U.S. hyperscale capacity lies in the tens of gigawatts rather than the hundreds. The results of this piece are intended to support national-scale reasoning about infrastructure feasibility under modern constraints.</description>

      <title>Thermal Comfort Path Planning Tool for Urban Mobility in Austin, Texas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme heat poses a growing challenge for active transportation in cities like Austin, Texas, where conventional weather reporting (e.g. a single air temperature measurement for the whole city) fails to capture the large microclimate variations that pedestrians and cyclists actually experience. We present a novel walking and biking route planner that selects paths based on thermal comfort using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) (Jendritzky et al., 2012) rather than just distance or travel time. This system combines high-resolution thermal modeling with real-time route mapping. We generate city-scale UTCI maps using SOLWEIG-GPU (Solar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry), to account for urban features (buildings, trees, etc.) and weather conditions (Lindberg et al., 2008; Kamath et al., 2026). For any given origin and destination, our tool calculates the average UTCI along each possible route and recommends the 'coolest' route, i.e. the path with the lowest heat stress (often the most shaded or otherwise thermally comfortable), while still being reasonably direct. In a case study for Austin, this approach identifies routes that significantly reduce pedestrians' heat exposure (often recommending routes with a much larger proportion of shade). Such thermally-informed route planning has important public health implications: by helping people avoid dangerous heat hotspots and sun-exposed areas, it can reduce the risk of heat-related illness and make walking or biking a safer choice even on hot days. This paper describes the motivation, methodology, results, and implications of the thermal comfort path planner, emphasizing the role of shade and thermal comfort in urban mobility and heat mitigation.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Topology of Global Imbalances:A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Systemic Risk in the Balance of Payments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional balance-of-payments (BoP) analysis treats national external positions as largely idiosyncratic time series. This misses an essential structural fact: global imbalances are jointly realized on a directed, weighted network of cross-border current-account and financial claims. We propose a network-theoretic paradigm in which the world economy is a directed graph whose edge weights encode net bilateral exposures. In this setting, systemic fragility is an emergent property of the spectral topology of the global exposure matrix. We develop (i) a mathematically explicit construction of a BoP adjacency operator, (ii) a \textbf{Spectral Stability Criterion} proving that the system is globally asymptotically stable if and only if the spectral radius $\rho(A) &lt; 1$, and (iii) a \textbf{Spectral Stability Margin} ($\delta = 1 - \rho(B)$) that quantifies the proximity of the global economy to a ``Critical Slowing Down'' phase transition. Furthermore, we define a systemic-risk index using eigenvector centrality to identify nodes whose failure is mathematically indistinguishable from global collapse. Finally, we employ a \textbf{Non-backtracking (Hashimoto) operator} to derive a precise \textbf{topological threshold} for sovereign debt contagion, filtering bilateral ``noise'' to isolate deep-network circulation. Our results demonstrate that systemic risk is a latent property of the global spectral topology, requiring macroprudential interventions targeted at the network's spectral gaps rather than individual debt-to-GDP ratios.</description>

      <title>Indirect Reciprocity with Environmental Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity maintains cooperation in stranger societies by mapping individual behaviors onto reputation signals via social norms. Existing theoretical frameworks assume static environments with constant resources and fixed payoff structures. However, in real-world systems, individuals' strategic behaviors not only shape their reputation but also induce collective-level resource changes in ecological, economic, or other external environments, which in turn reshape the incentives governing future individual actions. To overcome this limitation, we establish a co-evolutionary framework that couples moral assessment, strategy updating, and environmental dynamics, allowing the payoff structure to dynamically adjust in response to the ecological consequences of collective actions. We find that this environmental feedback mechanism helps lower the threshold for the emergence of cooperation, enabling the system to spontaneously transition from a low-cooperation state to a stable high-cooperation regime, thereby reducing the dependence on specific initial conditions. Furthermore, while lenient norms demonstrate adaptability in static environments, norms with strict discrimination are shown to be crucial for curbing opportunism and maintaining evolutionary resilience in dynamic settings. Our results reveal the evolutionary dynamics of coupled systems involving reputation institutions and environmental constraints, offering a new theoretical perspective for understanding collective cooperation and social governance in complex environments.</description>

      <title>A Distinct Communication Strategies Model of the Double Empathy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double empathy problem recasts the difficulty of forming empathy bonds in social interactions between autistic and neurotypical individuals as a bidirectional problem, rather than due to a deficit exclusive to the person on the spectrum. However, no explicit mechanism to explain such a phenomenon has been proposed. Here we build a feedback-loop mathematical model that would theoretically induce the empathy degradation observed during communication in neurotypical-autistic pairs solely due to differences in communication preferences between neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals. Numerical simulations of dyadic interactions show the model, whose mechanism is based solely on communication preferences, can illustrate the breakdown of empathic bonding observed clinically. Stability analysis of the model provides a way to predict the overall trajectory of the interaction in the empathy space. Furthermore, we suggest experimental designs to measure several parameters outlined here and discuss the future directions for testing the proposed model.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Lying in a Spatially-Explicit Prisoner's Dilemma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present the results from a spatial model of the prisoner's dilemma, played on a toroidal lattice. Each individual has a default strategy of either cooperating ($C$) or defecting ($D$). Two strategies were tested, including ``tit-for-tat'' (TFT), in which individuals play their opponent's last play, or simply playing their default play. Each individual also has a probability of telling the truth ($0 \leq P_{truth} \leq 1$) about their last play. This parameter, which can evolve over time, allows individuals to be, for instance, a defector but present as a cooperator regarding their last play. This leads to interesting dynamics where mixed populations of defectors and cooperators with $P_{truth} \geq 0.75$ move toward populations of truth-telling cooperators. Likewise, mixed populations with $P_{truth} &lt; 0.7$ become populations of lying defectors. Both such populations are stable because they each have higher average scores than populations with intermediate values of $P_{truth}$. Applications of this model are discussed with regards to both humans and animals.</description>

      <title>Social Catalysts, Not Moral Agents: The Illusion of Alignment in LLM Societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems where collective cooperation is often threatened by the "Tragedy of the Commons." This study investigates the effectiveness of Anchoring Agents--pre-programmed altruistic entities--in fostering cooperation within a Public Goods Game (PGG). Using a full factorial design across three state-of-the-art LLMs, we analyzed both behavioral outcomes and internal reasoning chains. While Anchoring Agents successfully boosted local cooperation rates, cognitive decomposition and transfer tests revealed that this effect was driven by strategic compliance and cognitive offloading rather than genuine norm internalization. Notably, most agents reverted to self-interest in new environments, and advanced models like GPT-4.1 exhibited a "Chameleon Effect," masking strategic defection under public scrutiny. These findings highlight a critical gap between behavioral modification and authentic value alignment in artificial societies.</description>

      <title>Influence Mechanism Of Environmental Stimulus And Consumer Ethnocentrism On Purchasing Wuliangye: Applications Of Extended Theory Of Planned Behavior (ETPB) And Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental stimuli play a pivotal role in triggering impulsive purchases among consumers,while consumers from Sichuan Province, China, exhibit strong ethnocentric tendencies, impacting their decision-making process, particularly regarding Wuliangye liquor, a local product. Through an online survey of 453 Wuliangye consumers from Sichuan, an analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling rooted in the ETPB and SOR theory. This analysis revealed the favorable impact of environmental stimuli and consumer ethnocentrism on purchasing behavior. This influence was found to be partially mediated through perceived value, attitudes, and purchase intention, forming a chain-mediated effect. Notably, purchase intention doesn't always translate to actual buying behavior, with environmental stimuli, consumer ethnocentrism, perceived behavioral control and purchase intention all being robust predictors of purchase behavior. Finally, several management strategies were proposed, aimed at bolstering Wuliangye sales, with a focus on platform development, mid-to-low range product creation, and appealing to Generation Z consumers.</description>

      <title>Toward a new AI winter? How diffusion of technological innovation on networks leads to chaotic boom-bust cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological developments and the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) are omnipresent themes and concerns of the present day. Much has been written on these topics but applications of quantitative models to understand the techno-social landscape have been much more limited. We propose a mathematical model that can help understand in a unified manner the patterns underlying technological development and also identify the different regimes in which the technological landscape evolves. First, we develop a model of innovation diffusion between different technologies, the growth of each reinforcing the development of the others. The model has a variable that quantifies the level of development (or innovation, discovery) potential for a given technology. The potential, or market capacity, increases via diffusion from related technologies, reflecting the fact that a technology does not develop in isolation. Hence, the growth of each technology is influenced by how developed its neighboring (related) technologies are. This allows us to reproduce long-term trends seen in computing technology and large language models (LLMs). We then present a three-dimensional system of supply, demand, and investment which shows oscillations (business cycles) emerging if investment is too high into a given technology, product, or market. We finally combine the two models through a common variable and show that if investment or diffusion is too high in the network context, chaotic boom-bust cycles can emerge. These quantitative considerations allow us to reproduce the boom-bust patterns seen in non-fungible token (NFT) transaction data and also have deep implications for the development of AI which we highlight, such as the arrival of a new AI winter.</description>

      <title>Entropy Geometry and Condensation in Wealth Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a statistical framework for wealth allocation in which agents hold discrete units of wealth and macrostates are defined by how wealth is distributed across agents. The structure of the economic state space is characterized through a value convertibility function, which captures how effectively additional wealth can be transformed into productive or meaningful value. The derivative of this function determines the effective number of internally distinct configurations available to an agent at a given wealth level. In a closed setting with fixed total wealth and a fixed number of agents, we show that equilibrium wealth distributions follow directly from unbiased counting of admissible configurations and may display a condensation phenomenon, where a finite fraction of total wealth accumulates onto a single agent once the remaining agents can no longer absorb additional wealth. We then extend the framework to open systems in which both total wealth and the number of agents may vary. By embedding the system within a larger closed environment and analyzing a finite subsystem, we show that exponential weighting in wealth and agent number emerges naturally from counting arguments alone, without invoking explicit optimization or entropy maximization principles. This extension leads to a richer interpretation of wealth concentration: accumulation is no longer driven solely by excess wealth, but by a balance between wealth growth and the system's capacity to accommodate new agents. Condensation arises when this capacity is limited, forcing surplus wealth to concentrate onto a few agents. The framework thus provides a minimal and structurally grounded description of wealth concentration in both closed and open economic settings.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Spectra Analysis of Pulse Series - Application to Lung Sounds with Abnormalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the "theoretical limit of time-frequency resolution of Fourier analysis" is from its numerical implementation, especially from an assumption of "Periodic Boundary Condition (PBC)," which was introduced a century ago. We previously proposed to replace this condition with "Linear eXtrapolation Condition (LXC)," which does not require periodicity. This feature makes instantaneous spectra analysis of pulse series available, which replaces the short time Fourier transform (STFT). We applied the instantaneous spectra analysis to two lung sounds with abnormalities (crackles and wheezing) and to a normal lung sound, as a demonstration. Among them, crackles contains a random pulse series. The spectrum of each pulse is available, and the spectrogram of pulse series is available with assembling each spectrum. As a result, the time-frequency structure of given pulse series is visualized.</description>

      <title>Emergent structures in coupled opinion and network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a model of opinion formation on an adaptive social network, consisting of a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for individuals' opinions and corresponding network edge weights. A key driver of the system's behaviour is the form of the interaction function, which determines the strength of interactions based on the distance between individuals' opinions and appears in both opinion and network dynamics. Two cases are examined: in the first the interaction function is always positive and in the second case the interaction function is of bounded-confidence type. In both cases there is positive feedback between opinion clustering and the emergence of community structure in the social network. This is confirmed through analytical results on long-term behaviour, extending existing results for a fixed network, as well as through numerical simulations. Transient network dynamics are also examined through a short-time approximation that captures the `typical' early network dynamics. Each approach improves some aspect of our understanding of the interplay between opinion and network evolution.</description>

      <title>Link Fraction Mixed Membership Reveals Community Diversity in Aggregated Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a critical tool for understanding the mesoscopic structure of large-scale networks. However, when applied to aggregated or coarse-grained social networks, disjoint community partitions cannot capture the diverse composition of community memberships within aggregated nodes. While existing mixed membership methods alleviate this issue, they may detected communities that are highly sensitive to the aggregation resolution, not reliably reflecting the underlying community structure of the underlying individual-level network. This paper presents the Link Fraction Mixed Membership (LFMM) method, which computes the mixed memberships of nodes in aggregated networks. Unlike existing mixed membership methods, LFMM is consistent under aggregation. Specifically, we show that it conserves community membership sums at different scales. The method is utilized to study a population-scale social network of the Netherlands, aggregated at different resolutions. Experiments reveal variation in community membership across different geographical regions and evolution over the last decade. In particular, we show how our method identifies large urban hubs that act as the melting pots of diverse, spatially remote communities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Calgary, November 2005, Chad Hedrick was the first to skate the 5,000 m below 6:10. His world record time 6:09.68 was then beaten a week later, in Salt Lake City, by Sven Kramer's 6:08.78. Further top races and world records followed over the ensuing seasons; up to and including the 2024-2025 season, a total of 126 races have been below 6:10, with Nils van der Poel's 2021 world record being 6:01.56. The appropriately hyped-up canonical question for the friends and followers and aficionados of speedskating has then been when (and by whom  we for the first time would witness a below 6:00.00 race. In this note I first use extreme value statistics modelling to assess the state of affairs, as per the end of the 2024-2025 season, with predictions and probabilities for the 2025-2026 season. Under natural modelling assumptions the probability of seeing a new world record during this new season is shown to be about ten percent. We were indeed excited but in reality merely modestly surprised that a race better than van der Poel's record was clocked, by Timothy Loubineaud, in Salt Lake City, November 14, 2025. But Six-Minute Man Sander Eitrem's outstanding 5:58.52 in Inzell, on January 24, 2026, is truly beamonesquely shocking. I also use the modelling machinery to analyse the post-Eitrem situation, and suggest answers to the question of how fast the 5,000 m ever can be skated.</description>

      <title>Emergence and co-existence of periodic and unstructured motion in future-avoiding random walks</title>

Abstract: Self-avoiding random walks on graphs can be seen as walkers interacting with their own past history. This letter considers a complementary class of dynamics: Mutual future avoiding random walks (MFARWs), where stochastically driven walkers are avoiding each others planned future trajectories. Such systems arise naturally in conceptual models of shared mobility. We show that periodic behavior emerges spontaneously in such MFARWs, and that periodic and unstructured behavior coexist, providing a first example of Chimera style behavior of non-oscillatory paths on networks. Further, we analytically describe and predict the onset of structure. We find that the phase transition from unstructured to periodic behavior is driven by a novel mechanism of self-amplifying coupling to the periodic components of the stochastic drivers of the system. In the context of shared mobility applications, these Chimera states imply a regime of naturally stable co-existence between flexible and line-based public transport.</description>

      <title>Noisy nonlocal aggregation model with gradient flow structures</title>

Abstract: Interacting particle systems provide a fundamental framework for modeling collective behavior in biological, social, and physical systems. In many applications, stochastic perturbations are essential for capturing environmental variability and individual uncertainty, yet their impact on long-term dynamics and equilibrium structure remains incompletely understood, particularly in the presence of nonlocal interactions. We investigate a stochastic interacting particle system governed by potential-driven interactions and its continuum density formulation in the large-population limit. We introduce an energy functional and show that the macroscopic density evolution has a gradient-flow structure in the Wasserstein-2 space. The associated variational framework yields equilibrium states through constrained energy minimization and illustrates how noise regulates the density and mitigates singular concentration. We demonstrate the connection between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions through numerical examples in one and two dimensions. Within the variational framework, we compute energy minimizers and perform a linear stability analysis. The numerical results show that the stable minimizers agree with the long-time dynamics of the macroscopic density model.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Missing Transmission Chain Information in Agent-Based Models: Outcomes of Superspreading Events and Workplace Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) have emerged as distinguished tools for epidemic modeling due to their ability to capture detailed human contact patterns and can, thus, support decision-makers in times of outbreaks and epidemics. However, as a result of missing correspondingly resolved data transmission events are often modeled based on simplified assumptions. In this article, we present a framework to assess the impact of these simplifications on epidemic prediction outcomes, considering superspreading and workplace transmission events. We couple the VADERE microsimulation model with the large-scale MEmilio-ABM and compare the outcomes of four outbreak events after 10 days of simulation in a synthetic city district generated from German census data. In a restaurant superspreading event, where up to four households share tables, we observe 17.2 % more infections on day 10 after the outbreak. The difference increases to 46.0 % more infections when using the simplified initialization in a setting where only two households share tables. We observe similar outcomes (41.3 % vs. 9.3 % more infections) for two workplace settings with different mixing patterns between teams at work. In addition to the aggregated difference, we show differences in spatial dynamics and transmission trees obtained with complete or reduced outbreak information. We observe differences between simplified and fully detailed initializations that become more pronounced when the subnetworks in the outbreak setting are mixing less. In consequence and aside from classical calibration of models, the significant outcome differences should drive us to develop a more profound understanding of how and where simplified assumptions about transmission events are adequate.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous expressed-private $q$-voter model on networks: self-anticonformity and preference falsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People may express preferences that differ from their privately held views, often under social pressure, and may fail to act on their stated intentions. Such inconsistencies are referred to as preference falsification and the intention-behavior gap, respectively. Both hamper collective decision-making and adaptation, complicating policy formulation and implementation. To simulate these phenomena, dual-layer opinion agent-based models are used, in which each agent holds both a private and an expressed (public) opinion. Within the $q$-voter framework, two expressed-private opinion (EPO) models have been introduced in which private and expressed opinions are updated synchronously; two variants differ only by the presence of self-anticonformity, a mechanism in which an agent may set its private opinion opposite to its current expressed opinion, breaking internal harmony and creating a state akin to cognitive dissonance. Here, we extend these models by introducing an asynchronous update: in each elementary step, an agent updates its private opinion with probability $\alpha$ or its expressed opinion with complementary probability; hence the name $\alpha$-EPO models. Using Monte Carlo simulations on both artificial and real organizational social networks, along with mean-field and pair approximation analyses, we show that self-anticonformity makes collective outcomes robust to behavioral volatility tuned by $\alpha$, enhances collective agreement, and suppresses hysteresis. In contrast, without self-anticonformity, $\alpha$ affects the nature of the transition between agreement and disagreement: higher values of $\alpha$ suppress hysteresis and enhance overall agreement.</description>

      <title>Temporal Motif Participation Profiles for Analyzing Node Similarity in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks consisting of timestamped interactions between a set of nodes provide a useful representation for analyzing complex networked systems that evolve over time. Beyond pairwise interactions between nodes, temporal motifs capture patterns of higher-order interactions such as directed triangles over short time periods. We propose temporal motif participation profiles (TMPPs) to capture the behavior of nodes in temporal motifs. Two nodes with similar TMPPs take similar positions within temporal motifs, possibly with different nodes. TMPPs serve as unsupervised embeddings for nodes in temporal networks that are directly interpretable, as each entry denotes the frequency at which a node participates in a particular position in a specific temporal motif. We demonstrate that clustering TMPPs reveals groups of nodes with similar roles in a temporal network through simulation experiments and a case study on a network of militarized interstate disputes.</description>
