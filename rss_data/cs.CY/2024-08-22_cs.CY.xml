      <title>Gender Bias Evaluation in Text-to-image Generation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of text-to-image generation has brought rising ethical considerations, especially regarding gender bias. Given a text prompt as input, text-to-image models generate images according to the prompt. Pioneering models such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing high-fidelity images from natural language prompts. However, these models often exhibit gender bias, as studied by the tendency of generating man from prompts such as "a photo of a software developer". Given the widespread application and increasing accessibility of these models, bias evaluation is crucial for regulating the development of text-to-image generation. Unlike well-established metrics for evaluating image quality or fidelity, the evaluation of bias presents challenges and lacks standard approaches. Although biases related to other factors, such as skin tone, have been explored, gender bias remains the most extensively studied. In this paper, we review recent work on gender bias evaluation in text-to-image generation, involving bias evaluation setup, bias evaluation metrics, and findings and trends. We primarily focus on the evaluation of recent popular models such as Stable Diffusion, a diffusion model operating in the latent space and using CLIP text embedding, and DALL-E 2, a diffusion model leveraging Seq2Seq architectures like BART. By analyzing recent work and discussing trends, we aim to provide insights for future work.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Sustainability Compliance: Characterizing the EU Taxonomy for Business Process Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To promote sustainable business practices, and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, the EU has developed the taxonomy of sustainable activities, which describes when exactly business practices can be considered sustainable. While the taxonomy has only been recently established, progressively more companies will have to report how much of their revenue was created via sustainably executed business processes. To help companies prepare to assess whether their business processes comply with the constraints outlined in the taxonomy, we investigate in how far these criteria can be used for conformance checking, that is, assessing in a data-driven manner, whether business process executions adhere to regulatory constraints. For this, we develop a few-shot learning pipeline to characterize the constraints of the taxonomy with the help of an LLM as to the process dimensions they relate to. We find that many constraints of the taxonomy are useable for conformance checking, particularly in the sectors of energy, manufacturing, and transport. This will aid companies in preparing to monitor regulatory compliance with the taxonomy automatically, by characterizing what kind of information they need to extract, and by providing a better understanding of sectors where such an assessment is feasible and where it is not.</description>

      <title>Research on the Application of Large Language Models in Automatic Question Generation: A Case Study of ChatGLM in the Context of High School Information Technology Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application effectiveness of the Large Language Model (LLMs) ChatGLM in the automated generation of high school information technology exam questions. Through meticulously designed prompt engineering strategies, the model is guided to generate diverse questions, which are then comprehensively evaluated by domain experts. The evaluation dimensions include the Hitting(the degree of alignment with teaching content), Fitting (the degree of embodiment of core competencies), Clarity (the explicitness of question descriptions), and Willing to use (the teacher's willingness to use the question in teaching). The results indicate that ChatGLM outperforms human-generated questions in terms of clarity and teachers' willingness to use, although there is no significant difference in hit rate and fit. This finding suggests that ChatGLM has the potential to enhance the efficiency of question generation and alleviate the burden on teachers, providing a new perspective for the future development of educational assessment systems. Future research could explore further optimizations to the ChatGLM model to maintain high fit and hit rates while improving the clarity of questions and teachers' willingness to use them.</description>

      <title>Decoding Pedestrian Stress on Urban Streets using Electrodermal Activity Monitoring in Virtual Immersive Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pedestrian stress level is shown to significantly influence human cognitive processes and, subsequently, decision-making, e.g., the decision to select a gap and cross a street. This paper systematically studies the stress experienced by a pedestrian when crossing a street under different experimental manipulations by monitoring the ElectroDermal Activity (EDA) using the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor. To fulfil the research objectives, a dynamic and immersive virtual reality (VR) platform was used, which is suitable for eliciting and capturing pedestrian's emotional responses in conjunction with monitoring their EDA. A total of 171 individuals participated in the experiment, tasked to cross a two-way street at mid-block with no signal control. Mixed effects models were employed to compare the influence of socio-demographics, social influence, vehicle technology, environment, road design, and traffic variables on the stress levels of the participants. The results indicated that having a street median in the middle of the road operates as a refuge and significantly reduced stress. Younger participants were (18-24 years) calmer than the relatively older participants (55-65 years). Arousal levels were higher when it came to the characteristics of the avatar (virtual pedestrian) in the simulation, especially for those avatars with adventurous traits. The pedestrian location influenced stress since the stress was higher on the street while crossing than waiting on the sidewalk. Significant causes of arousal were fear of accidents and an actual accident for pedestrians. The estimated random effects show a high degree of physical and mental learning by the participants while going through the scenarios.</description>

      <title>VIRIS: Simulating indoor airborne transmission combining architectural design and people movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Viral Infection Risk Indoor Simulator (VIRIS) has been developed to quickly assess and compare mitigations for airborne disease spread. This agent-based simulator combines people movement in an indoor space, viral transmission modelling and detailed architectural design, and it is powered by topologicpy, an open-source Python library. VIRIS generates very fast predictions of the viral concentration and the spatiotemporal infection risk for individuals as they move through a given space. The simulator is validated with data from a courtroom superspreader event. A sensitivity study for unknown parameter values is also performed. We compare several non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) issued in UK government guidance, for two indoor settings: a care home and a supermarket. Additionally, we have developed the user-friendly VIRIS web app that allows quick exploration of diverse scenarios of interest and visualisation, allowing policymakers, architects and space managers to easily design or assess infection risk in an indoor space.</description>

      <title>Statistical Challenges with Dataset Construction: Why You Will Never Have Enough Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance on many computer vision benchmarks in recent years. However, can we be confident that impressive performance on benchmarks will translate to strong performance in real-world environments? Many environments in the real world are safety critical, and even slight model failures can be catastrophic. Therefore, it is crucial to test models rigorously before deployment. We argue, through both statistical theory and empirical evidence, that selecting representative image datasets for testing a model is likely implausible in many domains. Furthermore, performance statistics calculated with non-representative image datasets are highly unreliable. As a consequence, we cannot guarantee that models which perform well on withheld test images will also perform well in the real world. Creating larger and larger datasets will not help, and bias aware datasets cannot solve this problem either. Ultimately, there is little statistical foundation for evaluating models using withheld test sets. We recommend that future evaluation methodologies focus on assessing a model's decision-making process, rather than metrics such as accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Dilemma of Uncertainty Estimation for General Purpose AI in the EU AI Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AI act is the European Union-wide regulation of AI systems. It includes specific provisions for general-purpose AI models which however need to be further interpreted in terms of technical standards and state-of-art studies to ensure practical compliance solutions. This paper examines the AI act requirements for providers and deployers of general-purpose AI and further proposes uncertainty estimation as a suitable measure for legal compliance and quality assurance in training of such models. We argue that uncertainty estimation should be a required component for deploying models in the real world, and under the EU AI Act, it could fulfill several requirements for transparency, accuracy, and trustworthiness. However, generally using uncertainty estimation methods increases the amount of computation, producing a dilemma, as computation might go over the threshold ($10^{25}$ FLOPS) to classify the model as a systemic risk system which bears more regulatory burden.</description>

      <title>Modeling Reference-dependent Choices with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the classic Prospect Theory has highlighted the reference-dependent and comparative nature of consumers' product evaluation processes, few models have successfully integrated this theoretical hypothesis into data-driven preference quantification, particularly in the realm of recommender systems development. To bridge this gap, we propose a new research problem of modeling reference-dependent preferences from a data-driven perspective, and design a novel deep learning-based framework named Attributed Reference-dependent Choice Model for Recommendation (ArcRec) to tackle the inherent challenges associated with this problem. ArcRec features in building a reference network from aggregated historical purchase records for instantiating theoretical reference points, which is then decomposed into product attribute specific sub-networks and represented through Graph Neural Networks. In this way, the reference points of a consumer can be encoded at the attribute-level individually from her past experiences but also reflect the crowd influences. ArcRec also makes novel contributions to quantifying consumers' reference-dependent preferences using a deep neural network-based utility function that integrates both interest-inspired and price-inspired preferences, with their complex interaction effects captured by an attribute-aware price sensitivity mechanism. Most importantly, ArcRec introduces a novel Attribute-level Willingness-To-Pay measure to the reference-dependent utility function, which captures a consumer's heterogeneous salience of product attributes via observing her attribute-level price tolerance to a product. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world online shopping datasets demonstrate ArcRec's superior performances over fourteen state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Parallel Algorithms for Median Consensus Clustering in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm that finds the consensus of many different clustering solutions of a graph. We formulate the problem as a median set partitioning problem and propose a greedy optimization technique. Unlike other approaches that find median set partitions, our algorithm takes graph structure into account and finds a comparable quality solution much faster than the other approaches. For graphs with known communities, our consensus partition captures the actual community structure more accurately than alternative approaches. To make it applicable to large graphs, we remove sequential dependencies from our algorithm and design a parallel algorithm. Our parallel algorithm achieves 35x speedup when utilizing 64 processing cores for large real-world graphs from single-cell experiments.</description>

      <title>Lookism: The overlooked bias in computer vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there have been significant advancements in computer vision which have led to the widespread deployment of image recognition and generation systems in socially relevant applications, from hiring to security screening. However, the prevalence of biases within these systems has raised significant ethical and social concerns. The most extensively studied biases in this context are related to gender, race and age. Yet, other biases are equally pervasive and harmful, such as lookism, i.e., the preferential treatment of individuals based on their physical appearance. Lookism remains under-explored in computer vision but can have profound implications not only by perpetuating harmful societal stereotypes but also by undermining the fairness and inclusivity of AI technologies. Thus, this paper advocates for the systematic study of lookism as a critical bias in computer vision models. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify three areas of intersection between lookism and computer vision. We illustrate them by means of examples and a user study. We call for an interdisciplinary approach to address lookism, urging researchers, developers, and policymakers to prioritize the development of equitable computer vision systems that respect and reflect the diversity of human appearances.</description>

      <title>Don't Kill the Baby: The Case for AI in Arbitration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the introduction of Generative AI (GenAI) in 2022, its ability to simulate human intelligence and generate content has sparked both enthusiasm and concern. While much criticism focuses on AI's potential to perpetuate bias, create emotional dissonance, displace jobs, and raise ethical questions, these concerns often overlook the practical benefits of AI, particularly in legal contexts.
  This article examines the integration of AI into arbitration, arguing that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) allows parties to contractually choose AI-driven arbitration, despite traditional reservations. The article makes three key contributions: (1) It shifts the focus from debates over AI's personhood to the practical aspects of incorporating AI into arbitration, asserting that AI can effectively serve as an arbitrator if both parties agree; (2) It positions arbitration as an ideal starting point for broader AI adoption in the legal field, given its flexibility and the autonomy it grants parties to define their standards of fairness; and (3) It outlines future research directions, emphasizing the importance of empirically comparing AI and human arbitration, which could lead to the development of distinct systems.
  By advocating for the use of AI in arbitration, this article underscores the importance of respecting contractual autonomy and creating an environment that allows AI's potential to be fully realized. Drawing on the insights of Judge Richard Posner, the article argues that the ethical obligations of AI in arbitration should be understood within the context of its technological strengths and the voluntary nature of arbitration agreements. Ultimately, it calls for a balanced, open-minded approach to AI in arbitration, recognizing its potential to enhance the efficiency, fairness, and flexibility of dispute resolution</description>

      <title>TAGIFY: LLM-powered Tagging Interface for Improved Data Findability on OGD portals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efforts directed towards promoting Open Government Data (OGD) have gained significant traction across various governmental tiers since the mid-2000s. As more datasets are published on OGD portals, finding specific data becomes harder, leading to information overload. Complete and accurate documentation of datasets, including association of proper tags with datasets is key to improving dataset findability and accessibility. Analysis conducted on the Estonian Open Data Portal, revealed that 11% datasets have no associated tags, while 26% had only one tag assigned to them, which underscores challenges in data findability and accessibility within the portal, which, according to the recent Open Data Maturity Report, is considered trend-setter. The aim of this study is to propose an automated solution to tagging datasets to improve data findability on OGD portals. This paper presents Tagify - a prototype of tagging interface that employs large language models (LLM) such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to automate dataset tagging, generating tags for datasets in English and Estonian, thereby augmenting metadata preparation by data publishers and improving data findability on OGD portals by data users. The developed solution was evaluated by users and their feedback was collected to define an agenda for future prototype improvements.</description>

      <title>Gender, Race, and Intersectional Bias in Resume Screening via Language Model Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) hiring tools have revolutionized resume screening, and large language models (LLMs) have the potential to do the same. However, given the biases which are embedded within LLMs, it is unclear whether they can be used in this scenario without disadvantaging groups based on their protected attributes. In this work, we investigate the possibilities of using LLMs in a resume screening setting via a document retrieval framework that simulates job candidate selection. Using that framework, we then perform a resume audit study to determine whether a selection of Massive Text Embedding (MTE) models are biased in resume screening scenarios. We simulate this for nine occupations, using a collection of over 500 publicly available resumes and 500 job descriptions. We find that the MTEs are biased, significantly favoring White-associated names in 85.1\% of cases and female-associated names in only 11.1\% of cases, with a minority of cases showing no statistically significant differences. Further analyses show that Black males are disadvantaged in up to 100\% of cases, replicating real-world patterns of bias in employment settings, and validate three hypotheses of intersectionality. We also find an impact of document length as well as the corpus frequency of names in the selection of resumes. These findings have implications for widely used AI tools that are automating employment, fairness, and tech policy.</description>

      <title>ClaimVer: Explainable Claim-Level Verification and Evidence Attribution of Text Through Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the midst of widespread misinformation and disinformation through social media and the proliferation of AI-generated texts, it has become increasingly difficult for people to validate and trust information they encounter. Many fact-checking approaches and tools have been developed, but they often lack appropriate explainability or granularity to be useful in various contexts. A text validation method that is easy to use, accessible, and can perform fine-grained evidence attribution has become crucial. More importantly, building user trust in such a method requires presenting the rationale behind each prediction, as research shows this significantly influences people's belief in automated systems. Localizing and bringing users' attention to the specific problematic content is also paramount, instead of providing simple blanket labels. In this paper, we present ClaimVer, a human-centric framework tailored to meet users' informational and verification needs by generating rich annotations and thereby reducing cognitive load. Designed to deliver comprehensive evaluations of texts, it highlights each claim, verifies it against a trusted knowledge graph (KG), presents the evidence, and provides succinct, clear explanations for each claim prediction. Finally, our framework introduces an attribution score, enhancing applicability across a wide range of downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Resource-constrained Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01290v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Access to resources strongly constrains the decisions we make. While we might wish to offer every student a scholarship, or schedule every patient for follow-up meetings with a specialist, limited resources mean that this is not possible. When deploying machine learning systems, these resource constraints are simply enforced by varying the threshold of a classifier. However, these finite resource limitations are disregarded by most existing tools for fair machine learning, which do not allow the specification of resource limitations and do not remain fair when varying thresholds. This makes them ill-suited for real-world deployment. Our research introduces the concept of "resource-constrained fairness" and quantifies the cost of fairness within this framework. We demonstrate that the level of available resources significantly influences this cost, a factor overlooked in previous evaluations.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being deployed across various domains today. However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls. Our benchmark dataset and automated framework allow us to evaluate the performance of five LLMs, encompassing both black-box and open-source models. This work lays the foundation for future research into improving the efficiency of LLMs in interactive cybersecurity tasks and automated task planning. By providing a specialized dataset, our project offers an ideal platform for developing, testing, and refining LLM-based approaches to vulnerability detection and resolution. Evaluating LLMs on these challenges and comparing with human performance yields insights into their potential for AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to perform real-world threat management. We make our dataset open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/LLM_CTF_Database along with our playground automated framework https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/llm_ctf_automation.</description>

      <title>SHIELD: Evaluation and Defense Strategies for Copyright Compliance in LLM Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed machine learning but raised significant legal concerns due to their potential to produce text that infringes on copyrights, resulting in several high-profile lawsuits. The legal landscape is struggling to keep pace with these rapid advancements, with ongoing debates about whether generated text might plagiarize copyrighted materials. Current LLMs may infringe on copyrights or overly restrict non-copyrighted texts, leading to these challenges: (i) the need for a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess copyright compliance from multiple aspects; (ii) evaluating robustness against safeguard bypassing attacks; and (iii) developing effective defense targeted against the generation of copyrighted text. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a curated dataset to evaluate methods, test attack strategies, and propose lightweight, real-time defense to prevent the generation of copyrighted text, ensuring the safe and lawful use of LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that current LLMs frequently output copyrighted text, and that jailbreaking attacks can significantly increase the volume of copyrighted output. Our proposed defense mechanism significantly reduces the volume of copyrighted text generated by LLMs by effectively refusing malicious requests.

      <title>Large Model Strategic Thinking, Small Model Efficiency: Transferring Theory of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state-of-the-art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, highly-performing specialized algorithms by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we first present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine different social contexts with games of varying social dilemmas, record its answers, and use them for Q&amp;A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. The smaller model is therefore trained not just on the answers provided, but also on the motivations provided by the larger model, which should contain advice and guidelines to navigate both strategic dilemmas and social cues. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model consistently bridged the gap in performance between the smaller pre-trained version of the model and its larger relative and that its improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples, including on out-of-sample scenarios that include completely different game structures. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a 46% improvement measured as alignment towards the behavior of the larger model, with 100% representing indistinguishable behavior. When presented with out-of-sample social contexts and games, the fine-tuned model still displays remarkable levels of alignment, reaching an improvement of 18% and 28% respectively.</description>
