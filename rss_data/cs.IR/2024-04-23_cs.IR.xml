      <title>Planning Ahead in Generative Retrieval: Guiding Autoregressive Generation through Simultaneous Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces PAG-a novel optimization and decoding approach that guides autoregressive generation of document identifiers in generative retrieval models through simultaneous decoding. To this aim, PAG constructs a set-based and sequential identifier for each document. Motivated by the bag-of-words assumption in information retrieval, the set-based identifier is built on lexical tokens. The sequential identifier, on the other hand, is obtained via quantizing relevance-based representations of documents. Extensive experiments on MSMARCO and TREC Deep Learning Track data reveal that PAG outperforms the state-of-the-art generative retrieval model by a large margin (e.g., 15.6% MRR improvements on MS MARCO), while achieving 22x speed up in terms of query latency.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Quantization based Semantic Code for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the success of large language models, generative retrieval has emerged as a new retrieval technique for recommendation. It can be divided into two stages: the first stage involves constructing discrete Codes (i.e., codes), and the second stage involves decoding the code sequentially via the transformer architecture. Current methods often construct item semantic codes by reconstructing based quantization on item textual representation, but they fail to capture item discrepancy that is essential in modeling item relationships in recommendation sytems. In this paper, we propose to construct the code representation of items by simultaneously considering both item relationships and semantic information. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained language model to extract item's textual description and translate it into item's embedding. Then we propose to enhance the encoder-decoder based RQVAE model with contrastive objectives to learn item code. To be specific, we employ the embeddings generated by the decoder from the samples themselves as positive instances and those from other samples as negative instances. Thus we effectively enhance the item discrepancy across all items, better preserving the item neighbourhood. Finally, we train and test semantic code with with generative retrieval on a sequential recommendation model. Our experiments demonstrate that our method improves NDCG@5 with 43.76% on the MIND dataset and Recall@10 with 80.95% on the Office dataset compared to the previous baselines.</description>

      <title>From Matching to Generation: A Survey on Generative Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) systems are crucial tools for users to access information, widely applied in scenarios like search engines, question answering, and recommendation systems. Traditional IR methods, based on similarity matching to return ranked lists of documents, have been reliable means of information acquisition, dominating the IR field for years. With the advancement of pre-trained language models, generative information retrieval (GenIR) has emerged as a novel paradigm, gaining increasing attention in recent years. Currently, research in GenIR can be categorized into two aspects: generative document retrieval (GR) and reliable response generation. GR leverages the generative model's parameters for memorizing documents, enabling retrieval by directly generating relevant document identifiers without explicit indexing. Reliable response generation, on the other hand, employs language models to directly generate the information users seek, breaking the limitations of traditional IR in terms of document granularity and relevance matching, offering more flexibility, efficiency, and creativity, thus better meeting practical needs. This paper aims to systematically review the latest research progress in GenIR. We will summarize the advancements in GR regarding model training, document identifier, incremental learning, downstream tasks adaptation, multi-modal GR and generative recommendation, as well as progress in reliable response generation in aspects of internal knowledge memorization, external knowledge augmentation, generating response with citations and personal information assistant. We also review the evaluation, challenges and future prospects in GenIR systems. This review aims to offer a comprehensive reference for researchers in the GenIR field, encouraging further development in this area.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Causal Preference Learning for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems use users' historical interactions to learn their preferences and deliver personalized recommendations from a vast array of candidate items. Current recommender systems primarily rely on the assumption that the training and testing datasets have identical distributions, which may not hold true in reality. In fact, the distribution shift between training and testing datasets often occurs as a result of the evolution of user attributes, which degrades the performance of the conventional recommender systems because they fail in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, particularly in situations of data sparsity. This study delves deeply into the challenge of OOD generalization and proposes a novel model called Cross-Domain Causal Preference Learning for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (CDCOR), which involves employing a domain adversarial network to uncover users' domain-shared preferences and utilizing a causal structure learner to capture causal invariance to deal with the OOD problem. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we validate the remarkable performance of our model in handling diverse scenarios of data sparsity and out-of-distribution environments. Furthermore, our approach surpasses the benchmark models, showcasing outstanding capabilities in out-of-distribution generalization.</description>

      <title>A Reproducibility Study of PLAID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PLAID (Performance-optimized Late Interaction Driver) algorithm for ColBERTv2 uses clustered term representations to retrieve and progressively prune documents for final (exact) document scoring. In this paper, we reproduce and fill in missing gaps from the original work. By studying the parameters PLAID introduces, we find that its Pareto frontier is formed of a careful balance among its three parameters; deviations beyond the suggested settings can substantially increase latency without necessarily improving its effectiveness. We then compare PLAID with an important baseline missing from the paper: re-ranking a lexical system. We find that applying ColBERTv2 as a re-ranker atop an initial pool of BM25 results provides better efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs in low-latency settings. However, re-ranking cannot reach peak effectiveness at higher latency settings due to limitations in recall of lexical matching and provides a poor approximation of an exhaustive ColBERTv2 search. We find that recently proposed modifications to re-ranking that pull in the neighbors of top-scoring documents overcome this limitation, providing a Pareto frontier across all operational points for ColBERTv2 when evaluated using a well-annotated dataset. Curious about why re-ranking methods are highly competitive with PLAID, we analyze the token representation clusters PLAID uses for retrieval and find that most clusters are predominantly aligned with a single token and vice versa. Given the competitive trade-offs that re-ranking baselines exhibit, this work highlights the importance of carefully selecting pertinent baselines when evaluating the efficiency of retrieval engines.</description>

      <title>A Short Review for Ontology Learning from Text: Stride from Shallow Learning, Deep Learning to Large Language Models Trend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontologies provide formal representation of knowledge shared within Semantic Web applications and Ontology learning from text involves the construction of ontologies from a given corpus of text. In the past years, ontology learning has traversed through shallow learning and deep learning methodologies, each offering distinct advantages and limitations in the quest for knowledge extraction and representation. A new trend of these approaches is relying on large language models to enhance ontology learning. This paper gives a review in approaches and challenges of ontology learning. It analyzes the methodologies and limitations of shallow-learning-based and deep-learning-based techniques for ontology learning, and provides comprehensive knowledge for the frontier work of using large language models to enhance ontology learning. In addition, it proposes several noteworthy future directions for further exploration into the integration of large language models with ontology learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Anchor-aware Deep Metric Learning for Audio-visual Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric learning minimizes the gap between similar (positive) pairs of data points and increases the separation of dissimilar (negative) pairs, aiming at capturing the underlying data structure and enhancing the performance of tasks like audio-visual cross-modal retrieval (AV-CMR). Recent works employ sampling methods to select impactful data points from the embedding space during training. However, the model training fails to fully explore the space due to the scarcity of training data points, resulting in an incomplete representation of the overall positive and negative distributions. In this paper, we propose an innovative Anchor-aware Deep Metric Learning (AADML) method to address this challenge by uncovering the underlying correlations among existing data points, which enhances the quality of the shared embedding space. Specifically, our method establishes a correlation graph-based manifold structure by considering the dependencies between each sample as the anchor and its semantically similar samples. Through dynamic weighting of the correlations within this underlying manifold structure using an attention-driven mechanism, Anchor Awareness (AA) scores are obtained for each anchor. These AA scores serve as data proxies to compute relative distances in metric learning approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on two audio-visual benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AADML method, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of AA proxies with various metric learning methods, further highlighting the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Critical Infrastructure Facilities During Disasters Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical Infrastructure Facilities (CIFs), such as healthcare and transportation facilities, are vital for the functioning of a community, especially during large-scale emergencies. In this paper, we explore a potential application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to monitor the status of CIFs affected by natural disasters through information disseminated in social media networks. To this end, we analyze social media data from two disaster events in two different countries to identify reported impacts to CIFs as well as their impact severity and operational status. We employ state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to perform computational tasks including retrieval, classification, and inference, all in a zero-shot setting. Through extensive experimentation, we report the results of these tasks using standard evaluation metrics and reveal insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs. We note that although LLMs perform well in classification tasks, they encounter challenges with inference tasks, especially when the context/prompt is complex and lengthy. Additionally, we outline various potential directions for future exploration that can be beneficial during the initial adoption phase of LLMs for disaster response tasks.</description>

      <title>Tree of Reviews: A Tree-based Dynamic Iterative Retrieval Framework for Multi-hop Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-hop question answering is a knowledge-intensive complex problem. Large Language Models (LLMs) use their Chain of Thoughts (CoT) capability to reason complex problems step by step, and retrieval-augmentation can effectively alleviate factual errors caused by outdated and unknown knowledge in LLMs. Recent works have introduced retrieval-augmentation in the CoT reasoning to solve multi-hop question answering. However, these chain methods have the following problems: 1) Retrieved irrelevant paragraphs may mislead the reasoning; 2) An error in the chain structure may lead to a cascade of errors.
  In this paper, we propose a dynamic retrieval framework called Tree of Reviews (ToR), where the root node is the question, and the other nodes are paragraphs from retrieval, extending different reasoning paths from the root node to other nodes. Our framework dynamically decides to initiate a new search, reject, or accept based on the paragraphs on the reasoning paths. Compared to related work, we introduce a tree structure to handle each retrieved paragraph separately, alleviating the misleading effect of irrelevant paragraphs on the reasoning path; the diversity of reasoning path extension reduces the impact of a single reasoning error on the whole. We conducted experiments on three different multi-hop question answering datasets. The results show that compared to the baseline methods, ToR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both retrieval and response generation. In addition, we propose two tree-based search optimization strategies, pruning and effective expansion, to reduce time overhead and increase the diversity of path extension. We will release our code.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Advanced Text Anonymisation Methods: A Comparative Study on Novel and Traditional Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of data privacy, the ability to effectively anonymise text is paramount. With the proliferation of deep learning and, in particular, transformer architectures, there is a burgeoning interest in leveraging these advanced models for text anonymisation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study comparing the performance of transformer-based models and Large Language Models(LLM) against traditional architectures for text anonymisation. Utilising the CoNLL-2003 dataset, known for its robustness and diversity, we evaluate several models. Our results showcase the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, offering a clear perspective on the efficacy of modern versus traditional methods. Notably, while modern models exhibit advanced capabilities in capturing con textual nuances, certain traditional architectures still keep high performance. This work aims to guide researchers in selecting the most suitable model for their anonymisation needs, while also shedding light on potential paths for future advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Generation for Domain-specific Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Question answering (QA) has become an important application in the advanced development of large language models. General pre-trained large language models for question-answering are not trained to properly understand the knowledge or terminology for a specific domain, such as finance, healthcare, education, and customer service for a product. To better cater to domain-specific understanding, we build an in-house question-answering system for Adobe products. We propose a novel framework to compile a large question-answer database and develop the approach for retrieval-aware finetuning of a Large Language model. We showcase that fine-tuning the retriever leads to major improvements in the final generation. Our overall approach reduces hallucinations during generation while keeping in context the latest retrieval information for contextual grounding.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Dense Blocking for Entity Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blocking is a critical step in entity resolution, and the emergence of neural network-based representation models has led to the development of dense blocking as a promising approach for exploring deep semantics in blocking. However, previous advanced self-supervised dense blocking approaches require domain-specific training on the target domain, which limits the benefits and rapid adaptation of these methods. To address this issue, we propose UBlocker, a dense blocker that is pre-trained on a domain-independent, easily-obtainable tabular corpus using self-supervised contrastive learning. By conducting domain-independent pre-training, UBlocker can be adapted to various downstream blocking scenarios without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. To evaluate the universality of our entity blocker, we also construct a new benchmark covering a wide range of blocking tasks from multiple domains and scenarios. Our experiments show that the proposed UBlocker, without any domain-specific learning, significantly outperforms previous self- and unsupervised dense blocking methods and is comparable and complementary to the state-of-the-art sparse blocking methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sample Dynamic Time Warping for Few-Shot Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-sample keyword spotting, each keyword class is represented by multiple spoken instances, called samples. A na\"ive approach to detect keywords in a target sequence consists of querying all samples of all classes using sub-sequence dynamic time warping. However, the resulting processing time increases linearly with respect to the number of samples belonging to each class. Alternatively, only a single Fr\'echet mean can be queried for each class, resulting in reduced processing time but usually also in worse detection performance as the variability of the query samples is not captured sufficiently well. In this work, multi-sample dynamic time warping is proposed to compute class-specific cost-tensors that include the variability of all query samples. To significantly reduce the computational complexity during inference, these cost tensors are converted to cost matrices before applying dynamic time warping. In experimental evaluations for few-shot keyword spotting, it is shown that this method yields a very similar performance as using all individual query samples as templates while having a runtime that is only slightly slower than when using Fr\'echet means.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Recommender Systems: A Survey of Poisoning Attacks and Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems have become an integral part of online services to help users locate specific information in a sea of data. However, existing studies show that some recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, particularly those that involve learning schemes. A poisoning attack is where an adversary injects carefully crafted data into the process of training a model, with the goal of manipulating the system's final recommendations. Based on recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such attacks have gained importance recently. While numerous countermeasures to poisoning attacks have been developed, they have not yet been systematically linked to the properties of the attacks. Consequently, assessing the respective risks and potential success of mitigation strategies is difficult, if not impossible. This survey aims to fill this gap by primarily focusing on poisoning attacks and their countermeasures. This is in contrast to prior surveys that mainly focus on attacks and their detection methods. Through an exhaustive literature review, we provide a novel taxonomy for poisoning attacks, formalise its dimensions, and accordingly organise 30+ attacks described in the literature. Further, we review 40+ countermeasures to detect and/or prevent poisoning attacks, evaluating their effectiveness against specific types of attacks. This comprehensive survey should serve as a point of reference for protecting recommender systems against poisoning attacks. The article concludes with a discussion on open issues in the field and impactful directions for future research. A rich repository of resources associated with poisoning attacks is available at https://github.com/tamlhp/awesome-recsys-poisoning.</description>

      <title>Aligning LLM Agents by Learning Latent Preference from User Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interactive learning of language agents based on user edits made to the agent's output. In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness. The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time. We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data and using it to define a prompt policy that drives future response generation. This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks. Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference. However, user preference can be complex and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages a large language model (LLM) to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits. In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation. We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, for evaluation using a GPT-4 simulated user. We compare with algorithms that directly retrieve user edits but do not learn descriptive preference, and algorithms that learn context-agnostic preference. On both tasks, CIPHER achieves the lowest edit distance cost and learns preferences that show significant similarity to the ground truth preferences</description>

      <title>A Sensor-Based Simulation Method for Spatiotemporal Event Detection</title>

Abstract: Human movements in urban areas are essential to understand human-environment interactions. However, activities and associated movements are full of uncertainties due to the complexity of a city. In this paper, we propose a novel sensor-based approach for spatiotemporal event detection based on the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method. Specifically, we first identify the key locations, defined as 'sensors' , which have the strongest correlation with the whole dataset. We then simulate a regular uneventful scenario with the observation data points from those key lo-cations. By comparing the simulated and observation scenarios, events are extracted both spatially and temporally. We apply this method in New York City with taxi trip record data. Results show that this method is effective in detecting when and where events occur.</description>

      <title>Where to Move Next: Zero-shot Generalization of LLMs for Next POI Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation provides valuable suggestions for users to explore their surrounding environment. Existing studies rely on building recommendation models from large-scale users' check-in data, which is task-specific and needs extensive computational resources. Recently, the pretrained large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in various NLP tasks and have also been investigated for recommendation scenarios. However, the generalization abilities of LLMs still are unexplored to address the next POI recommendations, where users' geographical movement patterns should be extracted. Although there are studies that leverage LLMs for next-item recommendations, they fail to consider the geographical influence and sequential transitions. Hence, they cannot effectively solve the next POI recommendation task. To this end, we design novel prompting strategies and conduct empirical studies to assess the capability of LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, for predicting a user's next check-in. Specifically, we consider several essential factors in human movement behaviors, including user geographical preference, spatial distance, and sequential transitions, and formulate the recommendation task as a ranking problem. Through extensive experiments on two widely used real-world datasets, we derive several key findings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs have promising zero-shot recommendation abilities and can provide accurate and reasonable predictions. We also reveal that LLMs cannot accurately comprehend geographical context information and are sensitive to the order of presentation of candidate POIs, which shows the limitations of LLMs and necessitates further research on robust human mobility reasoning mechanisms.</description>

      <title>DBCopilot: Scaling Natural Language Querying to Massive Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL simplifies database interactions by enabling non-experts to convert their natural language (NL) questions into Structured Query Language (SQL) queries. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved the zero-shot text-to-SQL paradigm, existing methods face scalability challenges when dealing with massive, dynamically changing databases. This paper introduces DBCopilot, a framework that addresses these challenges by employing a compact and flexible copilot model for routing across massive databases. Specifically, DBCopilot decouples the text-to-SQL process into schema routing and SQL generation, leveraging a lightweight sequence-to-sequence neural network-based router to formulate database connections and navigate natural language questions through databases and tables. The routed schemas and questions are then fed into LLMs for efficient SQL generation. Furthermore, DBCopilot also introduced a reverse schema-to-question generation paradigm, which can learn and adapt the router over massive databases automatically without requiring manual intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that DBCopilot is a scalable and effective solution for real-world text-to-SQL tasks, providing a significant advancement in handling large-scale schemas.</description>

      <title>Improving Video Corpus Moment Retrieval with Partial Relevance Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR) is a new video retrieval task aimed at retrieving a relevant moment from a large corpus of untrimmed videos using a text query. The relevance between the video and query is partial, mainly evident in two aspects:~(1)~Scope: The untrimmed video contains many frames, but not all are relevant to the query. Strong relevance is typically observed only within the relevant moment.~(2)~Modality: The relevance of the query varies with different modalities. Action descriptions align more with visual elements, while character conversations are more related to textual information.Existing methods often treat all video contents equally, leading to sub-optimal moment retrieval. We argue that effectively capturing the partial relevance between the query and video is essential for the VCMR task. To this end, we propose a Partial Relevance Enhanced Model~(PREM) to improve VCMR. VCMR involves two sub-tasks: video retrieval and moment localization. To align with their distinct objectives, we implement specialized partial relevance enhancement strategies. For video retrieval, we introduce a multi-modal collaborative video retriever, generating different query representations for the two modalities by modality-specific pooling, ensuring a more effective match. For moment localization, we propose the focus-then-fuse moment localizer, utilizing modality-specific gates to capture essential content. We also introduce relevant content-enhanced training methods for both retriever and localizer to enhance the ability of model to capture relevant content. Experimental results on TVR and DiDeMo datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines, achieving a new state-of-the-art of VCMR. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/hdy007007/PREM}.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Data Processing Framework for Pretraining Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of the foundation models heavily relies on large-scale, diverse, and high-quality pretraining data. In order to improve data quality, researchers and practitioners often have to manually curate datasets from difference sources and develop dedicated data cleansing pipeline for each data repository. Lacking a unified data processing framework, this process is repetitive and cumbersome. To mitigate this issue, we propose a data processing framework that integrates a Processing Module which consists of a series of operators at different granularity levels, and an Analyzing Module which supports probing and evaluation of the refined data. The proposed framework is easy to use and highly flexible. In this demo paper, we first introduce how to use this framework with some example use cases and then demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the data quality with an automated evaluation with ChatGPT and an end-to-end evaluation in pretraining the GPT-2 model. The code and demonstration videos are accessible on GitHub.</description>
