      <title>Vanishing Moments of Wavelets on p-adic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study on the vanishing moments of wavelets on p-adic fields is carried out in this paper. The p-vanishing moments and discrete p-vanishing moments are defined on a p-adic field and the relation between them is investigated. The p-vanishing moments of Haar-type and non-Haar type wavelet functions are computed. Also, the connection between p-vanishing moment of non-Haar type wavelet functions and the approximation order of the indicator function of the compact open subgroup B0 (0) of Qp are established. A characterization of the p-vanishing moments of nonorthogonal wavelets is done.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal bases of exponential functions for infinite convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ denot the infinite convolution generated by $\{(N_k,B_k)\}_{k=1}^\infty$ given by $$ \mu =\delta_{{N_1}^{-1}B_1}\ast\delta_{(N_1N_2)^{-1}B_2}\ast\dots\ast\delta_{(N_1N_2\cdots N_k)^{-1}B_k} *\cdots. $$ where $B_k$ is a complete residue system for each integer $k&gt;0$. We write $$ \nu_{&gt;k}=\delta_{N_{k+1}^{-1} B_{k+1}} * \delta_{(N_{k+1} N_{k+2})^{-1} B_{k+2}} * \cdots. $$ Since the elements in $B_k$ may have very large absolute values, the infinite convolution may not be compactly supported. In this paper, we study the necessary and sufficient conditions for such infinite convolutions being a spectral measure.
  Generally, for such infinite convolutions, the necessary conditions for spectrality mainly depend on the properties of the polynomials generated by the complete residue systems. The main result shows that if every $B_k$ satisfies uniform discrete zero condition, and $\{\nu_{&gt;k}\}_{k=1}^\infty$ is {\it tight}, then $\# B_k | N_k$ for all integers $k\geq 2$. For some special complete residue systems $\{B_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for $\mu$ being a spectral measure.</description>

      <title>Two-weighted estimates for some sublinear operators on generalized weighted Morrey Spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the boundedness of sublinear operators generated by fractional integrals as well as sublinear operators generated by Calder\`on-Zygmund operators on generalized weighted Morrey spaces and generalized weighted mixed-Morrey spaces. In particular we are interested in the strong-type estimate for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and the weak estimate for $p=1$. Under some assumptions, we prove that the operators and their commutator with a BMO function are bounded on those function spaces with different weights. The results then imply the boundedness of fractional integrals with Gaussian kernel bounds as well as with rough kernels, fractional maximal integrals with rough kernels, and sublinear operators with rough kernels generated by Calder\`on-Zygmund operators. Using the results, we obtain some regularity properties of the solution of some partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a precise general relation between the entropy of a compact operator and its eigenvalues. It is then shown how this result along with the underlying philosophy can be applied to improve substantially on the best known characterizations of the entropy of the Landau-Pollak-Slepian operator and the metric entropy of unit balls in Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Takagi-van der Waerden functions in metric spaces and its Lipschitz derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Takagi-van der Waerden function with parameters $a{&gt;}b{&gt;}0$ by setting $f_{a,b}(x)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty b^n d\big(x,S_n\big)$, where $S_n$ is a maximal $\frac1{a^n}$-separated set in a metric space $X$ without isolated points. So, if $X=\mathbb R$ and $S_n=\frac1{a^n}\mathbb Z$ then $f_{2,1}$ is the Takagi function and $f_{10,1}$ is the van der Waerden function which are the famous examples of nowhere differentiable functions. Then we prove that the big Lipschitz derivative $\mathrm{Lip} f_{a,b}=+\infty$ if $a&gt;b&gt;2$. Moreover, if $X$ is a normed space then the little Lipschitz derivative $\mathrm{lip} f_{a,b}=+\infty$ for large enough $a&gt;b$. Thus, we prove that for any open set $A$ in a metric (normed) space $X$ there exists a continuous function $f$ such that $\mathrm{Lip} f(x)=+\infty$ (and $\mathrm{lip} f(x)=+\infty$) exactly on $A$.</description>

      <title>Banach algebras associated to twisted \'{e}tale groupoids: simplicity and pure infiniteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define reduced and essential Banach algebras associated to a twisted \'{e}tale (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ and extend some fundamental results from $C^*$-algebras to this context. For instance, we prove that for topologically free and minimal groupoids every essential Banach algebra is simple, and we give conditions under which reduced algebras are essential (for example Hausdorffness of $\mathcal{G}$ is sufficient). This in particular solves the simplicity problem posed recently by Gardella-Lupini for $L^p$-operator algebras associated to $\mathcal{G}$. In addition, using either the $n$-filling or locally contracting condition we give pure infiniteness criteria for essential simple Banach algebras associated to $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$. This extends the corresponding $C^*$-algebraic results that were previously known to hold in the untwisted Hausdorff case. The results work nicely, and allow for characterisation of the generalized intersection property, in the realm of $L^P$-operator algebras where $P \subseteq [1,\infty]$ is a non-empty set of parameters. Such algebras cover in particular $L^p$-operator algebras, for $p\in [1,\infty]$, and their Banach $*$-algebra versions.
  We apply our results to Banach algebra crossed products by twisted partial group actions, Roe-type Banach algebras with coefficients in finite-rank operators on a Banach space, twisted tight $L^P$-operator algebras of inverse semigroups, graph $L^P$-operator algebras, and algebras associated to self-similar group actions on graphs. We also interpret our results in terms of twisted inverse semigroup actions and their crossed products.</description>

      <title>Open problems and perspectives on solving Friedrichs systems by Krylov approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up, at the abstract Hilbert space setting, the general question on when an inverse linear problem induced by an operator of Friedrichs type admits solutions belonging to (the closure of) the Krylov subspace associated to such operator. Such Krylov solvability of abstract Friedrichs systems allows to predict when, for concrete differential inverse problems, truncation algorithms can or cannot reproduce the exact solutions in terms of approximants from the Krylov subspace.</description>

      <title>Operator Theory on the Pentablock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pentablock, denoted as $\cP,$ is defined as follows: $$\cP= \left\{ (a_{21}, {\rm tr}(A), {\rm det}(A)) : A = [a_{ij}]_{2 \times 2} \text{ with } \|A\|&lt;1 \right\}.$$ It originated from the work of Agler--Lykova--Young in connection with a particular case of the $\mu$-synthesis problem. It is a non-convex, polynomially convex, $\mathbb{C}$-convex, star-like about the origin, and inhomogeneous domain.
  This paper deals with operator theory on the pentablock. We study pentablock unitaries and isometries, providing an algebraic characterization of pentablock isometries. En route, we provide the Wold-type decomposition for pentablock isometries, which consists of three parts: the unitary part, the pure part, and a new component. We define this novel component as the quasi-pentablock unitary and provide a functional model for it. Additionally, a model for a class of pure pentablock isometries has been found, along with some examples. Furthermore, a representation resembling the Beurling-Lax-Halmos paradigm has been presented for the invariant subspaces of pentablock pure isometries.</description>

      <title>Topological Classification of Insulators: II. Quasi-Two-Dimensional Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an alternative characterization of two-dimensional locality (necessary e.g. to define the Hall conductivity of a Fermi projection) using the spectral projections of the Laughlin flux operator. Using this abstract characterization, we define generalizations of this locality, which we term quasi-2D. We go on to calculate the path-connected components of spaces of unitaries or orthogonal projections which are quasi-2D-local and find a starkly different behavior compared with the actual 2D column of the Kitaev table, exhibiting e.g., in the unitary chiral case, infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}$-valued indices.</description>

      <title>Singular extension of critical Sobolev mappings with values into complete Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triggered by a recent criterion, due to A.~Petrunin [17], to check if a complete, non-compact, Riemannian manifold admits an isometric embedding into a Euclidean space with positive reach, we extend to manifolds with such property the singular extension results of B.~Bulanyi and J.~Van~Schaftingen [5] for maps in the critical, nonlinear Sobolev space $W^{m/(m+1),m+1}\left(X^m,\mathcal{N}\right)$, where $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, $\mathcal{N}$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, and $X^m$ is either the sphere $\mathbb{S}^m = \partial \mathbb{B}^{m+1}_+$, the plane $\mathbb{R}^m$, or again $\mathbb{S}^m$ but seen as the boundary sphere of the Poincar\'{e} ball model of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{m+1}$. As in [5], we obtain that the extended maps satisfy an exponential weak-type Sobolev-Marcinkiewicz estimate. Finally, we provide some illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>The wave function of stabilizer states and the Wehrl conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on quantum systems represented by a Hilbert space $L^2(A)$, where $A$ is a locally compact Abelian group that contains a compact open subgroup. We examine two interconnected issues related to Weyl-Heisenberg operators. First, we provide a complete and elegant solution to the problem of describing the stabilizer states in terms of their wave functions, an issue that arises in quantum information theory. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the stabilizer states are precisely the minimizers of the Wehrl entropy functional, thereby resolving the analog of the Wehrl conjecture for any such group. Additionally, we construct a moduli space for the set of stabilizer states, that is, a parameterization of this set, that endows it with a natural algebraic structure, and we derive a formula for the number of stabilizer states when $A$ is finite. Notably, these results are novel even for finite Abelian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras. These are operator-valued versions of a class of second quantization algebras that includes $q$-Gaussian and $q$-Araki-Woods algebras and also generalize Shlyakhtenko's von Neumann algebras generated by operator-valued semicircular variables. We develop a disintegration theory that reduces the isomorphism type of operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras over type I factors to the scalar-valued case. Moreover, these algebras come with a natural weight, and we characterize its modular theory. We also give sufficient criteria that guarantee that factoriality of these algebras.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the cyclicity of the shift operator $S$ acting on a Banach space $\X$ of analytic functions on the open unit disc $\D$. We develop a general framework where a method based on a corona theorem can be used to show that if $f,g\in\X$ satisfy $|g(z)|\leq |f(z)|$, for every $z\in\D$, and if $g$ is cyclic, then $f$ is cyclic. We also give sufficient conditions for cyclicity in this context. This enable us to recapture some recent results obtained in de Branges-Rovnayk spaces, in  Besov--Dirichlet spaces and in weighted Dirichlet type spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores weighted $(L^p, L^q)$ inequalities for the Fourier transform in rank one Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type. We establish both necessary and sufficient conditions for these inequalities to hold. To prove the weighted Fourier inequalities, we apply restriction theorems on symmetric spaces and utilize Calder{\'o}n's estimate for sublinear operators. While establishing the necessary conditions, we demonstrate that Harish-Chandra's elementary spherical functions play a crucial role in this setting. Furthermore, we apply our findings to derive Fourier inequalities with polynomial and exponential weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a positive operator between $L^p$-spaces is given by integration against a kernel function if and only if the image of each positive function has a lower semi-continuous representative with respect to a suitable topology. This is a consequence of a new characterization of kernel operators on general Banach lattices as those operators whose range can be represented over a fixed countable set of positive vectors. Similar results are shown to hold for operators that merely dominate a non-trivial kernel operator.</description>

      <title>Stability criteria for positive semigroups on ordered Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider generators of positive $C_0$-semigroups and, more generally, resolvent positive operators $A$ on ordered Banach spaces and seek for conditions ensuring the negativity of their spectral bound $s(A)$. Our main result characterizes $s(A) &lt; 0$ in terms of so-called \emph{small-gain conditions} that describe the behaviour of $Ax$ for positive vectors $x$. This is new even in case that the underlying space is an $L^p$-space or a space of continuous functions.
  We also demonstrate that it becomes considerably easier to characterize the property $s(A) &lt; 0$ if the cone of the underlying Banach space has non-empty interior or if the essential spectral bound of $A$ is negative. To treat the latter case, we discuss a counterpart of a Krein-Rutman theorem for resolvent positive operators. When $A$ is the generator of a positive $C_0$-semigroup, our results can be interpreted as stability results for the semigroup, and as such, they complement similar results recently proved for the discrete-time case.
  In the same vein, we prove a Collatz--Wielandt type formula and a logarithmic formula for the spectral bound of generators of positive semigroups.</description>

Abstract: We study the spaceability of the set of recurrent vectors $\text{Rec}(T)$ for an operator $T:X\longrightarrow X$ on a Banach space $X$. In particular: we find sufficient conditions for a quasi-rigid operator to have a recurrent subspace; when $X$ is a complex Banach space we show that having a recurrent subspace is equivalent to the fact that the essential spectrum of the operator intersects the closed unit disc; and we extend the previous result to the real case. As a consequence we obtain that: a weakly-mixing operator on a real or complex separable Banach space has a hypercyclic subspace if and only if it has a recurrent subspace. The results exposed exhibit a symmetry between the hypercyclic and recurrence spaceability theories showing that, at least for the spaceable property, hypercyclicity and recurrence can be treated as equals.</description>

      <title>On the $m\mathrm{th}$-Order Weighted Projection Body Operator and Related Inequalities</title>

Abstract: For a convex body $K$ in $\mathbb R^n$, the inequalities of Rogers-Shephard and Zhang, written succinctly, are $$\text{vol}_n(DK)\leq \binom{2n}{n} \text{vol}_n(K) \leq \text{vol}_n(n\text{vol}_n(K)\Pi^\circ K).$$ Here, $DK=\{x\in\mathbb R^n:K\cap(K+x)\neq \emptyset\}$ is the difference body of $K$, and $\Pi^\circ K$ is the polar projection body of $K$. There is equality in either if, and only if, $K$ is a $n$-dimensional simplex. In fact, there exists a collection of convex bodies, the so-called radial mean bodies $R_p K$ introduced by Gardner and Zhang, which continuously interpolates between $DK$ and $\Pi^\circ K$. For $m\in\mathbb N$, Schneider defined the $m$th-order difference body of $K$ as $$D^m(K)=\{(x_1,\dots,x_m)\in\mathbb R^{nm}:K\cap_{i=1}^m(K+x_i)\neq \emptyset\}\subset \mathbb R^{nm}$$ and proved the $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. In a prequel to this work, the authors, working with Haddad, extended this $m$th-order concept to the radial mean bodies and the polar projection body, establishing the associated Zhang's projection inequality.
  In this work, we introduce weighted versions of the above-mentioned operators by replacing the Lebesgue measure with measures that have density. The weighted version of these operators in the $m=1$ case was first done by Roysdon (difference body), Langharst-Roysdon-Zvavitch (polar projection body) and Langharst-Putterman (radial mean bodies). This work can be seen as a sequel to all those works, extending them to $m$th-order. In the last section, we extend many of these ideas to the setting of generalized volume, first introduced by Gardner-Hug-Weil-Xing-Ye.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of eventually positive semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positive $C_0$-semigroups that occur in concrete applications are, more often than not, irreducible. Therefore a deep and extensive theory of irreducibility has been developed that includes characterizations, perturbation analysis, and spectral results. Many arguments from this theory, however, break down if the semigroup is only eventually positive - a property that has recently been shown to occur in numerous concrete evolution equations.
  In this article, we develop new tools that also work for the eventually positive case. The lack of positivity for small times makes it necessary to consider ideals that might only be invariant for large times. In contrast to their classical counterparts - the invariant ideals - such eventually invariant ideals require more involved methods from the theory of operator ranges.
  Using those methods we are able to characterize (an appropriate adaptation of) irreducibility by means of linear functionals, derive a perturbation result, prove a number of spectral theorems, and analyze the interaction of irreducibility with analyticity, all in the eventually positive case. By a number of examples, we illustrate what kind of behaviour can and cannot be expected in this setting.</description>

      <title>On the relations between Auerbach or almost Auberbach Markushevich systems and Schauder bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that the summability of the series $\sum\varepsilon_n$ is the necessary and sufficient criterion ensuring that every $(1+\varepsilon_n)$ Markushevich basis in a separable Hilbert space is a Riesz basis. Further we show that if $n\varepsilon_n\to \infty$, then in $\ell_2$ there exists a $(1+\varepsilon_n)$ Markushevich basis that under any permutation is non-equivalent to a Schauder basis. We extend this result to any separable Banach space. Finally we provide examples of Auerbach bases in 1-symmetric separable Banach spaces whose no permutations are equivalent to any Schauder basis or (depending on the space) any unconditional Schauder basis.</description>

      <title>Maximal noncompactness of limiting Sobolev embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new method suitable for establishing lower bounds on the ball measure of noncompactness of operators acting between considerably general quasinormed function spaces. This new method removes some of the restrictions oft-presented in the previous work. Most notably, the target function space need not be disjointly superadditive nor equipped with a norm. Instead, a property that is far more often at our disposal is exploited, namely the absolute continuity of the target quasinorm.
  We use this new method to prove that limiting Sobolev embeddings into spaces of Brezis--Wainger type are so-called maximally noncompact, i.e., their ball measure of noncompactness is the worst possible.</description>

      <title>The Douglas question on the Bergman and Fock spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a positive Borel measure and $T_\mu$ be the bounded Toeplitz operator induced by $\mu$ on the Bergman or Fock space. In this paper, we mainly investigate the invertibility of the Toeplitz operator $T_\mu$ and the Douglas question on the Bergman and Fock spaces. In the Bergman-space setting, we obtain several necessary and sufficient conditions for the invertibility of $T_\mu$ in terms of the Berezin transform of $\mu$ and the reverse Carleson condition in two classical cases: (1) $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the normalized area measure on the open unit disk $\mathbb D$; (2) $\mu$ is the pull-back measure of the normalized area measure under an analytic self-mapping of $\mathbb D$. Nonetheless, we show that there exists a Carleson measure for the Bergman space such that its Berezin transform is bounded below but the corresponding Toeplitz operator is not invertible. On the Fock space, we show that $T_\mu$ is invertible if and only if $\mu$ is a reverse Carleson measure, but the invertibility of $T_\mu$ is not completely determined by the invertibility of the Berezin transform of $\mu$. These suggest that the answers to the Douglas question for Toeplitz operators induced by positive measures on the Bergman and Fock spaces are both negative in general cases.</description>

      <title>Compact bilinear operators and paraproducts revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new proof of the compactness of bilinear paraproducts with CMO symbols. By drawing an analogy to compact linear operators, we first explore further properties of compact bilinear operators on Banach spaces and present examples. We then prove compactness of bilinear paraproducts with CMO symbols by combining one of the properties of compact bilinear operators thus obtained with vanishing Carleson measure estimates and interpolation of bilinear compactness.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Paszkiewicz's conjecture about a product of positive contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Paszkiewicz conjecture about a product of positive contractions asserts that given a decreasing sequence $T_1\ge T_2\ge \dots$ of positive contractions on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, the product $S_n=T_n\dots T_1$ converges strongly. Recently, the first named author verified the conjecture for certain classes of sequences. In this paper, we prove the Paszkiewicz conjecture in full generality. Moreover, we show that in some cases, a generalized version of the Paszkiewicz conjecture also holds.</description>

      <title>The complete Pick property for pairs of kernels and Shimorin's factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{H}_k, \mathcal{H}_{\ell})$ be a pair of Hilbert function spaces with kernels $k, \ell$. In a 2005 paper, Shimorin showed that a certain factorization condition on $(k, \ell)$ yields a commutant lifting theorem for multipliers $\mathcal{H}_k\to\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$, thus unifying and extending previous results due to Ball-Trent-Vinnikov and Volberg-Treil. Our main result is a strong converse to Shimorin's theorem for a large class of holomorphic pairs $(k, \ell),$ which leads to a full characterization of the complete Pick property for such pairs. We also present a short alternative proof of sufficiency for Shimorin's condition. Finally, we establish necessary conditions for abstract pairs $(k, \ell)$ to satisfy the complete Pick property, further generalizing Shimorin's work with proofs that are new even in the single-kernel case $k=\ell.$ Our approach differs from Shimorin's in that we do not work with the Nevanlinna-Pick problem directly; instead, we are able to extract vital information for $(k, \ell)$ through Carath\'eodory-Fej\'er interpolation.</description>

      <title>A Birkhoff-Kellogg type theorem for discontinuous operators with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By means of fixed point index theory for multi-valued maps, we provide an analogue of the classical Birkhoff--Kellogg Theorem in the context of discontinuous operators acting on affine wedges in Banach spaces. Our theory is fairly general and can be applied, for example, to eigenvalues and parameter problems for ordinary differential equations with discontinuities. We illustrate in details this fact for a class of second order boundary value problem with deviated arguments and discontinuous terms. In a specific example, we explicitly compute the terms that occur in our theory.</description>

      <title>Layer potential operators for transmission problems on extension domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the well-posedness of transmission problems on classes of two-sided Sobolev extension domains to give variational definitions for (boundary) layer potential operators and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators. These classes of domains contain Lipschitz domains, and also domains with fractal boundaries. Although our variational formulation does not involve any measures on the boundary, we recover the classical results in smooth domains by considering the surface measure on the boundary. We discuss properties of these operators and generalize basic results in imaging beyond the Lipschitz case.</description>
