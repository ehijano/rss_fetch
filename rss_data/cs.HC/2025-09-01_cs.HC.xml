      <title>Can LLMs Generate Behaviors for Embodied Virtual Agents Based on Personality Traits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a framework that employs personality prompting with Large Language Models to generate verbal and nonverbal behaviors for virtual agents based on personality traits. Focusing on extraversion, we evaluated the system in two scenarios: negotiation and ice breaking, using both introverted and extroverted agents. In Experiment 1, we conducted agent to agent simulations and performed linguistic analysis and personality classification to assess whether the LLM generated language reflected the intended traits and whether the corresponding nonverbal behaviors varied by personality. In Experiment 2, we carried out a user study to evaluate whether these personality aligned behaviors were consistent with their intended traits and perceptible to human observers. Our results show that LLMs can generate verbal and nonverbal behaviors that align with personality traits, and that users are able to recognize these traits through the agents' behaviors. This work underscores the potential of LLMs in shaping personality aligned virtual agents.</description>

      <title>Designing Smarter Conversational Agents for Kids: Lessons from Cognitive Work and Means-Ends Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and how structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a seven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents, teachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map children's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others, functional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform conversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery, Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support. In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges, comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach. Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and caregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application with Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows, and an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective, scaffolded learning.</description>

      <title>Design and evaluation of a serious game in virtual reality to increase empathy towards students with phonological dyslexia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder estimated to strike approximately 5 to 10 per cent of the population. In particular, phonological dyslexia causes problems in connecting the sounds of words with their written forms. Consequently, affected individuals may encounter issues such as slow reading speed, inaccurate reading, and difficulty decoding unfamiliar words. To address these complexities, the use of compensatory tools and strategies is essential to ensure equitable opportunities for dyslexic students. However, the general underestimation of the issue and lack of awareness regarding the significance of support methodologies pose significant obstacles. One of the ways to enhance consciousness towards a certain issue is by stimulating empathy with whom is affected by it. In light of this, this study introduces a serious game in virtual reality, targeted at educators, students, and, in general, at the non-dyslexic community. The game seeks to enhance understanding of the challenges that individuals with dyslexia experience daily, highlighting the relevance of supportive measures. This approach encourages players to empathize with the struggles of dyslexic individuals and to learn firsthand the importance of supportive methodologies. The final version of the experience was tested by 101 participants and evaluated through a specific collection of questionnaires validated in the literature. The results show that using the proposed virtual reality tool to promote empathy for individuals with phonological dyslexia is highly effective, leading to an average 20 per cent increase in participants' empathy after playing the game.</description>

      <title>Conflict in Community-Based Design: A Case Study of a Relationship Breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community-based design efforts rightly seek to reduce the power differences between researchers and community participants by aligning with community values and furthering their priorities. However, what should designers do when key community members' practices seem to enact an oppressive and harmful structure? We reflect on our two-year-long engagement with a non-profit organization in southern India that supports women subjected to domestic abuse or facing mental health crises. We highlight the organizational gaps in knowledge management and transfer, which became an avenue for our design intervention. During design, we encountered practices that upheld caste hierarchies. These practices were expected to be incorporated into our technology. Anticipating harms to indirect stakeholders, we resisted this incorporation. It led to a breakdown in our relationship with the partner organization. Reflecting on this experience, we outline pluralistic pathways that community-based designers might inhabit when navigating value conflicts. These include making space for reflection before and during engagements, strategically repositioning through role reframing or appreciative inquiry, and exiting the engagement if necessary.</description>

      <title>Morae: Proactively Pausing UI Agents for User Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots, and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences, as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.</description>

      <title>Developer Insights into Designing AI-Based Computer Perception Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer perception (CP) technologies use mobile sensors to collect behavioral and physiological data for clinical decision-making. These tools can reshape how clinical knowledge is generated and interpreted. However, effective integration of these tools into clinical workflows depends on how developers balance clinical utility with user acceptability and trustworthiness. Our study presents findings from 20 in-depth interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools. Interviews were transcribed and inductive, thematic analysis was performed to identify 4 key design priorities: 1) to account for context and ensure explainability for both patients and clinicians; 2) align tools with existing clinical workflows; 3) appropriately customize to relevant stakeholders for usability and acceptability; and 4) push the boundaries of innovation while aligning with established paradigms. Our findings highlight that developers view themselves as not merely technical architects but also ethical stewards, designing tools that are both acceptable by users and epistemically responsible (prioritizing objectivity and pushing clinical knowledge forward). We offer the following suggestions to help achieve this balance: documenting how design choices around customization are made, defining limits for customization choices, transparently conveying information about outputs, and investing in user training. Achieving these goals will require interdisciplinary collaboration between developers, clinicians, and ethicists.</description>

      <title>MicroLabVR: Interactive 3D Visualization of Simulated Spatiotemporal Microbiome Data in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbiomes are a vital part of the human body, engaging in tasks like food digestion and immune defense. Their structure and function must be understood in order to promote host health and facilitate swift recovery during disease. Due to the difficulties in experimentally studying these systems in situ, more research is being conducted in the field of mathematical modeling. Visualizing spatiotemporal data is challenging, and current tools that simulate microbial communities' spatial and temporal development often only provide limited functionalities, often requiring expert knowledge to generate useful results. To overcome these limitations, we provide a user-friendly tool to interactively explore spatiotemporal simulation data, called MicroLabVR, which transfers spatial data into virtual reality (VR) while following guidelines to enhance user experience (UX). With MicroLabVR, users can import CSV datasets containing population growth, substance concentration development, and metabolic flux distribution data. The implemented visualization methods allow users to evaluate the dataset in a VR environment interactively. MicroLabVR aims to improve data analysis for the user by allowing the exploration of microbiome data in their spatial context.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot KWS for Children's Speech using Layer-Wise Features from SSL Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec. Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing, demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech. Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best, delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions. To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the distinct characteristics of child speakers.</description>

      <title>Personality Matters: User Traits Predict LLM Preferences in Multi-Turn Collaborative Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32 participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types, evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval, and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences. Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably, aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations miss.</description>

      <title>AI Chatbots as Professional Service Agents: Developing a Professional Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of large language model (LLM) applications, there is an emerging shift in the role of LLM-based AI chatbots from serving merely as general inquiry tools to acting as professional service agents. However, current studies often overlook a critical aspect of professional service agents: the act of communicating in a manner consistent with their professional identities. This is of particular importance in the healthcare sector, where effective communication with patients is essential for achieving professional goals, such as promoting patient well-being by encouraging healthy behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose LAPI (LLM-based Agent with a Professional Identity), a novel framework for designing professional service agent tailored for medical question-and-answer (Q\&amp;A) services, ensuring alignment with a specific professional identity. Our method includes a theory-guided task planning process that decomposes complex professional tasks into manageable subtasks aligned with professional objectives and a pragmatic entropy method designed to generate professional and ethical responses with low uncertainty. Experiments on various LLMs show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, including few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, across key metrics such as fluency, naturalness, empathy, patient-centricity, and ROUGE-L scores. Additionally, the ablation study underscores the contribution of each component to the overall effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Togedule: Scheduling Meetings with Large Language Models and Adaptive Representations of Group Availability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01000v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scheduling is a perennial-and often challenging-problem for many groups. Existing tools are mostly static, showing an identical set of choices to everyone, regardless of the current status of attendees' inputs and preferences. In this paper, we propose Togedule, an adaptive scheduling tool that uses large language models to dynamically adjust the pool of choices and their presentation format. With the initial prototype, we conducted a formative study (N=10) and identified the potential benefits and risks of such an adaptive scheduling tool. Then, after enhancing the system, we conducted two controlled experiments, one each for attendees and organizers (total N=66). For each experiment, we compared scheduling with verbal messages, shared calendars, or Togedule. Results show that Togedule significantly reduces the cognitive load of attendees indicating their availability and improves the speed and quality of the decisions made by organizers.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of human-AI interaction in question answering is crucial for enhancing collaborative efficiency. Extending from our initial formative study, which revealed challenges in human utilization of conversational AI support, we designed two configurations for prompt guidance: a Nudging approach, where the AI suggests potential responses for human agents, and a Highlight strategy, emphasizing crucial parts of reference documents to aid human responses. Through two controlled experiments, the first involving 31 participants and the second involving 106 participants, we compared these configurations against traditional human-only approaches, both with and without AI assistance. Our findings suggest that effective human-AI collaboration can enhance response quality, though merely combining human and AI efforts does not ensure improved outcomes. In particular, the Nudging configuration was shown to help improve the quality of the output when compared to AI alone. This paper delves into the development of these prompt guidance paradigms, offering insights for refining human-AI collaborations in conversational question-answering contexts and contributing to a broader understanding of human perceptions and expectations in AI partnerships.</description>

      <title>Verisimilitude as Boon and Bane: How People Initiate Opportunistic Interactions at Professional Events in Social VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22241</link>

Abstract: Opportunistic interactions-the unstructured exchanges that emerge as individuals become aware of each other's presence-are essential for relationship building and information sharing in everyday life. Yet, fostering effective opportunistic interactions has proven challenging, especially at professional events that have increasingly transitioned from in person to online formats. In the current paper, we offer an in-depth qualitative account of how people initiate opportunistic interactions in social VR. Our participants consisted of 16 individuals with ongoing experience attending VR-mediated events in their professional communities. We conducted extensive observations with each participant during one or more events they attended. We also interviewed them after every observed event, obtaining self-reflections on their attempts to navigate opportunistic interactions with others. Our analysis revealed that participants sought to understand the extent to which social VR preserved the real-world meanings of various nonverbal cues, which we refer to as verisimilitude. We detailed the unique connections between a person's perceived verisimilitude and their social behaviors at each of the three steps toward initiating opportunistic interactions: availability recognition, attention capture, and ice-breaking. Across these steps, the VR platform typically replaces complex social mechanisms with feasible technical ones in order to function, thereby altering the preconditions necessary for a nonverbal cue's social meanings to remain intact. We identified a rich set of strategies that participants developed to assess verisimilitude and act upon it, while also confirming a lack of systematic knowledge guiding their practices. Based on these findings, we provide actionable insights for social VR platform design that can best support the initiation of opportunistic interactions for professional purposes.</description>

      <title>What is "Spatial" about Spatial Computing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in geographic information systems and mixed reality technologies have positioned spatial computing as a transformative paradigm in computational science. However, the field remains conceptually fragmented, with diverse interpretations across disciplines like Human-Computer Interaction, Geographic Information Science, and Computer Science, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of spatial computing and poses challenges for its coherent advancement and interdisciplinary integration. In this paper, we trace the origins and historical evolution of spatial computing and examine how "spatial" is understood, identifying two schools of thought: "spatial" as the contextual understanding of space, where spatial data guides interaction in the physical world; and "spatial" as a mixed space for interaction, emphasizing the seamless integration of physical and digital environments to enable embodied engagement. By synthesizing these perspectives, we propose spatial computing as a computational paradigm that redefines the interplay between environment, computation, and human experience, offering a holistic lens to enhance its conceptual clarity and inspire future technological innovations that support meaningful interactions with and shaping of environments.</description>

      <title>A Collaborative Content Moderation Framework for Toxicity Detection based on Conformalized Estimates of Annotation Disagreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content moderation typically combines the efforts of human moderators and machine learning models. However, these systems often rely on data where significant disagreement occurs during moderation, reflecting the subjective nature of toxicity perception. Rather than dismissing this disagreement as noise, we interpret it as a valuable signal that highlights the inherent ambiguity of the content,an insight missed when only the majority label is considered. In this work, we introduce a novel content moderation framework that emphasizes the importance of capturing annotation disagreement. Our approach uses multitask learning, where toxicity classification serves as the primary task and annotation disagreement is addressed as an auxiliary task. Additionally, we leverage uncertainty estimation techniques, specifically Conformal Prediction, to account for both the ambiguity in comment annotations and the model's inherent uncertainty in predicting toxicity and disagreement.The framework also allows moderators to adjust thresholds for annotation disagreement, offering flexibility in determining when ambiguity should trigger a review. We demonstrate that our joint approach enhances model performance, calibration, and uncertainty estimation, while offering greater parameter efficiency and improving the review process in comparison to single-task methods.</description>

      <title>Documenting Deployment with Fabric: A Repository of Real-World AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into society, from financial services and traffic management to creative writing. Academic literature on the deployment of AI has mostly focused on the risks and harms that result from the use of AI. We introduce Fabric, a publicly available repository of deployed AI use cases to outline their governance mechanisms. Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository, we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance.</description>
