      <title>Inferring firm-level supply chain networks with realistic systemic risk from industry sector-level data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Production networks constitute the backbone of every economic system. They are inherently fragile as several recent crises clearly highlighted. Estimating the system-wide consequences of local disruptions (systemic risk) requires detailed information on the supply chain networks (SCN) at the firm-level, as systemic risk is associated with specific mesoscopic patterns. However, such information is usually not available and realistic estimates must be inferred from available sector-level data such as input-output tables and firm-level aggregate output data. Here we explore the ability of several maximum-entropy algorithms to infer realizations of SCNs characterized by a realistic level of systemic risk. We are in the unique position to test them against the actual Ecuadorian production network at the firm-level. Concretely, we compare various properties, including the Economic Systemic Risk Index, of the Ecuadorian production network with those from four inference models. We find that the most realistic systemic risk content at the firm-level is retrieved by the model that incorporates information about firm-specific input disaggregated by sector, indicating the importance of correctly accounting for firms' heterogeneous input profiles across sectors. Our results clearly demonstrate the minimal amount of empirical information at the sector level that is necessary to statistically generate synthetic SCNs that encode realistic firm-specific systemic risk.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dominance for super heavy-tailed random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of super heavy-tailed distributions and establish the inequality that any weighted average of independent and identically distributed super heavy-tailed random variables stochastically dominates one such random variable. We show that many commonly used extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) distributions, such as the Pareto, Fr\'echet, and Burr distributions, belong to the class of super heavy-tailed distributions. The established stochastic dominance relation is further generalized to allow negatively dependent or non-identically distributed random variables. In particular, the weighted average of non-identically distributed random variables stochastically dominates their distribution mixtures. Applications of these results in portfolio diversification, goods bundling, and inventory management are discussed. Remarkably, in the presence of super heavy-tailedness, the results that hold for finite-mean models in these applications are flipped.</description>

      <title>EX-DRL: Hedging Against Heavy Losses with EXtreme Distributional Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for modeling loss distributions have shown promise in developing hedging strategies in derivatives markets. A common approach in DRL involves learning the quantiles of loss distributions at specified levels using Quantile Regression (QR). This method is particularly effective in option hedging due to its direct quantile-based risk assessment, such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). However, these risk measures depend on the accurate estimation of extreme quantiles in the loss distribution's tail, which can be imprecise in QR-based DRL due to the rarity and extremity of tail data, as highlighted in the literature. To address this issue, we propose EXtreme DRL (EX-DRL), which enhances extreme quantile prediction by modeling the tail of the loss distribution with a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). This method introduces supplementary data to mitigate the scarcity of extreme quantile observations, thereby improving estimation accuracy through QR. Comprehensive experiments on gamma hedging options demonstrate that EX-DRL improves existing QR-based models by providing more precise estimates of extreme quantiles, thereby improving the computation and reliability of risk metrics for complex financial risk management.</description>
