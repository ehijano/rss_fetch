      <title>Associations between iron and mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter nuclei in aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter has values similar to that seen in white matter. We suspect these elevated values may be related to iron. Multi-shell diffusion and multi-echo gradient echo acquisitions were used to derive mean kurtosis and R2*, respectively. Mean kurtosis and R2* were measured in subcortical grey matter nuclei and white matter tracts in 93 older adults and 62 younger adults. Grey matter regions exhibited higher mean kurtosis and R2* in the older adult group whereas white matter regions had reduced mean kurtosis in the older adult group. Grey matter mean kurtosis was significantly correlated with R2* iron-rich grey matter nuclei in both groups. Our findings indicate that higher mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter structures may be due to either increased tissue complexity or to decreases in signal-to-noise ratios from iron deposition</description>

      <title>Scatter correction based on quasi-Monte Carlo for CT reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scatter signals can degrade the contrast and resolution of computed tomography (CT) images and induce artifacts. How to effectively correct scatter signals in CT has always been a focal point of research for researchers. This work presents a new framework for eliminating scatter artifacts in CT. In the framework, the interaction between photons and matter is characterized as a Markov process, and the calculation of the scatter signal intensity in CT is transformed into the computation of a $4n$-dimensional integral, where $n$ is the highest scatter order. Given the low-frequency characteristics of scatter signals in CT, this paper uses the quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method combined with forced fixed detection and down sampling to compute the integral. In the reconstruction process, the impact of scatter signals on the X-ray energy spectrum is considered. A scatter-corrected spectrum estimation method is proposed and applied to estimate the X-ray energy spectrum. Based on the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm, a multi-module coupled reconstruction method, referred to as FDK-QMC-BM4D, has been developed to simultaneously eliminate scatter artifacts, beam hardening artifacts, and noise in CT imaging. Finally, the effectiveness of the FDK-QMC-BM4D method is validated in the Shepp-Logan phantom and head. Compared to the widely recognized Monte Carlo method, which is the most accurate method by now for estimating and correcting scatter signals in CT, the FDK-QMC-BM4D method improves the running speed by approximately $102$ times while ensuring accuracy. By integrating the mechanism of FDK-QMC-BM4D, this study offers a novel approach to addressing artifacts in clinical CT.</description>

      <title>A Shape-Based Functional Index for Objective Assessment of Pediatric Motor Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical assessments for neuromuscular disorders, such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), continue to rely on subjective measures to monitor treatment response and disease progression. We introduce a novel method using wearable sensors to objectively assess motor function during daily activities in 19 patients with DMD, 9 with SMA, and 13 age-matched controls. Pediatric movement data is complex due to confounding factors such as limb length variations in growing children and variability in movement speed. Our approach uses Shape-based Principal Component Analysis to align movement trajectories and identify distinct kinematic patterns, including variations in motion speed and asymmetry. Both DMD and SMA cohorts have individuals with motor function on par with healthy controls. Notably, patients with SMA showed greater activation of the motion asymmetry pattern. We further combined projections on these principal components with partial least squares (PLS) to identify a covariation mode with a canonical correlation of r = 0.78 (95% CI: [0.34, 0.94]) with muscle fat infiltration, the Brooke score (a motor function score), and age-related degenerative changes, proposing a novel motor function index. This data-driven method can be deployed in home settings, enabling better longitudinal tracking of treatment efficacy for children with neuromuscular disorders.</description>

      <title>Generative Style Transfer for MRI Image Segmentation: A Case of Glioma Segmentation in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the utilization of lower-quality Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology raises questions about the applicability of machine learning methods for clinical tasks. This study aims to provide a robust deep learning-based brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) method tailored for the SSA population using a threefold approach. Firstly, the impact of domain shift from the SSA training data on model efficacy was examined, revealing no significant effect. Secondly, a comparative analysis of 3D and 2D full-resolution models using the nnU-Net framework indicates similar performance of both the models trained for 300 epochs achieving a five-fold cross-validation score of 0.93. Lastly, addressing the performance gap observed in SSA validation as opposed to the relatively larger BraTS glioma (GLI) validation set, two strategies are proposed: fine-tuning SSA cases using the GLI+SSA best-pretrained 2D fullres model at 300 epochs, and introducing a novel neural style transfer-based data augmentation technique for the SSA cases. This investigation underscores the potential of enhancing brain tumor prediction within SSA's unique healthcare landscape.</description>
