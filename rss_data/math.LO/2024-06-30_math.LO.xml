      <title>Approximate equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study approximate equivalence relations up to commensurability, in the presence of a definable measure. As a basic framework, we give a presentation of probability logic based on continuous logic. Hoover's normal form is valid here; if one begins with a discrete logic structure, it reduces arbitrary formulas of probability logic to correlations between quantifier-free formulas. We completely classify binary correlations in terms of the Kim-Pillay space, leading to strong results on the interpretative power of pure probability logic over a binary language. Assuming higher amalgamation of independent types, we prove a higher stationarity statement for such correlations.
  We also give a short model-theoretic proof of a categoricity theorem for continuous logic structures with a measure of full support, generalizing theorems of Gromov-Vershik and Keisler, and often providing a canonical model for a complete pure probability logic theory. These results also apply to local probability logic, providing in particular a canonical model for a local pure probability logic theory with a unique 1-type and geodesic metric.
  For sequences of approximate equivalence relations with an 'approximately unique' probability logic 1-type, we obtain a structure theorem generalizing the `Lie model' theorem for approximate subgroups. The models here are Riemannian homogeneous spaces, fibered over a locally finite graph.
  Specializing to definable graphs over finite fields, we show that after a finite partition, a definable binary relation converges in finitely many self-compositions to an equivalence relation of geometric origin.
  For NIP theories, pursuing a question of Pillay's, we prove an archimedean finite-dimensionality statement for the automorphism groups of definable measures, acting on a given type of definable sets.</description>

      <title>Slalom numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is an extensive and systematic study of cardinal invariants we call slalom numbers, describing the combinatorics of sequences of sets of natural numbers. Our general approach, based on relational systems, covers many such cardinal characteristics, including localization and anti-localization cardinals. We show that most of the slalom numbers are connected to topological selection principles, in particular, we obtain the representation of the uniformity of meager and the cofinality of measure. Considering instances of slalom numbers parametrized by ideals on natural numbers, we focus on monotonicity properties with respect to ideal orderings and computational formulas for the disjoint sum of ideals. Hence, we get such formulas for several pseudo-intersection numbers as well as for the bounding and dominating numbers parametrized with ideals. Based on the effect of adding a Cohen real, we get many consistent constellations of different values of slalom numbers.</description>

      <title>Tense logics based on posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Not all logical systems can be captured using algebras. We see this in classical logic (formalized by Boolean algebras) and many-valued logics (like Lukasiewicz logic with MV-algebras). Even quantum mechanics, initially formalized with orthomodular lattices, benefits from a simpler approach using just partially ordered sets (posets). This paper explores how logical connectives are introduced in poset-based logics. Building on prior work by the authors, we delve deeper into "dynamic" logics where truth values can change over time. We consider time sets with a preference relation and propositions whose truth depends on time. Tense operators, introduced by J.Burgess and extended for various logics, become a valuable tool. This paper proposes several approaches to this topic, aiming to inspire a further stream of research.</description>

      <title>Realizing the Maximal Analytic Display Fragment of Labeled Sequent Calculi for Tense Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study translations between the maximal class of analytic display calculi for tense logics and labeled sequent calculi, thus solving an open problem about the translatability of proofs between the two formalisms. In particular, we provide PTIME translations that map cut-free display proofs to and from special cut-free labeled proofs, which we dub 'strict' labeled proofs. This identifies the space of cut-free display proofs with a polynomially equivalent subspace of labeled proofs, showing how calculi within the two formalisms polynomially simulate one another. We analyze the relative sizes of proofs under this translation, finding that display proofs become polynomially shorter when translated to strict labeled proofs, though with a potential increase in the length of sequents; in the reverse translation, strict labeled proofs may become polynomially larger when translated into display proofs. In order to achieve our results, we formulate labeled sequent calculi in a new way that views rules as 'templates', which are instantiated with substitutions to obtain rule applications; we also provide the first definition of primitive tense structural rules within the labeled sequent formalism. Therefore, our formulation of labeled calculi more closely resembles how display calculi are defined for tense logics, which permits a more fine-grained analysis of rules, substitutions, and translations. This work establishes that every analytic display calculus for a tense logic can be viewed as a labeled sequent calculus, showing conclusively that the labeled formalism subsumes and extends the display formalism in the setting of primitive tense logics.</description>

      <title>On quantitative convergence for stochastic processes: Crossings, fluctuations and martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for extracting highly uniform bounds on local stability for stochastic processes in terms of information on fluctuations or crossings. This includes a large class of martingales: As a corollary of our main abstract result, we obtain a quantitative version of Doob's convergence theorem for $L_1$-sub- and supermartingales, but more importantly, demonstrate that our framework readily extends to more complex stochastic processes such as almost-supermartingales, thus paving the way for future applications in stochastic optimization. Fundamental to our approach is the use of ideas from logic, particularly a careful analysis of the quantifier structure of probabilistic statements and the introduction of a number of abstract notions that represent stochastic convergence in a quantitative manner. In this sense, our work falls under the 'proof mining' program, and indeed, our quantitative results provide new examples of the phenomenon, recently made precise by the first author and Pischke, that many proofs in probability theory are proof-theoretically tame, and amenable to the extraction of quantitative data that is both of low complexity and independent of the underlying probability space.</description>

      <title>Randomness versus superspeedability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speedable numbers are real numbers which are algorithmically approximable from below and whose approximations can be accelerated nonuniformly. We begin this article by answering a question of Barmpalias by separating a strict subclass that we will refer to as superspeedable from the speedable numbers; for elements of this subclass, acceleration is possible uniformly and to an even higher degree. This new type of benign left-approximations of numbers then integrates itself into a hierarchy of other such notions studied in a growing body of recent work. We add a new perspective to this study by juxtaposing this hierachy with the well-studied hierachy of algorithmic randomness notions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study generalised Taylor morphisms, functors which construct differential ring homomorphisms from ring homomorphisms in a uniform way, analogous to the Taylor expansion for smooth functions. We generalise the construction of the twisted Taylor morphism by Le\'on S\'anchez and Tressl to arbitrary differential rings by `twisting' the ring of Hurwitz series, and prove that this results in a functor which is the right adjoint to a certain forgetful functor. We therefore give a concrete characterisation of all generalised Taylor morphisms over all differential rings with finitely many commuting derivations.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Calculus sizes over the Boolean and Fourier bases are incomparable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every $n &gt;0$, we show the existence of a CNF tautology over $O(n^2)$ variables of width $O(\log n)$ such that it has a Polynomial Calculus Resolution refutation over $\{0,1\}$ variables of size $O(n^3polylog(n))$ but any Polynomial Calculus refutation over $\{+1,-1\}$ variables requires size $2^{\Omega(n)}$. This shows that Polynomial Calculus sizes over the $\{0,1\}$ and $\{+1,-1\}$ bases are incomparable (since Tseitin tautologies show a separation in the other direction) and answers an open problem posed by Sokolov [Sok20] and Razborov.</description>
