      <title>Metastability in Parabolic Equations and Diffusion Processes with a Small Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study diffusion processes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that leave invariant a finite collection of manifolds (surfaces or points) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and small perturbations of such processes. Assuming certain ergodic properties at and near the invariant surfaces, we describe the rate at which the process gets attracted to or repelled from the surface, based on the local behavior of the coefficients. For processes that include, additionally, a small non-degenerate perturbation, we describe the metastable behavior. Namely, by allowing the time scale to depend on the size of the perturbation, we observe different asymptotic distributions of the process at different time scales.
  Stated in PDE terms, the results provide the asymptotics, at different time scales, for the solution of the parabolic Cauchy problem when the operator that degenerates on a collection of surfaces is perturbed by a small non-degenerate term. This asymptotic behavior switches at a finite number of time scales that are calculated and does not depend on the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for random Cayley graphs of nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the random Cayley graphs of a sequence of finite nilpotent groups of diverging sizes $G=G(n)$, whose ranks and nilpotency classes are uniformly bounded. For some $k=k(n)$ such that $1\ll\log k \ll \log |G|$, we pick a random set of generators $S=S(n)$ by sampling $k$ elements $Z_1,\ldots,Z_k$ from $G$ uniformly at random with replacement, and set $S:=\{Z_j^{\pm 1}:1 \le j\le k \}$. We show that the simple random walk on Cay$(G,S)$ exhibits cutoff with high probability.
  Some of our results apply to a general set of generators. Namely, we show that there is a constant $c&gt;0$, depending only on the rank and the nilpotency class of $G$, such that for all symmetric sets of generators $S$ of size at most $ \frac{c\log |G|}{\log \log |G|}$, the spectral gap and the $\varepsilon$-mixing time of the simple random walk $X=(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ on Cay$(G,S)$ are asymptotically the same as those of the projection of $X$ to the abelianization of $G$, given by $[G,G]X_t$. In particular, $X$ exhibits cutoff if and only if its projection does.</description>

      <title>On affine multi-color urns grown under multiple drawing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early investigation of P\'{o}lya urns considered drawing balls one at a time. In the last two decades, several authors considered multiple drawing in each step, but mostly for schemes on two colors. In this manuscript, we consider multiple drawing from urns of balls of multiple colors, formulating asymptotic theory for specific urn classes and addressing more applications.
  The class we consider is affine and tenable, built around a "core" square matrix. An index for the drawing schema is derived from the eigenvalues of the core. We identify three regimes: small-, critical-, and large-index. In the small-index regime, we find an asymptotic Gaussian law. In the critical-index regime, we also find an asymptotic Gaussian law, albeit a difference in the scale factor, which involves logarithmic terms.
  In both of these regimes, we have explicit forms for the structure of the mean and the covariance matrix of the composition vector (both exact and asymptotic). In all three regimes we have strong laws.</description>

      <title>Invariance of fixation probability in Moran-like Processes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The now famous Isothermal Theorem was introduced in a Nature Communications article in 2005 by Nowak and Liebermann and has since been the founding document of the rich field of evolutionary graph theory. Unfortunately, the Isothermal Theorem has never been proven completely. The main argument, that the projection of the graph dynamics is a Markovian Birth-and-Death- Process, is not applicable in general and leaves the question open for the case, when the projection is not Markov. To complete the proof, we first generalise the model by Liebermann and Nowak, by introducing a non-uniform selection policy to select an individual for procreation. Then, we use a martingale argument to prove that selecting with a specific selection policy related to the weight matrix of the underlying population graph still gives rise to Moran fixation probability, even outside of the framework of the original Isothermal Theorem. Our proof includes and completes the proof of the Isothermal Theorem. We follow up with a small numerical study that shows that the set of spatial Moran Processes with Moran fixation probability is even richer than previously understood. The initial condition and the selection policy play an important role in this.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation and singularity of laws on the path space for SDEs driven by Rosenblatt processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study parameter identification for solutions to (possibly non-linear) SDEs driven by additive Rosenblatt process and singularity of the induced laws on the path space. We propose a joint estimator for the drift parameter, diffusion intensity, and Hurst index that can be computed from discrete-time observations with a bounded time horizon and we prove its strong consistency (as well as the speed of convergence) under in-fill asymptotics with a fixed time horizon. As a consequence of this strong consistency, singularity of measures generated by the solutions with different drifts is shown. This results in the invalidity of a Girsanov-type theorem for Rosenblatt processes.</description>

      <title>Fixing a Minor Mistake in the Theory of Stochastic Integration and Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When considering stochastic integration and the theory of stochastic differential equations, P. Protter's textbook \cite{protter} undoubtedly is a main piece of standard literature. Not only is it well-written, but it also contains various profound results regarding these fields. Unfortunately, Theorem 12 of Chapter V, which presents an equivalence to uniform convergence on compacts in probability, is found to be incorrect. Given that numerous important results rely on this theorem, this paper aims to present a corrected version of it.</description>

      <title>Reflected Brownian Motion in a wedge: sum-of-exponential absorption probability at the vertex and differential properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Brownian motion with drift in a wedge of angle $\beta$ which is obliquely reflected on each edge along angles $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$. We assume that the classical parameter $\alpha=\frac{\delta+\varepsilon - \pi}{\beta}$ is greater than $1$ and we focus on transient cases where the process can either be absorbed at the vertex or escape to infinity. We show that $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^*$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for the absorption probability, seen as a function of the starting point, to be written as a finite sum of terms of exponential product form. In such cases, we give expressions for the absorption probability and its Laplace transform. When $\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}+\frac{\pi}{\beta}\mathbb{Z}$ we find explicit D-algebraic expression for the Laplace transform. Our results rely on Tutte's invariant method and on a recursive compensation approach.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap Percolation on the Binomial Random $k$-uniform Hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of $r$-neighbourhood bootstrap percolation on the binomial $k$-uniform random hypergraph $H_k(n,p)$ for given integers $k\geq 2$ and $r\geq 2$. In $r$-neighbourhood bootstrap percolation, infection spreads through the hypergraph, starting from a set of initially infected vertices, and in each subsequent step of the process every vertex with at least $r$ infected neighbours becomes infected. For our analysis the set of initially infected vertices is chosen uniformly at random from all sets of given size. In the regime $n^{-1}\ll n^{k-2}p \ll n^{-1/r}$ we establish a threshold such that if the number of initially infected vertices remains below the threshold, then with high probability only a few additional vertices become infected, while if the number of initially infected vertices exceeds the threshold then with high probability almost every vertex becomes infected. In fact we show that the probability of failure decreases exponentially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use mathematical statistics theory to derive the Compound-Dirichlet-Multinomial (CDM) prediction model. We then use this model to predict winning numbers for the 6-number, 5-number, pick-4 and pick-3 lottery games. We also develop a strategy which we call the 3-strategy, for generating profit by predicting winning numbers for the pick-3 lottery game.</description>

      <title>Tournaments and random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between tournaments and random walks. This connection was observed by Moser, who conjectured that the number of score sequences $S_n\sim C4^n/n^{5/2}$. Winston and Kleitman came close to finding the correct order of $S_n$. Building on this, and subsequent works by Tak\'acs, Kim and Pittel confirmed that $S_n=\Theta(4^n/n^{5/2})$.
  In this work, we verify Moser's conjecture, using limit theory for integrated random walk bridges. Moreover, we show that $C$ can be described in terms of random walks. Combining this with a recent proof and alternative, number-theoretic description of $C$ by the second author, we obtain an analogue of Louchard's formula, for the Laplace transform of the squared Brownian excursion/Airy area measure. Finally, we describe the scaling limit of random score sequences, in terms of the Kolmogorov excursions, studied recently by B\"{a}r, Duraj and Wachtel.
  Our results can also be interpreted as answering questions related to a class of random polymers, which began with influential work of Sina\u{i}. From this point of view, our methods yield the precise asymptotics for a persistence probability, related to the pinning/wetting models from statistical physics, that was estimated up to constants by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, as conjectured by Caravenna and Deuschel.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Sina\u{i} excursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of random polymers, introduced by Sina\u{\i}, which are related to persistence probabilities in integrated simple random walk bridges. We find the precise asymptotics of these probabilities, and describe their combinatorics, using limit theory for infinitely divisible distributions, and the number-theoretic subset counting formulas of von Sterneck from the early 1900s. Our results sharpen estimates by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, and respond to a conjecture of Caravenna and Deuschel, which arose in their study of the pinning/wetting models, for random linear chains exhibiting entropic repulsion. Our key combinatorial result is an analogue of Sparre Andersen's classical formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double Pareto distribution is a heavy-tailed distribution with a power-law tail, that is generated via geometric Brownian motion with an exponentially distributed observation time. In this study, we examine a modified model wherein the exponential distribution of the observation time is replaced with a continuous uniform distribution. The probability density, complementary cumulative distribution, and moments of this model are exactly calculated. Furthermore, the validity of the analytical calculations is discussed in comparison with numerical simulations of stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Iterated Monodromy Group With Non-Martingale Fixed-Point Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct families of rational functions $f: \mathbb{P}^1_k \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1_k$ of degree $d \geq 2$ over a perfect field $k$ with non-martingale fixed-point processes. Then for any normal variety $X$ over $\mathbb{P}_{\bar{k}}^N$, we give conditions on $f: X \rightarrow X$ to guarantee that the associated fixed-point process is a martingale. This work extends the previous work of Bridy, Jones, Kelsey, and Lodge ~\cite{iterated} on martingale conditions and answers their question on the existence of a non-martingale fixed-point process associated with the iterated monodromy group of a rational function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider strictly positive solutions to a class of fourth-order conservative quasilinear SPDEs on the $d$-dimensional torus modeled after the stochastic thin-film equation. Using recent results on quasilinear stochastic evolution equations, we show local well-posedness, blow-up criteria and instantaneous regularization in suitable function spaces under corresponding smoothness conditions on the noise. As a key ingredient, we prove stochastic maximal $L^p$-regularity estimates for thin film-type operators with measurable in time coefficients. With the aid of the above-mentioned results, we obtain global well-posedness of the stochastic thin-film equation with an interface potential by closing $\alpha$-entropy estimates and subsequently an energy estimate in dimension one. In particular, we can treat a wide range of mobility functions including the power laws $u^n$ for $n\in [0,6)$ as long as the interface potential is sufficiently repulsive.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we review the recent construction of the Liouville conformal field theory (CFT) from probabilistic methods, and the formalization of the conformal bootstrap. This model has offered a fruitful playground to unify the probabilistic construction of the path integral, the geometric axiomatics of CFT by Segal and the representation theoretical content of the conformal bootstrap. We explain and extract the main steps and ideas behind the construction and resolution of this non-compact CFT.</description>

      <title>Importance sampling for rare event tracking within the ensemble Kalman filtering framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we employ importance sampling (IS) techniques to track a small over-threshold probability of a running maximum associated with the solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) within the framework of ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF). Between two observation times of the EnKF, we propose to use IS with respect to the initial condition of the SDE, IS with respect to the Wiener process via a stochastic optimal control formulation, and combined IS with respect to both initial condition and Wiener process. Both IS strategies require the approximation of the solution of Kolmogorov Backward equation (KBE) with boundary conditions. In multidimensional settings, we employ a Markovian projection dimension reduction technique to obtain an approximation of the solution of the KBE by just solving a one dimensional PDE. The proposed ideas are tested on two illustrative examples: Double Well SDE and Langevin dynamics, and showcase a significant variance reduction compared to the standard Monte Carlo method and another sampling-based IS technique, namely, multilevel cross entropy.</description>

      <title>Markovian lifting and optimal control for integral stochastic Volterra equations with completely monotone kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on solving the optimal control problem for integral stochastic Volterra equations in a finite dimensional setting. In our setting, the noise term is driven by a pure jump L\'evy noise and the control acts on the intensity of the jumps.
  We use recent techniques proposed by Hamaguchi, where a crucial requirement is that the convolution kernel should be a completely monotone function. This allows us to use Bernstein's representation and the machinery of Laplace transform to obtain a Markovian lift.
  It is natural that the Markovian lift, in whatever form constructed, transforms the state equation into a stochastic differential equation in an infinite-dimensional space. This space should be large enough to contain all the information about the history of the process. Hence, although the original equation is taken in a finite dimensional space, the resulting lift is always infinite dimensional.
  We solve the problem by using the forward-backward approach in the infinite-dimensional setting and prove the existence of the optimal control for the original problem. Under additional assumptions on the coefficients, we see that a control in closed-loop form can be achieved.</description>

      <title>A quasi-stationary approach to the long-term asymptotics of the growth-fragmentation equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a growth-fragmentation system, cells grow in size slowly and split apart at random. Typically, the number of cells in the system grows exponentially and the distribution of the sizes of cells settles into an equilibrium 'asymptotic profile'. In this work we introduce a new method to prove this asymptotic behaviour for the growth-fragmentation equation, and show that the convergence to the asymptotic profile occurs at exponential rate. We do this by identifying an associated sub-Markov process and studying its quasi-stationary behaviour via a Lyapunov function condition. By doing so, we are able to simplify and generalise results in a number of common cases and offer a unified framework for their study. In the course of this work we are also able to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the growth-fragmentation equation in a wide range of situations.</description>

      <title>Superconvergence phenomenon in Wiener chaoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an unexpected phenomenon of strong regularization along normal convergence on Wiener chaoses. For every sequence of chaotic random variables, convergence in law to the Gaussian distribution is upgraded to superconvergence: the regularity of the densities increases along the convergence, and all the derivatives converges uniformly. Our findings strengthen known results regarding modes of convergence for normal approximation on Wiener chaoses. Without additional assumptions, convergence in total variation is established by Nourdin &amp; Peccati, and later on amplified to convergence in relative entropy by Nourdin, Peccati &amp; Swan. Our result is then extended to the multivariate setting, and for polynomial mappings of a Gaussian field provided the projection on the Wiener chaos of maximal degree admits a non-degenerate Gaussian limit. While our findings apply to any context involving polynomials of a Gaussian field, we emphasize applications regarding: improved Carbery-Wright estimates near Gaussianity; normal convergence in entropy and in Fisher information; superconvergence for the spectral moments of GOE; moments bounds for the inverse of strongly correlated Wishart-type matrices; superconvergence in the Breuer-Major Theorem. Our proofs leverage Malliavin's historical idea to establish smoothness of the density via the existence of negative moments of the Malliavin gradient, and we develop a new paradigm to study this problem. We relate the existence of negative moments to spectral quantities associated with the Malliavin Hessian. This link relies on an adequate choice of the Malliavin gradient, which provides a novel decoupling procedure of independent interest. Previous attempts to establish convergence beyond entropy have imposed restrictive assumptions ensuring finiteness of negative moments for the Malliavin derivatives. Our analysis renders these assumptions superfluous.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for supercritical remaining-lifetime age-structured branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supercritical age-structured branching models starting from a single particle with a random lifetime, where the reproduction law depends on the remaining lifetime of the parent. The lifespan of an individual is decided at its birth and its remaining lifetime decreases at the unit speed. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided for the convergence of the Malthusian normalized random measures. The Malthusian type limit theory in a functional form can be strengthened to hold with probability one under some ``$L\log L$'' conditions. We further prove a central limit theory with a random normalization factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an abstract framework for establishing smoothing properties within a specific class of inhomogeneous discrete-time Markov processes. These properties, in turn, serve as a basis for demonstrating the existence of density functions for our processes or more precisely for regularized versions of them. They can also be exploited to show the total variation convergence towards the solution of a Stochastic Differential Equation as the time step between two observations of the discrete time Markov processes tends to zero. The distinctive feature of our methodology lies in the exploration of smoothing properties under some local weak H\"ormander type conditions satisfied by the discrete-time Markov processes. Our H\"ormander properties are demonstrated to align with the standard local weak H\"ormander properties satisfied by the coefficients of the Stochastic Differential Equations which are the total variation limits of our discrete time Markov processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The periodic KPZ fixed point is the conjectural universal limit of the KPZ universality class models on a ring when both the period and time critically tend to infinity. For the case of the periodic narrow wedge initial condition, we consider the conditional distribution when the periodic KPZ fixed point is unusually large at a particular position and time. We prove a conditional limit theorem up to the ``pinch-up" time. When the period is large enough, the result is the same as that for the KPZ fixed point on the line obtained by Liu and Wang in 2022. We identify the regimes in which the result changes and find probabilistic descriptions of the limits.</description>

      <title>Simulating conditioned diffusions on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To date, most methods for simulating conditioned diffusions are limited to the Euclidean setting. The conditioned process can be constructed using a change of measure known as Doob's $h$-transform. The specific type of conditioning depends on a function $h$ which is typically unknown in closed form. To resolve this, we extend the notion of guided processes to a manifold $M$, where one replaces $h$ by a function based on the heat kernel on $M$. We consider the case of a Brownian motion with drift, constructed using the frame bundle of $M$, conditioned to hit a point $x_T$ at time $T$. We prove equivalence of the laws of the conditioned process and the guided process with a tractable Radon-Nikodym derivative. Subsequently, we show how one can obtain guided processes on any manifold $N$ that is diffeomorphic to $M$ without assuming knowledge of the heat kernel on $N$.
  We illustrate our results with numerical simulations and an example of parameter estimation where a diffusion process on the torus is observed discretely in time.</description>

      <title>Semigroup of annuli in Liouville CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conformal field theory, the semigroup of annuli with boundary parametrization plays a special role, in that it generates the whole algebra of local conformal symmetries, the so-called Virasoro algebra. The subgroup of elements $\mathbb{A}_f=\mathbb{D}\setminus f(\mathbb{D}^\circ)$ for contracting biholomorphisms $f:\mathbb{D}\to f(\mathbb{D})\subset \mathbb{D}^\circ$ with $f(0)=0$ is called the holomorphic semigroup of annuli. In this article, we construct a differentiable representation of the holomorphic semigroup into the space of bounded operators on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of Liouville Conformal Field Theory and show it generates under differentiation the positive Virasoro elements ${\bf L}_n,\tilde{{\bf L}}_n$ for $n\geq 0$. We also construct a projective representation of the semigroup of annuli in the space of bounded operators on $\mathcal{H}$ in terms of Segal amplitudes and show that all Virasoro elements ${\bf L}_n,\tilde{{\bf L}}_n$ for $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ are generated by differentiation of these annuli amplitudes. Finally, we use this to show that the Segal amplitudes for Liouville theory are differentiable with respetc to their boundary parametrizations, and the differential is computed in terms of Virasoro generators. This paper will serve, in a forthcoming work, as a fundamental tool in the construction of the conformal blocks as globally defined holomorphic sections of a holomorphic line bundle on Teichmuller space and satisfying the Ward identities.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study the \emph{Fourier spectrum} which is a continuously parametrised family of dimensions living between the Fourier dimension and the Hausdorff dimension for both sets and measures. We establish some fundamental theory and motivate the concept via several applications, especially to sumset type problems. For example, we study dimensions of convolutions and sumsets, and solve the distance set problem for sets satisfying certain Fourier analytic conditions.</description>

      <title>Exponential ergodicity of a degenerate age-size piecewise deterministic process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of the first-moment semigroup of a non conservative piecewise deterministic measure-valued stochastic process with support on R 2 + driven by a deterministic flow between random jump times, with a transition kernel which has a degenerate form. Using a Doob h-transform where the function h is taken as an eigenfunction of the associated generator, we can bring ourselves back to the study of a conservative process whose exponential ergodicity is proven via Harris' Theorem. Particular attention is given to the proof of Doeblin minoration condition. The main difficulty is the degeneracy of one of the two variables, and the deterministic dependency between the two variables, which make it no trivial to uniformly bound the expected value of the trajectories with respect to a non-degenerate measure in a two-dimensional space, which is particularly hard in a non-compact setting. Here, we propose a general method to construct explicit trajectories which explore the space state with positive probability and witch permit to prove a petite-set condition for the compact sets of the state space. An application to an age-structured growthfragmentation process modelling bacterial growth is also shown.</description>

We do so by studying the action of an annealead transfer operators on ad-hoc spaces of probability densities.
