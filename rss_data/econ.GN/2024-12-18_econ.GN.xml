      <title>Emergence of Power-Law and Other Wealth Distributions in Crowd of Heterogeneous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the emergence of power-law and other concentrated distributions through a feedback loop model in crowd interactions. Agents act by their response functions to observations and external forces, while observations change by the aggregated actions of all agents, weighted by their respective influence, i.e. power or wealth. Agents wealth dynamically adjust based on the alignment between an agents actions and observation outcomes: agents gain wealth when their actions align with observed trends and lose wealth otherwise. A reward function, that describes the change of agents wealth at each time step, manifests the differences of response functions of agents to observations. When all agents responses are set to zero and feedback loop is broken, agents wealth follow a normal or lognormal distribution. Otherwise, this response-reward iterative feedback mechanism results in concentrated wealth distributions, characterized by a small number of dominant agents and the marginalization of the majority. Contrasted to past studies, such concentration is not limited only to asymptotic behavior at the upper tail for large variables, nor does it require the reward function to be linear to agents previous wealth as formulated in random growth model and network preferential attachment. Probability density functions for various distributions are more visually distinguishable for small values at the lower tail. In application of this model, key differences in income and wealth distributions in the US vs Japan are attributed to different response functions of agents in the two countries. The model applicability extends beyond social systems to other many-body systems with analogous feedback mechanisms, where power-law distributions represent a rare subset of general concentrated outcomes.</description>

      <title>Gender Bias and Property Taxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gender bias distorts the economic behavior and outcomes of women and households. We investigate gender biases in property taxes. We analyze records of more than 100,000 property tax appeal hearings and more than 2.7 years of associated audio recordings, considering how panelist and appellant genders associate with hearing outcomes. We first observe that female appellants fare systematically worse than male appellants in their hearings. Second, we show that, whereas male appellants' hearing outcomes do not vary meaningfully with the gender composition of the panel they face, those of female appellants' do, such that female appellants obtain systematically lesser (greater) reductions to their home values when facing female (male) panelists. Employing a multi-modal large language model (M-LLM), we next construct measures of participant behavior and tone from hearing audio recordings. We observe markedly different behaviors between male and female appellants and, in the case of male appellants, we find that these differences also depend on the gender of the panelists they face (e.g., male appellants appear to behave systematically more aggressively towards female panelists). In contrast, the behavior of female appellants remains relatively constant, regardless of their panel's gender. Finally, we show that female appellants continue to fare worse in front of female panels, even when we condition upon the appelant's in-hearing behavior and tone. Our results are thus consistent with the idea that gender biases are driven, at least in part, by unvoiced beliefs and perceptions on the part of ARB panelists. Our study documents the presence of gender biases in property appraisal appeal hearings and highlights the potential value of generative AI for analyzing large-scale, unstructured administrative data.</description>

      <title>Organizational culture and the usage of Industry 4.0 technologies: evidence from Swiss businesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using novel establishment-level observational data from Switzerland, we empirically examine whether the usage of key technologies of Industry 4.0 distinguishes across firms with different types of organizational culture. Based on the Technology-Organization-Environment and the Competing Values framework, we hypothesize that the developmental culture has the greatest potential to promote the usage of Industry 4.0 technologies. We also hypothesize that companies with a hierarchical or rational culture are especially likely to make use of automation technologies, such as AI and robotics. By means of descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis, we find empirical support for our first hypothesis, while we cannot con-firm our second hypothesis. Our empirical results provide important implications for managerial decision-makers. Specifically, the link between organizational culture and the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies is relevant for managers, as this knowledge helps them to cope with digital transformation in turbulent times and keep their businesses competitive.</description>

      <title>Digital technologies and performance incentives: Evidence from businesses in the Swiss economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using novel survey data from Swiss firms, this paper empirically examines the relationship between the use of digital technologies and the prevalence of performance incentives. We argue that digital technologies tend to reduce the cost of organizational monitoring through improved measurement of employee behavior and performance, as well as through employee substitution in conjunction with a reduced agency problem. While we expect the former mechanism to increase the prevalence of performance incentives, the latter is likely to decrease it. Our doubly robust ATE estimates show that companies using business software and certain key technologies of Industry 4.0 increasingly resort to performance incentives, suggesting that the improved measurement effect dominates the employee substitution effect. In addition, we find that companies emerging as technology-friendly use performance incentives more frequently than their technology-averse counterparts. Both findings hold for managerial and non-managerial employees. Our estimation results are robust to a variety of sensitivity checks and suggest that Swiss businesses leverage digital technologies to enhance control over production or service processes, allowing them to intensify their management of employees through performance incentives.</description>

      <title>Digital Transformation in Switzerland: The Current State and Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive, descriptive overview of the current state of digital transformation in the Swiss economy and delineates areas that businesses should keep an eye on. Key findings illustrate that even established technologies are not universally adopted, that companies tend to overestimate their technological status compared to their competitors, and that it is important to have the appropriate technological know-how when introducing new technologies. In addition, companies expect changes in their work processes and employment conditions in connection with the digital transformation. Specifically, work tasks are expected to become more complex, diverse and varied. Employees' knowledge acquisition will gain in importance, especially in the form of formal further training and self-learning. Employees will also be more autonomous in making decisions about their jobs and working hours.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Strategic Reasoning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for a variety of complex and critical tasks, it is vital to assess their logical capabilities in strategic environments. This paper examines their ability in strategic reasoning -- the process of choosing an optimal course of action by predicting and adapting to other agents' behavior. Using six LLMs, we analyze responses from play in classical games from behavioral economics (p-Beauty Contest, 11-20 Money Request Game, and Guessing Game) and evaluate their performance through hierarchical models of reasoning (level-$k$ theory and cognitive hierarchy theory). Our findings reveal that while LLMs show understanding of the games, the majority struggle with higher-order strategic reasoning. Although most LLMs did demonstrate learning ability with games involving repeated interactions, they still consistently fall short of the reasoning levels demonstrated by typical behavior from human subjects. The exception to these overall findings is with OpenAI's GPT-o1 -- specifically trained to solve complex reasoning tasks -- which consistently outperforms other LLMs and human subjects. These findings highlight the challenges and pathways in advancing LLMs toward robust strategic reasoning from the perspective of behavioral economics.</description>

      <title>Expressions of Market-Based Correlations Between Prices and Returns of Two Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives the expressions of correlations between prices of two assets, returns of two assets, and price-return correlations of two assets that depend on statistical moments and correlations of the current values, past values, and volumes of their market trades. The usual frequency-based expressions of correlations of time series of prices and returns describe a partial case of our model when all trade volumes and past trade values are constant. Such an assumptions are rather far from market reality, and its use results in excess losses and wrong forecasts. Traders, banks, and funds that perform multi-million market transactions or manage billion-valued portfolios should consider the impact of large trade volumes on market prices and returns. The use of the market-based correlations of prices and returns of two assets is mandatory for them. The development of macroeconomic models and market forecasts like those being created by BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed., is impossible without the use of market-based correlations of prices and returns of two assets.</description>

      <title>Measuring Higher-Order Rationality with Belief Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining an individual's strategic reasoning capability based solely on choice data is a complex task. This complexity arises because sophisticated players might have non-equilibrium beliefs about others, leading to non-equilibrium actions. In our study, we pair human participants with computer players known to be fully rational. This use of robot players allows us to disentangle limited reasoning capacity from belief formation and social biases. Our results show that, when paired with robots, subjects consistently demonstrate higher levels of rationality and maintain stable rationality levels across different games compared to when paired with humans. This suggests that strategic reasoning might indeed be a consistent trait in individuals. Furthermore, the identified rationality limits could serve as a measure for evaluating an individual's strategic capacity when their beliefs about others are adequately controlled.</description>

      <title>Herding Unmasked: Insights into Cryptocurrencies, Stocks and US ETFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herding behavior has become a familiar phenomenon to investors, with potential dangers of both undervaluing and overvaluing assets, while also threatening market stability. This study contributes to the literature on herding behavior by using a recent dataset, covering the most impactful events of recent years. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining herding behavior across three different types of investment vehicle and also the first study observing herding at a community (subset) level. Specifically, we first explore this phenomenon in each separate type of investment vehicle, namely stocks, US ETFs and cryptocurrencies, using the Cross-Sectional Absolute Deviation model. We find mostly similar herding patterns for stocks and US ETFs. Subsequently, the same experiment is implemented on a combination of all three investment vehicles. For a deeper investigation, we adopt graph-based techniques including the Minimum Spanning Tree and Louvain community detection to partition the combination into smaller subsets to detect herding behavior for each subset. We find that herding behavior exists at all times across all types of investment vehicle at a subset level, although perhaps not at the superset level, and that this herding behavior tends to stem from specific events that solely impact that subset of assets. Lastly, we explore herding by examining the financial contagion effects between these types of investment vehicle. Results show that US ETFs not only have a tendency to propagate similar trading behaviors in stocks and especially cryptocurrencies but also show self-reinforcing herding behavior, acting as drivers of their own trends.</description>

      <title>As Generative Models Improve, We Must Adapt Our Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in generative AI has led to new models being introduced almost every month. In light of this rapid progression, we pose and address a central question: to what extent must prompts evolve as the capabilities of generative AI models advance? To answer this question, we conducted an online experiment with N = 1,983 participants where each participant was incentivized to write prompts to reproduce a target image as closely as possible in 10 consecutive tries. Each participant was randomly and blindly assigned to use one of three text-to-image diffusion models: DALL-E 2, its more advanced successor, DALL-E 3, or a version of DALL-E 3 with automatic prompt revision. In total, we collected and analyzed over 18,000 prompts and over 300,000 images. We find that task performance was higher for participants using DALL-E 3 than for those using DALL-E 2. This performance gap corresponds to a noticeable difference in the similarity of participants' images to their target images, and was caused in equal measure by: (1) the increased technical capabilities of DALL-E 3, and (2) endogenous changes in participants' prompting in response to these increased capabilities. Furthermore, while participants assigned to DALL-E 3 with prompt revision still outperformed those assigned to DALL-E 2, automatic prompt revision reduced the benefits of using DALL-E 3 by 58%. Our results suggest that for generative AI to realize its full impact on the global economy, people, firms, and institutions will need to update their prompts in response to new models.</description>

      <title>Can Machines Think Like Humans? A Behavioral Evaluation of LLM-Agents in Dictator Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly undertake real-world tasks and engage with human society, how well do we understand their behaviors? We (1) investigate how LLM agents' prosocial behaviors -- a fundamental social norm -- can be induced by different personas and benchmarked against human behaviors; and (2) introduce a behavioral and social science approach to evaluate LLM agents' decision-making. We explored how different personas and experimental framings affect these AI agents' altruistic behavior in dictator games and compared their behaviors within the same LLM family, across various families, and with human behaviors. The findings reveal substantial variations and inconsistencies among LLMs and notable differences compared to human behaviors. Merely assigning a human-like identity to LLMs does not produce human-like behaviors. Despite being trained on extensive human-generated data, these AI agents are unable to capture the internal processes of human decision-making. Their alignment with human is highly variable and dependent on specific model architectures and prompt formulations; even worse, such dependence does not follow a clear pattern. LLMs can be useful task-specific tools but are not yet intelligent human-like agents.</description>
