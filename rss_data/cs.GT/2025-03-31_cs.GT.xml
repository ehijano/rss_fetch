      <title>InfoBid: A Simulation Framework for Studying Information Disclosure in Auctions with Large Language Model-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In online advertising systems, publishers often face a trade-off in information disclosure strategies: while disclosing more information can enhance efficiency by enabling optimal allocation of ad impressions, it may lose revenue potential by decreasing uncertainty among competing advertisers. Similar to other challenges in market design, understanding this trade-off is constrained by limited access to real-world data, leading researchers and practitioners to turn to simulation frameworks. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing human-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit assumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing frameworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information asymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions. To address this gap, we introduce InfoBid, a flexible simulation framework that leverages LLM agents to examine the effects of information disclosure strategies in multi-agent auction settings. Using GPT-4o, we implemented simulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas. The results reveal key insights into how signaling influences strategic behavior and auction outcomes, which align with both economic and social learning theories. Through InfoBid, we hope to foster the use of LLMs as proxies for human economic and social agents in empirical studies, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities and limitations. This work bridges the gap between theoretical market designs and practical applications, advancing research in market simulations, information design, and agent-based reasoning while offering a valuable tool for exploring the dynamics of digital economies.</description>

      <title>On-Off Systems with Strategic Customers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications such as urban traffic control and make-to-order systems, we study a fluid model of a single-server, on-off system that can accommodate multiple queues. The server visits each queue in order: when a queue is served, it is "on", and when the server is serving another queue or transitioning between queues, it is "off". Customers arrive over time, observe the state of the system, and decide whether to join. We consider two regimes for the formation of the on and off durations. In the exogenous setting, each queue's on and off durations are predetermined. We explicitly characterize the equilibrium outcome in closed form and give a compact linear program to compute the optimal on-off durations that maximizes total reward collected from serving customers. In the endogenous setting, the durations depend on customers' joining decisions under an exhaustive service policy where the server never leaves a non-empty queue. We show that an optimal policy in this case extends service beyond the first clearance for at most one queue. Using this property, we introduce a closed-form procedure that computes an optimal policy in no more than 2n steps for a system with n queues.</description>

      <title>Deviation Between Team-Optimal Solution and Nash Equilibrium in Flow Assignment Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the team-optimal solution and the Nash equilibrium (NE) to assess the impact of strategy deviation on team performance. As a working use case, we focus on a class of flow assignment problems in which each source node acts as a cooperating decision maker (DM) within a team that minimizes the team cost based on the team-optimal strategy. In practice, some selfish DMs may prioritize their own marginal cost and deviate from NE strategies, thus potentially degrading the overall performance. To quantify this deviation, we explore the deviation bound between the team-optimal solution and the NE in two specific scenarios: (i) when the team-optimal solution is unique and (ii) when multiple solutions do exist. This helps DMs analyze the factors influencing the deviation and adopting the NE strategy within a tolerable range. Furthermore, in the special case of a potential game model, we establish the consistency between the team-optimal solution and the NE. Once the consistency condition is satisfied, the strategy deviation does not alter the total cost, and DMs do not face a strategic trade-off. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis through some simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Fast enumeration of effective mixed transports for recommending shipper collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on a form of joint transportation called mixed transportation and enumerate the combinations with high cooperation effects from among a number of transport lanes registered in a database (logistics big data). As a measure of the efficiency of mixed transportation, we consider the reduction rate that represents how much the total distance of loading trips is shortened by cooperation. The proposed algorithm instantly presents the set of all mixed transports with a reduction rate of a specified value or less. This algorithm is more than 7,000 times faster than simple brute force.</description>

      <title>Faster Rates for No-Regret Learning in General Games via Cautious Optimism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the first uncoupled learning algorithm that attains $O(n \log^2 d \log T)$ per-player regret in multi-player general-sum games, where $n$ is the number of players, $d$ is the number of actions available to each player, and $T$ is the number of repetitions of the game. Our results exponentially improve the dependence on $d$ compared to the $O(n\, d \log T)$ regret attainable by Log-Regularized Lifted Optimistic FTRL [Far+22c], and also reduce the dependence on the number of iterations $T$ from $\log^4 T$ to $\log T$ compared to Optimistic Hedge, the previously well-studied algorithm with $O(n \log d \log^4 T)$ regret [DFG21]. Our algorithm is obtained by combining the classic Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update (OMWU) with an adaptive, non-monotonic learning rate that paces the learning process of the players, making them more cautious when their regret becomes too negative.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Mean-variance Team Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a long-run mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where each agent shares a common mean-variance objective for the system and takes actions independently to maximize it. MV-TSG has two main challenges. First, the variance metric is neither additive nor Markovian in a dynamic setting. Second, simultaneous policy updates of all agents lead to a non-stationary environment for each individual agent. Both challenges make dynamic programming inapplicable. In this paper, we study MV-TSGs from the perspective of sensitivity-based optimization. The performance difference and performance derivative formulas for joint policies are derived, which provide optimization information for MV-TSGs. We prove the existence of a deterministic Nash policy for this problem. Subsequently, we propose a Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Policy Iteration (MV-MAPI) algorithm with a sequential update scheme, where individual agent policies are updated one by one in a given order. We prove that the MV-MAPI algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective function. By analyzing the local geometry of stationary points, we derive specific conditions for stationary points to be (local) Nash equilibria, and further, strict local optima. To solve large-scale MV-TSGs in scenarios with unknown environmental parameters, we extend the idea of trust region methods to MV-MAPI and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm named Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization (MV-MATRPO). We derive a performance lower bound for each update of joint policies. Finally, numerical experiments on energy management in multiple microgrid systems are conducted.</description>

      <title>Buyer-Initiated Auction Mechanism for Data Redemption in Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised privacy concerns over user data, leading to regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). With the essential toolbox provided by machine unlearning, AI service providers are now able to remove user data from their trained models as well as the training datasets, so as to comply with such regulations. However, extensive data redemption can be costly and degrade model accuracy. To balance the cost of unlearning and the privacy protection, we propose a buyer-initiated auction mechanism for data redemption, enabling the service provider to purchase data from willing users with appropriate compensation. This approach does not require the server to have any a priori knowledge about the users' privacy preference, and provides an efficient solution for maximizing the social welfare in the investigated problem.</description>

      <title>Robust Self-testing for Synchronous Correlations and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an abstract operator-algebraic characterization of robust self-testing for synchronous correlations and games. Specifically, we show that a synchronous correlation is a robust self-test if and only if there is a unique state on an appropriate $C^*$-algebra that "implements" the correlation. Extending this result, we prove that a synchronous game is a robust self-test if and only if its associated $C^*$-algebra admits a unique amenable tracial state. This framework allows us to establish that all synchronous correlations and games that serve as commuting operator self-tests for finite-dimensional strategies are also robust self-tests. As an application, we recover sufficient conditions for linear constraint system games to exhibit robust self-testing. We also demonstrate the existence of a synchronous nonlocal game that is a robust self-test but not a commuting operator self-test, showing that these notions are not equivalent.</description>

      <title>Learning in Quantum Common-Interest Games and the Separability Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning in games has emerged as a powerful tool for machine learning with numerous applications. Quantum games model interactions between strategic players who have access to quantum resources, and several recent works have studied {learning in} the competitive regime of quantum zero-sum games. Going beyond this setting, we introduce quantum common-interest games (CIGs) where players have density matrices as strategies and their interests are perfectly aligned. We bridge the gap between optimization and game theory by establishing the equivalence between KKT (first-order stationary) points of an instance of the Best Separable State (BSS) problem and the Nash equilibria of its corresponding quantum CIG. This allows learning dynamics for the quantum CIG to be seen as decentralized algorithms for the BSS problem. Taking the perspective of learning in games, we then introduce non-commutative extensions of the continuous-time replicator dynamics and the discrete-time best response dynamics/linear multiplicative weights update for learning in quantum CIGs. We prove analogues of classical convergence results of the dynamics and explore differences which arise in the quantum setting. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05657v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social choice theory with ordinal preferences, a voting method satisfies the axiom of positive involvement if adding to a preference profile a voter who ranks an alternative uniquely first cannot cause that alternative to go from winning to losing. In this note, we prove a new impossibility theorem concerning this axiom: there is no ordinal voting method satisfying positive involvement that also satisfies the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, resolvability, and a common invariance property for Condorcet methods, namely that the choice of winners depends only on the ordering of majority margins by size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A manager facing a task of unknown difficulty can propose a plan to let a worker undertake the task; the worker can either accept the proposal or reject it. The plan benefits the worker only when the task is sufficiently easy and benefits the manager only when it is sufficiently hard. The manager can conduct a test at no cost to acquire information about the difficulty of the task; however, she can misreport the test result to the worker. We find that it is optimal for the manager to conduct a threshold test and to propose the plan only when the difficulty of the task exceeds the threshold. Moreover, when the worker privately knows his capability, we find that the manager can benefit from screening the worker by offering up to two additional interval tests.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for the Assignment Game Beyond Additive Valuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The assignment game, introduced by Shapley and Shubik (1971), is a classic model for two-sided matching markets between buyers and sellers. In the original assignment game, it is assumed that payments lead to transferable utility and that buyers have unit-demand valuations for the items being sold. Two important and mostly independent lines of work have studied more general settings with imperfectly transferable utility and gross substitutes valuations. Multiple efficient algorithms have been proposed for computing a competitive equilibrium, the standard solution concept in assignment games, in these two settings. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for computing competitive equilibria in a setting with both imperfectly transferable utility and gross substitutes valuations. Our algorithm combines augmenting path techniques from maximum matching and algorithms for matroid intersection. We also show that, in a mild generalization of our model, computing a competitive equilibrium is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>ShapG: new feature importance method based on the Shapley value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With wide application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), it has become particularly important to make decisions of AI systems explainable and transparent. In this paper, we proposed a new Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method called ShapG (Explanations based on Shapley value for Graphs) for measuring feature importance. ShapG is a model-agnostic global explanation method. At the first stage, it defines an undirected graph based on the dataset, where nodes represent features and edges are added based on calculation of correlation coefficients between features. At the second stage, it calculates an approximated Shapley value by sampling the data taking into account this graph structure. The sampling approach of ShapG allows to calculate the importance of features efficiently, i.e. to reduce computational complexity. Comparison of ShapG with other existing XAI methods shows that it provides more accurate explanations for two examined datasets. We also compared other XAI methods developed based on cooperative game theory with ShapG in running time, and the results show that ShapG exhibits obvious advantages in its running time, which further proves efficiency of ShapG. In addition, extensive experiments demonstrate a wide range of applicability of the ShapG method for explaining complex models. We find ShapG an important tool in improving explainability and transparency of AI systems and believe it can be widely used in various fields.</description>
