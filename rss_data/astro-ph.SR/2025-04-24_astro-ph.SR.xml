      <title>Stellar ejection velocities from the binary supernova scenario: A comparison across population synthesis codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of binary systems are disrupted at the moment of the first supernova, resulting in an unbound compact object and companion star. These ejected companion stars contribute to the observed population of runaway stars. Therefore, an understanding of their ejection velocities is essential to interpreting observations, particularly in the Gaia era of high-precision astronomy.
  We present a comparison of the predicted ejection velocities of disrupted binary companions in three different population synthesis codes: COSMIC, COMPAS, and binary_c, which use two independent algorithms for the treatment of natal kicks. We confirm that, despite the codes producing different pre-supernova evolution from the same initial conditions, they each find the ejection velocities of secondary stars from disrupted binaries are narrowly distributed about their pre-supernova orbital velocity. We additionally include a correction to the derivation included in Kiel &amp; Hurley 2009 that brings it into agreement with methods from other works for determining post-supernova binary orbital parameters. During this comparison, we identified and resolved bugs in the kick prescriptions of \textit{all three} codes we considered, highlighting how open-science practices and code comparisons are essential for addressing implementation issues.</description>

      <title>An efficient method for magnetic field extrapolation based on a family of analytical three-dimensional magnetohydrostatic equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With current observational methods it is not possible to directly measure the magnetic field in the solar corona with sufficient accuracy. Therefore, coronal magnetic field models have to rely on extrapolation methods using photospheric magnetograms as boundary conditions. In recent years, due to the increased resolution of observations and the need to resolve non-force-free lower regions of the solar atmosphere, there have been increased efforts to use magnetohydrostatic (MHS) field models instead of force-free extrapolation methods. Although numerical methods to calculateMHS solutions can deal with non-linear problems and hence provide more accurate models, analytical three-dimensional MHS equilibria can also be used as a numerically relatively "cheap" complementary method. In this paper, we present an extrapolation method based on a family of analytical MHS equilibria that allows for a transition from a non-force-free region to a force-free region. We demonstrate how asymptotic forms of the solutions can help to increase the numerical efficiency of the method. Through both artificial boundary condition testing and a first application to observational</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Bayesian inference of natal kicks from inert black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The emerging population of inert black hole binaries (BHBs) provides a unique opportunity to constrain black hole (BH) formation physics. These systems are composed of a stellar-mass BH in a wide orbit around a non-degenerate star with no observed Xray emission. Inert BHBs allow for narrow constraints to be inferred on the natal kick and mass loss during BH-forming core-collapse events. Aims. In anticipation of the upcoming BLOeM survey, we aim to provide tight constraints on BH natal kicks by exploiting the full parameter space obtained from combined spectroscopic and astrometric data to characterize the orbits of inert BHBs. Multi-epoch spectroscopy from the BLOeM project will provide measurements of periods, eccentricities, and radial velocities for inert BHBs in the SMC, which complements Gaia astrometric observations of proper motions. Methods. We present a Bayesian parameter estimation framework to infer natal kicks and mass loss during core-collapse from inert BHBs, accounting for all available observables, including the systemic velocity and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. The framework further allows for circumstances when some of the observables are unavailable, such as for the distant BLOeM sources which preclude resolved orbits. Results. With our new framework, we are able to distinguish between BH formation channels, even in the absence of a resolved orbit. In cases when the pre-explosion orbit can be assumed to be circular, we precisely recover the parameters of the core-collapse, highlighting the importance of understanding the eccentricity landscape of pre-explosion binaries, both theoretically and observationally. Treating the near-circular, inert BHB, VFTS 243, as a representative of the anticipated BLOeM systems, we constrain the natal kick to less than 27 km/s and the mass loss to less than 2.9 Msun within a 90% credible interval.</description>

      <title>On the origin of long-term modulation in the Sun's magnetic activity cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most striking manifestations of orderly behavior emerging out of complex interactions in any astrophysical system is the 11-year cycle of sunspots. However, direct sunspot observations and reconstructions of long-term solar activity clearly exhibit amplitude fluctuations beyond the decadal timescale -- which may be termed as supradecadal modulation. Whether this long-term modulation in the Sun's magnetic activity results from nonlinear mechanisms or stochastic perturbations remains controversial and a matter of active debate. Utilizing multi-millennial scale kinematic dynamo simulations based on the Babcock-Leighton paradigm -- in the likely (near-critical) regime of operation of the solar dynamo -- we demonstrate that this supradecadal modulation in solar activity cannot be explained by nonlinear mechanisms alone; stochastic forcing is essential for the manifestation of observed long-term fluctuations in the near-critical dynamo regime. Our findings substantiate some independent observational and theoretical investigations, and provide additional insights into temporal dynamics associated with a plethora of natural phenomena in astronomy and planetary systems arising from weakly nonlinear, non-deterministic processes.</description>

      <title>V4141 Sgr: Outflows and repeated outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the ongoing brightening of the poorly studied symbiotic star V4141 Sgr and examine its long-term variability. We present new low-resolution spectroscopic observations of the system in its bright state and combine them with multi-color photometric data from our observations, ASAS-SN, ATLAS, and Gaia DR3. To investigate its long-term evolution, we also incorporate historical data, including photographic plates, constructing a light curve spanning more than a century. Our analysis reveals that V4141 Sgr has undergone multiple outbursts, with at least one exhibiting characteristics typical of "slow" symbiotic novae. The current outburst is characterized by the ejection of optically thick material and possibly bipolar jets, a phenomenon observed in only a small fraction of symbiotic stars. These findings establish V4141 Sgr as an intriguing target for continued monitoring.</description>

      <title>Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XXIII. The F-type twin system RZ Chamaeleontis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RZ Cha is a detached eclipsing binary containing two slightly evolved F5 stars in a circular orbit of period 2.832 d. We use new light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and spectroscopic orbits from Gaia DR3 to measure the physical properties of the component stars. We obtain masses of 1.488 +/- 0.011 Msun and 1.482 +/- 0.011 Msun, and radii of 2.150 +/- 0.006 Rsun and 2.271 +/- 0.006 Rsun. An orbital ephemeris from the TESS data does not match published times of mid-eclipse from the 1970s, suggesting the period is not constant. We measure a distance to the system of 176.7 +/- 3.7 pc, which agrees with the Gaia DR3 value. A comparison with theoretical models finds agreement for metal abundances of Z = 0.014 and Z = 0.017 and an age of 2.3 Gyr. No evidence for pulsations was found in the light curves. Future data from TESS and Gaia will provide more precise masses and constraints on any changes in orbital period.</description>

      <title>Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XXIV. The delta Scuti pulsator V596 Pup (formerly known as VV Pyx)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V596 Pup is a detached eclipsing binary containing two A1 V stars in a 4.596 d period orbit with a small eccentricity and apsidal motion, previously designated as VV Pyxidis. We use new light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and published radial velocities to determine the physical properties of the component stars. We find masses of 2.098 +/- 0.021 Msun and 2.091 +/- 0.018 Msun, and radii of 2.179 +/- 0.008 Rsun and 2.139 +/- 0.007 Rsun. The measured distance to the system is affected by the light from a nearby companion star; we obtain 178.4 +/- 2.5 pc. The properties of the system are best matched by theoretical predictions for a subsolar metallicity of Z = 0.010 and an age of 570 Myr. We measure seven significant pulsation frequencies from the light curve, six of which are consistent with delta Scuti pulsations and one of which is likely of slowly-pulsating B-star type.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic stars in the era of modern ground- and space-based surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars, interacting binaries composed of a cool giant and a hot compact companion, exhibit complex variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Over the past decades, large-scale photometric and spectroscopic surveys from ground- and space-based observatories have significantly advanced their discovery and characterization. These datasets have transformed the search for new symbiotic candidates, providing extensive time-domain information crucial for their classification and analysis. This review highlights recent observational results that have expanded the known population of symbiotic stars, refined classification criteria, and enhanced our understanding of their variability. Despite these advances, fundamental questions remain regarding their long-term evolution, mass transfer and accretion processes, or their potential role as progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. With ongoing and upcoming surveys, the coming years promise new discoveries and a more comprehensive picture of these intriguing interacting systems.</description>

      <title>An accreting dwarf star orbiting the S-type giant star pi1 Gru</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to characterize the properties of the inner companion of the S-type AGB star pi1 Gru, and to identify plausible future evolution scenarios for this triple system. Methods. We observed pi1 Gru with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE. In addition, we collected archival photometry data and used the Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. We derive the best orbital parameters from Bayesian inference. Results. The inner companion, pi1 Gru C was located at 37.4 +/- 2.0 mas from the primary in June-July 2019 (projected separation of 6.05 +/- 0.55 au at 161.7 +/- 11.7 pc). The best orbital solution gives a companion mass of 0.86 (+0.22/-0.20) Msun (using the derived mass of the primary), and a semi-major axis of 7.05 (+0.54/-0.57) au. This leads to an orbital period of 11.0 (+1.7/-1.5) yr. The best solution is an elliptical orbit with eccentricity e = 0.35 (+0.18/-0.17), but a circular orbit cannot be totally excluded. The close companion can either be a K1V (F9.5V/K7V) star or a white dwarf. The ultraviolet and millimeter continuum photometry are consistent with the presence of an accretion disk around the close companion. The ultraviolet emission could then either originate in hot spots in an overall cooler disk, or also from a hot disk in case the companion is a white dwarf. Conclusions. Though the close companion and the AGB star are interacting, and an accretion disk is observed around the companion, the mass-accretion rate is too low to cause a Ia supernova but could produce novae every ~900 yr. Short wavelength spatially resolved observations are needed to further constrain the nature of the C companion. Searches for close-in companions similar to this system will help to better understand the physics of mass- and angular-momentum transfer, and orbital evolution in the late evolutionary stages.</description>

      <title>Magnetorotational instability in a solar mean-field dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question whether the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) can operate in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun and how it affects the interaction with the dynamo process. Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field, but in our Cartesian cases it is found to reduce the resulting magnetic field strength and thus to suppress the dynamo process. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.</description>

      <title>Colors and Dynamics of a Near-Sun Orbital Asteroid Family: 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observed the dynamically similar near-Sun asteroids 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1 for their optical colors. These objects have the lowest known semi-major axes of any asteroids. 2021 PH27 has the largest general relativistic effects of any known solar system object. The small semi-major axis and very close passage to the Sun suggests the extreme thermal and gravitational environment should highly modify these asteroids' surfaces. From g', r', i' and z'-band imaging, we find the colors of 2021 PH27 to be between the two major asteroid types the S and C classes (g'-r'= 0.58 +- 0.02, r'-i'=0.12 +- 0.02 and i'-z'=-0.08 +- 0.05 mags). With a spectral slope of 6.8 +-0.03 percent per 100nm, 2021 PH27 is a X-type asteroid and requires albedo or spectral features to further identify its composition. We find the dynamically similar 2025 GN1 also has very similar colors (g'-r'=0.55 +-0.06 and r'-i'=0.14 +-0.04) as 2021 PH27, suggesting these objects are fragments from a once larger parent asteroid or 2021 PH27 is shedding material. The colors are not blue like some other near-Sun asteroids such as 3200 Phaethon that have been interpreted to be from the loss of reddening substances from the extreme temperatures. There is no evidence of activity or a large amplitude period for 2021 PH27, whereas 2025 GN1 might have a more significant rotational light curve. 2025 GN1 may have a very close encounter or hit Venus in about 2155 years and likely separated from 2021 PH27 in about the last 10 kyrs.</description>

      <title>Turbulent heating in collisionless low-beta plasmas: imbalance, Landau damping, and electron-ion energy partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An understanding of how turbulent energy is partitioned between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for modelling many astrophysical systems. Using theory and simulations of a four-dimensional reduced model of low-beta gyrokinetics (the `Kinetic Reduced Electron Heating Model'), we investigate the dependence of collisionless heating processes on plasma beta and imbalance (normalised cross-helicity). These parameters are important because they control the helicity barrier, the formation of which divides the parameter space into two distinct regimes with remarkably different properties. In the first, at lower beta and/or imbalance, the absence of a helicity barrier allows the cascade of injected power to proceed to small (perpendicular) scales, but its slow cascade rate makes it susceptible to significant electron Landau damping, in some cases leading to a marked steepening of the magnetic spectra on scales above the ion Larmor radius. In the second, at higher beta and/or imbalance, the helicity barrier halts the cascade, confining electron Landau damping to scales above the steep `transition-range' spectral break, resulting in dominant ion heating. We formulate quantitative models of these processes that compare well to simulations in each regime, and combine them with results of previous studies to construct a simple formula for the electron-ion heating ratio as a function of beta and imbalance. This model predicts a `winner takes all' picture of low-beta plasma heating, where a small change in the fluctuations' properties at large scales (the imbalance) can cause a sudden switch between electron and ion heating.</description>

Abstract: Context: Dimethyl sulfide (DMS; CH$_3$SCH$_3$) is an organosulfur compound that has been suggested as a potential biosignature in exoplanetary atmospheres. In addition to its tentative detections toward the sub-Neptune planet K2-18b, DMS has been detected in the coma of the 67/P comet and toward the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. However, its formation routes have not been characterized yet.
  Aims: In this work, we have investigated three gas-phase reactions (CH$_3$SH + CH$_3$OH$_2^+$, CH$_3$OH + CH$_3$SH$_2^+$, and the CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association), aiming at characterizing DMS formation routes in shocked molecular clouds and star-forming regions.
  Methods: We have performed dedicated quantum and kinetics calculations to evaluate the reaction rate coefficients as a function of temperature to be included in astrochemical models.
  Results: Among the investigated processes, the reaction between methanethiol (CH$_3$SH) and protonated methanol (CH$_3$OH$_2^+$)(possibly followed by a gentle proton transfer to ammonia) is a compelling candidate to explain the formation of DMS in the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association does not seem to be a very efficient process, with the exclusion of cold clouds, provided that the thiomethoxy radical (CH$_3$S) is available.
  This work does not deal directly with the possible formation of DMS in the atmosphere of exoplanets. However, it clearly indicates that there are efficient abiotic formation routes of this interesting species.</description>

      <title>Rotating neutron stars: anisotropy model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build slowly rotating anisotropic neutron stars using the Hartle-Thorne formalism, employing three distinct anisotropy models--Horvat, Bowers-Liang, and a covariant model--to characterize the relationship between radial and tangential pressure. We analyze how anisotropy influences stellar properties such as the mass-radius relation, angular momentum, moment of inertia, and binding energy. Our findings reveal that the maximum stable mass of non-rotating stars depends strongly on the anisotropy model, with some configurations supporting up to 60% more mass than their isotropic counterparts with the same central density. This mass increase is most pronounced in the models where the anisotropy grows toward the star's surface, as seen in the covariant model. Furthermore, slowly rotating anisotropic stars adhere to universal relations for the moment of inertia and binding energy, regardless of the chosen anisotropy model or equation of state.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>

      <title>Thermal Evolution and Mass Loss on Short-Period, Low-Mass Planets During FU Orionis Outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-short-period (USP) planets represent a unique class of exoplanets characterized by their tight orbits and relatively low masses, with some also exhibiting unusually high iron fractions. Previous work (Becker et al, 2021) proposed a dynamical pathway wherein planets can migrate inward due to drag from sub-Keplerian gas during episodic FU Orionis (FU Ori) outbursts, an abrupt accretion phenomenon exhibited by young stellar objects, thereby potentially populating USP orbits. However, the implications of this migration process on the structural and compositional evolution of these planets remain unexplored. In this work, we model the response of a planet's surface material to the high disk temperatures characteristic of an FU Ori event and compute the fraction of an Earth-like planet's mass that will be lost due to vaporization and subsequent turbulent diffusion of gaseous molecules during the FU Ori event. We find that low-mass planets may lose a substantial fraction of their mantle mass during FU Ori events, potentially contributing to the observed prevalence of low-mass, iron-rich USP planets.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Observations of a Small-Scale Cancellation Nanoflare: Supporting Evidence for the Cancellation Nanoflare Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytical cancellation nanoflare model has recently been established to show the fundamental role that ubiquitous small-scale cancellation nanoflares play in solar atmospheric heating. Although this model is well-supported by simulations, observational evidence is needed to deepen our understanding of cancellation nanoflares. We present observations of a small-scale cancellation nanoflare event, analyzing its magnetic topology evolution, triggers, and physical parameters. Using coordinated observations from Solar Dynamics Observatory and Goode Solar Telescope, we identify a photospheric flow-driven cancellation event with a flux cancellation rate of ~10^{15} Mx/s and a heating rate of 8.7 x 10^6 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The event shows the characteristic transition from $\pi$-shaped to X-shaped magnetic configuration before forming a two arcsecs current sheet, closely matching model predictions. This event provides critical observational support for the cancellation nanoflare model and its role in solar atmospheric heating.</description>

      <title>On the age distribution of Classical Cepheids in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the positive correlation between age and Galactocentric distance seen in Galactic Classical Cepheids, which at first sight may seem counter-intuitive in the context of inside-out galaxy formation. To explain it, we use the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model and a simulation of star particles in the Galactic disc coupled with stellar evolutionary models. We then select Classical Cepheids from this simulation and test in qualitative terms which ingredients are necessary to find agreement with the observational data. We show that the interplay of the Galactic disc's metallicity gradient and the metallicity dependence of the Cepheids' life-time in the instability strip results in a pronounced positive age-Galactocentric distance relation. This renders a reconstruction of the recent star-formation history based on Classical Cepheids unrealistic. It also has important consequences on our interpretation of the observed scatter about the radial metallicity gradient measured with Galactic Classical Cepheids.</description>
