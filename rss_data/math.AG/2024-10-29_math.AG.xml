      <title>Moduli spaces of curves with polynomial point counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the number of curves of a fixed genus g over finite fields is a polynomial function of the size of the field if and only if g is at most 8. Furthermore, we determine for each positive genus g the smallest n such that the moduli space of curves of genus g with n marked points does not have polynomial point count. A key ingredient in the proofs, which is also a new result of independent interest, is the computation of the thirteenth cohomology group of the moduli spaces of stable curves of genus g with n marked points, for all g and n.</description>

      <title>Towards Cohomology of Real Closed Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown by Claus Scheiderer prior to 1994 that real closed spaces have \'{e}tale cohomology. Following Scheiderer, study of real closed spaces fell out of fashion and o-minimal geometry became the focus for those at the intersection of model theory and geometry. I decided to breathe new life into the theory of real closed rings and spaces, as studied by Schwartz in 1989. In Section 1, I build the fundamentals of the theory using as little machinery as possible, and presented them as clearly as I could. Hidden gems include a full proof that real closed rings are closed under limits and colimits. In Section 2, I give an introduction to the category of real closed spaces in the first half. In the second half, I construct an equivalence of topoi between Scheiderer's sheaves on the real \'{e}tale site, and sheaves on a real \'{e}tale site $\rce/X$ of my creation. Since $\text{Sh}(\rce/X)$ can be defined without the use of $G$-topoi, the equivalence of topoi renders Scheiderer's theory computable. I end with a discussion of how one might use motivic cohomology to better understand recent results of Annette Huber in \cite{no_deRham_huber}.</description>

      <title>A toric degeneration of Kronecker moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that there is a finite SAGBI basis of the coordinate ring of a Kronecker quiver moduli space, indexed by primitive semi-standard tableaux pairs. This induces a toric degeneration of the Kronecker moduli space to a normal toric variety, a generalization of the toric degeneration of the Grassmannian to the Gelfand--Cetlin polytope constructed by Gonciulea--Lakshmibai. The moment polytope of the degenerate toric variety can be described as the intersection of two Gelfand--Cetlin polytopes. We explain when this can be generalized to degenerations coming from matching fields.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of the Bethe ansatz equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes are devoted to the recent progress in the geometric aspects of quantum integrable systems based on quantum groups solved using the Bethe ansatz technique. One part is devoted to their enumerative geometry realization through the quantum K-theory of Nakajima quiver varieties. The other part describes a recently studied $q$-deformation of the correspondence between oper connections and Gaudin models. The notes are based on a minicourse at C.I.M.E. Summer School ``Enumerative geometry, quantisation and moduli spaces," September 04-08, 2023.</description>

      <title>A transfer principle for unirationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply ideas related to the strength of polynomials to provide new cases of unirational hypersurfaces. It is famously known that hypersurfaces that are smooth in very high codimension are unirational, and a simple corollary then implies that any polynomial of sufficiently high strength will give rise to a unirational hypersurface. Our main result shows that unirationality is preserved under a substitution of high collective strength. In particular, we prove that polynomials of sufficiently high secondary strength are unirational. Along the way, we introduce a ``transfer principle,'' showing that polynomials of high collective strength have Fano schemes defined by polynomials of high collective strength. This gives an alternate proof of a result of Xi Chen on unirationality of Fano schemes, and proves a weakened form of the de Jong-Debarre Conjecture. Combined with some ideas of Starr, this implies a version of Kazhdan and Ziegler's result about the universality of complete intersections of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Complete Families of Generic Covers of Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and motivate a conjecture about the existence of complete, 1-dimensional families of covers of an elliptic curve. If the conjecture holds, then it would imply a uniform lower bound of 5 for slope of the moduli space of curves. If the conjecture fails, this would itself be an interesting phenomenon worthy of explanation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the symmetric rank of products of linear forms and an irreducible quadratic form. The main result presents a new, non-trivial lower bound for the rank, and the arguments rely on the apolarity lemma. In the special case of degree 4, we give a list of normal forms for such quartics, and we apply our general result to compute the rank of almost all of them. These families of quartics provide examples of polynomials of generic, supergeneric and even maximal rank, as well as an unexpected number of decompositions.</description>

      <title>Derived equivalence for the simple flop of type $D_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every simple flop of type $D_5$, i.e. resolved by blowups with exceptional divisor isomorphic to a generalized Grassmann bundle with fiber $OG(4, 10)$, induces a derived equivalence. This provides new evidence for the DK conjecture of Bondal--Orlov and Kawamata. The proof is based on a sequence of mutations of exceptional objects: we use the same argument to prove derived equivalence for some pairs of non birational Calabi--Yau fivefolds in $OG(5, 10)$, related to Manivel's double--spinor Calabi--Yau varieties. We extend the construction to prove derived equivalence of Calabi--Yau fibrations which are described as zero loci in some generalized Grassmann bundles.</description>

      <title>Beauville-Laszlo gluing of algebraic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a complete discrete valuation field $K$, we show that one may always glue a separated formal algebraic space $\mathfrak{X}$ over $\mathcal{O}_K$ to a separated algebraic space $U$ over $K$ along an open immersion of rigid spaces $j\colon \mathfrak{X}^{\rm rig}\to U^{\rm an}$, producing a separated algebraic space $X$ over $\mathcal{O}_K$. This process gives rise to an equivalence between such `gluing triples' $(U,\mathfrak{X},j)$ and separated algebraic spaces $X$ over $\mathcal{O}_K$, which one might interpret as a version of the Beauville--Laszlo theorem for algebraic spaces rather than coherent sheaves. Moreover, an analogous equivalence exists over any excellent base. Examples due to Matsumoto imply that the result of such a gluing might be a genuine algebraic space (not a scheme) even if $U$ and the special fiber of $\mathfrak{X}$ are projective. The proof is a combination of Nagata compactification theorem for algebraic spaces and of Artin's contraction theorem. We give multiple examples and applications of this idea.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define spin structures on perfect complexes outside of characteristic two, generalizing the usual notion for vector bundles. We give an explicit local characterization of spin structures, and show that for an oriented quadratic complex $E$ on an algebraic stack, spin structures on $E$ are parametrized by a degree $2$ gerbe. As an application, we show how to lift the K-theory class of Oh-Thomas in DT4 theory to a genuine (twisted) sheaf.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of Hurwitz degenerations and tropical realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the realizability of balanced functions on tropical curves, establishing new sufficient criteria for superabundant functions on genus two curves, analogous to the well-spacedness condition in genus one. We find that realizability is sensitive to the precise locations of conjugate and Weierstrass points on the tropical curve. The key input is a combinatorial comparison of semistable limit theorems for maps of curves. Amini-Baker-Brugall\'e-Rabinoff previously showed that realizability of functions is equivalent to ``modifiability'' to a tropical admissible cover. The resulting criteria are typically inexplicit; we develop combinatorial techniques to derive explicit, verifiable criteria from these. We then develop a dimensional reduction technique to deduce statements about maps to $\mathbb{R}^r$ from ones about maps to $\mathbb{R}$. By proving directly that modifiability and well-spacedness are equivalent in genus one, we obtain a new proof that well-spaced maps are realizable. Along the way, we explain how the modifiability criterion can be viewed as a comparison result for properness statements for moduli of relative maps and admissible covers.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study a relative monoidal version of the Bondal-Orlov reconstruction theorem. We establish an uniqueness result for tensor triangulated category structures $(\boxtimes,\mathbb{1})$ on the derived category $D^{b}(X)$ of a variety $X$ which is smooth projective and faithfully flat over a quasi-compact quasi-separated base scheme $S$ in the case where the fibers $X_{s}$ over any point $s\in S$ all have ample (anti-)canonical bundles. To do so we construct a stack $\Gamma$ of dg-bifunctors which parametrize the local homotopical behaviour of $\boxtimes$, and we study some of its properties around the derived categories of the fibers $X_{s}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare a couple of notions of differential form on singular complex algebraic varieties, and relate them to the outermost associated graded spaces of the Hodge filtration of ordinary and intersection cohomology. In particular, we introduce and study singularities, that we call quasi-rational, which are normal and such that for all p, the zeroth cohomology sheaf of the complex of Du Bois p-forms is isomorphic to the direct image of p-forms from a desingularization. We show that an isolated singularity is rational if and only if it is quasi-rational, Du Bois, and certain Hodge numbers of the local mixed Hodge structures vanish.</description>

      <title>The N\'eron model of a higher-dimensional Lagrangian fibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\pi : X \to B$ be a projective Lagrangian fibration of a smooth symplectic variety $X$ to a smooth variety $B$. Denote the complement of the discriminant locus by $B_0 = B \setminus \operatorname{Disc}(\pi)$, its preimage by $X_0 = \pi^{-1}(B_0)$, and the complement of the critical locus by $X' = X \setminus \operatorname{Sing}(\pi)$. Under an assumption that the morphism $X' \to B$ is surjective, we construct (1) the N\'eron model of the abelian fibration $\pi_0 : X_0 \to B_0$ and (2) the N\'eron model of its automorphism abelian scheme $\operatorname{Aut}^{\circ}_{\pi_0} \to B_0$. Contrary to the case of elliptic fibrations, $X'$ may not be the N\'eron model of $X_0$; this is precisely because of the existence of flops in higher-dimensional symplectic varieties. Using such techniques, we analyze when $X' \to B$ is a torsor under a smooth group scheme and also revisit some known results in literature.</description>

      <title>A Eudoxian study of discriminant curves associated to normal surface singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(f,g): (S,s) \to (\mathbb{C}^2, 0)$ be a finite morphism from a germ of normal complex analytic surface to the germ of $\mathbb{C}^2$ at the origin. We show that the affine algebraic curve in $\mathbb{C}^2$ defined by the initial Newton polynomial of a defining series of the discriminant germ of $(f,g)$ depends up to toric automorphisms only on the germs of curves defined by $f$ and $g$. This result generalizes a theorem of Gryszka, Gwo\'zdziewicz and Parusi\'nski, which is the special case in which $(S,s)$ is smooth. Our proof uses a common generalization of formulas of L\^e and Casas-Alvero for the intersection number of the discriminant with a germ of plane curve. It uses also a theorem of Delgado and Maugendre characterizing the special members of pencils of curves on normal surface singularities. We apply it to the pencils generated by all pairs $(f^b, g^a)$, for varying positive integral exponents $a, b$, following a strategy initiated by Gwo\'zdziewicz. This is similar to the Eudoxian method of comparison of magnitudes by comparing the sizes of their positive integral multiples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that in regular $F$-finite rings of positive characteristic, the Bernstein-Sato root set of the tensor product of ideals is the union of their respective Bernstein-Sato root sets. Moreover, by computing some special $F$-thresholds, we provide an explicit description about the Bernstein-Sato roots of a weighted homogeneous polynomial with an isolated singularity at the origin in positive characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an affine algebraic variety, we introduce algebraic Gelfand-Fuks cohomology of polynomial vector fields with coefficients in differentiable $AV$-modules. Its complex is given by cochains that are differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck. Using the jets of vector fields, we compute this cohomology for varieties with uniformizing parameters. We prove that in this case, Gelfand-Fuks cohomology with coefficients in a tensor module decomposes as a tensor product of the de Rham cohomology of the variety and the cohomology of the Lie algebra of vector fields on affine space, vanishing at the origin. We explicitly compute this cohomology for affine space, the torus, and Krichever-Novikov algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.03461v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Torsors under affine groups are generalized in the super context by super-torsors under affine super-groups. We investigate those super-torsors by using Hopf-algebra language and techniques. It is explicitly shown, under suitable assumptions, that every super-torsor arises from an ordinary torsor. Especially, the objects with affinity restriction, or namely, the affine super-torsors and the affine ordinary torsors are shown to be precisely in one-to-one correspondence. The results play substantial roles in ongoing construction of super-symmetric Picard-Vessiot theory.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Bring's curve in any characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p\ge 7$ be a prime, and $m\ge 5$ an integer. A natural generalization of Bring's curve valid over any field $\mathbb{K}$ of zero characteristic or positive characteristic $p$, is the algebraic variety $V$ of $\textrm{PG}(m-1,\mathbb{K})$ which is the complete intersection of the projective algebraic hypersurfaces of homogeneous equations $x_1^k+\cdots +x_m^{k}=0$ with $1\leq k\leq m-2$. In positive characteristic, we also assume $m\le p-1$. Up to a change of coordinates in $\textrm{PG}(m-1,\mathbb{K})$, we show that $V$ is a projective, absolutely irreducible, non-singular curve of $\textrm{PG}(m-2,\mathbb{K})$ with degree $(m-2)!$, genus $\mathfrak{g}= \frac{1}{4} ((m-2)(m-3)-4)(m-2)!+1$, and tame automorphism group $G$ isomorphic to $\textrm{Sym}_m$. We compute the genera of the quotient curves of $V$ with respect to the stabilizers of one or more coordinates under the action of $G$. In positive characteristic, the two extremal cases, $m=5$ and $m=p-1$ are investigated further. For $m=5$, we show that there exist infinitely many primes $p$ such that $V$ is $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$-maximal curve of genus $4$. The smallest such primes are $29,59,149,239,839$. For $m=p-1$ we prove that $V$ has as many as $(p-2)!$ points over $\mathbb{F}_p$ and has no further points over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. We also point out a connection with previous work of R\'edei about the famous Minkowski conjecture proven by Haj\'os (1941), as well as with a more recent result of Rodr\'iguez Villegas, Voloch and Zagier (2001) on plane curves attaining the St\"ohr-Voloch bound, and the regular sequence problem for systems of diagonal equations introduced by Conca, Krattenthaler and Watanabe (2009).</description>

      <title>On Bruhat-Tits theory over a higher dimensional base</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09431v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a perfect field. Assume that the characteristic of $k$ satisfies certain tameness assumptions \eqref{tameness}. Let $\mathcal O_{_n} := k\llbracket z_{_1}, \ldots, z_{_n}\rrbracket$ and set $K_{_n} := \text{Fract}~\cO_{_n}$. Let $G$ be an almost-simple, simply-connected affine Chevalley group scheme with a maximal torus $T$ and a Borel subgroup $B$. Given a $n$-tuple ${\bf f} = (f_{_1}, \ldots, f_{_n})$ of concave functions on the root system of $G$ as in Bruhat-Tits \cite{bruhattits1}, \cite{bruhattits}, we define {\it {\tt n}-bounded subgroups ${\tt P}_{_{\bf f}}\subset G(K_{_n})$} as a direct generalization of Bruhat-Tits groups for the case $n=1$. We show that these groups are {\it schematic}, i.e. they are valued points of smooth {\em quasi-affine} (resp. {\em affine}) group schemes with connected fibres and {\it adapted to the divisor with normal crossing $z_1 \cdots z_n =0$} in the sense that the restriction to the generic point of the divisor $z_i=0$ is given by $f_i$ (resp. sums of concave functions given by points of the apartment). This provides a higher-dimensional analogue of the Bruhat-Tits group schemes with natural specialization properties. In \S\ref{mixedstuff}, under suitable assumptions on $k$ \S \ref{charassum}, we extend all these results for a $n+1$-tuple ${\bf f} = (f_{_0}, \ldots, f_{_n})$ of concave functions on the root system of $G$ replacing $\mathcal O_{_n}$ by ${\cO} \llbracket x_{_1},\cdots,x_{_n} \rrbracket$ where $\cO$ is a complete discrete valuation ring with a perfect residue field $k$ of characteristic $p$. In the last part of the paper, we give applications in char zero to constructing certain natural group schemes on wonderful embeddings of groups and also certain families of {\tt 2-parahoric} group schemes on minimal resolutions of surface singularities that arose in \cite{balaproc}.</description>

      <title>Extensions of tautological rings and motivic structures in the cohomology of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study collections of subrings of $H^*(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$ that are closed under the tautological operations that map cohomology classes on moduli spaces of smaller dimension to those on moduli spaces of larger dimension and contain the tautological subrings. Such extensions of tautological rings are well-suited for inductive arguments and flexible enough for a wide range of applications. In particular, we confirm predictions of Chenevier and Lannes for the $\ell$-adic Galois representations and Hodge structures that appear in $H^k(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$ for $k = 13$, $14$, and $15$. We also show that $H^4(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$ is generated by tautological classes for all $g$ and $n$, confirming a prediction of Arbarello and Cornalba from the 1990s. In order to establish the final bases cases needed for the inductive proofs of our main results, we use Mukai's construction of canonically embedded pentagonal curves of genus 7 as linear sections of an orthogonal Grassmannian and a decomposition of the diagonal to show that the pure weight cohomology of $\mathcal{M}_{7,n}$ is generated by algebraic cycle classes, for $n \leq 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Koll\'{a}r-Matsusaka's Riemann-Roch type inequalities, applying effective very ampleness of adjoint bundles on Fujita conjecture and log-concavity given by Khovanskii-Teissier inequalities, we show that for any partition $\lambda$ of the positive integer $d$ there exists a universal bivariate polynomial $Q_\lambda(x, y)$ which has deg $Q \leq d$ and whose coefficients depend only on $n$, such that for any projective manifold $X$ of dimension $n$ and any ample line bundle $L$ on $X$, \begin{equation*}
  \left|c_\lambda(X)\cdot L^{n -d}\right|\leq
  \frac{Q_{\lambda}(L^{n}, K_X \cdot L^{n -1} )}{(L^{n})^{d-1}}, \end{equation*} where $K_X$ is the canonical bundle of $X$ and $c_\lambda(X)$ is the monomial Chern class given by the partition $\lambda$. As a special case, when $K_X$ or $-K_X$ is ample, this implies that there exists a constant $c_n$ depending only on $n$ such that for any monomial Chern classes of top degree, the Chern number ratios \begin{equation*} \left|\frac{c_\lambda(X)}{c_1 (X) ^{n}}\right|\leq c_n, \end{equation*} which recovers a recent result of Du-Sun. The main result also yields an asymptotic version of the sharper Riemann-Roch type inequality. Furthermore, using similar method we also obtain inequalities for Chern classes of the logarithmic tangent bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of relative tangency for projective algebraic varieties. The dual variety $X_Z^\vee$ of a variety $X$ relative to a subvariety $Z$ is the set of hyperplanes tangent to $X$ at a point of $Z$. We also introduce the concept of polar classes of $X$ relative to $Z$. We explore the duality of varieties of low rank matrices relative to special linear sections. In this framework, we study the critical points of the Euclidean Distance function from a data point to $X$, lying on $Z$. The locus where the number of such conditional critical points is positive is called the ED data locus of $X$ given $Z$. The generic number of such critical points defines the conditional ED degree of $X$ given $Z$. We show the irreducibility of ED data loci, and we compute their dimensions and degrees in terms of relative characteristic classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This text surveys cohomological properties of pairs $(U,f)$ consisting of a smooth complex quasi-projective variety $U$ together with a regular function on~it. On the one hand, one tries to mimic the case of a germ of holomorphic function in its Milnor ball and, on the other hand, one takes advantage of the algebraicity of~$U$ and $f$ to apply technique of algebraic geometry, in particular Hodge theory. The monodromy properties are expressed by means of tools provided by the theory of linear differential equations, by mimicking the Stokes phenomenon. In the case of tame functions on smooth affine varieties, which is an algebraic analogue of that of a holomorphic function with an isolated critical point, the theory simplifies much and the formulation of the results are nicer. Examples of such tame functions are exhibited.</description>

      <title>Fourier Quasicrystals on $\mathbb R^n$ Preliminary Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper has three aims. First, for $n \geq 1$ we construct a family of real-rooted trigonometric polynomial maps $P : \mathbb C^n \mapsto \mathbb C^n$ whose divisors are Fourier Quasicrystals (FQ). For $n = 1$ these divisors include the first nontrivial FQ with positive integer coefficients constructed by Kurasov and Sarnak \cite{kurasovsarnak}, and for $n &gt; 1$ they overlap with Meyer's curved model sets \cite{meyer6} and two-dimensional \cite{meyer7} and multidimensional \cite{meyer8} crystalline measures. We prove that the divisors are FQ by directly computing their Fourier transforms using a formula derived in \cite{lawton}. Second, we extend the relationship between real-rootedness and amoebas, derived for $n = 1$ by Alon, Cohen and Vinzant \cite{alon}, to the case $n &gt; 1.$ The extension uses results in \cite{bushuevatsikh} about homology of complements of amoebas of algebraic sets of codimension $&gt; 1.$ Third, we prove that the divisors of all uniformly generic real-rooted $P$ are FQ. The proof uses the formula relating Grothendieck residues and Newton polytopes derived by Gelfond and Khovanskii \cite{gelfondkhovanskii1} . Finally, we note that Olevskii and Ulanovskii [60] have proved that all FQ are divisors of real-rooted trigonometric polynomials for $n = 1$ but that the situation for $n &gt; 1$ remains unsolved.</description>

      <title>Log Canonical Minimal Model Program for corank one foliations on Threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $\mathcal{F}$ is a corank one foliation on a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial normal projective threefold and $\Delta \geq 0$ a $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor on $X$ such that $(\mathcal{F}, \Delta)$ is foliated log canonical and $(X, \Delta)$ is klt, we show that $K_{\mathcal{F}} +\Delta$ admits a minimal model or a Mori fiber space. In case $(\mathcal{F}, \Delta)$ is boundary polarized and $K_{\mathcal{F}}+ \Delta$ is pseudoeffective, the minimal model is good. We also apply our results to study the relation between different minimal models, namely, any two minimal models of a given foliated log canonical pair can be connected by a sequence of flops and in the boundary polarized case, the minimal models are only finitely many in number.</description>

      <title>A new hierarchy for complex plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the type of a plane curve as the initial degree of the corresponding Bourbaki ideal. Then we show that this invariant behaves well with respect to the union of curves. The curves of type $0$ are precisely the free curves and the curves of type $1$ are the plus-one generated curves. In this note we show first that line arrangements and conic-line arrangements can have all the theoretically possible types. In the second part we study the properties of the curves of type $2$ and construct families of line arrangements and conic-line arrangements of this type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.08403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new ingredient, invariant systems of differential equations, to our study of character sheaves on graded Lie algebras. The character sheaves we construct in this paper, together with the ones constructed in [VX1, X2], constitute all cuspidal character sheaves for Vinberg's type I classical graded Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Norms and Transfers in Motivic Homotopy Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the compatibility between norms and transfers in motivic homotopy theory. More precisely, we construct norm functors for motivic spaces equipped with various flavours of transfer. This yields a norm monoidal refinement of the infinite $\mathbb{P}^1$-delooping machine of Elmanto-Hoyois-Khan-Sosnilo-Yakerson. We apply this refinement to construct a normed algebra structure on the very effective Hermitian $\mathrm{K}$-theory spectrum.</description>

      <title>Eilenberg-Moore categories and quiver representations of monads and comonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider representations of quivers taking values in monads or comonads over a Grothendieck category $\mathcal C$. We treat these as scheme like objects whose ``structure sheaf'' consists of monads or comonads. By using systems of adjoint functors between Eilenberg-Moore categories, we obtain a categorical framework of modules over monad quivers, and of comodules over comonad quivers. Our main objective is to give conditions for these to be Grothendieck categories, which play the role of noncommutative spaces. As with usual ringed spaces, we have to study two kinds of module categories over a monad quiver. The first behaves like a sheaf of modules over a ringed space. The second consists of modules that are cartesian, which resemble quasi-coherent sheaves. We also obtain an extension of the classical quasi-coherator construction to modules over a monad quiver with values in Eilenberg-Moore categories. We establish similar results for comodules over a comonad quiver. One of our key steps is finding a modulus like bound for an endofunctor $U:\mathcal C\longrightarrow \mathcal C$ in terms of $\kappa(G)$, where $G$ is a generator for $\mathcal C$ and $\kappa(G)$ is a cardinal such that $G$ is $\kappa(G)$-presentable. Another feature of our paper is that we study modules over a monad quiver in two different orientations, which we refer to as ``cis-modules'' and ``trans-modules.'' We conclude with rational pairings of a monad quiver with a comonad quiver, which relate comodules over a comonad quiver to coreflective subcategories of modules over monad quivers.</description>

      <title>On abelian varieties whose torsion is not self-dual</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many abelian surfaces $A$ defined over the rational numbers such that, for a prime $\ell \leqslant 7$, the $\ell$-torsion subgroup of $A$ is not isomorphic as a Galois module to the $\ell$-torsion subgroup of its dual $A^\vee$. We do this by explicitly analyzing the action of the Galois group on the $\ell$-adic Tate module and its reduction modulo $\ell$. We offer a framework for these computations and illustrate its use in simpler examples before using it in the proof of our main result.</description>

      <title>Finite translation orbits on double families of abelian varieties (with an appendix by E. Amerik)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07015v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider two families of $g$-dimensional abelian varieties induced by two distinct rational maps on the same variety $\overline{\mathcal A}$ onto two bases $\overline S_1$ and $\overline S_2$ and having big common domain of definition. Two non-torsion sections of these families induce two (birational) fiberwise translations on $\overline{\mathcal A}$, respectively. We show that if $\dim \overline S_1+\dim \overline S_2\le 2g$, the points with finite orbit under the action of a certain subset of the group generated by both translations lie in a proper Zariski closed subset that can be described to a certain extent. Our work is a higher dimensional generalization of a result of Corvaja, Tsimermann and Zannier.</description>

      <title>The $m$-step solvable anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a mixed-characteristic local field, and let $m$ be an integer $\geq 0$. We shall denote by $K^m/K$ the maximal $m$-step solvable extension of $K$, and write $G_K^{m}$ for the maximal $m$-step solvable quotient of the absolute Galois group $G_K$ of $K$; we will regard $G_K$ and its quotients as filtered profinite groups by equipping them with the respective ramification filtrations (in upper numbering). It is known from the previous result due to Mochizuki that the isomorphism class of $K$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the filtered profinite group $G_K$. In this paper, we prove (with some mono-anabelian results) that the isomorphism class of $K$ is determined by the isomorphism class of the maximal metabelian quotient $G_K^2$ as a filtered profinite group, and further that $K^{m}/K$ is determined functorially by the filtered profinite group $G_{K}^{m+2}$ (resp. $G_{K}^{m+3}$) for $m\geq 2$ (resp. $m = 0, 1$).</description>
