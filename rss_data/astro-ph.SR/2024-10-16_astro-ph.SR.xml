      <title>AI Foundation Model for Heliophysics: Applications, Design, and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have been widely researched in the areas of language and vision, demonstrating their capacity to understand long sequences of data and their usefulness in numerous helio-physics applications. Foundation models (FMs), which are pre-trained on a large-scale datasets, form the basis for a variety of downstream tasks. These models, especially those based on transformers in vision and language, show exceptional potential for adapting to a wide range of downstream applications. In this paper, we provide our perspective on the criteria for designing an FM for heliophysics and associated challenges and applications using the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) dataset. We believe that this is the first study to design an FM in the domain of heliophysics.</description>

      <title>Expansion properties of the young supernova type Iax remnant Pa 30 revealed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered Pa 30 nebula, the putative type Iax supernova remnant associated with the historical supernova of 1181 AD, shows puzzling characteristics that make it unique among known supernova remnants. In particular, Pa 30 exhibits a complex morphology, with a unique radial and filamentary structure, and it hosts a hot stellar remnant at its center, which displays oxygen-dominated, ultra-fast winds. Because of the surviving stellar remnant and the lack of hydrogen and helium in its filaments, it has been suggested that Pa 30 is the product of a failed thermonuclear explosion in a near- or super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf, which created a sub-luminous transient, a rare sub-type of the Ia class of supernovae called type Iax. We here present a detailed study of the 3D structure and velocities of a full radial section of the remnant. The Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations, obtained with the new red channel of the Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectrograph, reveal that the ejecta are consistent with being ballistic, with velocities close to the free-expansion velocity. Additionally, we detect a large cavity inside the supernova remnant and a sharp inner edge to the filamentary structure, which coincides with the outer edge of a bright ring detected in infrared images. Finally, we detect a strong asymmetry in the amount of ejecta along the line of sight, which might hint to an asymmetric explosion. Our analysis provides strong confirmation that the explosion originated from SN 1181.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Chemical Composition of WD 1145+017: Impact of Circumstellar Disks Contamination on Photospheric Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a chemical analysis of the asteroid-bearing white dwarf WD 1145+017 using optical and ultraviolet spectroscopic data from 25 epochs between 2015 and 2023. We present an updated gas disk model with improved opacity calculations and temperature profiles to properly account for all circumstellar absorption features. Incorporating these changes into our models, we identified at least 10 elements in the disk, including a detection of circumstellar Na. We detected 16 elements in the photosphere, including new detections of P, Co and Cu. At 16 elements, WD 1145+017 ties GD 362 as one of the most polluted white dwarfs in terms of the number of elements detected. We find that both the disk and photosphere compositions align, to first order, with CI Chondrite. Our study underscores the importance of accounting for circumstellar absorption, as neglecting them leads to significant abundance errors. Additionally, the analysis of the disk's opacity highlighted a ultraviolet flux reduction due to a pseudo-continuum due to a optically thick component. This result may affect previous analyses of other polluted white dwarfs, suggesting a need for revisiting some studies.</description>

      <title>Predicting metallicities and carbon abundances from Gaia XP spectra for (carbon-enhanced) metal-poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-rich (C-rich) stars can be found at all metallicities and evolutionary stages. They are often the result of mass-transfer from a companion, but some of the most metal-poor C-rich objects are likely carrying the imprint of the metal-free First Stars from birth. In this work, we employ a neural network to predict metallicities and carbon abundances for over 10 million stars with Gaia low-resolution XP spectra, down to [Fe/H] = -3.0 and up to [C/Fe] $\approx$ +2. We identify ~2000 high-confidence bright (G&lt;16) carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0 and [C/Fe] &gt; +0.7. The majority of our C-rich candidates have [Fe/H] &gt; -2.0 and are expected to be binary mass-transfer products, supported by high barium abundances in GALAH and/or their Gaia RUWE and radial velocity variations. We confirm previous findings of an increase in C-rich stars with decreasing metallicity, adopting a definition of $3\sigma$ outliers from the [C/Fe] distribution, although our frequency appears to flatten for -3.0 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0 at a level of 6-7%. We also find that the fraction of C-rich stars is low among globular cluster stars (connected to their lower binary fraction), and that it decreases for field stars more tightly bound to the Milky Way. We interpret these last results as evidence that disrupted globular clusters contribute more in the inner Galaxy, supporting previous work. Homogeneous samples like these are key to understanding the full population properties of C-rich stars, and this is just the beginning.</description>

      <title>Unveiling two deeply embedded young protostars in the S68N Class 0 protostellar core with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7 -- 5.3 $\mu$m observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central (NC) source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (A_K ~ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.94 $\pm$ 0.15 cm s$^{-2}$. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines HI are not detected. The South Central (SC) source, which is even more embedded (A_K ~ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 $\mu$m) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in \Ht and CO ro-vibrational lines. Shock modeling of the \Ht (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast $C$-type shocks ($\geq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), with high pre-shock density ($\geq$ $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$), and strong magnetic field (b ~ 3--10, where $B = b\,\times\,\sqrt{\textrm{n}_{\textrm{H}} (\textrm{cm}^{-3})}\,\mu\textrm{G}$) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, ie irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH$^{+}$ ro-vibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.</description>

      <title>Radiative acceleration calculation methods and abundance anomalies in Am stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic diffusion with radiative levitation is a major transport process to consider to explain abundance anomalies in Am stars. Radiative accelerations vary from one species to another, yielding different abundance anomalies at the stellar surface. Radiative accelerations can be computed using different methods: some evolution codes use an analytical approximation, while others calculate them from monochromatic opacities. We compared the abundance evolutions predicted using these various methods. Our models were computed with the Toulouse-Geneva evolution code, in which both an analytical approximation (the single-valued parameter method) and detailed calculations from Opacity Project (OP) atomic data are implemented for the calculation of radiative accelerations. The time evolutions of the surface abundances were computed using macroscopic transport processes that are able to reproduce observed Am star surface abundances in presence of atomic diffusion, namely an ad hoc turbulent model or a global mass loss. The radiative accelerations obtained with the various methods are globally in agreement for all the models below the helium convective zone, but can be much greater between the bottom of the hydrogen convective zone and that of helium. The time evolutions of the surface abundances mostly agree within the observational error, but the abundance of some elements can exceed this error for the least massive mass-loss model. The gain in computing time from using analytical approximations is significant compared to sequential calculations from monochromatic opacities for the turbulence models and for the least massive wind model; the gain is small otherwise. Test calculations of turbulence models with the tabulated OPAL opacities yield quite similar abundances as OP for most elements but in a much shorter time, so that determining Am star parameters can be done using a two-step method.</description>

      <title>Emulators for stellar profiles in binary population modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge about the internal physical structure of stars is crucial to understanding their evolution. The novel binary population synthesis code POSYDON includes a module for interpolating the stellar and binary properties of any system at the end of binary MESA evolution based on a pre-computed set of models. In this work, we present a new emulation method for predicting stellar profiles, i.e., the internal stellar structure along the radial axis, using machine learning techniques. We use principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and fully-connected feed-forward neural networks for making predictions. We find accuracy to be comparable to that of nearest neighbor approximation, with a strong advantage in terms of memory and storage efficiency. By delivering more information about the evolution of stellar internal structure, these emulators will enable faster simulations of higher physical fidelity with large-scale simulations of binary star population synthesis possible with POSYDON and other population synthesis codes.</description>

      <title>Distance and stellar parameter estimations of solar-like stars from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Gaia mission has opened up a new era for the precise astrometry of stars, thus revolutionizing our understanding of the Milky Way. However, beyond a few kiloparseconds from the Sun, parallax measurements become less reliable, and even within 2 kpc, there still exist stars with large uncertainties.
  Aims. Our aim was to determine the distance and stellar parameters of 521,424 solar-like stars from LAMOST DR9; these stars lacked precise distance measurements (uncertainties higher than 20\% or even without any distance estimations) when checked with Gaia.
  Methods. We proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict the absolute magnitudes, colors, and stellar parameters (T_eff, logg, and [FeH]) directly from low-resolution spectra. For spectra with signal-to-noise ratios at g band (S/N_g) greater than 10, the model achieves a precision of 85 K for T_eff, 0.07 dex for logg, 0.06 dex for [Fe/H], 0.25 mag for M_g, and 0.03 mag for bp-rp. The estimated distances have a median fractional error of 4% with a standard deviation of 8%.
  Results: We applied the trained CNN model to 521,424 solar-like stars to derive the distance and stellar parameters. Compared with other distance estimation studies and spectroscopic surveys, the results show good consistency. Additionally, we investigated the metallicity gradients of the Milky Way from a subsample, and find a radial gradient ranging from -0.05 &lt; Delta{[Fe/H]}/Delta{R} &lt; 0.0 dex/kpc and a vertical gradient ranging from -0.26 &lt; Delta{[Fe/H]}/Delta{Z} &lt; -0.07dex/kpc
  Conclusions. We conclude that our method is effective in estimating distances and stellar parameters for solar-like stars with limited astrometric data. Our measurements are reliable for Galactic structure studies and hopefully will be useful for exoplanet researches.</description>

      <title>Heating in the Solar Atmosphere at a Fin Current Sheet Driven by Magnetic Flux Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection before flux cancellation in the solar photosphere when two opposite-polarity photospheric magnetic fragments are approaching one another is usually modelled by assuming that a small so-called "floating current sheet" forms about a null point or separator that is situated in the overlying atmosphere. Here instead we consider the reconnection that is initiated as soon as the fragments become close enough that their magnetic fields interact. The resulting current sheet, which we term a "fin sheet" extends up from the null point or separator that is initially located in the solar surface. We develop here nonlinear analyses for finite-length models of both fin and floating current sheets that extend the previous models that were limited to short floating current sheets. These enable the length of the current sheet to be calculated in both cases as functions of the separation distance of the sources and the reconnection rate, as well as the rate of heating. Usually, the fin current sheet liberates more energy than a floating current sheet.</description>

      <title>Evolution From Asymptotic Giant Branch to Pre-planetary Nebula: Whorled Patterns and Stellar Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipolar or multipolar lobes in pre-planetary nebulae (pPNe) often exhibit intertwined outer whorled patterns, resulting from stellar wind matter accumulation during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. These structures are likely triggered by stellar or substellar companions. We regard that CW Leonis currently stands at a critical transition moment, providing a vivid illustration of the progression from an AGB star in a binary system to a pPN. We have found that CW Leonis has shown significant enhancements in its optical and near-infrared light curves over the past two decades, with the recent Hubble Space Telescope image finally revealing the long-awaited central star. Utilizing an eccentric-orbit binary model, we can reproduce the position-angle dependence of the expansion velocity in the whorled pattern around CW Leonis, suggesting a nearly face-on orbital inclination. Its contradiction to the features in the innermost circumstellar envelope, corresponding to a nearly edge-on inclination, may imply the presence of an additional companion. Our updated theoretical framework explores the complexity of the whorled pattern. Further identifying and monitoring phase-transition candidates at the tip of the AGB will provide valuable insights into the AGB-pPN transition and the role of companions in shaping the morphological evolution of these stellar objects.</description>

      <title>How does the solar chromospheric activity look like under different inclination angles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromospheric plages are distributed between mid-latitude and the Equator and never close to the Poles. Therefore, we suspect that the inclination angle of the solar rotation axis has an impact on the observable chromospheric emission. We reproduce the solar images from any inclination in order to study the effect of the inclination axis on the solar variability by using direct observations of the Sun in the Ca II K line. More than 2700 days of observations since the beginning of the Ca II K observations with USET, in July 2012, were used in our analysis. For each observation day, we produce synoptic maps to map the entire solar surface during a full solar rotation. Then by choosing a given inclination, we generate solar-disk views, representing the segmented brightest structures of the chromosphere (plages and enhanced network), as seen under this inclination. The area fraction are extracted from the masks for each inclination and we compare the evolution of those time series to quantify the impact of the inclination angle. We find a variation of the area fraction between an Equator-on view and a Pole-on view. Our results show an important impact of the viewing angle on the detection of modulation due to the solar rotation. With the dense temporal sampling of USET data, the solar rotation is detectable up to an inclination of about $|i| = 70^{\circ}$ and the solar-cycle modulation is clearly detected for all inclinations, though with a reduced amplitude in polar views. When applying a sparse temporal sampling typical for time series of solar-like stars, the rotational modulation is no longer detected, whatever the inclination. On the other hand, we find that the activity-cycle modulation remains detectable as long as the sampling contains at least 20 observations per year and the cycle amplitude reaches at least 30\% of the solar-cycle amplitude.</description>

      <title>Advection-nonlinear-diffusion model of flare accelerated electron transport in Type III solar radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons accelerated by solar flares and observed as type III solar radio bursts are not only a crucial diagnostic tool for understanding electron transport in the inner heliosphere but also a possible early indication of potentially hazardous space weather events. The electron beams travelling in the solar corona and heliosphere along magnetic field lines generate Langmuir waves and quasilinearly relax towards a plateau in velocity space. The relaxation of the electron beam over the short distance in contrast to large beam-travel distances observed is often referred to as Sturrok's dilemma. Here, we develop a new electron transport model with quasilinear distance/time self-consistently changing in space and time. The model results in a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation for the electron beam density with nonlinear diffusion term that inversely proportional to the beam density. The solution predicts slow super-diffusive (ballistic) spatial expansion of a fast propagating electron beam. The model also provides the evolution of the spectral energy density of Langmuir waves, which determines brightness temperature of plasma radiation in solar bursts. The model solution is consistent with the results of numerical simulation using kinetic equations and can explain some characteristics of type III solar radio bursts.</description>

      <title>History of the Observation of Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are about 6000 stars, that can be seen with the naked eye and have been observed for centuries for various purposes. More modern investigations using advanced telescopes show that our Milky Way, a quite common galaxy, consists of about 100 -- 400 billion stars. And, it is estimated that there are between 200 billion to 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe -- all of them consist mostly of stars, and sending observable signals which also represents nothing more than a superposition of the light of individual stars. So we can conclude that the most common observable objects in the Universe are $\textit{stars}$.
  In this chapter, we focus on the long history of the observation of stars (compared to studies in other fields of science) to find out more about the nature of these objects.</description>

      <title>Serendipitous observation of a white dwarf companion to a JWST/MIRI coronagraphic calibrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the unplanned detection of a white dwarf companion to the star HD 218261 in mid-infrared (10-16 $\mu$m) observations with JWST/MIRI. This star was observed as a calibrator for coronagraphic observations of the exoplanet host HR 8799. HD 218261 B has only previously been detected by Gaia, and only in visible light. We confidently detect the companion in the mid-infrared, where it is less luminous than the primary by a factor of ~10$^4$. The visible and mid-infrared photometry are consistent with a white dwarf of $T_\text{eff}\approx10000$ K, $M\approx0.8 M_\odot$, though observation of its optical spectrum is required to precisely constrain its physical parameters. These results demonstrate that precise mid-infrared photometry of white dwarf companions to bright stars can be obtained with MIRI, opening up new possibilities for studying white dwarfs in close binaries.</description>

      <title>Predicting photospheric UV emission from stellar evolutionary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar ultraviolet (UV) emission serves as a crucial indicator for estimating magnetic activity and evaluating the habitability of exoplanets orbiting stars. In this paper, we present a straightforward method to derive stellar photospheric UV emission for F to M main-sequence stars. By using PARSEC models, we establish relations between near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) magnitudes from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), NUV magnitudes from the China Space Station Telescope, and stellar effective temperatures and Gaia BP$-$RP color for different metallicities. Together with the observed sample, we find that for NUV emission, the photospheric contribution to the observed flux is less than 20% for M stars, around 10% to 70% for G stars, and ranges from 30% to 85% for G and F stars. For FUV emission, the photospheric contribution is less than $10^{-6}$ for M stars, below $10^{-4}$ for K stars, around $10^{-4}$ to 10% for G stars, and between 6% and 50% for F stars. Our work enables the simple and effective determination of stellar excess UV emission and the exploration of magnetic activity.</description>

      <title>Hot Subdwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot subdwarf (SD) stars are the stripped cores of red giant stars in transition to the white dwarf sequence. The B-type subdwarfs (sdB) are powered by helium fusion in the core, more evolved ones (sdO) by shell burning. Low mass SDs may evolve through this stage without any support by nuclear fusion. Because the loss of the giants' envelopes is likely caused by mass transfer in binaries, hot SDs are test beds for close-binary evolution through stable and unstable Roche lobe overflow, common envelope formation and ejection as well as mergers. Many classes of hot SDs can be identified according to surface composition, binarity, magnetism, pulsation characteristics and population membership, including members of globular clusters. Observed binaries show a wide spread of orbital periods from 20 minutes to more than 1,000 days with white dwarf or main sequence companions. The closest systems qualify as type Ia supernova progenitors and LISA detectable gravitational wave sources. High-precision light curves from Kepler and TESS combined with radial velocity curves are used to derive masses, while asteroseismology adds information on the internal structure, slow rotation, and synchronization. Gaia's parallax measurements now allow us to place the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and derive stellar parameters by combining them with multi-band photometry. The stellar radius can be determined to high precision this way. Newton's law can then be used to derive masses if accurate surface gravities are available. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys will provide atmospheric parameters for large samples of stars, allowing the mass distributions for the diverse subtypes to be established. These are crucial for testing binary synthesis models and constraining poorly known parameters such as the common envelope efficiency as well as the critical threshold mass-ratio for mass transfer stability.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Protostar-Driven Photoionization in Herbig-Haro Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies showed that observations of line emission from shocks in YSO jets require a substantial amount of ionization of the pre-shock matter. Photoionization from X-ray emitted close to the central source may be responsible for the initial ionization fraction. The aim of our work is to study the effect of X-ray photoionization, coming from the vicinity of the central star, on the ionization fraction inside the jet that can be advected at large distances. For this purpose we have performed axisymmetric MHD jet launching simulations including photoionization and optically thin losses using PLUTO. For typical X-ray luminosities in classical T-Tauri stars, we see that the photoionization is responsible for ionizing to 10 % -20 % the jet close to the star.</description>

      <title>Water depletion and 15NH3 in the atmosphere of the coldest brown dwarf observed with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a temperature of $\sim 285$ K WISE0855 is the coldest brown dwarf observed so far. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we obtained observations that allow us to characterize WISE0855s atmosphere focusing on vertical variation in the water steam abundance, measuring trace gas abundances and receiving bulk parameters for this cold object. We observed the ultra cool dwarf WISE0855 using the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS) onboard JWST at a spectral resolution of up to 3750. We combined the observation with published data from the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) G395M and PRISM modes yielding a spectrum ranging from 0.8 to 22 um. We apply atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS to measure atmospheric abundances, the pressure-temperature structure, radius and gravity of the brown dwarf. We also employ publicly available clear and cloudy self-consistent grid models to estimate bulk properties of the atmosphere such as the effective temperature, radius, gravity and metallicity. Atmospheric retrievals constrain a variable water abundance profile in the atmosphere, as predicted by equilibrium chemistry. We detect the 15NH3 isotopologue and infer a ratio of mass fraction of 14NH3/15NH3 = 332+63-43 for the clear retrieval. We measure the bolometric luminosity by integrating the presented spectrum and obtain a value of log(L/L$_{\odot}$) = -7.291+/-0.008. The detected water depletion indicates that water condenses out in the upper atmosphere due to the very low effective temperature of WISE0855. The height in the atmosphere where this occurs is covered by the MIRI/MRS data, and thus demonstrates the potential of MIRI to characterize cold gas giants atmospheres. Comparing the data to retrievals and self-consistent grid models, we do not detect signs for water ice clouds, although their spectral features have been predicted in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Disequilibrium Chemistry, Diabatic Thermal Structure, and Clouds in the Atmosphere of COCONUTS-2b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Located 10.888 pc from Earth, COCONUTS-2b is a planetary-mass companion to a young (150--800 Myr) M3 star, with a wide orbital separation (6471 au) and a low companion-to-host mass ratio ($0.021\pm0.005$). We have studied the atmospheric properties of COCONUTS-2b using newly acquired 1.0--2.5~$\mu$m spectroscopy from Gemini/Flamingos-2. The spectral type of COCONUTS-2b is refined to T$9.5 \pm 0.5$ based on comparisons with T/Y dwarf spectral templates. We have conducted an extensive forward-modeling analysis, comparing the near-infrared spectrum and mid-infrared broadband photometry with sixteen state-of-the-art atmospheric model grids developed for brown dwarfs and self-luminous exoplanets near the T/Y transition. The \texttt{PH$_{3}$-free ATMO2020++}, \texttt{ATMO2020++}, and \texttt{Exo-REM} models best match the specific observations of COCONUTS-2b, regardless of variations in the input spectrophotometry. This analysis suggests the presence of disequilibrium chemistry, along with a diabatic thermal structure and/or clouds, in the atmosphere of COCONUTS-2b. All models predict fainter $Y$-band fluxes than observed, highlighting uncertainties in the alkali chemistry models and opacities. We determine a bolometric luminosity of $\log{(L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot})}=-6.18$ dex, with a 0.5 dex-wide range of $[-6.43,-5.93]$ dex that accounts for various assumptions of models. Using thermal evolution models, we derive an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=483^{+44}_{-53}$ K, a surface gravity of $\log{(g)}=4.19^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$ dex, a radius of $R=1.11^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, and a mass of $M=8 \pm 2$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. Various atmospheric model grids consistently indicate that COCONUTS-2b's atmosphere has sub- or near-solar metallicity and C/O. These findings provide valuable insights into COCONUTS-2b's formation history and the potential outward migration to its current wide orbit.</description>

      <title>Spin and Obliquity Evolution of Hot Jupiter Hosts from Resonance Locks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a hot Jupiter orbits a star whose effective temperature exceeds $\sim$6100 K, its orbit normal tends to be misaligned with the stellar spin axis. Cooler stars have smaller obliquities. The latter may have been damped by hot Jupiters in resonance lock with axisymmetric stellar gravity modes (azimuthal number $m=0$), as has been recently recognized. Here we allow for resonance locks with non-axisymmetric modes, which affect both stellar obliquity and spin frequency. Obliquities damp for all modes ($-2 \leq m \leq 2$). Stars spin up for $m &gt; 0$, and spin down for $m &lt; 0$. We carry out a population synthesis that assumes hot Jupiters form misaligned around both cool and hot stars, and subsequently lock onto modes whose $m$-values yield the highest mode energies for given starting obliquities. Core hydrogen burning enables hot Jupiters to torque low-mass stars, but not high-mass stars, into spin-orbit alignment. Resonance locking plus stellar spin-down from magnetic braking largely reproduces observed obliquities and stellar rotation rates and how they trend with stellar effective temperature and orbital separation.</description>

      <title>A systematic search for rapid transients in the Subaru HSC-SSP transient survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high-cadence transient surveys have discovered rapid transients whose light curve timescales are shorter than those of typical supernovae. In this paper, we present a systematic search for rapid transients at medium-high redshifts among 3381 supernova candidates obtained from the Subaru HSC-SSP transient survey. We developed a machine learning classifier to classify the supernova candidates into four types (Type Ia, Ibc, II supernovae, and rapid transients) based on the features derived from the light curves. By applying this classifier to the 3381 supernova candidates and by further applying the quality cut, we selected 14 rapid transient samples. They are located at a wide range of redshifts ($0.34 \leq z \leq 1.85$) and show a wide range of the peak absolute magnitude ($-17 \geq M \geq -22$). The event rate of the rapid transients is estimated to be $\sim 6\times10^3~\rm{events~yr^{-1}~Gpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 0.74$, which corresponds to about $2$ $\%$ of the event rate of normal core-collapse supernovae at the similar redshift. Based on the luminosity and color evolution, we selected two candidates of Type Ibn supernovae at $z\sim0.75$. The event rate of Type Ibn SN candidates is more than 1 $\%$ of Type Ib SN rate at the same redshift, suggesting that this fraction of massive stars at this redshift range eruptively ejects their He-rich envelope just before the explosions. Also, two objects at $z=1.37$ and 1.85 show high luminosities comparable to superluminous supernovae. Their event rate is about 10-25 $\%$ of superluminous supernovae at $z\sim 2$.</description>

      <title>How accurate are transient spectral classification tools? -- A study using 4,646 SEDMachine spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate classification of transients obtained from spectroscopic data are important to understand their nature and discover new classes of astronomical objects. For supernovae (SNe), SNID, NGSF (a Python version of SuperFit), and DASH are widely used in the community. Each tool provides its own metric to help determine classification, such as rlap of SNID, chi2/dof of NGSF, and Probability of DASH. However, we do not know how accurate these tools are, and they have not been tested with a large homogeneous dataset. Thus, in this work, we study the accuracy of these spectral classification tools using 4,646 SEDMachine spectra, which have accurate classifications obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (BTS). Comparing our classifications with those from BTS, we have tested the classification accuracy in various ways. We find that NGSF has the best performance (overall Accuracy 87.6% when samples are split into SNe Ia and Non-Ia types), while SNID and DASH have similar performance with overall Accuracy of 79.3% and 76.2%, respectively. Specifically for SNe Ia, SNID can accurately classify them when rlap &gt; 15 without contamination from other types, such as Ibc, II, SLSN, and other objects that are not SNe (Purity &gt; 98%). For other types, determining their classification is often uncertain. We conclude that it is difficult to obtain an accurate classification from these tools alone. This results in additional human visual inspection effort being required in order to confirm the classification. To reduce this human visual inspection and to support the classification process for future large-scale surveys, this work provides supporting information, such as the accuracy of each tool as a function of its metric.</description>

      <title>TESS Giants Transiting Giants. VII. A Hot Saturn Orbiting an Oscillating Red Giant Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of TOI-7041 b (TIC 201175570 b), a hot Saturn transiting a red giant star with measurable stellar oscillations. We observe solar-like oscillations in TOI-7041 with a frequency of maximum power of $\nu_{\rm max} = 218.50\pm2.23$ $\mu$Hz and a large frequency separation of $\Delta\nu = 16.5282\pm0.0186$ $\mu$Hz. Our asteroseismic analysis indicates that TOI-7041 has a radius of $4.10 \pm 0.06$(stat) $\pm$ 0.05(sys) $R_\odot$, making it one of the largest stars around which a transiting planet has been discovered with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the mission's first oscillating red giant with a transiting planet. TOI-7041 b has an orbital period of $9.691 \pm 0.006$ days and a low eccentricity of $e = 0.04 \pm 0.04$. We measure a planet radius of $1.02 \pm 0.03$ $R_J$ with photometry from TESS, and a planet mass of $0.36 \pm 0.16$ $M_J$ ($114 \pm 51$ $M_\oplus$) with ground-based radial velocity measurements. TOI-7041 b appears less inflated than similar systems receiving equivalent incident flux, and its circular orbit indicates that it is not undergoing tidal heating due to circularization. The asteroseismic analysis of the host star provides some of the tightest constraints on stellar properties for a TESS planet host and enables precise characterization of the hot Saturn. This system joins a small number of TESS-discovered exoplanets orbiting stars that exhibit clear stellar oscillations and indicates that extended TESS observations of evolved stars will similarly provide a path to improved exoplanet characterization.</description>

      <title>An HST Transmission Spectrum of the Closest M-Dwarf Transiting Rocky Planet LTT 1445Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Which rocky exoplanets have atmospheres, and which do not? This presumably simply question is the first that must be answered in the pathway toward understanding the prevalence of nearby habitable planets. A mere 6.9 pc from Earth, the LTT 1445A system is the closest transiting M-dwarf system, and its largest known planet, at $\rm 1.31\; R_{\oplus}$ and 424 K, is one of the best rocky targets in which to search for an atmosphere. We use HST/WFC3 transmission spectroscopy with the G280 and G141 grisms to study the spectrum of LTT 1445Ab between $\rm 0.2-1.65\;\mu m$. In doing so, we uncover a flare on the neighboring star LTT 1445C, and report one of the first simultaneous near-UV/optical spectra of an M dwarf flare. The planet spectrum is consistent with a flat line, though the infrared portion displays potential features that could be explained by known opacity sources such as HCN. Some atmospheric retrievals weakly favor ($\sim2\sigma$) an atmosphere over a flat line, but it remains challenging to discern between stellar contamination, an atmosphere, and a featureless spectrum at this time. We do, however, confidently rule out $\leq100\times$ solar metallicity atmospheres. Although stellar contamination retrievals cannot fit the infrared features well, the overall spectrum is consistent with stellar contamination from hot spots, cold spots, or both. Based on the UV/optical data, we place limits on the extent of stellar variability expected in the near-infrared ($30-40$ ppm), which will be critical for upcoming JWST observations of this highly optimal target.</description>

      <title>Search for young stellar objects within 4XMM-DR13 using CatBoost and SPE</title>

Abstract: Classifying and summarizing large data sets from different sky survey projects is essential for various subsequent scientific research. By combining data from 4XMM-DR13, SDSS DR18, and CatWISE, we formed an XMM-WISE-SDSS sample that included information in the X-ray, optical, and infrared bands. By cross-matching this sample with datasets from known spectral classifications from SDSS and LAMOST, we obtained a training dataset containing stars, galaxies, quasars, and Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). Two machine learning methods, CatBoost and Self-Paced Ensemble (SPE), were used to train and construct machine learning models through training sets to classify the XMM-WISE-SDSS sample. Notably, the SPE classifier showed excellent performance in YSO classification, identifying 1102 YSO candidates from 160,545 sources, including 258 known YSOs. Then we further verify whether these candidates are YSOs by the spectra in LAMOST and the identification in the SIMBAD and VizieR dabtabases. Finally there are 412 unidentified YSO candidates. The discovery of these new YSOs is an important addition to existing YSO samples and will deepen our understanding of star formation and evolution. Moreover we provided a classification catalog for the whole XMM-WISE-SDSS sample.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino-Majoron couplings using SN1987A data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino decay to a lighter neutrino and a massless (pseudo)scalar Goldstone boson remains of wide interest, as in the search for ultralight dark matter or of neutrinoless double beta-decay, and for its implications in astrophysics and cosmology. Neutrino interactions with Majorons can affect the dynamics of supernovae and impact the emitted neutrino flux. Using a three-neutrino framework and detailed supernova simulations, we perform the first likelihood analysis of the 24 neutrino events from SN1987A, including nonradiative decay in matter to a massless (pseudo)scalar boson like a Majoron. Focusing on the induced spectral distortions, we present bounds on the neutrino-Majoron couplings, as a function of the lightest neutrino mass, that are either complementary or competitive with current ones.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric retrieval of Subaru/IRD high-resolution spectrum of the archetype T-type brown dwarf Gl 229 B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs provide a unique opportunity to study atmospheres and their physical and chemical processes with high precision, especially in temperature ranges relevant to exoplanets. In this study, we performed high-resolution ($R \sim 70,000$) spectroscopy using Subaru/IRD of Gl 229 B, the first discovered T-type (T7.0p) brown dwarf, which orbits an M1V host star at a separation of 33 au. We conducted atmospheric retrieval on the reduced $H$-band spectrum using the high-resolution spectrum model compatible with automatic differentiation and GPU, ExoJAX. In contrast to previous retrieval studies on medium-resolution spectra, we obtained a C/O ratio consistent with that of the host star, aligning with the expected formation process for such a massive brown dwarf. Additionally, based on the strong constraint on temperature from the high-resolution spectrum and previously measured photometric magnitude, our analysis indicates that Gl 229 B is a binary, which was also proposed by Brandt et al. (2021). Finally, we validated current molecular line lists by leveraging the obtained high-precision, high-resolution spectrum of this warm ($\sim 900$ K) atmosphere. This study highlights the importance of observing companion brown dwarfs as benchmark objects for establishing characterization techniques for low-mass objects and enhancing our understanding of their atmospheres, given the wealth of available information and the relative ease of observation.</description>

      <title>Precision timing of eclipsing binaries from TESS full frame images. Method and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several hundreds of thousands of eclipsing binaries (EBs) are expected to be detected in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full frame images (FFIs). This represents a significant increase in the number of EBs available for eclipse timing variation studies. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of performing precise eclipse timing of TESS EBs using the FFIs. To this end, we developed a fast, automated method and applied it to a sample of $\sim$100 EBs selected from the Villanova TESS EB catalog. Our timing analysis resulted in the detection of ten new triple candidates with outer periods shorter than $\sim$1300$\,$d. For five of them, we were able to constrain the outer orbit by analyzing independently the short-cadence (SC) and FFI data and to derive the minimum mass of the third body with a precision better than 4 per cent for SC and 11 per cent for FFI data. We then compared the results obtained from the two datasets and found that using the FFI data leads to (1) a degradation of both the accuracy and precision of the tertiary mass determination for the tightest EBs and (2) an overall underestimation of the third component's mass. However, we stress that our main conclusions on the nature of the detected signals do not depend on which dataset is used. This confirms the great potential of TESS FFIs, which will allow us to search for rare objects such as substellar circumbinary companions and compact triple stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Stripped helium-star and compact object binaries in coeval populations -- predictions based on detailed binary evolution models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive stars mainly form in close binaries, where their mutual interactions can profoundly alter their evolutionary paths. Evolved binaries consisting of a massive OB-type main-sequence star with a stripped helium star or a compact companion represent a crucial stage in the evolution towards double compact objects, whose mergers are (potentially) detectable via gravitational waves. The recent detection of X-ray quiet OB+black hole binaries and OB+stripped helium star binaries has set the stage for discovering more of these systems in the near future. In this work, based on 3670 detailed binary-evolution models and using empirical distributions of initial binary parameters, we compute the expected population of such evolved massive binaries in coeval stellar populations, including stars in star clusters and in galaxies with starburst activities, for ages up to 100 Myr. Our results are vividly illustrated in an animation that shows the evolution of these binaries in the color-magnitude diagram over time. We find that the number of OB+black hole binaries peaks around 10 Myr, and OB+neutron star binaries are most abundant at approximately 20 Myr. Both black holes and neutron stars can potentially be found in populations with ages up to 90 Myr. Additionally, we analyze the properties of such binaries at specific ages. We find that OB+helium stars and OB+black hole binaries are likely to be identifiable as single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Our research serves as a guide for future observational efforts to discover such binaries in young star clusters and starburst environments.</description>

      <title>The boring history of Gaia BH3 from isolated binary evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the first observed dormant black hole (BH) with a mass of $\approx{30}$ M$_\odot$ and represents the first confirmation that such massive BHs are associated with metal-poor stars. Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use the MIST stellar models and our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $5.6 \times 10^8$ binaries exploring 20 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\odot$) and a low mass companion ($&lt;1$ M$_\odot$) in a wide ($P&gt;10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e&gt;0.6$). Such progenitor binary stars do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\lesssim$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t&gt;10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z&lt;0.01$) populations to be $\sim 4 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$ (for our fiducial model), representing $\sim 3\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\approx 4000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\approx 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3-like. Given the density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one at the observed distance of Gaia BH3. Our models show that, even if it was born inside a stellar cluster, Gaia BH3 is compatible with a primordial binary star that escaped from its parent cluster without experiencing significant dynamical interactions.</description>

      <title>Transients by Black Hole Formation from Red Supergiants: Impact of Dense Circumstellar Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Failed supernovae (SNe), which are likely the main channel for forming stellar-mass black holes, are predicted to accompany mass ejections much weaker than typical core-collapse SNe. We conduct a grid of one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations to explore the emission of failed SNe from red supergiant progenitors, leveraging recent understanding of the weak explosion and the dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding these stars. We find from these simulations and semi-analytical modeling that diffusion in the CSM prolongs the early emission powered by shock breakout/cooling. The early emission has peak luminosities of $\sim 10^7$-$10^8~L_\odot$ in optical and UV, and durations of days to weeks. The presence of dense CSM aids detection of the early bright peak from these events via near-future wide-field surveys such as Rubin Observatory, ULTRASAT and UVEX.</description>
