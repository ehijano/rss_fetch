      <title>Quantile Slice Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate an alternate, effective approach to simple slice sampling. Using the probability integral transform, we first generalize Neal's shrinkage algorithm, standardizing the procedure to an automatic and universal starting point: the unit interval. This enables the introduction of approximate (pseudo-) targets through importance reweighting, a technique that has popularized elliptical slice sampling. Reasonably accurate pseudo-targets can boost sampler efficiency by requiring fewer rejections and by reducing target skewness. This strategy is effective when a natural, possibly crude, approximation to the target exists. Alternatively, obtaining a marginal pseudo-target from initial samples provides an intuitive and automatic tuning procedure. We consider two metrics for evaluating the quality of approximation; each can be used as a criterion to find an optimal pseudo-target or as an interpretable diagnostic. We examine performance of the proposed sampler relative to other popular, easily implemented MCMC samplers on standard targets in isolation, and as steps within a Gibbs sampler in a Bayesian modeling context. We extend the transformation method to multivariate slice samplers and demonstrate with a constrained state-space model for which a readily available forward-backward algorithm provides the target approximation.</description>

      <title>MM Algorithms for Statistical Estimation in Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantile regression is a robust and practically useful way to efficiently model quantile varying correlation and predict varied response quantiles of interest. This article constructs and tests MM algorithms, which are simple to code and have been suggested superior to some other prominent quantile regression methods in nonregularized problems, in an array of quantile regression settings including linear (modeling different quantile coefficients both separately and simultaneously), nonparametric, regularized, and monotone quantile regression. Applications to various real data sets and two simulation studies comparing MM to existing tested methods have corroborated our algorithms' effectiveness. We have made one key advance by generalizing our MM algorithm to efficiently fit easy-to-predict-and-interpret parametric quantile regression models for data sets exhibiting manifest complicated nonlinear correlation patterns, which has not yet been covered by current literature to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Scalable Monte Carlo for Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book aims to provide a graduate-level introduction to advanced topics in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, as applied broadly in the Bayesian computational context. Most, if not all of these topics (stochastic gradient MCMC, non-reversible MCMC, continuous time MCMC, and new techniques for convergence assessment) have emerged as recently as the last decade, and have driven substantial recent practical and theoretical advances in the field. A particular focus is on methods that are scalable with respect to either the amount of data, or the data dimension, motivated by the emerging high-priority application areas in machine learning and AI.</description>

      <title>Parallel MCMC Algorithms: Theoretical Foundations, Algorithm Design, Case Studies</title>

Abstract: Parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC) algorithms generate clouds of proposals at each step to efficiently resolve a target probability distribution. We build a rigorous foundational framework for pMCMC algorithms that situates these methods within a unified 'extended phase space' measure-theoretic formalism. Drawing on our recent work that provides a comprehensive theory for reversible single proposal methods, we herein derive general criteria for multiproposal acceptance mechanisms which yield ergodic chains on general state spaces. Our formulation encompasses a variety of methodologies, including proposal cloud resampling and Hamiltonian methods, while providing a basis for the derivation of novel algorithms. In particular, we obtain a top-down picture for a class of methods arising from 'conditionally independent' proposal structures. As an immediate application, we identify several new algorithms including a multiproposal version of the popular preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) sampler suitable for high- and infinite-dimensional target measures which are absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian base measure. To supplement our theoretical results, we carry out a selection of numerical case studies that evaluate the efficacy of these novel algorithms. First, noting that the true potential of pMCMC algorithms arises from their natural parallelizability, we provide a limited parallelization study using TensorFlow and a graphics processing unit to scale pMCMC algorithms that leverage as many as 100k proposals at each step. Second, we use our multiproposal pCN algorithm (mpCN) to resolve a selection of problems in Bayesian statistical inversion for partial differential equations motivated by fluid measurement. These examples provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of mpCN for high-dimensional target distributions featuring complex geometries and multimodal structures.</description>
