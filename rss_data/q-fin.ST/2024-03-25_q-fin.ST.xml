      <title>Chain-structured neural architecture search for financial time series forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare three popular neural architecture search strategies on chain-structured search spaces: Bayesian optimization, the hyperband method, and reinforcement learning in the context of financial time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear shifts and dislocations in financial market structure and composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops new mathematical techniques to identify temporal shifts among a collection of US equities partitioned into a new and more detailed set of market sectors. Although conceptually related, our three analyses reveal distinct insights about financial markets, with meaningful implications for investment managers. First, we explore a variety of methods to identify nonlinear shifts in market sector structure and describe the mathematical connection between the measure used and the captured phenomena. Second, we study network structure with respect to our new market sectors and identify meaningfully connected sector-to-sector mappings. Finally, we conduct a series of sampling experiments over different sample spaces and contrast the distribution of Sharpe ratios produced by long-only, long-short and short-only investment portfolios. In addition, we examine the sector composition of the top-performing portfolios for each of these portfolio styles. In practice, the methods proposed in this paper could be used to identify regime shifts, optimally structured portfolios, and better communities of equities.</description>

      <title>Six Levels of Privacy: A Framework for Financial Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic Data is increasingly important in financial applications. In addition to the benefits it provides, such as improved financial modeling and better testing procedures, it poses privacy risks as well. Such data may arise from client information, business information, or other proprietary sources that must be protected. Even though the process by which Synthetic Data is generated serves to obscure the original data to some degree, the extent to which privacy is preserved is hard to assess. Accordingly, we introduce a hierarchy of ``levels'' of privacy that are useful for categorizing Synthetic Data generation methods and the progressively improved protections they offer. While the six levels were devised in the context of financial applications, they may also be appropriate for other industries as well. Our paper includes: A brief overview of Financial Synthetic Data, how it can be used, how its value can be assessed, privacy risks, and privacy attacks. We close with details of the ``Six Levels'' that include defenses against those attacks.</description>
