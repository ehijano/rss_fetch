      <title>Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN): An End-to-End Direct Probabilistic Framework for Characterizing Hydraulic Conductivities and Quantifying Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN) framework for inverse modeling of groundwater flow and solute transport processes. DIN utilizes an offline-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a powerful prior leaner, which flexibly incorporates sparse, multi-source observational data, including hydraulic head, solute concentration, and hard conductivity data, through conditional injection mechanisms. These conditioning inputs subsequently guide the generative inversion process during sampling. Bypassing iterative forward simulations, DIN leverages stochastic sampling and probabilistic modeling mechanisms to directly generate ensembles of posterior parameter fields by repeatedly executing the reverse denoising process. Two representative posterior scenarios, Gaussian and non-Gaussian, are investigated. The results demonstrate that DIN can produce multiple constraint-satisfying realizations under identical observational conditions, accurately estimate hydraulic-conductivity fields, and achieve reliable uncertainty quantification. The framework exhibits strong generalization capability across diverse data distributions, offering a robust and unified alternative to conventional multi-stage inversion methodologies.</description>

      <title>Structure-Function Coherent Coarsening for Cross-Resolution Ecohydrological Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ecohydrological models are increasingly applied across multiple scenarios, yet their application remains constrained by high computational costs of fine-resolution simulations and structural inconsistencies in cross-scale modeling. This study develops a Structure-Function Coherent Coarsening (SFCC) framework that preserves both hydrological connectivity and functional heterogeneity during model input coarsening. We apply the VELMA model to 24 subbasins in the Salish Sea Basin, U.S. and examine three types of inputs: (i) DEM coarsened with a Hydro-aware approach that preserves drainage topology; (ii) land-use and soil-type datasets coarsened with function-preserving methods (Auto-weight and Auto-reassign) that retain small but process-dominant classes; and (iii) initial conditions coarsened with hydrology-, land-cover-, and soil-aware strategies to enhance temporal stability. Results show that the Hydro-aware method effectively preserves watershed morphology and yields more consistent runoff and nitrate predictions than mean-based coarsening across scales. For categorical inputs, the function-preserving methods alleviate the dominant-class bias of majority aggregation, particularly in basins where small high-impact patches drive nitrogen export. Long-term simulations further show that although hydrological variables equilibrate rapidly and biogeochemical processes adjust more gradually, deviations in both decrease over time and converge toward a steady state. These demonstrate that structural consistency and functional preservation together maintain dynamic stability through spatiotemporal feedback. Compared with existing work, the proposed SFCC framework operates directly at the data-input level, enabling more coherent integration of multi-source datasets and maximizing the retention of high-resolution information.</description>

      <title>Distributed Acoustic Fiber Sensing for Research Campuses and Large Scientific Infrastructures -- The Hamburg WAVE proto-network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate and investigate how Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) can be utilized on research campuses and in large scientific infrastructures to study environmental vibrations and reduce their impact on high-precision experiments. We first discuss the potential of DAS in the context of particle accelerators, gravitational wave detection experiments and research campuses. Next, we present the results of our seismic measurement campaign conducted with our proto-network, which involved the probing of over 12 km of fiber, in May 2021. This campaign was conducted by the Hamburg WAVE initiative in Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld and included DESY, the European XFEL, PETRA III and the University of Hamburg. Our proto-network confirms the ability to observe natural, anthropogenic, and infrastructural vibrations and how and where these couple into different parts of the heterogeneously set up fiber network. We also present results on a study of noise and motion coupling aspects of DAS probing double-redundant fiber loops in a unique environment, the European XFEL. Our results show that DAS greatly benefits research campuses and large scientific infrastructures and they highlight the opportunities and challenges of implementing and operating such seismic networks.</description>

      <title>Ambient Noise Full Waveform Inversion with Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15013v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation are crucial for investigating velocity structures and improving seismic hazard assessment. However, standard methods such as finite difference or finite element are computationally expensive. Recent studies have shown that a new class of machine learning models, called neural operators, can solve the elastodynamic wave equation orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. Full waveform inversion is a prime beneficiary of the accelerated simulations. Neural operators, as end-to-end differentiable operators, combined with automatic differentiation, provide an alternative approach to the adjoint-state method. State-of-the-art optimization techniques built into PyTorch provide neural operators with greater flexibility to improve the optimization dynamics of full waveform inversion, thereby mitigating cycle-skipping problems. In this study, we demonstrate the first application of neural operators for full waveform inversion on a real seismic dataset, which consists of several nodal transects collected across the San Gabriel, Chino, and San Bernardino basins in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.</description>

      <title>Non-randomness of Japan megaquakes implied by stress recovery and accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring stress recovery and accumulation associated with megaquakes helps to assess their recurrence. Previous studies proposed a high likelihood of imminent recurrence for the 2011 Tohoku and the 17th-century Hokkaido megaquakes belonging to the magnitude-9 class, although their current stress state remains uncertain. Here we compare the occurrence of small earthquakes relative to larger ones, using b-values, showing high b-values in the source area of the Tohoku earthquake, indicating low stresses. In contrast, low b-values occurred in the source area of the 17th-century earthquake, indicating high stresses as seen before the Tohoku event. Around the low-b-value zone, phenomena that provide insight into subsequent large earthquakes are observed, and which were reported for worldwide earthquakes: seismic quiescence, a seismic gap, strong plate coupling, and slow earthquake activity avoiding megaquakes' rupture zones. Results imply that the Hokkaido and Tohoku megaquakes occur nonrandomly in time, rather their recurrence intervals are more characteristic.</description>
