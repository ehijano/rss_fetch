      <title>Wildfire Modeling: Designing a Market to Restore Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13773v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, summer wildfires have become the norm in California, and the United States of America. These wildfires are caused due to variety of reasons. The state collects wildfire funds to help the impacted customers. However, the funds are eligible only under certain conditions and are collected uniformly throughout California. Therefore, the overall idea of this project is to look for quantitative results on how electrical corporations cause wildfires and how they can help to collect the wildfire funds or charge fairly to the customers to maximize the social impact. The research project aims to propose the implication of wildfire risk associated with vegetation, and due to power lines and incorporate that in dollars. Therefore, the project helps to solve the problem of collecting wildfire funds associated with each location and incorporate energy prices to charge their customers according to their wildfire risk related to the location to maximize the social surplus for the society. The thesis findings will help to calculate the risk premium involving wildfire risk associated with the location and incorporate the risk into pricing. The research of this submitted proposal provides the potential contribution towards detecting the utilities associated wildfire risk in the power lines, which can prevent wildfires by controlling the line flows of the system. Ultimately, the goal of this proposal is a social benefit to save money for the electrical corporations and their customers in California, who pay flat charges for Wildfire Fund each month $0.00580/kWh (in dollars). Therefore, this proposal will propose new method to collect wildfire fund with maximum customer surplus for future generations.</description>

      <title>Designing Digital Voting Systems for Citizens: Achieving Fairness and Legitimacy in Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Participatory Budgeting (PB) has evolved into a key democratic instrument for resource allocation in cities. Enabled by digital platforms, cities now have the opportunity to let citizens directly propose and vote on urban projects, using different voting input and aggregation rules. However, the choices cities make in terms of the rules of their PB have often not been informed by academic studies on voter behaviour and preferences. Therefore, this work presents the results of behavioural experiments where participants were asked to vote in a fictional PB setting. We identified approaches to designing PB voting that minimise cognitive load and enhance the perceived fairness and legitimacy of the digital process from the citizens' perspective. In our study, participants preferred voting input formats that are more expressive (like rankings and distributing points) over simpler formats (like approval voting). Participants also indicated a desire for the budget to be fairly distributed across city districts and project categories. Participants found the Method of Equal Shares voting rule to be fairer than the conventional Greedy voting rule. These findings offer actionable insights for digital governance, contributing to the development of fairer and more transparent digital systems and collective decision-making processes for citizens.</description>
