      <title>Mobility edges and fractal states in quasiperiodic Gross-Pitaevskii chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore properties of a Gross-Pitaevskii chain subject to an incommensurate periodic potential, i.e., a nonlinear Aubry-Andre model. We show that the condensate crucially impacts the properties of the elementary excitations. In contrast to the conventional linear Aubry-Andre model, the boundary between localized and extended states (mobility edge) exhibits nontrivial branching. For instance, in the high-density regime, tongues of extended phases at intermediate energies penetrate the domain of localized states. In the low-density case, the situation is opposite, and tongues of localized phases emerge. Moreover, intermediate critical (fractal) states are observed. The low-energy phonon part of the spectrum is robust against the incommensurate potential. Our study shows that accounting for interactions, already at the classical level, lead to highly nontrivial behavior of the elementary excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Liquid and solid layers in a thermal deep learning machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on deep neural networks (DNNs), deep learning has been successfully applied to many problems, but its mechanism is still not well understood -- especially the reason why over-parametrized DNNs can generalize. A recent statistical mechanics theory on supervised learning by a prototypical multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on some artificial learning scenarios predicts that adjustable parameters of over-parametrized MLPs become strongly constrained by the training data close to the input/output boundaries, while the parameters in the center remain largely free, giving rise to a solid-liquid-solid structure. Here we establish this picture, through numerical experiments on benchmark real-world data using a thermal deep learning machine that explores the phase space of the synaptic weights and neurons. The supervised training is implemented by a GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics algorithm, which operates at very low temperatures, and the trained machine exhibits good generalization ability in the test. Global and layer-specific dynamics, with complex non-equilibrium aging behavior, are characterized by time-dependent auto-correlation and replica-correlation functions. Our analyses reveal that the design space of the parameters in the liquid and solid layers are respectively structureless and hierarchical. Our main results are summarized by a data storage ratio -- network depth phase diagram with liquid and solid phases. The proposed thermal machine, which is a physical model with a well-defined Hamiltonian, that reduces to MLP in the zero-temperature limit, can serve as a starting point for physically interpretable deep learning.</description>

      <title>Classical analog circuit emulation of quantum Grover search algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a completely analog framework that emulates universal quantum gates and quantum algorithms. It is based on electronic circuits made of operational amplifiers, resistors and capacitors. In these circuits, input and output lines represent the computational basis states (CBSs) and thus $2^n$ lines are required to represent $n$ qubits. An operation of the circuits is based on classical evolution and interference of complex amplitudes associated with each CBS. The framework can emulate entangled states and is free from decoherence, measurements are classical and do not collapse states. Similar to physical quantum computers, emulated quantum algorithms can be constructed as a sequence of the gates belonging to a universal set (phase shift, Hadamard, controlled-NOT), as a unitary matrix and as combinations of the two. Circuits representing the universal gates have been made and tested. We also have made a matrix-based emulator of a 3-qubit Grover search algorithm. We tested it by searching for one and two particular states with one and two iterations and found that its outputs accurately match predicted values. We anticipate that the emulators can work as sub-components of physical quantum computers. On their own, the emulators can be used for operations that require a few qubits or operations that can be split into independent (and perhaps weakly entangled) blocks of qubits.</description>

      <title>Crossover between Solid-like and Liquid-like Behavior in Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In supercooled liquids, at a temperature between the glass transition temperature Tg and the melting point Tm, thermodynamic properties remain continuous, while dynamic behavior exhibits anomalies. The origin of such thermodynamics-dynamic decoupling has long been a puzzle in the field of glass researches. In this study, we show that the ratio of the alpha-relaxation time associated with the relative and center-of-mass coordinate of nearest-neighbor atomic pairs can effectively characterize the dynamic features of supercooled liquids. With this approach, supercooled liquids can be categorized into two distinct 'states' based on their dynamics: solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. We further propose four possible paths from the liquid to the final glass state, each exhibiting unique thermodynamic and dynamic behaviors. Two of these paths predict a characteristic temperature Tx between Tm and Tg, where a crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors occurs in supercooled liquids. The molecular dynamics simulations of several supercooled liquids reveal that the actual path followed by all these systems undergo the crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. Tx is found to reside in a similar temperature range as the critical temperature Tc in the mode-coupling theory and the breakdown temperature Tb of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This crossover provides a new microscopic perspective for explaining macroscopic dynamic anomalies, and the absence of a typical thermodynamic phase transition at Tg.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Fingerprint of Controlled Structural Disorder in Artificial Spin Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the emergence of complexity in disordered interacting systems, central to fields like spin glass physics, remains challenging due to difficulties in systematic experimental tuning. We introduce a tunable artificial spin lattice platform to directly probe the connection between controlled structural disorder and collective spin-wave dynamics. By precisely varying positional and rotational randomness in Ni81Fe19 nanobar arrays from periodic to random, we map the evolution from discrete spectral modes to a complex, dense manifold. Crucially, we establish a quantitative correlation between information-theoretic measures of static disorder and the dynamic spectral complexity derived from the GHz spin-wave response. This correlation provides a dynamic fingerprint of an increasingly complex energy landscape resulting from tuned disorder. Furthermore, thermal probe via thermal Brillouin light scattering reveal significantly richer microstates diversity in disordered states than driven probe using broadband ferromagnetic resonance. Our work presents a unique experimental testbed for studying how the ingredients of glassy physics manifest in high-frequency dynamics, offering quantitative insights into the onset of complexity in interacting nanomagnet systems.</description>

      <title>Disorder and the Robustness of Superconductivity on the Flat Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between on-site disorder and fermion pairing on the quasi one-dimensional flat band Creutz lattice. Both disorder and flat bands localize particles, but an attractive interaction results in pair formation and delocalization giving rise to superconductivity. In this work, we examine the attractive Hubbard model on the Creutz lattice to study the competition between these two effects and elucidate the properties of the superconducting phase and the localization quantum phase transition as the disorder strength is increased. Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust against disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize the fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction strength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the clean system. Using large scale density matrix renormalization group computations, we show that this transition is of the BKT form. In addition, even at very small interaction strength, the localization is not due to single fermion localization but to pair localization. For completeness, we briefly study this disorder-induced localization with mean field theory and show that $W_c$ can be accurately determined by using an appropriate scaling function.</description>

      <title>Scalable Neural Quantum State based Kernel Polynomial Method for Optical Properties from the First Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational optimization of neural-network quantum state representations has achieved FCI-level accuracy for ground state calculations, yet computing optical properties involving excited states remains challenging. In this work, we present a neural-network-based variational quantum Monte Carlo approach for ab-initio absorption spectra. We leverage parallel batch autoregressive sampling and GPU-supported local energy parallelism to efficiently compute ground states of complex systems. By integrating neural quantum ground states with the kernel polynomial method, our approach accurately calculates absorption spectra for large molecules with over 50 electrons, achieving FCI-level precision. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior scalability and reduced runtime compared to FCI, marking a significant step forward in optical property calculations for large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical learning and quantum memory with non-Hermitian many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems provide a fertile platform for quantum technologies, owing in part to their distinct dynamical phases. These systems can be characterized by the preservation or spontaneous breaking of parity-time reversal symmetry, significantly impacting the dynamical behavior of quantum resources such as entanglement and purity; resources which in turn govern the system's information processing and memory capacity. Here we investigate this relationship using the example of an interacting NH spin system defined on random graphs. We show that the onset of the first exceptional point - marking the real-to-complex spectral transition - also corresponds to an abrupt change in the system's learning capacity. We further demonstrate that this transition is controllable via local disorder and spin interactions strength, thereby defining a tunable learnability threshold. Within the learning phase, the system exhibits the key features required for memory-dependent reservoir computing. This makes explicit a direct link between spectral structure and computational capacity, further establishing non-Hermiticity, and more broadly engineered dissipation, as a dynamic resource for temporal quantum machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature-learning deep nets progressively collapse data to a regular low-dimensional geometry. How this emerges from the collective action of nonlinearity, noise, learning rate, and other factors, has eluded first-principles theories built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. We exhibit a noise-nonlinearity phase diagram that identifies regimes where shallow or deep layers learn more effectively and propose a macroscopic mechanical theory that reproduces the diagram and links feature learning across layers to generalization.</description>

      <title>Spectral form factor and energy correlations in banded random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Banded random matrices were introduced as a more realistic alternative to full random matrices for describing the spectral statistics of heavy nuclei. Initially considered by Wigner, they have since become a paradigmatic model for investigating level statistics and the localization-delocalization transition in disordered quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that, despite the absence of short-range energy correlations, weak long-range energy correlations persist in the nonergodic phase of banded random matrices. This result is supported by our numerical and analytical studies of quantities that probe both short- and long-range energy correlations, namely, the spectral form factor, level number variance, and power spectrum. We derive the timescales for the onset of spectral correlations (ramp) and for the saturation (plateau) of the spectral form factor. Unexpectedly, we find that in the nonergodic phase, these timescales decrease as the bandwidth of the matrices is reduced. We also show that the high-frequency behavior of the power spectrum of energy fluctuations can distinguish between the nonergodic and ergodic phases of the banded random matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We computed analytically global density-of-states correlation function $R\left(\omega\right)$ for L'evy-Rosenzveig-Porter random matrix ensemble which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. Using extension of Efetov's supersymmetry approach we calculated $R\left(\omega\right)$ exactly in all relevant ranges of $\omega$ . At relatively low $\omega\ll\Gamma$ (where $\Gamma$ corresponds to effective mini-band width) we found GUE-type oscillations with period of level spacing $\Delta$, decaying exponentially at the Thouless energy scale $E_{th}=\sqrt{\frac{\Delta\Gamma}{2\pi}}$. At high energies $\omega\gg E_{th}$ our results coincide with those obtained a cavity equation approach, demonstrating power-law decay. Inverse of the effective mini-band width $1/\Gamma$ is shown to be given by the average of the local decay times over L'evy distribution.</description>

      <title>Overlap Gap and Computational Thresholds in the Square Wave Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Square Wave Perceptrons (SWPs) form a class of neural network models with oscillating activation function that exhibit intriguing ``hardness'' properties in the high-dimensional limit at a fixed signal-to-noise ratio $\alpha = O(1)$. In this work, we examine two key aspects of these models. The first is related to the so-called overlap-gap property, that is a disconnectivity feature of the geometry of the solution space of combinatorial optimization problems proven to cause the failure of a large family of solvers, and conjectured to be a symptom of algorithmic hardness. We identify, both in the storage and in the teacher-student settings, the emergence of an overlap gap at a threshold $\alpha_{\mathrm{OGP}}(\delta)$, which can be made arbitrarily small by suitably increasing the frequency of oscillations $1/\delta$ of the activation. This suggests that in this small-$\delta$ regime, typical instances of the problem are hard to solve even for small values of $\alpha$. Second, in the teacher-student setup, we show that the recovery threshold of the planted signal for message-passing algorithms can be made arbitrarily large by reducing $\delta$. These properties make SWPs both a challenging benchmark for algorithms and an interesting candidate for cryptographic applications.</description>

      <title>Floquet Amorphous Topological Orders in a One-dimensional Rydberg Glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological orders in amorphous systems that lack crystalline symmetry have gained considerable attention recently. Here we propose the Floquet amorphous topological matter, among which the topological orders are explored in experimentally accessible one-dimensional array of randomly pointed Rydberg atoms with periodic driving. The topological properties are comprehensively characterized, considering both the single-particle and many-body perspectives. It is found that the periodic driving leads to rich topological phases of matter. At the single-particle level, we evaluate the real space winding numbers and polarization, revealing robust amorphous topological phases with 0-type and $\pi$-type edge modes. We show a structural disorder induced topological phase transition associated with localization transition in the nonequilibrium system. Remarkably, in the many-body case it is discovered that the amorphous topological order exists in the chain of hardcore bosons, captured by the topological entanglement entropy and the string order. Moreover, feasible experimental probe protocols are also elaborated.</description>

      <title>Genuine topological Anderson insulator from impurity induced chirality reversal</title>

Abstract: We investigate a model of Dirac fermions with Haldane type mass impurities which open a global topological gap even in the dilute limit. Surprisingly, we find that the chirality of this mass term, i.e., the sign of the Chern number, can be reversed by tuning the magnitude of the single-impurity scattering. Consequently, the disorder induces a phase disconnected from the clean topological phase, i.e., a genuine topological Anderson insulator. In seeming contradiction to the expectation that mass disorder is an irrelevant perturbation to the clean integer quantum Hall transition, the tri-critical point separating these two Chern insulating phases and a thermal metal phase is located at zero impurity density and connected to the appearance of a zero energy bound state in the continuum corresponding to a divergent Haldane mass impurity. Our conclusions based on the T-matrix expansion are substantiated by large scale Chebyshev-Polynomial-Green-Function numerics. We discuss possible experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Towards Timetronics with Photonic Systems</title>

Abstract: Periodic driving of particles can create crystalline structures in their dynamics. Such systems can be used to study solid-state physics phenomena in the time domain. In addition, it is possible to realize photonic time crystals and to engineer the wave-number band structure of optical devices by periodic temporal modulation of the properties of light-propagating media. Here we introduce a versatile approach which uses traveling wave resonators to emulate various condensed matter phases in the time dimension. This is achieved by utilizing temporal modulation of the permittivity and the shape of small segments of the resonators. The required frequency and depth of the modulation are experimentally achievable which opens a pathway for the practical realisation of crystalline structures in time in microwave and in optical systems.</description>

      <title>Spintronic Neuron Using a Magnetic Tunnel Junction for Low-Power Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spiking artificial neuron design based on a combined spin valve/magnetic tunnel junction (SV/MTJ). Traditional hardware used in artificial intelligence and machine learning faces significant challenges related to high power consumption and scalability. To address these challenges, spintronic neurons, which can mimic biologically inspired neural behaviors, offer a promising solution. We present a model of an SV/MTJ-based neuron which uses technologies that have been successfully integrated with CMOS in commercially available applications. The operational dynamics of the neuron are derived analytically through the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation, demonstrating its ability to replicate key spiking characteristics of biological neurons, such as response latency and refractive behavior. Simulation results indicate that the proposed neuron design can operate on a timescale of about 1 ns, without any bias current, and with power consumption as low as 50 uW.</description>

      <title>Theory of itinerant collisional spin dynamics in nondegenerate molecular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &amp; $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</description>

      <title>Learning-at-Criticality in Large Language Models for Quantum Field Theory and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.</description>
