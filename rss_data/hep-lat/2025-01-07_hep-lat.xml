      <title>Does the Z boson have a lighter cousin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quenched electroweak theory on the lattice I construct a set of physical states which overlap the physical photon and Z boson states. This is done by employing eigenstates of the covariant lattice Laplacian, in addition to the Higgs and lattice link variables, to construct gauge invariant vector boson creation operators. Diagonalizing the transfer matrix in the subspace of Hilbert space spanned by this set yields a massless photon and massive Z particle, as expected. But in the numerical data there is evidence for more vector bosons in the spectrum, albeit with considerable uncertainty in their masses, with the lowest finite mass particle in the range of 3-4 GeV.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ invariant of massive Wilson Dirac operator and the index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the lattice index theorem in the perspective of $K$-theory. The standard definition given by the overlap Dirac operator equals to the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass. This equality is not coincidental but reflects a mathematically profound significance known as the suspension isomorphism of $K$-groups. Specifically, we identify the Wilson Dirac operator as an element of the $K^1$ group, which is characterized by the $\eta$-invariant. Furthermore, we prove that, at sufficiently small but finite lattice spacings, this $\eta$-invariant equals to the index of the continuum Dirac operator. Our results indicate that the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and the associated exact chiral symmetry are not essential for understanding gauge field topology in lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Computing the UV-finite electromagnetic corrections to the hadronic vacuum polarization in the muon $(g-2)$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to reach a precision of $0.2\%$ on the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, such that the full Standard-Model prediction matches in precision the direct experimental measurement, it is crucial to include the leading, O($\alpha$) electromagnetic corrections to HVP. In this work, we determine an important contribution to the latter from a diagram comprised of two two-point quark-loops, connected by the internal photon and gluons. This ultraviolet-finite correction is calculated from lattice QCD using a coordinate-space formalism, where photons are treated in the continuum and infinite volume. Our result amounts to a $(-0.89\pm 0.18)\%$ correction to the leading-order HVP contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$. To overcome the worsening statistical noise at large distances, our analysis is combined with phenomenological models featuring light pseudoscalar mesons with masses below 1 GeV. In particular, our data show a very steep mass dependence as dictated by the charged pion loop. Similarly, the other diagrams appearing in the O$(\alpha)$-corrections to the HVP with the internal photon connecting two separate quark loops are also ultraviolet-finite and can be computed with the same formalism.</description>

      <title>Improved entanglement entropy estimates from filtered bitstring probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the bitstring probabilities of ground states of bipartitioned ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the mutual information which is a lower bound on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. We show that in many cases, these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). Surprisingly, in some cases, as we increase $p_{min}$ the filtered mutual information tends to plateaus at values very close to $S^{vN}_A$ over some range of $p_{min}$. We consider various sizes, lattice spacings and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of $S^{vN}_A$. We briefly discuss practical implementations with the QuEra's Aquila device.</description>

      <title>Stringy scaling of multi-tensor hard string scattering amplitudes and the K-identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. We discover the stringy scaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing to the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA calculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.</description>
