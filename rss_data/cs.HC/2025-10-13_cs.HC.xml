      <title>Understanding and Predicting Temporal Visual Attention Influenced by Dynamic Highlights in Monitoring Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring interfaces are crucial for dynamic, highstakes tasks where effective user attention is essential. Visual highlights can guide attention effectively but may also introduce unintended disruptions. To investigate this, we examined how visual highlights affect users' gaze behavior in a drone monitoring task, focusing on when, how long, and how much attention they draw. We found that highlighted areas exhibit distinct temporal characteristics compared to non-highlighted ones, quantified using normalized saliency (NS) metrics. Highlights elicited immediate responses, with NS peaking quickly, but this shift came at the cost of reduced search efforts elsewhere, potentially impacting situational awareness. To predict these dynamic changes and support interface design, we developed the Highlight-Informed Saliency Model (HISM), which provides granular predictions of NS over time. These predictions enable evaluations of highlight effectiveness and inform the optimal timing and deployment of highlights in future monitoring interface designs, particularly for time-sensitive tasks.</description>

      <title>MLLM as a UI Judge: Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs for Predicting Human Perception of User Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an ideal design pipeline, user interface (UI) design is intertwined with user research to validate decisions, yet studies are often resource-constrained during early exploration. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a promising opportunity to act as early evaluators, helping designers narrow options before formal testing. Unlike prior work that emphasizes user behavior in narrow domains such as e-commerce with metrics like clicks or conversions, we focus on subjective user evaluations across varied interfaces. We investigate whether MLLMs can mimic human preferences when evaluating individual UIs and comparing them. Using data from a crowdsourcing platform, we benchmark GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama across 30 interfaces and examine alignment with human judgments on multiple UI factors. Our results show that MLLMs approximate human preferences on some dimensions but diverge on others, underscoring both their potential and limitations in supplementing early UX research.</description>

      <title>Green Grid: Smart Tech Meets E-Waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic waste (e-waste) is a rapidly growing global problem caused by shorter device lifecycles and rising consumption. India ranks third globally in e-waste generation, producing over 1.7 million tonnes in 2023-24, of which less than half is formally processed. To address this, we propose Green Grid, an integrated AI-powered e-waste management platform combining IoT-enabled smart collection, AI-based device classification, blockchain-based traceability, and gamified citizen engagement. The system features smart recycling bins with sensors for real-time monitoring, deep learning models for device identification and sorting, a blockchain ledger for tamper-proof tracking, and a reward-based mobile or web app to encourage user participation. Additionally, Green Grid offers analytics dashboards and an eco-marketplace to support policymakers and recyclers. By bridging technology, sustainability, and community participation, the platform enhances transparency, increases formal recycling rates, and advances India's transition toward a circular economy.</description>

      <title>Beyond Words: Infusing Conversational Agents with Human-like Typing Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models have facilitated the emergence of highly intelligent conversational AI capable of engaging in human-like dialogues. However, a notable distinction lies in the fact that these AI models predominantly generate responses rapidly, often producing extensive content without emulating the thoughtful process characteristic of human cognition and typing. This paper presents a design aimed at simulating human-like typing behaviors, including patterns such as hesitation and self-editing, as well as a preliminary user experiment to understand whether and to what extent the agent with human-like typing behaviors could potentially affect conversational engagement and its trustworthiness. We've constructed an interactive platform featuring user-adjustable parameters, allowing users to personalize the AI's communication style and thus cultivate a more enriching and immersive conversational experience. Our user experiment, involving interactions with three types of agents - a baseline agent, one simulating hesitation, and another integrating both hesitation and self-editing behaviors - reveals a preference for the agent that incorporates both behaviors, suggesting an improvement in perceived naturalness and trustworthiness. Through the insights from our design process and both quantitative and qualitative feedback from user experiments, this paper contributes to the multimodal interaction design and user experience for conversational AI, advocating for a more human-like, engaging, and trustworthy communication paradigm.</description>

      <title>"I know it's not right, but that's what it said to do": Investigating Trust in AI Chatbots for Cybersecurity Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI chatbots are an emerging security attack vector, vulnerable to threats such as prompt injection, and rogue chatbot creation. When deployed in domains such as corporate security policy, they could be weaponized to deliver guidance that intentionally undermines system defenses. We investigate whether users can be tricked by a compromised AI chatbot in this scenario. A controlled study (N=15) asked participants to use a chatbot to complete security-related tasks. Without their knowledge, the chatbot was manipulated to give incorrect advice for some tasks. The results show how trust in AI chatbots is related to task familiarity, and confidence in their ownn judgment. Additionally, we discuss possible reasons why people do or do not trust AI chatbots in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Co-Authoring the Self: A Human-AI Interface for Interest Reflection in Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language-based user profiles in recommender systems have been explored for their interpretability and potential to help users scrutinize and refine their interests, thereby improving recommendation quality. Building on this foundation, we introduce a human-AI collaborative profile for a movie recommender system that presents editable personalized interest summaries of a user's movie history. Unlike static profiles, this design invites users to directly inspect, modify, and reflect on the system's inferences. In an eight-week online field deployment with 1775 active movie recommender users, we find persistent gaps between user-perceived and system-inferred interests, show how the profile encourages engagement and reflection, and identify design directions for leveraging imperfect AI-powered user profiles to stimulate more user intervention and build more transparent and trustworthy recommender experiences.</description>

      <title>Creation, Critique, and Consumption: Exploring Generative AI Descriptions for Supporting Blind and Low Vision Professionals with Visual Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many blind and low vision (BLV) people are excluded from professional roles that may involve visual tasks due to access barriers and persisting stigmas. Advancing generative AI systems can support BLV people through providing contextual and personalized visual descriptions for creation, critique, and consumption. In this workshop paper, we provide design suggestions for how visual descriptions can be better contextualized for multiple professional tasks. We conclude by discussing how these designs can improve autonomy, inclusion, and skill development over time.</description>

      <title>Promptimizer: User-Led Prompt Optimization for Personal Content Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While LLMs now enable users to create content classifiers easily through natural language, automatic prompt optimization techniques are often necessary to create performant classifiers. However, such techniques can fail to consider how social media users want to evolve their filters over the course of usage, including desiring to steer them in different ways during initialization and iteration. We introduce a user-centered prompt optimization technique, Promptimizer, that maintains high performance and ease-of-use but additionally (1) allows for user input into the optimization process and (2) produces final prompts that are interpretable. A lab experiment (n=16) found that users significantly preferred Promptimizer's human-in-the-loop optimization over a fully automatic approach. We further implement Promptimizer into Puffin, a tool to support YouTube content creators in creating and maintaining personal classifiers to manage their comments. Over a 3-week deployment with 10 creators, participants successfully created diverse filters to better understand their audiences and protect their communities.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Rational Dilated Wavelet Transform on Motor Imagery EEG Decoding with Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the impact of the Rational Discrete Wavelet Transform (RDWT), used as a plug-in preprocessing step for motor imagery electroencephalographic (EEG) decoding prior to applying deep learning classifiers. A systematic paired evaluation (with/without RDWT) is conducted on four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures: EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, MBEEG\_SENet, and EEGTCNet. This evaluation was carried out across three benchmark datasets: High Gamma, BCI-IV-2a, and BCI-IV-2b. The performance of the RDWT is reported with subject-wise averages using accuracy and Cohen's kappa, complemented by subject-level analyses to identify when RDWT is beneficial. On BCI-IV-2a, RDWT yields clear average gains for EEGTCNet (+4.44 percentage points, pp; kappa +0.059) and MBEEG\_SENet (+2.23 pp; +0.030), with smaller improvements for EEGNet (+2.08 pp; +0.027) and ShallowConvNet (+0.58 pp; +0.008). On BCI-IV-2b, the enhancements observed are modest yet consistent for EEGNet (+0.21 pp; +0.044) and EEGTCNet (+0.28 pp; +0.077). On HGD, average effects are modest to positive, with the most significant gain observed for MBEEG\_SENet (+1.65 pp; +0.022), followed by EEGNet (+0.76 pp; +0.010) and EEGTCNet (+0.54 pp; +0.008). Inspection of the subject material reveals significant enhancements in challenging recordings (e.g., non-stationary sessions), indicating that RDWT can mitigate localized noise and enhance rhythm-specific information. In conclusion, RDWT is shown to be a low-overhead, architecture-aware preprocessing technique that can yield tangible gains in accuracy and agreement for deep model families and challenging subjects.</description>

      <title>Barriers that Programming Instructors Face While Performing Emergency Pedagogical Design to Shape Student-AI Interactions with Generative AI Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are increasingly pervasive, pushing instructors to redesign how students use GenAI tools in coursework. We conceptualize this work as emergency pedagogical design: reactive, indirect efforts by instructors to shape student-AI interactions without control over commercial interfaces. To understand practices of lead users conducting emergency pedagogical design, we conducted interviews (n=13) and a survey (n=169) of computing instructors. These instructors repeatedly encountered five barriers: fragmented buy-in for revising courses; policy crosswinds from non-prescriptive institutional guidance; implementation challenges as instructors attempt interventions; assessment misfit as student-AI interactions are only partially visible to instructors; and lack of resources, including time, staffing, and paid tool access. We use these findings to present emergency pedagogical design as a distinct design setting for HCI and outline recommendations for HCI researchers, academic institutions, and organizations to effectively support instructors in adapting courses to GenAI.</description>

      <title>LibraryLens: An Interactive Tool for Exploring and Arranging Digital Bookshelves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing digital book management platforms often fail to capture the rich spatial and visual cues inherent to physical bookshelves, hindering users' ability to fully engage with their collections. We present LibraryLens, a novel visualization tool that addresses these shortcomings by enabling users to create, explore, and interact with immersive, two-dimensional representations of their personal libraries. The tool also caters to the growing trend of social sharing within online book communities, allowing users to create visually appealing representations of their libraries that can be easily shared on social platforms. Despite limitations inherent to the metadata being rendered, formative evaluations suggest that LibraryLens has the potential to lower the barrier to entry for users seeking to optimize their book organization without the constraints of physical space or manual labor, ultimately fostering deeper engagement with their personal libraries.</description>

Abstract: Conversational AI (CAI) systems offer opportunities to scale service provision to unprecedented levels and governments and corporations are already beginning to deploy them across services. The economic argument is similar across domains: use CAI to automate the time-consuming conversations required for customer, client or patient support. Herein we draw on our work in dementia care to explore some of the challenges and opportunities for CAI, and how a new way of conceptualising these systems could help ensure essential aspects for human thriving are not lost in the process of automation.</description>

      <title>Differential Analysis of Pseudo Haptic Feedback: Novel Comparative Study of Visual and Auditory Cue Integration for Psychophysical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo-haptics exploit carefully crafted visual or auditory cues to trick the brain into "feeling" forces that are never physically applied, offering a low-cost alternative to traditional haptic hardware. Here, we present a comparative psychophysical study that quantifies how visual and auditory stimuli combine to evoke pseudo-haptic pressure sensations on a commodity tablet. Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a virtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were captured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain was paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440 Hz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional "knocking" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased systematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only trials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3, respectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited stronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force needed to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration. These results demonstrate that consumer-grade isometric devices can reliably induce and measure graded pseudo-haptic feedback without specialized actuators, opening a path toward affordable rehabilitation tools, training simulators and assistive interfaces.</description>

      <title>VisPile: A Visual Analytics System for Analyzing Multiple Text Documents With Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligence analysts perform sensemaking over collections of documents using various visual and analytic techniques to gain insights from large amounts of text. As data scales grow, our work explores how to leverage two AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs), in a visual text analysis tool, enhancing sensemaking and helping analysts keep pace. Collaborating with intelligence community experts, we developed a visual analytics system called VisPile. VisPile integrates an LLM and a KG into various UI functions that assist analysts in grouping documents into piles, performing sensemaking tasks like summarization and relationship mapping on piles, and validating LLM- and KG-generated evidence. Our paper describes the tool, as well as feedback received from six professional intelligence analysts that used VisPile to analyze a text document corpus.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models for the Machine-Assisted Resolution of User Intentions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional, GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However, extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative. This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded intelligence.</description>

      <title>AgenticAD: A Specialized Multiagent System Framework for Holistic Alzheimer Disease Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a complex, multifaceted challenge to patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system, necessitating integrated and dynamic support solutions. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising avenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing singular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support without systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological framework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic Alzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of a collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address a distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and multimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data interpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized, interoperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver and Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced Multimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of each agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration frameworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded responses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing, and in-memory database querying. This paper presents a detailed architectural blueprint for an integrated AI ecosystem for AD care. By moving beyond single-purpose tools to a collaborative, multi-agent paradigm, this framework establishes a foundation for developing more adaptive, personalized, and proactive solutions. This methodological approach aims to pave the way for future systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient outcomes and reduce caregiver burden.</description>

      <title>Everyone prefers human writers, including AI</title>

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556) and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a 14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point (pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3 percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect (P$&lt;$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures (+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not only replicate but amplify this human tendency.</description>

      <title>GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GTAlign .</description>

      <title>Designing and Evaluating an AI-driven Immersive Multidisciplinary Simulation (AIMS) for Interprofessional Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interprofessional education has long relied on case studies and the use of standardized patients to support teamwork, communication, and related collaborative competencies among healthcare professionals. However, traditional approaches are often limited by cost, scalability, and inability to mimic the dynamic complexity of real-world clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we designed and developed AIMS (AI-Enhanced Immersive Multidisciplinary Simulations), a virtual simulation that integrates a large language model (Gemini-2.5-Flash), a Unity-based virtual environment engine, and a character creation pipeline to support synchronized, multimodal interactions between the user and the virtual patient. AIMS was designed to enhance collaborative clinical reasoning and health promotion competencies among students from pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and social work. A formal usability testing session was conducted which participants assumed professional roles on a healthcare team and engaged in a mix of scripted and unscripted conversations. Participants explored the patient's symptoms, social context, and care needs. Usability issues were identified (e.g., audio routing, response latency) and used to guide subsequent refinements. Findings in general suggest that AIMS supports realistic, profession-specific and contextually appropriate conversations. We discussed both technical and pedagogical innovations of AIMS and concluded with future directions.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Disentangled Embedding Alignment for Noise-Robust and Cross-Corpus Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectiveness of speech emotion recognition in real-world scenarios is often hindered by noisy environments and variability across datasets. This paper introduces a two-step approach to enhance the robustness and generalization of speech emotion recognition models through improved representation learning. First, our model employs EDRL (Emotion-Disentangled Representation Learning) to extract class-specific discriminative features while preserving shared similarities across emotion categories. Next, MEA (Multiblock Embedding Alignment) refines these representations by projecting them into a joint discriminative latent subspace that maximizes covariance with the original speech input. The learned EDRL-MEA embeddings are subsequently used to train an emotion classifier using clean samples from publicly available datasets, and are evaluated on unseen noisy and cross-corpus speech samples. Improved performance under these challenging conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Training Models to Detect Successive Robot Errors from Human Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As robots become more integrated into society, detecting robot errors is essential for effective human-robot interaction (HRI). When a robot fails repeatedly, how can it know when to change its behavior? Humans naturally respond to robot errors through verbal and nonverbal cues that intensify over successive failures-from confusion and subtle speech changes to visible frustration and impatience. While prior work shows that human reactions can indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users. The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% for classifying successive failures. Modeling the progression of human reactions enhances error detection and understanding of repeated interaction breakdowns in HRI.</description>

      <title>Student Development Agent: Risk-free Simulation for Evaluating AIED Innovations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of AI-powered educational (AIED) innovation, evaluating the developmental consequences of novel designs before they are exposed to students has become both essential and challenging. Since such interventions may carry irreversible effects, it is critical to anticipate not only potential benefits but also possible harms. This study proposes a student development agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to simulate how students with diverse characteristics may evolve under different educational settings without administering them to real students. By validating the approach through a case study on a multi-agent learning environment (MAIC), we demonstrate that the agent's predictions align with real student outcomes in non-cognitive developments. The results suggest that LLM-based simulations hold promise for evaluating AIED innovations efficiently and ethically. Future directions include enhancing profile structures, incorporating fine-tuned or small task-specific models, validating effects of empirical findings, interpreting simulated data and optimizing evaluation methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Safer and Understandable Driver Intention Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety, i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/</description>

      <title>Identifying &amp; Interactively Refining Ambiguous User Goals for Data Visualization Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication. However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies: Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn exchanges in code generation.</description>

      <title>Confidence-weighted integration of human and machine judgments for superior decision-making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can surpass humans in certain forecasting tasks. What role does this leave for humans in the overall decision process? One possibility is that humans, despite performing worse than LLMs, can still add value when teamed with them. A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when team members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which tasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We simplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a logistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for any number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated its effectiveness in both image classification and neuroscience forecasting tasks. Combining human judgments with one or more machines consistently improved overall team performance. Our hope is that this simple and effective strategy for integrating the judgments of humans and machines will lead to productive collaborations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in applying LLMs to scientific tasks. In this work, we conduct an experimental study to explore applicability of LLMs for configuring, annotating, translating, explaining, and generating scientific workflows. We use 5 different workflow specific experiments and evaluate several open- and closed-source language models using state-of-the-art workflow systems. Our studies reveal that LLMs often struggle with workflow related tasks due to their lack of knowledge of scientific workflows. We further observe that the performance of LLMs varies across experiments and workflow systems. Our findings can help workflow developers and users in understanding LLMs capabilities in scientific workflows, and motivate further research applying LLMs to workflows.</description>

      <title>PeRoI: A Pedestrian-Robot Interaction Dataset for Learning Avoidance, Neutrality, and Attraction Behaviors in Social Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots are increasingly being deployed in public spaces such as shopping malls, sidewalks, and hospitals, where safe and socially aware navigation depends on anticipating how pedestrians respond to their presence. However, existing datasets rarely capture the full spectrum of robot-induced reactions, e.g., avoidance, neutrality, attraction, which limits progress in modeling these interactions. In this paper, we present the Pedestrian-Robot Interaction~(PeRoI) dataset that captures pedestrian motions categorized into attraction, neutrality, and repulsion across two outdoor sites under three controlled conditions: no robot present, with stationary robot, and with moving robot. This design explicitly reveals how pedestrian behavior varies across robot contexts, and we provide qualitative and quantitative comparisons to established state-of-the-art datasets. Building on these data, we propose the Neural Robot Social Force Model~(NeuRoSFM), an extension of the Social Force Model that integrates neural networks to augment inter-human dynamics with learned components and explicit robot-induced forces to better predict pedestrian motion in vicinity of robots. We evaluate NeuRoSFM by generating trajectories on multiple real-world datasets. The results demonstrate improved modeling of pedestrian-robot interactions, leading to better prediction accuracy, and highlight the value of our dataset and method for advancing socially aware navigation strategies in human-centered environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies reveal that experienced data practitioners often draw sketches to facilitate communication around privacy design concepts. However, there is limited understanding of how we can help novice students develop such communication skills. This paper studies methods for lowering novice data science students' barriers to creating high-quality privacy sketches. We first conducted a need-finding study (N=12) to identify barriers students face when sketching privacy designs. We then used a human-centered design approach to guide the method development, culminating in three simple, text-based heuristics. Our user studies with 24 data science students revealed that simply presenting three heuristics to the participants at the beginning of the study can enhance the coverage of privacy-related design decisions in sketches, reduce the mental effort required for creating sketches, and improve the readability of the final sketches.</description>

      <title>GestureCoach: Rehearsing for Engaging Talks with LLM-Driven Gesture Recommendations</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces GestureCoach, a system designed to help speakers deliver more engaging talks by guiding them to gesture effectively during rehearsal. GestureCoach combines an LLM-driven gesture recommendation model with a rehearsal interface that proactively cues speakers to gesture appropriately. Trained on experts' gesturing patterns from TED talks, the model consists of two modules: an emphasis proposal module, which predicts when to gesture by identifying gesture-worthy text segments in the presenter notes, and a gesture identification module, which determines what gesture to use by retrieving semantically appropriate gestures from a curated gesture database. Results of a model performance evaluation and user study (N=30) show that the emphasis proposal module outperforms off-the-shelf LLMs in identifying suitable gesture regions, and that participants rated the majority of these predicted regions and their corresponding gestures as highly appropriate. A subsequent user study (N=10) showed that rehearsing with GestureCoach encouraged speakers to gesture and significantly increased gesture diversity, resulting in more engaging talks. We conclude with design implications for future AI-driven rehearsal systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring human-SAV interaction using LLMs: The impact of psychological factors on user experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been extensive prior work exploring how psychological factors such as anthropomorphism affect the adoption of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs). However, limited research has been conducted on how prompt strategies in large language models (LLM)-powered conversational SAV agents affect users' perceptions, experiences, and intentions to adopt such technology. In this work, we investigate how conversational SAV agents powered by LLMs drive these psychological factors, such as psychological ownership, the sense of possession a user may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own. We designed four SAV agents with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics and psychological ownership triggers. Quantitative measures of psychological ownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment of SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants interacted with each SAV. Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the experience of psychological ownership during the interactions. The results indicate that an SAV designed to be more anthropomorphic and to induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's human-like qualities, and its responses were perceived as more positive but also more subjective compared to the control conditions. Qualitative findings support established routes to psychological ownership in the SAV context and suggest that the conversational agent's perceived performance may also influence psychological ownership. Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes highlight the importance of personalization in designing effective SAV interactions. These findings provide practical guidance for designing conversational SAV agents that enhance user experience and adoption.</description>

      <title>Cognitio Emergens: Agency, Dimensions, and Dynamics in Human-AI Knowledge Co-Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human-AI scientific collaboration has evolved from tool-user relationships into co-evolutionary partnerships. When AlphaFold improved protein structure prediction, researchers engaged with an epistemic partner that transformed their approach to structure-function problems. Yet existing frameworks position AI as either sophisticated tool or potential risk, overlooking how scientific understanding emerges through recursive interaction. We introduce Cognitio Emergens (CE), a framework that captures the co-evolutionary nature of human-AI epistemic partnerships.
  Drawing from autopoiesis theory, social systems theory, and organizational modularity, CE integrates three components: Agency Configurations modeling how authority distributes through Directed, Contributory, and Partnership modes, with partnerships oscillating dynamically rather than following linear progression; Epistemic Dimensions capturing six capabilities along Discovery, Integration, and Projection axes, creating distinctive "capability signatures" that guide strategic development; and Partnership Dynamics identifying evolutionary forces including epistemic alienation, where researchers lose interpretive control over knowledge they formally endorse.
  The framework equips researchers to diagnose dimensional imbalances, institutional leaders to design governance structures supporting multiple agency configurations, and policymakers to develop evaluations beyond simple performance metrics. By reconceptualizing human-AI collaboration as fundamentally co-evolutionary, CE provides conceptual tools for cultivating partnerships that preserve epistemic integrity while enabling transformative breakthroughs neither humans nor AI could achieve independently.</description>

      <title>Automating eHMI Action Design with LLMs for Automated Vehicle Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absence of explicit communication channels between automated vehicles (AVs) and other road users requires the use of external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) to convey messages effectively in uncertain scenarios. Currently, most eHMI studies employ predefined text messages and manually designed actions to perform these messages, which limits the real-world deployment of eHMIs, where adaptability in dynamic scenarios is essential. Given the generalizability and versatility of large language models (LLMs), they could potentially serve as automated action designers for the message-action design task. To validate this idea, we make three contributions: (1) We propose a pipeline that integrates LLMs and 3D renderers, using LLMs as action designers to generate executable actions for controlling eHMIs and rendering action clips. (2) We collect a user-rated Action-Design Scoring dataset comprising a total of 320 action sequences for eight intended messages and four representative eHMI modalities. The dataset validates that LLMs can translate intended messages into actions close to a human level, particularly for reasoning-enabled LLMs. (3) We introduce two automated raters, Action Reference Score (ARS) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to benchmark 18 LLMs, finding that the VLM aligns with human preferences yet varies across eHMI modalities.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Human-Centered Racial Covenant Detection and Georeferencing with Plug-and-Play NLP Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though no longer legally enforceable, racial covenants in twentieth-century property deeds continue to shape spatial and socioeconomic inequalities. Understanding this legacy requires identifying racially restrictive language and geolocating affected properties. The Mapping Prejudice project addresses this by engaging volunteers on the Zooniverse crowdsourcing platform to transcribe covenants from scanned deeds and link them to modern parcel maps using transcribed legal descriptions. While the project has explored automation, it values crowdsourcing for its social impact and technical advantages. Historically, Mapping Prejudice relied on lexicon-based searching and, more recently, fuzzy matching to flag suspected covenants. However, fuzzy matching has increased false positives, burdening volunteers and raising scalability concerns. Additionally, while many properties can be mapped automatically, others still require time-intensive manual geolocation.
  We present a human-centered computing approach with two plug-and-play NLP pipelines: (1) a context-aware text labeling model that flags racially restrictive language with high precision and (2) a georeferencing module that extracts geographic descriptions from deeds and resolves them to real-world locations. Evaluated on historical deed documents from six counties in Minnesota and Wisconsin, our system reduces false positives in racial term detection by 25.96% while maintaining 91.73% recall and achieves 85.58% georeferencing accuracy within 1x1 square-mile ranges. These tools enhance document filtering and enrich spatial annotations, accelerating volunteer participation and reducing manual cleanup while strengthening public engagement.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of User Needs and Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing ubiquity of conversational AI highlights the need for frameworks that capture not only users' instrumental goals but also the situated, adaptive, and social practices through which they achieve them. Existing taxonomies of conversational behavior either overgeneralize, remain domain-specific, or reduce interactions to narrow dialogue functions. To address this gap, we introduce the Taxonomy of User Needs and Actions (TUNA), an empirically grounded framework developed through iterative qualitative analysis of 1193 human-AI conversations, supplemented by theoretical review and validation across diverse contexts. TUNA organizes user actions into a three-level hierarchy encompassing behaviors associated with information seeking, synthesis, procedural guidance, content creation, social interaction, and meta-conversation. By centering user agency and appropriation practices, TUNA enables multi-scale evaluation, supports policy harmonization across products, and provides a backbone for layering domain-specific taxonomies. This work contributes a systematic vocabulary for describing AI use, advancing both scholarly understanding and practical design of safer, more responsive, and more accountable conversational systems.</description>

      <title>The Feature Understandability Scale for Human-Centred Explainable AI: Assessing Tabular Feature Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly pervasive and powerful, the ability to audit AI-based systems is growing in importance. However, explainability for artificial intelligence systems is not a one-size-fits-all solution; different target audiences have varying requirements and expectations for explanations. While various approaches to explainability have been proposed, most explainable artificial intelligence methods for tabular data focus on explaining the outputs of supervised machine learning models using the input features. However, a user's ability to understand an explanation depends on their understanding of such features. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the system designer to try to pre-select understandable features for producing a global explanation of an ML model. Unfortunately, no measure currently exists to assess the degree to which a user understands a given input feature. This work introduces two psychometrically validated scales that quantitatively seek to assess users' understanding of tabular input features for supervised classification problems. Specifically, these scales, one for numerical and one for categorical data, each with two factors and comprising 8 and 9 items, aim to assign a score to each input feature, effectively producing a rank, and allowing for the quantification of feature prioritisation. A confirmatory factor analysis demonstrates a strong relationship between such items and a good fit of the two-factor structure for each scale. This research presents a novel method for assessing understanding and outlines potential applications in the domain of explainable artificial intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As robotic technologies evolve, their potential in artistic creation becomes an increasingly relevant topic of inquiry. This study explores how professional abstract artists perceive and experience co-creative interactions with an autonomous painting robotic arm. Eight artists engaged in six painting sessions -- three with a human partner, followed by three with the robot -- and subsequently participated in semi-structured interviews analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis. Human-human interactions were described as intuitive, dialogic, and emotionally engaging, whereas human-robot sessions felt more playful and reflective, offering greater autonomy and prompting for novel strategies to overcome the system's limitations. This work offers one of the first empirical investigations into artists' lived experiences with a robot, highlighting the value of long-term engagement and a multidisciplinary approach to human-robot co-creation.</description>

      <title>Make the Fastest Faster: Importance Mask Synthesis for Interactive Volume Visualization using Reconstruction Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualizing a large-scale volumetric dataset with high resolution is challenging due to the substantial computational time and space complexity. Recent deep learning-based image inpainting methods significantly improve rendering latency by reconstructing a high-resolution image for visualization in constant time on GPU from a partially rendered image where only a portion of pixels go through the expensive rendering pipeline. However, existing solutions need to render every pixel of either a predefined regular sampling pattern or an irregular sample pattern predicted from a low-resolution image rendering. Both methods require a significant amount of expensive pixel-level rendering. In this work, we provide Importance Mask Learning (IML) and Synthesis (IMS) networks, which are the first attempts to directly synthesize important regions of the regular sampling pattern from the user's view parameters, to further minimize the number of pixels to render by jointly considering the dataset, user behavior, and the downstream reconstruction neural network. Our solution is a unified framework to handle various types of inpainting methods through the proposed differentiable compaction/decompaction layers. Experiments show our method can further improve the overall rendering latency of state-of-the-art volume visualization methods using reconstruction neural network for free when rendering scientific volumetric datasets. Our method can also directly optimize the off-the-shelf pre-trained reconstruction neural networks without elongated retraining.</description>

      <title>Student-AI Interaction in an LLM-Empowered Learning Environment: A Cluster Analysis of Engagement Profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational practice enables personalized learning by accommodating diverse learner behaviors. This study explored diverse learner profiles within a multi-agent, LLM-empowered learning environment. Data was collected from 312 undergraduate students at a university in China as they participated in a six-module course. Based on hierarchical cluster analyses of system profiles and student-AI interactive dialogues, we found that students exhibit varied behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement tendencies. This analysis allowed us to identify two types of dropouts (early dropouts and stagnating interactors) and three completer profiles (active questioners, responsive navigators, and lurkers). The results showed that high levels of interaction do not always equate to productive learning and vice versa. Prior knowledge significantly influenced interaction patterns and short-term learning benefits. Further analysis of the human-AI dialogues revealed that some students actively engaged in knowledge construction, while others displayed a high frequency of regulatory behaviors. Notably, both groups of students achieved comparable learning gains, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-agent learning environment in supporting personalized learning. These results underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of engagement in human-AI collaborative learning and provide practical implications for the design of adaptive educational systems.</description>

      <title>Why AI Agents Still Need You: Findings from Developer-Agent Collaborations in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software Engineering Agents (SWE agents) can autonomously perform development tasks on benchmarks like SWE Bench, but still face challenges when tackling complex and ambiguous real-world tasks. Consequently, SWE agents are often designed to allow interactivity with developers, enabling collaborative problem-solving. To understand how developers collaborate with SWE agents and the barriers they face in such interactions, we observed 19 developers using an in-IDE agent to resolve 33 open issues in repositories to which they had previously contributed. Participants successfully resolved about half of these issues, with those solving issues incrementally having greater success than those using a one-shot approach. Participants who actively collaborated with the agent and iterated on its outputs were also more successful, though they faced challenges in trusting the agent's responses and collaborating on debugging and testing. Our findings suggest that to facilitate successful collaborations, both SWE agents and developers should actively contribute to tasks throughout all stages of the software development process. SWE agents can enable this by challenging and engaging in discussions with developers, rather than being conclusive or sycophantic.</description>

      <title>A Mega-Study of Digital Twins Reveals Strengths, Weaknesses and Opportunities for Further Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital representations of individuals ("digital twins") promise to transform social science and decision-making. Yet it remains unclear whether such twins truly mirror the people they emulate. We conducted 19 preregistered studies with a representative U.S. panel and their digital twins, each constructed from rich individual-level data, enabling direct comparisons between human and twin behavior across a wide range of domains and stimuli (including never-seen-before ones). Twins reproduced individual responses with 75% accuracy and seemingly low correlation with human answers (approximately 0.2). However, this apparently high accuracy was no higher than that achieved by generic personas based on demographics only. In contrast, correlation improved when twins incorporated detailed personal information, even outperforming traditional machine learning benchmarks that require additional data. Twins exhibited systematic strengths and weaknesses - performing better in social and personality domains, but worse in political ones - and were more accurate for participants with higher education, higher income, and moderate political views and religious attendance. Together, these findings delineate both the promise and the current limits of digital twins: they capture some relative differences among individuals but not yet the unique judgments of specific people. All data and code are publicly available to support the further development and evaluation of digital twin pipelines.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Depth-Aware Method For Embodied Reference Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and reliable referent detection.</description>
