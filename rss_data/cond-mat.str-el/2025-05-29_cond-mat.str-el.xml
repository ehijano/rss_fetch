      <title>Triplon Bose-Einstein condensation and proximate magnetism in dimerized antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimerized quantum magnets provide a useful arena for novel quantum states and phases transitions with the singlet-triplet type of triplon excitations. Here we study the triplon physics and the Bose-Einstein condensation in two isostructural dimerized antiferromagnets $A$Cu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ ($A$ = Hg, Cd). With the systematic measurements, we demonstrate a dimer singlet ground state in HgCu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ with a triplon gap $\sim$ 7.9 K and a triplon Bose-Einstein condensation with an antiferromagnetic order in CdCu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ below 4.4 K. We further adopt the bond-operator technique and show that the elemental replacement preserves the Hamiltonian and allows the study in a unified theoretical framework with tunable interdimer and intradimer interactions on the opposite sides of the quantum critical point. With the peculiar Cu$_2$O$_8$ dimer configuration and effective ferromagnetic interdimer interaction, $A$Cu(SeO$_3$)$_2$ is distinguished from other $S$ = 1/2 dimerized antiferromagnets. Our results represent a global understanding of the magnetic ground states as well as the magnetic transitions in the dimerized magnets of this unusual crystal structure.</description>

      <title>Valence-bonds, spin liquids and unconventional criticality in a 1D Kondo insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional multi-orbital Kondo lattice model and show that by tuning the kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons it is possible to stabilize Kondo insulators with non-trivial spin physics. In particular, depending on the size of the exchange coupling between the local moments, we find kinetic-energy-driven transitions between a featureless Kondo insulator and a valence-bond solid or a gapless spin liquid. We also provide evidence for an unconventional continuous phase transition between two featureless Kondo insulators distinguished by their quantum numbers under reflection symmetry.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic electron damping and energy gap in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The many body electron-electron interaction in cuprates causes the broadening of the electronic bands in \textit{\textbf{k}}-space, leading to a deviation from the standard Fermi liquid. While a \textit{\textbf{k}}-dependent anisotropic electronic scattering (\textit{\textbf{k}}-DAES) has been assessed by photoemission, its fingerprint in \textit{\textbf{Q}}-space has been scarcely considered. Here, we explore the \textit{\textbf{Q}}-dependent electron dynamics in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ through the evolution of low-energy charge excitations as measured by resonant inelastic x ray scattering (RIXS). In the normal state, the RIXS spectra display a continuum of excitations down to 0~meV, while the superconducting state features a spectral weight suppression below 80 meV without any enhancement at higher energies. To interpret the energy and \textit{\textbf{Q}}-evolution of our data, we introduce a phenomenological expression of the charge susceptibility by including the \textit{\textbf{k}}-DAES. We show that only the charge susceptibility with \textit{\textbf{k}}-DAES captures the RIXS data, highlighting the importance of \textit{\textbf{k}}-DAES when describing the \textit{\textbf{Q}}-dependence of charge excitations from 0 to few eV scale. Furthermore, we also find that the inclusion of \textit{\textbf{k}}-DAES is essential when quantitative parameters such as the electronic energy gap are extracted from RIXS data.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Many-Body Scars in 2D Quantum Gauge Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Sr$_2$NbO$_4$: A $4d$ analogue of the layered perovskite Sr$_2$VO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21995v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the layered perovskite Sr$_2$NbO$_4$, a 4$d$ analogue of Sr$_2$VO$_4$, which remains an unsolved puzzle with a possible intriguing hidden magnetic order. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the robust thermodynamic stability and exfoliability of Sr$_2$NbO$_4$, suggesting potential applications as a 2D material. Imperfect Fermi surface nesting indicates instabilities that may drive symmetry lowering, charge/orbital density waves, or superconductivity. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations reveal moderate mass renormalization $(m^*/m\sim1.3)$ and an itinerant character of magnetism with strong longitudinal spin fluctuations. The exchange interaction is dominated by in-plane ferromagnetic coupling with much weaker interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effects at a Spin-Flop Transition in the Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the experimentally detected features in the low-temperature behavior of the magnetization in an external magnetic field perpendicular to the layers of manganese ions of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ are due to quantum effects induced by the off-diagonal nature of the trigonal component of the crystal field. In this case, the anomalous increase in the magnetization of the material before the spin-flop transition, as well as after it in the phase of "collapsed" sublattices, is explained by the suppression of contributions from quantum effects. The comparison of the results of the theoretical analysis with experimental data has made it possible to refine the parameters of the effective spin model of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and to establish the important role of the noted trigonal component.</description>

      <title>Unified Magnetoelectric Mechanism for Spin Splitting in Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a relativistic magnetoelectric correction that unifies the understanding of spin splitting (SS) in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. Based on Dirac theory, we show that local electric multipoles coupled to magnetic moments govern SS across compensated magnets, leading to quadrupole-, dipole-, or monopole-driven regimes. Our model predicts momentum-dependent and momentum-independent SS, reconciling seemingly distinct phenomena such as altermagnetism and the spin Zeeman effect. This work establishes a general physical mechanism for SS beyond conventional Zeeman and Rashba paradigms.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of 2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\times 2}, U(1)) / \left( H^2(G, U(1)) \right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate the correspondence between field-theoretic and lattice descriptions, we further analyze $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ cluster state models as concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Robustness of topological edge states in open alternating spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the Haldane spin-$1$ chain and dimerized chains of
  spin-$1/2$ exhibit topologically protected edge states that
  are robust against specific perturbations. Recently, such spin
  chains have been specifically assembled on surfaces and we
  investigate here the robustness of these edge states against
  coupling to the surface. Since no physical system can be considered perfectly isolated, it
  is crucial to examine whether topological robustness is maintained in the
  presence of environmental coupling.
  We apply exact diagonalization to a Lindblad master equation that couples an
  alternating Heisenberg spin chain based on spins $1/2$ to a surface via
  various jump operators. The robustness of topological states is assessed via the
  time evolution of quantities such as the ground-state degeneracy, correlation
  function, entropy, and magnetization of edge states.
  We investigate chains built from dimers with antiferromagnetic and
  ferromagnetic intra-dimer coupling, which resemble
  Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Haldane models, resp., and assess the
  impact of $z$-axis anisotropy and longer-ranged couplings. Generally,
  we find that signatures of topological properties are
  more robust in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like chains than in
  Haldane-like chains.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear time-reversal symmetry breaking in kagome spin ice HoAgGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome spin ice is an intriguing class of spin systems constituted by in-plane Ising spins with ferromagnetic interaction residing on the kagome lattice, theoretically predicted to host a plethora of magnetic transitions and excitations. In particular, different variants of kagome spin ice models can exhibit different sequences of symmetry breaking upon cooling from the paramagnetic to the fully ordered ground state. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the frustrated intermetallic HoAgGe stands as a faithful solid-state realization of kagome spin ice. Here we use single crystal neutron diffuse scattering to map the spin ordering of HoAgGe at various temperatures more accurately and surprisingly find that the ordering sequence appears to be different from previously known scenarios: From the paramagnetic state, the system first enters a partially ordered state with fluctuating magnetic charges, in contrast to a charge-ordered paramagnetic phase before reaching the fully ordered state. Through state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations and scaling analyses using a quasi-2D model for the distorted Kagome spin ice in HoAgGe, we elucidate a single three-dimensional (3D) XY phase transition into the ground state with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). However, the 3D XY transition has a long crossover tail before the fluctuating magnetic charges fully order. More interestingly, we find both experimentally and theoretically that the TRS breaking phase of HoAgGe features an unusual, hysteretic response: In spite of their vanishing magnetization, the two time-reversal partners are distinguished and selected by a nonlinear magnetic susceptibility tied to the kagome ice rule. Our discovery not only unveils a new symmetry breaking hierarchy of kagome spin ice, but also demonstrates the potential of TRS-breaking frustrated spin systems for information technology applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of an anisotropic Dicke model by revealing the non-analyticity induced by underlying exceptional points (EPs). We find that the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.</description>

      <title>Disturbing news about the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. For $N=3$, we investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch. We compute the anomalous dimension of the lightest operator that could participate in recombination, and find that it remains too heavy to allow for this scenario. This suggests that the NLSM $O(3)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(3)$ CFT, and may instead describe an alternative universality class, such as the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, corresponding to the N\'eel-VBS phase transition in $3$D. We also discuss how to generalize this analysis to $N&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Family of Multilayer Graphene Superconductors with Tunable Chirality: Momentum-Space Vortices Forged in the Berry-Ring of Fire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in rhombohedrally-stacked multilayer graphene heterostructures have reported signatures of chiral superconductivity, emerging from a spin and valley-polarized normal state with broken time-reversal symmetry and an associated anomalous Hall effect. These findings bring into focus the role of the electronic Bloch wavefunction and the quantum geometric tensor in determining the superconducting pairing channel. In this work, we examine superconducting instabilities of a model of $N$-layer rhombohedral graphene that possesses an enhanced Berry curvature distribution on an extended ring in momentum space $-$ that we dub the 'Berry-ring of fire' $-$ in the presence of an isotropic attractive interaction with a parametrically controlled spatial range. We determine that local interactions favor a $N$-fold winding in the order parameter phase for odd-$N$ layered systems, with even-$N$ layers requiring a spatially extended attraction range to achieve pairing. For generic interaction lengths, we discover a family of chiral superconductors and, remarkably, momentum-space vortices nucleated on the Berry-ring of fire. The existence of these vortices can be traced to a momentum-space flux quantization condition involving the Berry curvature, with the phase winding dictated by a combination of the Berry flux and a 'statistical flux' to enforce Fermi-Dirac statistics. Such an order parameter structure allows for the possibility of in-situ tuning between various chiral superconducting phases through changes in the electron density or the displacement field. We discuss ways in which these predictions can be experimentally tested and potentially exploited in future devices.</description>

      <title>Resurgence Analysis of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at large charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fixed point of the three-dimensional NJL model in a double-scaling limit where both the charge $Q$ and the number of fermion flavors $N$ become large with a fixed ratio $q=Q/(2N)$. While a similar analysis has been performed for the bosonic O(N) model, fermionic models pose new challenges. In this work, we systematically explore the CFT spectrum in both the large and small $q$ limits beyond the first few orders, and perform a resurgence analysis. Through this approach, we identify the exponential corrections that relate the convergent small-$q$ expansion to the asymptotic large-$q$ behavior.

      <title>Enhanced Neel temperature and unusual thermal expansion in flux-grown FeCrAs crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report results from our experimental investigation of the distorted-kagome compound FeCrAs. For this work, we developed a procedure using tin metal as a flux to produce needlelike crystals. The crystals were characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction as well as measurements of magnetization, electrical transport, and heat capacity. The physical behaviors are generally similar to published results on crystals grown from a stoichiometric melt with two notable exceptions. The Sommerfeld coefficient is found to be 18 mJ/K2/mol, a little more than half of the previously reported value, and the Neel temperature is found to be 150 K, about 25K higher than in previous reports. The reason for these discrepancies are uncertain, but they may be related to differences in stoichiometry or disorder; it is expected that the Cr/Fe ratio has some variability in this compound. In addition, we find unusual thermal expansion behavior, with an anomaly at the Neel temperature and nearly temperature independent thermal expansion along the hexagonal c-axis above this transition. This suggests significant spin-lattice coupling, which may provide insight into non-metallic transport properties that have been associated with anomalous charge carrier scattering.</description>

      <title>Magnetic $2\pi$ domain walls for tunable Majorana devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying realistic platforms capable of controlled operations with Majorana bound states is a key challenge in the study of topological superconductivity. Among the most promising proposals are magnet-superconductor hybrid devices, which employ magnetic textures to engineer regions of non-trivial topology. Here, we consider the remarkably simple case of $2\pi$ domain walls in a magnetic ribbon placed on a superconducting substrate. We show that for properly chosen parameters, such domain walls generate topological quasi-one dimensional superconducting wires and give rise to localized Majorana bound states at the ribbon edges. Magnetic $2\pi$ domain walls are easily created and controlled with existing experimental techniques, thus providing a versatile platform for Majorana manipulations.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometry control and epitaxial growth of AgCrSe2 thin films by pulsed-laser deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on epitaxial growth in thin-film synthesis of a polar magnetic semiconductor AgCrSe2 on lattice-matched yttria-stabilized zirconia (111) substrate by pulsed-layer deposition (PLD). By using Ag-rich PLD target to compensate for Ag deficiency in thin films, the nucleation of impurity phases is suppressed, resulting in the c-axis-oriented and single-phase AgCrSe2 thin film. Structural analysis using x-ray diffraction and cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals epitaxial growth with the presence of both twisted and polar domains. Optical absorbance spectrum and magnetization measurements show absorption edge at around 0.84 eV and magnetic transition temperature at 41 K, respectively. These values are consistent with the reported values of direct bandgap and N\'eel temperature of bulk AgCrSe2, reflecting a single-phase and stoichiometric feature of the obtained film. Our demonstration of epitaxial thin-film growth of AgCrSe2 serves as a bedrock for exploration of its potential thermoelectric and spintronic functionalities at surface or heterointerfaces.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood.
  Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum-observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces.
  Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Magnon thermal Hall effect in insulating antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we theoretically discuss thermal Hall effect of magnons in insulating N\'{e}el ordered antiferromagnets at zero external magnetic field. We show that non-zero thermal Hall effect requires absence of any symmetry between the two sublattices. The thermal Hall effect of magnons will be non-zero by a virtue of the spin-momentum splitting of the magnon spectrum due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as well as anisotropic second-nearest exchange interaction different in the two sublattices, both corresponding to the broken symmetry. We construct a theoretical model in which an external electric field may change the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic system thus altering the thermal Hall effect of magnons.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics and dark particle in a weak-coupled quantum Ising ladder with $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergent Ising$_h^2$ integrability is anticipated in a quantum Ising ladder composed of two weakly-coupled critical transverse field Ising chains. The system is remarkable for including eight types of massive relativistic particles, with their scattering matrix and mass spectrum characterized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ Lie algebra. In this article, by computing the spin dynamical structure factors following analytical form factor approach, we clearly identify dispersive single-particle excitations of (anti-) soliton and breathers as well as their multi-particle continua in the spectra, which is further confirmed by the numerical simulations. We show that the selection rule inherent in the parity and topological charge of the theory, causes a significant result that charge-parity-odd particles, termed as dark particles, cannot be directly excited from the ground state through any local or quasi-local operations. This in turn suggests the long lifetime of the lightest dark particle.</description>

      <title>Geometric expansion of fluctuations and average shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this letter, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frustrated spin models may lead to the formation of both classical non-collinear spin structures and unique quantum phases including highly entangled quantum spin liquids. Here, we study the entanglement and spatial quantum correlations in linear spin-wave theory around a classical spin-spiral ground state. We find that the entanglement between pairs of sites is short-ranged, and is completely absent in certain cases. In contrast, the entanglement hidden in multi-site clusters is peaked close to phase transitions and shows an asymptotic behavior modulated by the period of the magnetic structure. These findings motivate further exploring the connection in the entanglement properties of fully quantum and of quasiclassical spin models.</description>

      <title>Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit formed by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction $U$ and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped due to electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to be a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The effects of Hund's coupling $J_H$ on the low-energy spectra are also studied via exact diagonalization. The proposed low-energy theory for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is found to be valid in a wide range of $U$ and $J_H$.</description>

Abstract: Electric current generation and its dissipation are important physical processes. It ranges from the one follows the Ohm's law to superconductivity. Recently, it has been shown that the gradient of the chemical potential force arises from the time-component of the Berry connection from many-electron wave functions, and we consider its importance for the electric current conduction in this work. We first show that it rectifies the odd explanation in Joule heating by electric current in a metallic wire: Poynting's theorem explains that the energy for the Joule heating enters from the outside of the wire as radiation. We show that this energy is supplied by the chemical potential gradient generated by the battery connection. Next, we consider the discharging of a capacitor problem where the capacitor plays a role of a battery; and the tunneling supercurrent through the Josephson junction problem, where the original derivation did not include the capacitor contribution. Lastly, we argue that the gauge fluctuation of the time-component of the Berry connection included in the chemical potential gradient force might explain the Planckian dissipation observed in high transition temperature cuprate superconductors. The present work suggests the rethinking of the gauge invariance in Maxwell's equations.</description>

Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) have demonstrated considerable success as variational quantum states; however, their representational power remains incompletely understood. In this work, we present an analytical proof that RBMs can exactly and efficiently represent stabilizer code states (a class of highly entangled quantum states that are central to quantum error correction). Given a set of stabilizer generators, we develop an efficient algorithm to determine both the RBM architecture and the exact values of its parameters. Our findings provide new insights into the expressive power of RBMs, highlighting their capability to encode highly entangled states, and may serve as a useful tool for the classical simulation of quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Observation of giant nonlinear Hall conductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a system of two-dimensional electrons, a combination of broken symmetry, interactions, and nontrivial topology can conspire to give rise to a nonlinear transport regime, where electric current density scales as the square of electric field. This regime has become a venue for exciting discoveries such as the nonlinear Hall effect and diode-like nonreciprocal transport. However, interpretation of experimental data is challenging in the nonlinear regime as DC transport is described by a rank-3 conductivity tensor with 6 free parameters. Here, we resolve this challenge by analytically solving for the nonlinear potential distribution across the disk sample for an arbitrary linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors. This allows us to unambiguously extract all components of the nonlinear tensor from experimental measurement. Using this novel tool, we identify giant nonlinear Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene. Our methodology provides the first systematic framework for interpreting nonlinear transport and uncovers a new route towards understanding quasi-2D materials.</description>
