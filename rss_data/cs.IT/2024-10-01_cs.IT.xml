      <title>Movable Antenna Enabled Near-Field Communications: Channel Modeling and Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology offers promising potential to enhance wireless communication by allowing flexible antenna movement. To maximize spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), larger movable regions are required, which may render the conventional far-field assumption for channels between transceivers invalid. In light of it, we investigate in this paper MA-enabled near-field communications, where a base station (BS) with multiple movable subarrays serves multiple users, each equipped with a fixed-position antenna (FPA). First, we extend the field response channel model for MA systems to the near-field propagation scenario. Next, we examine MA-aided multiuser communication systems under both digital and analog beamforming architectures. For digital beamforming, spatial division multiple access (SDMA) is utilized, where an upper bound on the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) across users is derived in closed form. A low-complexity algorithm based on zero-forcing (ZF) is then proposed to jointly optimize the antenna position vector (APV) and digital beamforming matrix (DBFM) to approach this bound. For analog beamforming, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is employed, and an upper bound on the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among users is derived. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to iteratively optimize the APV, analog beamforming vector (ABFV), and power allocation until convergence. For both architectures, we further explore MA design strategies based on statistical channel state information (CSI), with the APV updated less frequently to reduce the antenna movement overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve performance close to the derived bounds and also outperform the benchmark schemes using dense or sparse arrays with FPAs.</description>

      <title>LDPC Codes for Quantitative Group Testing with a Non-Binary Alphabet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a novel scheme based on LDPC codes for quantitative group testing. The key underlying idea is to augment the bipartite graph by introducing hidden non-binary variables to strengthen the message-passing decoder. This is achieved by grouping items into bundles of size q within the test matrix, while keeping the testing procedure unaffected. The decoder, inspired by some works on counter braids, passes lower and upper bounds on the bundle values along the edges of the graph, with the gap between the two shrinking with the decoder iterations. Through a density evolution analysis and finite length simulations, we show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms its binary counterpart with limited increase in complexity.</description>

      <title>Alternating Maximization Algorithm for Mismatch Capacity with Oblivious Relaying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An approach is established for maximizing the Lower bound on the Mismatch capacity (hereafter abbreviated as LM rate), a key performance bound in mismatched decoding, by optimizing the channel input probability distribution. Under a fixed channel input probability distribution, the computation of the corresponding LM rate is a convex optimization problem. When optimizing the channel input probability distribution, however, the corresponding optimization problem adopts a max-min formulation, which is generally non-convex and is intractable with standard approaches. To solve this problem, a novel dual form of the LM rate is proposed, thereby transforming the max-min formulation into an equivalent double maximization formulation. This new formulation leads to a maximization problem setup wherein each individual optimization direction is convex. Consequently, an alternating maximization algorithm is established to solve the resultant maximization problem setup. Each step of the algorithm only involves a closed-form iteration, which is efficiently implemented with standard optimization procedures. Numerical experiments show the proposed approach for optimizing the LM rate leads to noticeable rate gains.</description>

      <title>Improving Achievability of Cache-Aided Private Variable-Length Coding with Zero Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A statistical cache-aided compression problem with a privacy constraint is studied, where a server has access to a database of $N$ files, $(Y_1,...,Y_N)$, each of size $F$ bits and is linked through a shared channel to $K$ users, where each has access to a local cache memory of size $MF$ bits. During the placement phase, the server fills the users' caches without prior knowledge of their demands, while the delivery phase takes place after the users send their demands to the server. We assume that each file in database $Y_i$ is arbitrarily correlated with a private attribute $X$, and an adversary is assumed to have access to the shared channel. The users and the server have access to a shared key $W$. The goal is to design the cache contents and the delivered message $\cal C$ such that the average length of $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized, while satisfying: i. The response $\cal C$ does not reveal any information about $X$, i.e., $I(X;\mathcal{C})=0$; ii. User $i$ can decode its demand, $Y_{d_i}$, by using the shared key $W$, $\cal C$, and its local cache $Z_i$. In a previous work, we have proposed a variable-length coding scheme that combines privacy-aware compression with coded caching techniques. In this paper, we propose a new achievability scheme using minimum entropy coupling concept and a greedy entropy-based algorithm. We show that the proposed scheme improves the previous results. Moreover, considering two special cases we improve the obtained bounds using the common information concept.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shannon information and Shannon entropy are undoubtedly the most commonly used quantitative measures of information, cropping up in the literature across a broad variety of disciplines, often in contexts unrelated to coding theory. Here, we generalize the original idea behind Shannon entropy as the cost of encoding a sample of a random variable in terms of the required codeword length, to arbitrary loss functions by considering the optimally achievable loss given a certain level of knowledge about the random variable. By formalizing knowledge in terms of the measure-theoretic notion of sub-$\sigma$-algebras, we arrive at a general notion of uncertainty reduction that includes entropy and information as special cases: entropy is the reduction of uncertainty from no (or partial) knowledge to full knowledge about a random variable, whereas information is uncertainty reduction from no (or partial) knowledge to partial knowledge. As examples, we get Shannon information and entropy when measuring loss in terms of message length, variance for square error loss, and more generally, for the Bregman loss, we get Bregman information. Moreover, we show that appealing properties of Shannon entropy and information extend to the general case, including well-known relations involving the KL divergence, which are extended to divergences of proper scoring rules.</description>

      <title>Time Efficiency of BATS Coding on Wireless Relay Network With Overhearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless relay network is a solution to extend the reach of a wireless connection by installing a relay node between the source node and the sink node. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmission, the sink node has a chance to receive part of the data sent by the source node. In this paper, we apply a network coding scheme called BATS codes on a wireless relay network where the relay node has a stable power supply, so that we can aim for the best decoding time instead of minimizing the number of transmissions for saving energy. We optimize the time efficiency that maximize the average decoding rate per unit time by some heuristics, and bring out a message that it is not optimal to set an average number of recoded packets per batch at the relay node equals the number of packets per batch sent by the source node.</description>

      <title>Age of Gossip with the Push-Pull Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a wireless network where a source generates packets and forwards them to a network containing $n$ nodes. The nodes in the network use the asynchronous push, pull or push-pull gossip communication protocols to maintain the most recent updates from the source. We use the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information in the network. Prior to this work, only the push gossiping protocol has been studied for age of information analysis. In this paper, we use the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) framework to obtain recursive equations for the expected version age of sets of nodes in the time limit. We then show that the pull and push-pull protocols can achieve constant version age, while it is already known that the push protocol can only achieve logarithmic version age. We then show that the push-pull protocol performs better than the push and the pull protocol. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations to evaluate these results.</description>

      <title>CURATE: Scaling-up Differentially Private Causal Graph Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal Graph Discovery (CGD) is the process of estimating the underlying probabilistic graphical model that represents joint distribution of features of a dataset. CGD-algorithms are broadly classified into two categories: (i) Constraint-based algorithms (outcome depends on conditional independence (CI) tests), (ii) Score-based algorithms (outcome depends on optimized score-function). Since, sensitive features of observational data is prone to privacy-leakage, Differential Privacy (DP) has been adopted to ensure user privacy in CGD. Adding same amount of noise in this sequential-natured estimation process affects the predictive performance of the algorithms. As initial CI tests in constraint-based algorithms and later iterations of the optimization process of score-based algorithms are crucial, they need to be more accurate, less noisy. Based on this key observation, we present CURATE (CaUsal gRaph AdapTivE privacy), a DP-CGD framework with adaptive privacy budgeting. In contrast to existing DP-CGD algorithms with uniform privacy budgeting across all iterations, CURATE allows adaptive privacy budgeting by minimizing error probability (for constraint-based), maximizing iterations of the optimization problem (for score-based) while keeping the cumulative leakage bounded. To validate our framework, we present a comprehensive set of experiments on several datasets and show that CURATE achieves higher utility compared to existing DP-CGD algorithms with less privacy-leakage.</description>

      <title>Sequencing the Neurome: Towards Scalable Exact Parameter Reconstruction of Black-Box Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring the exact parameters of a neural network with only query access is an NP-Hard problem, with few practical existing algorithms. Solutions would have major implications for security, verification, interpretability, and understanding biological networks. The key challenges are the massive parameter space, and complex non-linear relationships between neurons. We resolve these challenges using two insights. First, we observe that almost all networks used in practice are produced by random initialization and first order optimization, an inductive bias that drastically reduces the practical parameter space. Second, we present a novel query generation algorithm that produces maximally informative samples, letting us untangle the non-linear relationships efficiently. We demonstrate reconstruction of a hidden network containing over 1.5 million parameters, and of one 7 layers deep, the largest and deepest reconstructions to date, with max parameter difference less than 0.0001, and illustrate robustness and scalability across a variety of architectures, datasets, and training procedures.</description>

      <title>Sharing-Based Channel Access Procedure For Next Generation of Wireless LAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new channel access procedure to mitigate the channel access contention in next generation of Wireless Local-Area Networks (WLANs) by allowing cooperation among devices belonging to same network, while maintaining high flexibility in terms of how each device may contend the medium. After introducing the details of the proposed procedure, which is here referred to as sharing-based protocol, an analytical analysis is provided to compare it with the two state-of-art protocols currently adopted in IEEE 802.11 standard, i.e, Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA)-based and trigger-based protocol. In this regards, closed form expressions are derived to evaluate the success probability of channel access for each protocol. In order to show the merit of the proposed procedure, a comprehensive system level analysis is also provided, which highlights that the proposed procedure outperforms the two state-of-art protocols in terms of mitigating the End-to-End (E2E) delay and allowing a better spectrum utilization by reducing the overall congestion in the system.</description>

      <title>Generalization Error of the Tilted Empirical Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalization error (risk) of a supervised statistical learning algorithm quantifies its prediction ability on previously unseen data. Inspired by exponential tilting, Li et al. (2021) proposed the tilted empirical risk as a non-linear risk metric for machine learning applications such as classification and regression problems. In this work, we examine the generalization error of the tilted empirical risk. In particular, we provide uniform and information-theoretic bounds on the tilted generalization error, defined as the difference between the population risk and the tilted empirical risk, with a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the number of training samples. Furthermore, we study the solution to the KL-regularized expected tilted empirical risk minimization problem and derive an upper bound on the expected tilted generalization error with a convergence rate of $O(1/n)$.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Stable LLM Training in Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As mobile devices increasingly become focal points for advanced applications, edge computing presents a viable solution to their inherent computational limitations, particularly in deploying large language models (LLMs). However, despite the advancements in edge computing, significant challenges remain in efficient training and deploying LLMs due to the computational demands and data privacy concerns associated with these models. This paper explores a collaborative training framework that integrates mobile users with edge servers to optimize resource allocation, thereby enhancing both performance and efficiency. Our approach leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, allowing mobile users to adjust the initial layers of the LLM while edge servers handle the more demanding latter layers. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption and delay during training. We also address the common issue of instability in model performance by incorporating stability enhancements into our objective function. Through novel fractional programming technique, we achieve a stationary point for the formulated problem. Simulations demonstrate that our method reduces the energy consumption as well as the latency, and increases the reliability of LLMs across various mobile settings.</description>

      <title>Packet Aggregation May Harm Batched Network Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batched network coding (BNC) is a solution to multi-hop transmission on networks with packet loss. To be compatible with the existing infrastructure, BNC is usually implemented over UDP. A single error bit will probably result in discarding the packet. UDP-Lite is a variant of UDP that supports partial checksums. As long as the data covered by the checksum is correct, damaged payload will be delivered. With UDP-Lite, we can cope with other techniques such as payload aggregation of BNC packets to reduce the protocol overhead, and forward error correction to combat against bit errors. Unlike traditional transmissions, BNC has a loss resilience feature and there are dependencies between BNC packets. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary investigation on BNC over UDP-Lite. We show that aggregating as much as we can is not always the best strategy, and a hop-by-hop distributed efficiency optimization approach may lead to a worse throughput compared with the scheme without aggregation in a long network. These unnatural results caution that a casual integration of techniques with BNC can be harmful, and give us hints on future research directions.</description>

      <title>A physics-compliant diagonal representation for wireless channels parametrized by beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parametrization of wireless channels by so-called "beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces" (BD-RIS) is mathematically characterized by a matrix whose off-diagonal entries are partially or fully populated. Physically, this corresponds to tunable coupling mechanisms between the RIS elements that originate from the RIS control circuit. Here, we derive a physics-compliant diagonal representation for BD-RIS-parametrized channels. Recognizing that the RIS control circuit, irrespective of its detailed architecture, can always be represented as a multi-port network with auxiliary ports terminated by tunable individual loads, we physics-compliantly express the BD-RIS-parametrized channel as a multi-port chain cascade of i) radio environment, ii) static parts of the control circuit, and iii) individually tunable loads. Thus, the cascade of the former two systems is terminated by a system that is mathematically always characterized by a diagonal matrix. This physics-compliant diagonal representation implies that existing algorithms for channel estimation and optimization for conventional ("diagonal") RIS can be readily applied to BD-RIS scenarios. We demonstrate this in an experimentally grounded case study. Importantly, we highlight that, operationally, an ambiguous characterization of the cascade of radio environment and the static parts of the control circuit is required, but not the breakdown into the characteristics of its two constituent systems nor the lifting of the ambiguities. Nonetheless, we demonstrate how to derive or estimate the characteristics of the static parts of the control circuit for pedagogical purposes. The diagonal representation of BD-RIS-parametrized channels also enables their treatment with coupled-dipole-based models. We furthermore derive the assumptions under which the physics-compliant BD-RIS model simplifies to the widespread linear cascaded model.</description>

      <title>Multi-Antenna Coded Caching for Multi-Access Networks with Cyclic Wrap-Around</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores a multiple transmit antenna setting in a multi-access coded caching (MACC) network where each user accesses more than one cache. A MACC network has $K$ users and $K$ caches, and each user has access to $r &lt; K$ consecutive caches in a cyclic wrap-around manner. There are $L$ antennas at the server, and each cache has a normalized size of $M/N \leq 1$. The cyclic wrap-around MACC network with a single antenna at the server has been a well-investigated topic, and several coded caching schemes and improved lower bounds on the performance are known for the same. However, this MACC network has not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching literature. We study the multi-antenna MACC problem and propose a solution for the same by constructing a pair of arrays called caching and delivery arrays. We present three constructions of caching and delivery arrays for different scenarios and obtain corresponding multi-antenna MACC schemes for the same. Two schemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance under uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by matching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal multi-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number of users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$. Further, as a special case, one of the proposed schemes subsumes an existing optimal MACC scheme for the single-antenna setting.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Perspective on Random Access Efficiency for DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental limits of the recently proposed random access coverage depth problem for DNA data storage. Under this paradigm, it is assumed that the user information consists of $k$ information strands, which are encoded into $n$ strands via a generator matrix $G$. During the sequencing process, the strands are read uniformly at random, as each strand is available in a large number of copies. In this context, the random access coverage depth problem refers to the expected number of reads (i.e., sequenced strands) required to decode a specific information strand requested by the user. This problem heavily depends on the generator matrix $G$, and besides computing the expectation for different choices of $G$, the goal is to construct matrices that minimize the maximum expectation over all possible requested information strands, denoted by $T_{\max}(G)$. In this paper, we introduce new techniques to investigate the random access coverage depth problem, capturing its combinatorial nature and identifying the structural properties of generator matrices that are advantageous. We establish two general formulas to determine $T_{\max}(G)$ for arbitrary generator matrices. The first formula depends on the linear dependencies between columns of $G$, whereas the second formula takes into account recovery sets and their intersection structure. We also introduce the concept of recovery balanced codes and provide three sufficient conditions for a code to be recovery balanced. These conditions can be used to compute $T_{\max}(G)$ for various families of codes, such as MDS, simplex, Hamming, and binary Reed-Muller codes. Additionally, we study the performance of modified systematic MDS and simplex matrices, showing that the best results for $T_{\max}(G)$ are achieved with a specific combination of encoded strands and replication of the information strands.</description>

      <title>Ice-Filling: Near-Optimal Channel Estimation for Dense Array Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By deploying a large number of antennas with sub-half-wavelength spacing in a compact space, dense array systems(DASs) can fully unleash the multiplexing-and-diversity gains of limited apertures. To acquire these gains, accurate channel state information acquisition is necessary but challenging due to the large antenna numbers. To overcome this obstacle, this paper reveals that exploiting the high spatial correlation of DAS channels is crucial while designing the observation matrix for optimal/near-optimal channel estimation. Firstly, we prove that the observation matrix design is equivalent to a time-domain duality of multiple-input multiple-output precoding, which can be ideally addressed by the water-filling principle. For practical realizations, a novel ice-filling algorithm is proposed to design amplitude-and-phase controllable observation matrices, and a majorization-minimization algorithm is proposed to address the phase-only controllable case. Particularly, we prove that the ice-filling algorithm can be viewed as a ``quantized" water-filling algorithm. To support the sub-optimality of the proposed designs, we provide comprehensive analyses on the achievable mean square errors and their asymptotic expressions. Finally, numerical simulations verify that our proposed channel estimation designs can achieve the near-optimal performance and outperform existing approaches significantly.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the distributed broadcast problem within the context of network communications, a critical challenge in decentralized information dissemination. We put forth a novel hypergraph-based approach to address this issue, focusing on minimizing the number of broadcasts to ensure comprehensive data sharing among all network users. The key contributions of this work include the establishment of a general lower bound for the problem using the min-cut capacity of hypergraphs, and a distributed broadcast for quasi-trees (DBQT) algorithm tailored for the unique structure of quasi-trees, which is proven to be optimal. This paper advances both network communication strategies and hypergraph theory, with implications for a wide range of real-world applications, from vehicular and sensor networks to distributed storage systems.</description>

      <title>Converse Techniques for Identification via Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The model of identification via channels, introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. One such promising direction is message identification via channels, introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. Unlike in Shannon's classical model, where the receiver aims to determine which message was sent from a set of $M$ messages, message identification focuses solely on discerning whether a specific message $m$ was transmitted. The encoder can operate deterministically or through randomization, with substantial advantages observed particularly in the latter approach. While Shannon's model allows transmission of $M = 2^{nC}$ messages, Ahlswede and Dueck's model facilitates the identification of $M = 2^{2^{nC}}$ messages, exhibiting a double exponential growth in block length. In their seminal paper, Ahlswede and Dueck established the achievability and introduced a "soft" converse bound. Subsequent works have further refined this, culminating in a strong converse bound, applicable under specific conditions. Watanabe's contributions have notably enhanced the applicability of the converse bound. The aim of this survey is multifaceted: to grasp the formalism and proof techniques outlined in the aforementioned works, analyze Watanabe's converse, trace the evolution from earlier converses to Watanabe's, emphasizing key similarities and differences that underpin the enhancements. Furthermore, we explore the converse proof for message identification with feedback, also pioneered by Ahlswede and Dueck. By elucidating how their approaches were inspired by preceding proofs, we provide a comprehensive overview. This overview paper seeks to offer readers insights into diverse converse techniques for message identification, with a focal point on the seminal works of Hayashi, Watanabe, and, in the context of feedback, Ahlswede and Dueck.</description>

      <title>Gumbel-Softmax Discretization Constraint, Differentiable IDS Channel, and an IDS-Correcting Code for DNA Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) error-correcting codes have garnered increased attention with recent advancements in DNA storage technology. However, a universal method for designing IDS-correcting codes across varying channel settings remains underexplored. We present an autoencoder-based method, THEA-code, aimed at efficiently generating IDS-correcting codes for complex IDS channels. In the work, a Gumbel-Softmax discretization constraint is proposed to discretize the features of the autoencoder, and a simulated differentiable IDS channel is developed as a differentiable alternative for IDS operations. These innovations facilitate the successful convergence of the autoencoder, resulting in channel-customized IDS-correcting codes with commendable performance across complex IDS channels.</description>

      <title>What Roles can Spatial Modulation and Space Shift Keying Play in LEO Satellite-Assisted Communication?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of satellite communications play a pivotal role in addressing the ever-increasing demand for global connectivity, among which the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites attract a great amount of attention due to their low latency and high data throughput capabilities. Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Tree-Based Mechanisms for Differentially Private Approximate CDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the $\varepsilon$-differentially private (DP) release of an approximate cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the samples in a dataset. We assume that the true (approximate) CDF is obtained after lumping the data samples into a fixed number $K$ of bins. In this work, we extend the well-known binary tree mechanism to the class of \emph{level-uniform tree-based} mechanisms and identify $\varepsilon$-DP mechanisms that have a small $\ell_2$-error. We identify optimal or close-to-optimal tree structures when either of the parameters, which are the branching factors or the privacy budgets at each tree level, are given, and when the algorithm designer is free to choose both sets of parameters. Interestingly, when we allow the branching factors to take on real values, under certain mild restrictions, the optimal level-uniform tree-based mechanism is obtained by choosing equal branching factors \emph{independent} of $K$, and equal privacy budgets at all levels. Furthermore, for selected $K$ values, we explicitly identify the optimal \emph{integer} branching factors and tree height, assuming equal privacy budgets at all levels. Finally, we describe general strategies for improving the private CDF estimates further, by combining multiple noisy estimates and by post-processing the estimates for consistency.</description>

      <title>Decoupling by local random unitaries without simultaneous smoothing, and applications to multi-user quantum information tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a simple telescoping sum trick, together with the triangle inequality and a tensorisation property of expected-contractive coefficients of random channels, allow us to achieve general simultaneous decoupling for multiple users via local actions. Employing both old [Dupuis et al. Commun. Math. Phys. 328:251-284 (2014)] and new methods [Dupuis, arXiv:2105.05342], we obtain bounds on the expected deviation from ideal decoupling either in the one-shot setting in terms of smooth min-entropies, or the finite block length setting in terms of R\'enyi entropies. These bounds are essentially optimal without the need to address the simultaneous smoothing conjecture, which remains unresolved.
  This leads to one-shot, finite block length, and asymptotic achievability results for several tasks in quantum Shannon theory, including local randomness extraction of multiple parties, multi-party assisted entanglement concentration, multi-party quantum state merging, and quantum coding for the quantum multiple access channel. Because of the one-shot nature of our protocols, we obtain achievability results without the need for time-sharing, which at the same time leads to easy proofs of the asymptotic coding theorems. We show that our one-shot decoupling bounds furthermore yield achievable rates (so far only conjectured) for all four tasks in compound settings, that is for only partially known i.i.d. source or channel, which are furthermore optimal for entanglement of assistance and state merging.</description>

      <title>Zero-entropy encoders and simultaneous decoders in identification via quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by deterministic identification via classical channels, where the encoder is not allowed to use randomization, we revisit the problem of identification via quantum channels but now with the additional restriction that the message encoding must use pure quantum states, rather than general mixed states. Together with the previously considered distinction between simultaneous and general decoders, this suggests a two-dimensional spectrum of different identification capacities, whose behaviour could a priori be very different.
  We demonstrate two new results as our main findings: first, we show that all four combinations (pure/mixed encoder, simultaneous/general decoder) have a double-exponentially growing code size, and that indeed the corresponding identification capacities are lower bounded by the classical transmission capacity for a general quantum channel, which is given by the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem. Secondly, we show that the simultaneous identification capacity of a quantum channel equals the simultaneous identification capacity with pure state encodings, thus leaving three linearly ordered identification capacities. By considering some simple examples, we finally show that these three are all different: general identification capacity can be larger than pure-state-encoded identification capacity, which in turn can be larger than pure-state-encoded simultaneous identification capacity.</description>

      <title>FMLFS: A Federated Multi-Label Feature Selection Based on Information Theory in IoT Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In certain emerging applications such as health monitoring wearable and traffic monitoring systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices generate or collect a huge amount of multi-label datasets. Within these datasets, each instance is linked to a set of labels. The presence of noisy, redundant, or irrelevant features in these datasets, along with the curse of dimensionality, poses challenges for multi-label classifiers. Feature selection (FS) proves to be an effective strategy in enhancing classifier performance and addressing these challenges. Yet, there is currently no existing distributed multi-label FS method documented in the literature that is suitable for distributed multi-label datasets within IoT environments. This paper introduces FMLFS, the first federated multi-label feature selection method. Here, mutual information between features and labels serves as the relevancy metric, while the correlation distance between features, derived from mutual information and joint entropy, is utilized as the redundancy measure. Following aggregation of these metrics on the edge server and employing Pareto-based bi-objective and crowding distance strategies, the sorted features are subsequently sent back to the IoT devices. The proposed method is evaluated through two scenarios: 1) transmitting reduced-size datasets to the edge server for centralized classifier usage, and 2) employing federated learning with reduced-size datasets. Evaluation across three metrics - performance, time complexity, and communication cost - demonstrates that FMLFS outperforms five other comparable methods in the literature and provides a good trade-off on three real-world datasets.</description>
