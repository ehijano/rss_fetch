      <title>Pion electroproduction measurements in the nucleon resonance region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new pion electroproduction measurements in the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance, utilizing the SHMS - HMS magnetic spectrometers of Hall C at Jefferson Lab. The data focus on a region that exhibits a strong and rapidly changing interplay of the mesonic cloud and quark-gluon dynamics in the nucleon. The results are in reasonable agreement with models that employ pion cloud effects and chiral effective field theory calculations, but at the same time they suggest that an improvement is required to the theoretical calculations and provide valuable input that will allow their refinements. The data illustrate the potential of the magnetic spectrometers setup in Hall C towards the study the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. These first reported results will be followed by a series of measurements in Hall C, that will expand the studies of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance offering a high precision insight within a wide kinematic range from low to high momentum transfers.</description>

      <title>Calculation of the correlation, relativistic and QED corrections to the total electron binding energy in atoms and their nuclear charge dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present relativistic many-body calculations of total electron binding energy of neutral atoms up to element $Z=120$. Binding energy for ions may be found by subtracting known ionization potentials. Accuracy of the results for $17&lt;Z \le105$ significantly exceeds that in NIST tables (there are no data for $Z&gt;105$ there). We fit numerical results for binding energies by analytical function of $Z$. We also calculate numerical values and determine dependence on $Z$ of the correlation corrections, Dirac and Breit relativistic corrections and quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the influence of neutron transfer in Si-based fusion reactions around the Coulomb barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: We aim to investigate the role of a few neutron transfer channels on the dynamics of fusion reactions around the Coulomb barrier by judicially selecting 11 different $^{28,30}$Si-induced systems. These reactions are chosen in such a way that they possess positive and negative Q-values for neutron transfer channels to make the comparison more apparent. Furthermore, a comparative study on fusion barrier parameters using different proximity potentials and parametrizations is also a prime goal.
  Method: A channel coupling approach within the framework of a semiclassical model is being used to investigate the role of multi-neutron transfer with positive Q-values on fusion phenomena near and below the Coulomb barrier. The fusion barrier parameters have been extracted and analyzed within the framework of seven different potential models.
  Results: The sub-barrier fusion enhancement compared to the one-dimensional barrier penetration model (uncoupled) is investigated by considering collective excitations in colliding nuclei and multi-neutron transfer channels with Q $&gt;$ 0 within the channel coupling model. Furthermore, GRAZING calculations are performed to predict the cross-section of target-like fragments after 2n pickup transfer.
  Conclusion: All the fusion excitation functions (EFs) have been successfully explained by the coupled channel calculations using the channel coupling model. Only the significant effect of up to 2n pickup transfer with Q $&gt;$ 0 was found on sub-barrier fusion. Despite having positive Q values for transfer channels, no noticeable impact of more than 2n transfer was observed. GRAZING predictions are grossly in the same order as the quantitative contribution of 2n transfer channels observed by channel coupling model calculations.</description>

      <title>On-orbit calibration and long-term performance of the DAMPE trigger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a satellite-borne particle detector for measurements of high-energy cosmic rays and {\gamma}-rays. DAMPE has been operating smoothly in space for more than 8 years since launch on December 17, 2015. The trigger logic of DAMPE is designed according to the deposited energy information recorded by the calorimeter. The precise calibration of the trigger thresholds and their long-term evolutions are very important for the scientific analysis of DAMPE. In this work, we develop a new method for the threshold calibration, considering the influence from the electronic noise, and obtain the long-term evolutions of the trigger thresholds. The average increase rate of the trigger thresholds for the first 4 layers of the calorimeter is found to be about 0.9% per year, resulting in variations of the high-energy trigger efficiency of cosmic ray electrons by about -5% per year at 2 GeV and less than about -0.05% above 30 GeV.</description>

      <title>Flavor Dependence of Charged Pion Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have measured the flavor dependence of multiplicities for pi^+ and pi^- production in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) on proton and deuteron targets to explore a possible charge symmetry violation in fragmentation functions. The experiment used an electron beam with energies of 10.2 and 10.6 GeV at Jefferson Lab and the Hall-C spectrometers. The electron kinematics spanned the range 0.3&lt;x&lt;0.6, 2&lt;Q^2&lt;5.5 GeV^2, and 4&lt;W^2&lt;11 GeV^2. The pion fractional momentum range was 0.3&lt; z &lt;0.7, and the transverse momentum range was 0&lt;p_T&lt;0.25 GeV/c. Assuming factorization at low p_T and allowing for isospin breaking, we find that the results can be described by two "favored" and two "un-favored" effective low $p_T$ fragmentation functions that are flavor-dependent. However, they converge to a common flavor-independent value at the lowest x or highest W of this experiment.</description>

      <title>Final State Gluon Emission in Deep-Inelastic Scattering at Next-to-Leading Twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.05329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A detailed reanalysis of the single gluon emission rate at next-to-leading twist is carried out. As was the case in prior efforts, the problem is cast in the framework of deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) of an electron off a large nucleus. The quark produced in the interaction propagates through the remaining nucleus and engenders scattering and gluon radiation, which is calculated in the limit of one re-scattering. This medium induced single gluon emission rate forms the basis of several energy loss calculations in both DIS and heavy-ion collisions. Unlike prior efforts, a complete transverse momentum gradient expansion of the hadronic tensor, including $N_c$ suppressed terms, phase terms and finite gluon momentum fraction terms, ignored previously, is carried out. These terms turn out to be surprisingly large. In contrast to prior efforts, the full next-to-leading twist gluon emission kernel is found to be positive definite and slowly increasing with the exchanged transverse momentum. Phenomenological consequences of these new contributions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Global Data-Driven Determination of Baryon Transition Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadronic resonances emerge from strong interactions encoding the dynamics of quarks and gluons. The structure of these resonances can be probed by virtual photons parameterized in transition form factors. In this study, twelve $N^*$ and $\Delta$ transition form factors at the pole are extracted from data with the center-of-mass energy from $\pi N$ threshold to $1.8\,{\rm GeV}$, and the photon virtuality $0\leq Q^2/{\rm GeV}^2\leq 8$. For the first time, these results are determined from a simultaneous analysis of more than one state, i.e., $\sim 10^5$ $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $K\Lambda$ electroproduction data. In addition, about $ 5\cdot 10^4$ data in the hadronic sector as well as photoproduction serve as boundary conditions. For the $\Delta(1232)$ and $N(1440)$ states our results are in qualitative agreement with previous studies, while the transition form factors at the poles of some higher excited states are estimated for the first time. Realistic uncertainties are determined by further exploring the parameter space.</description>

      <title>QCD Masterclass Lectures on Jet Physics and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lectures were presented at the 2024 QCD Masterclass in Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer, France. They introduce and review fundamental theorems and principles of machine learning within the context of collider particle physics, focused on application to jet identification and discrimination. Numerous examples of binary discrimination in jet physics are studied in detail, including $H\to b\bar b$ identification in fixed-order perturbation theory, generic one-versus two-prong discrimination with parametric power counting techniques, and up versus down quark jet classification by assuming the central limit theorem, isospin conservation, and a convergent moment expansion of the single particle energy distribution. Quark versus gluon jet discrimination is considered in multiple contexts, from using additive, infrared and collinear safe observables, to using hadronic multiplicity, and to including measurements of the jet charge. While many of the results presented here are well known, some novel results are presented, the most prominent being a parametrized expression for the likelihood ratio of quark versus gluon discrimination for jets on which hadronic multiplicity and jet charge are simultaneously measured. End-of-lecture exercises are also provided.</description>
