      <title>Inefficient Alliance Formation in Coalitional Blotto Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In adversarial resource allocation settings, forming alliances can enhance performance, but the benefits may diminish if alliance formation becomes costly. In this work, we explore this issue using the framework of the coalitional Blotto game, in which two players compete separately against a common adversary across valued contests. Each player aims to win contests by allocating more of their limited budget than their opponent. Previous work on alliance formation in coalitional Blotto games has shown that if one player transfers a portion of their budget to the other, then both players can perform better; however, it is also known that it is never in either players' interest to simply concede a portion of their budget. In this work, we study the setting in which transfers are costly, meaning that if one player donates a portion of their budget, the recipient only receives a fraction of the transferred amount. We show that mutually beneficial costly transfers exist, and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a costly transfer. Then, we consider the setting in which players can transfer budgets and contests at a cost, and we show that this alliance strategy is mutually beneficial in almost all game instances.</description>

      <title>Randomized Strategic Facility Location with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the canonical problem of strategic facility location and study the power and limitations of randomization in the design of truthful mechanisms augmented with machine-learned predictions. In the strategic facility location problem, a set of agents are asked to report their locations in some metric space and the goal is to use these reported locations to determine where to open a new facility, aiming to optimize some aggregate measure of distance of the agents from that facility. However, the agents are strategic and can misreport their locations if this may lead to a facility location choice that they prefer. The goal is to design truthful mechanisms, which ensure the agents cannot benefit by misreporting. A lot of prior work has studied this problem from a worst-case perspective, but a recent line of work proposed a framework to refine these results when the designer is provided with some, possible incorrect, predictions regarding the agents' true locations. The goal is to simultaneously provide strong consistency guarantees (i.e., guarantees when the predictions provided to the mechanism are correct) and near-optimal robustness guarantees (i.e., guarantees that hold irrespective of how inaccurate the predictions may be). In this work we focus on the power of randomization in this problem and analyze the best approximation guarantees achievable with respect to the egalitarian social cost measure for one- and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Two-Team Polymatrix Games with Independent Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial multiplayer games are an important object of study in multiagent learning. In particular, polymatrix zero-sum games are a multiplayer setting where Nash equilibria are known to be efficiently computable. Towards understanding the limits of tractability in polymatrix games, we study the computation of Nash equilibria in such games where each pair of players plays either a zero-sum or a coordination game. We are particularly interested in the setting where players can be grouped into a small number of teams of identical interest. While the three-team version of the problem is known to be PPAD-complete, the complexity for two teams has remained open. Our main contribution is to prove that the two-team version remains hard, namely it is CLS-hard. Furthermore, we show that this lower bound is tight for the setting where one of the teams consists of multiple independent adversaries. On the way to obtaining our main result, we prove hardness of finding any stationary point in the simplest type of non-convex-concave min-max constrained optimization problem, namely for a class of bilinear polynomial objective functions.</description>

      <title>Speeding up deferred acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A run of the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm may contain proposals that are sure to be rejected. We introduce the accelerated deferred acceptance algorithm that proceeds in a similar manner to DA but with sure-to-be rejected proposals ruled out. Accelerated deferred acceptance outputs the same stable matching as DA but does so more efficiently: it terminates in weakly fewer rounds, requires weakly fewer proposals, and final pairs match no later. Computational experiments show that these efficiency savings can be strict.</description>

      <title>The Competition Complexity of Prophet Inequalities with Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the prophet inequality problem through the resource augmentation framework in scenarios when the values of the rewards are correlated. Our goal is to determine the number of additional rewards an online algorithm requires to approximate the maximum value of the original instance. While the independent reward case is well understood, we extend this research to account for correlations among rewards. Our results demonstrate that, unlike in the independent case, the required number of additional rewards for approximation depends on the number of original rewards, and that block-threshold algorithms, which are optimal in the independent case, may require an infinite number of additional rewards when correlations are present. We develop asymptotically optimal algorithms for the following three scenarios: (1) where rewards arrive in blocks corresponding to the different copies of the original instance; (2) where rewards across all copies are arbitrarily shuffled; and (3) where rewards arrive in blocks corresponding to the different copies of the original instance, and values within each block are pairwise independent rather than fully correlated.</description>

      <title>Cyber Deception: State of the art, Trends and Open challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in cybersecurity has significantly increased articles designing and implementing various Cyber Deception (CYDEC) mechanisms. This trend reflects the urgent need for new strategies to address cyber threats effectively. Since its emergence, CYDEC has established itself as an innovative defense against attackers, thanks to its proactive and reactive capabilities, finding applications in numerous real-life scenarios. Despite the considerable work devoted to CYDEC, the literature still presents significant gaps. In particular, there has not been (i) a comprehensive analysis of the main components characterizing CYDEC, (ii) a generic classification covering all types of solutions, nor (iii) a survey of the current state of the literature in various contexts. This article aims to fill these gaps through a detailed review of the main features that comprise CYDEC, developing a comprehensive classification taxonomy. In addition, the different frameworks used to generate CYDEC are reviewed, presenting a more comprehensive one. Existing solutions in the literature using CYDEC, both without Artificial Intelligence (AI) and with AI, are studied and compared. Finally, the most salient trends of the current state of the art are discussed, offering a list of pending challenges for future research.</description>

      <title>RetinaRegNet: A Zero-Shot Approach for Retinal Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RetinaRegNet, a zero-shot image registration model designed to register retinal images with minimal overlap, large deformations, and varying image quality. RetinaRegNet addresses these challenges and achieves robust and accurate registration through the following steps. First, we extract features from the moving and fixed images using latent diffusion models. We then sample feature points from the fixed image using a combination of the SIFT algorithm and random point sampling. For each sampled point, we identify its corresponding point in the moving image using a 2D correlation map, which computes the cosine similarity between the diffusion feature vectors of the point in the fixed image and all pixels in the moving image. Second, we eliminate most incorrectly detected point correspondences (outliers) by enforcing an inverse consistency constraint, ensuring that correspondences are consistent in both forward and backward directions. We further remove outliers with large distances between corresponding points using a global transformation based outlier detector. Finally, we implement a two-stage registration framework to handle large deformations. The first stage estimates a homography transformation to achieve global alignment between the images, while the second stage uses a third-order polynomial transformation to estimate local deformations. We evaluated RetinaRegNet on three retinal image registration datasets: color fundus images, fluorescein angiography images, and laser speckle flowgraphy images. Our model consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. The accurate registration achieved by RetinaRegNet enables the tracking of eye disease progression, enhances surgical planning, and facilitates the evaluation of treatment efficacy. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/RetinaRegNet.</description>

      <title>A Policy Iteration Method for Inverse Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a policy iteration method to solve an inverse problem for a mean-field game (MFG) model, specifically to reconstruct the obstacle function in the game from the partial observation data of value functions, which represent the optimal costs for agents. The proposed approach decouples this complex inverse problem, which is an optimization problem constrained by a coupled nonlinear forward and backward PDE system in the MFG, into several iterations of solving linear PDEs and linear inverse problems. This method can also be viewed as a fixed-point iteration that simultaneously solves the MFG system and inversion. We prove its linear rate of convergence. In addition, numerical examples in 1D and 2D, along with performance comparisons to a direct least-squares method, demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for solving inverse MFGs.</description>
