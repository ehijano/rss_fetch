      <title>On the global dynamics of a forest model with monotone positive feedback and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue to study (see arXiv:2401.08618, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.08618) a renewal equation $\phi(t)=\frak F\phi_t$ proposed in [C. Barril et al., J. Math. Biology, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-024-02084-x] to model trees growth. This time we are considering the case when the per capita reproduction rate $\beta(x)$ is a non-monotone (unimodal) function of tree's height $x$. Note that the height of some species of trees can impact negatively seed viability, in a kind of autogamy depression. Similarly to previous works, it is also assumed that the growth rate $g(x)$ of an individual of height $x$ is a strictly decreasing function. Here we analyse the connection between dynamics of the associated one-dimensional map $F(b)= {\frak F}b,$ $b \in {\mathbb R}_+$, and the delayed (hence infinite-dimensional) model $\phi(t)=\frak F\phi_t$. Our key observation is that this model is of monotone positive feedback type since $F$ is strictly increasing on ${\mathbb R}_+$ independently on the monotonicity properties of $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Compact almost automorphic dynamics of non-autonomous differential equations with exponential dichotomy and applications to biological models with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we prove that, if $A(\cdot)$ is a compact almost automorphic matrix and the system $$x'(t) = A(t)x(t)\, ,$$ possesses an exponential dichotomy with Green function $G(\cdot, \cdot)$, then its associated system $$y'(t) = B(t)y(t)\, ,$$ where $B(\cdot) \in H(A)$ (the hull of $A(\cdot)$) also possesses an exponential dichotomy. Moreover, the Green function $G(\cdot, \cdot)$ is compact Bi-almost automorphic in $\mathbb{R}^2$, this implies that $G(\cdot, \cdot)$ is $\Delta_2$ - like uniformly continuous, where $\Delta_2$ is the principal diagonal of $\mathbb{R}^2$, an important ingredient in the proof of invariance of the compact almost automorphic function space under convolution product with kernel $G(\cdot, \cdot)$. Finally, we study the existence of a positive compact almost automorphic solution of non-autonomous differential equations of biological interest having non-linear harvesting terms and mixed delays.</description>

      <title>Beyond Boolean networks, a multi-valued approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean networks can be viewed as functions on the set of binary strings of a given length, described via logical rules. They were introduced as dynamic models into biology, in particular as logical models of intracellular regulatory networks involving genes, proteins, and metabolites. Since genes can have several modes of action, depending on their expression levels, binary variables are often not sufficiently rich, requiring the use of multi-valued networks instead. The steady state analysis of Boolean networks is computationally complex, and increasing the number of variable values beyond $2$ adds substantially to this complexity, and no general methods are available beyond simulation. The main contribution of this paper is to give an algorithm to compute the steady states of a multi-valued network that has a complexity that, in many cases, is essentially the same as that for the case of binary values. Our approach is based on a representation of multi-valued networks using multi-valued logic functions, providing a biologically intuitive representation of the network. Furthermore, it uses tools to compute lattice points in rational polytopes, tapping a rich area of algebraic combinatorics as a source for combinatorial algorithms for Boolean network analysis. An implementation of the algorithm is provided.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of hyperbolic reaction-diffusion systems on directed networks through the generalized Routh-Hurwitz criterion for complex polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of dynamical systems on complex networks is of paramount importance in engineering, given that many natural and artificial systems find a natural embedding on discrete topologies. For instance, power grids, chemical reactors and the brain, to name a few, can be modeled through the network formalism by considering elementary units coupled via the links. In recent years, scholars have developed numerical and theoretical tools to study the stability of those coupled systems when subjected to perturbations. In such framework, it was found that asymmetric couplings enhance the possibilities for such systems to become unstable. Moreover, in this scenario the polynomials whose stability needs to be studied bear complex coefficients, which makes the analysis more difficult. In this work, we put to use a recent extension of the well-known Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, allowing to treat the complex coefficient case. Then, using the Brusselator model as a case study, we discuss the stability conditions and the regions of parameters when the networked system remains stable.</description>

      <title>FO logic on cellular automata orbits equals MSO logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of classical cellular automata (CA) to arbitrary labeled graphs, and show that FO logic on CA orbits is equivalent to MSO logic.  We deduce various results from that equivalence, including a characterization of finitely generated groups on which FO model checking for CA orbits is undecidable, and undecidability of satisfiability of a fixed FO property for CA over finite graphs. We also show concrete examples of FO formulas for CA orbits whose model checking problem is equivalent to the domino problem, or its seeded or recurring variants respectively, on any finitely generated group. For the recurring domino problem, we use an extension of the FO signature by a relation found in the well-known Garden of Eden theorem, but we also show a concrete FO formula without the extension and with one quantifier alternation whose model checking problem does not belong to the arithmetical hierarchy on group Z^2.</description>

      <title>Automating the Discovery of Partial Differential Equations in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) from data is crucial for understanding the governing mechanisms of natural phenomena, yet it remains a challenging task. We present an extension to the ARGOS framework, ARGOS-RAL, which leverages sparse regression with the recurrent adaptive lasso to identify PDEs from limited prior knowledge automatically. Our method automates calculating partial derivatives, constructing a candidate library, and estimating a sparse model. We rigorously evaluate the performance of ARGOS-RAL in identifying canonical PDEs under various noise levels and sample sizes, demonstrating its robustness in handling noisy and non-uniformly distributed data. We also test the algorithm's performance on datasets consisting solely of random noise to simulate scenarios with severely compromised data quality. Our results show that ARGOS-RAL effectively and reliably identifies the underlying PDEs from data, outperforming the sequential threshold ridge regression method in most cases. We highlight the potential of combining statistical methods, machine learning, and dynamical systems theory to automatically discover governing equations from collected data, streamlining the scientific modeling process.</description>

      <title>Kalman-based approaches for online estimation of bioreactor dynamics from fluorescent reporter measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address online estimation of microbial growth dynamics in bioreactors from measurements of a fluorescent reporter protein synthesized along with microbial growth. We consider an extended version of standard growth models that accounts for the dynamics of reporter synthesis. We develop state estimation from sampled, noisy measurements in the cases of known and unknown growth rate functions. Leveraging conservation laws and regularized estimation techniques, we reduce these nonlinear estimation problems to linear time-varying ones, and solve them via Kalman filtering. We establish convergence results in absence of noise and show performance on noisy data in simulation.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishable asymptotic pairs and multidimensional Sturmian configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two asymptotic configurations on a full $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shift are indistinguishable if for every finite pattern the associated sets of occurrences in each configuration coincide up to a finitely supported permutation of $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We prove that indistinguishable asymptotic pairs satisfying a "flip condition" are characterized by their pattern complexity on finite connected supports. Furthermore, we prove that uniformly recurrent indistinguishable asymptotic pairs satisfying the flip condition are described by codimension-one (dimension of the internal space) cut and project schemes, which symbolically correspond to multidimensional Sturmian configurations. Together the two results provide a generalization to $\mathbb{Z}^d$ of the characterization of Sturmian sequences by their factor complexity $n+1$. Many open questions are raised by the current work and are listed in the introduction.</description>

      <title>Absolutely continuous invariant measures for random dynamical systems of beta-transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random dynamical system of simple linear transformations on the unit interval $T_{\beta}(x)=\beta x$ (mod $1$), $x\in[0,1]$, $\beta&gt;0$, which are the so-called beta-transformations. For such a random dynamical system, including the case that it is generated by uncountably many maps, we give an explicit formula for the density function of a unique stationary measure under the assumption that the random dynamics is expanding in mean. As an application, in the case that the random dynamics is generated by finitely many maps and the maps are chosen according to a Bernoulli measure, we show that the density function is analytic as a function of parameter in the Bernoulli measure and give its derivative explicitly. Furthermore, for a non-i.i.d. random dynamical system of beta-transformations, we also give an explicit formula for the random densities of a unique absolutely continuous invariant measure under a certain strong expanding condition or under the assumption that the maps randomly chosen are close to the beta-transformation for a non-simple number in the sense of parameter $\beta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine methods from microlocal analysis and dimension theory to study resonances with largest real part for an Anosov flow with smooth real valued potential. We show that the resonant states are closely related to special systems of measures supported on the stable manifolds introduced by Climenhaga. As a result, we relate the presence of the resonances on the critical axis to mixing properties of the flow with respect to certain equilibrium measures and show that these equilibrium measures can be reconstructed from the spectral theory of the Anosov flow.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of a non-hyperbolic nonlinear map with non-bounded set of non-isolated fixed points with applications to Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the convergence analysis of the SUCPA (Semi Unsupervised Calibration through Prior Adaptation) algorithm, defined from a first-order non-linear difference equations, first developed to correct the scores output by a supervised machine learning classifier. The convergence analysis is addressed as a dynamical system problem, by studying the local and global stability of the nonlinear map derived from the algorithm. This map, which is defined by a composition of exponential and rational functions, turns out to be non-hyperbolic with a non-bounded set of non-isolated fixed points. Hence, a non-standard method for solving the convergence analysis is used consisting of an ad-hoc geometrical approach. For a binary classification problem (two-dimensional map), we rigorously prove that the map is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical experiments on real-world application are performed to support the theoretical results by means of two different classification problems: Sentiment Polarity performed with a Large Language Model and Cat-Dog Image classification. For a greater number of classes, the numerical evidence shows the same behavior of the algorithm, and this is illustrated with a Natural Language Inference example. The experiment codes are publicly accessible online at the following repository: https://github.com/LautaroEst/sucpa-convergence</description>
