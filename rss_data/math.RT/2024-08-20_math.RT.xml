      <title>On commutative tensor factors of group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any tensor product factorization with a commutative factor of a modular group algebra over a prime field comes from a direct product decomposition of the group basis. This extends previous work by Carlson and Kov\'acs for the commutative case and answers a question of them in some cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a 2015 paper we have defined a map from the set of conjugacy classes in a Weyl group W to the set of irreducible representations of W (its image parametrizes the strata of a reductive group with Weyl group W). In this paper we provide evidence that this map makes sense even when W is replaced by a noncrystallographic Coxeter group,</description>

      <title>Finite dimensional 2-cyclic Jacobian algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we start with a class of quivers containing only 2-cycles and loops, referred to as 2-cyclic quivers. We prove that there exists a potential on these quivers that ensures the resulting quiver with potential is Jacobian-finite. As an application, we first demonstrate through covering theory that a Jacobian-finite potential exists on a class of 2-acyclic quivers. Secondly, by using the 2-cyclic Caldero-Chapoton formula defined on section 4.2, the $\tau$-rigid modules obtained from the Jacobian algebras of our proven Jacobian-finite 2-cyclic quiver with potential can categorify Paquette-Schiffler's generalized cluster algebras in three specific cases: one for a disk with two marked points and one 3-puncture, one for a sphere with one puncture, one 3-puncture and one orbifold point, and another for a sphere with one puncture and two 3-punctures.</description>

      <title>Reduced words for reflections in Weyl groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reflections in a Coxeter group are defined as conjugates of a single generator, and thus admit palindromic expressions as products of generators. Our main result gives closed formulas providing a palindromic reduced expression for each reflection in any finite Weyl group. There exist algorithmic methods for determining such reduced expressions, but explicit formulas have not been recorded outside of well-known special cases.</description>

      <title>Matrix structure of classical ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$ graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ is a ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded algebra $\mathfrak g$ with a bracket $[|. , . |]$ that satisfies certain graded versions of the symmetry and Jacobi identity. In particular, despite the common terminology, $\mathfrak g$ is not a Lie algebra. We construct classes of ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebras corresponding to the classical Lie algebras, in terms of their defining matrices. For the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra of type $A$, the construction coincides with the previously known class. For the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra of type $B$, $C$ and $D$ our construction is new and gives rise to interesting defining matrices closely related to the classical ones but undoubtedly different. We also give some examples and possible applications to parastatistics.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Tsetlin Bases for Elliptic Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the level-0 representations of the elliptic quantum group $U_{q,p}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$. We give a classification theorem of the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $U_{q,p}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$ in terms of the theta function analogue of the Drinfeld polynomial for the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$. We also construct the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases for the level-0 $U_{q,p}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$-modules following the work by Nazarov-Tarasov for the Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_N)$-modules. This is a construction in terms of the Drinfeld generators. For the case of tensor product of the vector representations, we give another construction of the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases in terms of the $L$-operators and make a connection between the two constructions. We also compare them with those obtained by the first author by using the $\mathfrak{S}_n$-action realized by the elliptic dynamical $R$-matrix on the standard bases. As a byproduct, we obtain an explicit formula for the partition functions of the corresponding 2-dimensional square lattice model in terms of the elliptic weight functions of type $A_{N-1}$.</description>

Abstract: We construct central elements of the quantized enveloping algebra ${\rm U}_q({\mathfrak{gl}}_n)$ parameterized by arbitrary Young diagrams, analogous to Okounkov's quantum immanants. We show that the Harish-Chandra images of the $q$-immanants coincide with the Schur polynomials. We also prove quantum analogues of the higher Capelli identities and derive Newton-type identities.</description>

      <title>Characters of $GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ and vertex operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15330v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a vertex operator approach to construct and compute all complex irreducible characters of the general linear group $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$. Green's theory of $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ is recovered and enhanced under the realization of the Grothendieck ring of representations $R_G=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0}R(\GL_n(\mathbb F_q))$ as two isomorphic Fock spaces associated to two infinite-dimensional $F$-equivariant Heisenberg Lie algebras $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\hat{\overline{\mathbb F}}_q}$ and $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\overline{\mathbb F}_q}$, where $F$ is the Frobenius automorphism of the algebraically closed field $\overline{\mathbb F}_q$. Under this picture, the irreducible characters are realized by the Bernstein vertex operators for Schur functions, the characteristic functions of the conjugacy classes are realized by the vertex operators for the Hall-Littlewood functions, and the character table is completely given by matrix coefficients of vertex operators of these two types. One of the features of the current approach is a simpler identification of the Fock space $R_G$ as the Hall algebra of symmetric functions via vertex operator calculus, and another is that we are able to compute in general the character table, where Green's degree formula is demonstrated as an example.</description>

      <title>The Hochschild cohomology and the Tamarkin-Tsygan calculus of gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tamarkin Tsygan calculus of a finite dimensional algebra is a differential calculus given by the comprehensive data of the Hochschild cohomology, its structure both as a graded commutative algebra under the cup product and as a graded Lie algebra under the Gerstenhaber bracket, together with the Hochschild homology and its module structure over the Hochschild cohomology given by the cap product as well as the Connes differential. In this paper, we calculate the whole of the Tamarkin Tsygan calculus for the class of gentle algebras. Apart from some isolated calculations, this is, to our knowledge, the first complete calculation of this calculus for a family of finite dimensional algebras. Gentle algebras appear in many different areas of mathematics such as the theory of cluster algebras, N=2 gauge theories and homological mirror symmetry of surfaces. For the latter Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich show that the partially wrapped Fukaya category of a graded surface is triangle equivalent to the perfect derived category of a graded gentle algebra. Thus the symplectic cohomology of the surface should be linked to the Hochschild cohomology of the gentle algebra. We give a description of how this connection might be visualised, in that, we show how these structures are encoded in the geometric surface model of the bounded derived category associated to a gentle algebra via its ribbon graph. Finally, we show how to recover structural results for a gentle algebra given its Tamarkin-Tsygan calculus.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic Hecke algebra and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reprove the surjectivity statement of Braverman-Kazhdan's spectral description of Lusztig's asymptotic Hecke algebra $J$ in the context of $p$-adic groups. The proof is based on Bezrukavnikov-Ostrik's description of $J$ in terms of equivariant $K$-theory. As a porism, we prove that the action of $J$ extends from the non-strictly positive unramified characters to the complement of a finite union of divisors, and that the trace pairing between the Ciubotaru-He rigid cocentre of an affine Hecke algebra with equal parameters and the rigid quotient of its Grothendieck group is perfect whenever the parameter $q$ is not a root of the Poincar\'{e} polynomial of the finite Weyl group.
  Without recourse to $K$-theory, we prove a weak version of Xi's description of $J$ in type $A$.
  As an application of relationship between $J$ and the rigid cocentre, we prove that if the formal degree of a unipotent discrete series representation of a connected reductive $p$-adic group $G$ with a split inner form has denominator dividing the Poincar\'{e} polynomial of the Weyl group of $G$. Additionally, we give formulas for $t_w$ in terms of inverse and spherical Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for $w$ in the lowest cell.</description>

      <title>The 3-Preprojective Algebras Of Type $\~A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G \leq \operatorname{SL}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$ act on $R = \mathbb{C}[X_1, \ldots, X_{n+1}]$ by change of variables. Then, the skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is bimodule $(n+1)$-Calabi-Yau. Under certain circumstances, the algebra admits a locally finite-dimensional grading of Gorenstein parameter $1$, in which case it is the $(n+1)$-preprojective algebra of its $n$-representation infinite degree $0$ piece, as defined by Herschend, Iyama and Oppermann. If the group $G$ is abelian, the $(n+1)$-preprojective algebra is said to be of type $\~A$. For a given group $G$, it is not obvious whether $R \ast G$ admits such a grading making it into an $(n+1)$-preprojective algebra. We study the case when $n=2$ and $G$ is abelian. We give an explicit classification of groups such that $R \ast G$ is $3$-preprojective by constructing such gradings. This is possible as long as $G$ is not a subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and not $C_2 \times C_2$. For a fixed $G$, the algebra $R \ast G$ admits different $3$-preprojective gradings, so we associate a type to a grading and classify all types. Then we show that gradings of the same type are related by a certain kind of mutation. This gives a classification of $2$-representation infinite algebras of type $\~A$. The involved quivers are those arising from hexagonal dimer models on the torus, and the gradings we consider correspond to perfect matchings on the dimer, or equivalently to periodic lozenge tilings of the plane. Consequently, we classify these tilings up to flips, which correspond to the mutation we consider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2017, Green and Schroll introduced a generalization of Brauer graph algebras which they call Brauer configuration algebras. In the present paper, we further generalize Brauer configuration algebras to fractional Brauer configuration algebras by generalizing Brauer configurations to fractional Brauer configurations. The fractional Brauer configuration algebras are locally bounded but neither finite-dimensional nor symmetric in general. We show that if the fractional Brauer configuration is of type S (resp. of type MS), then the corresponding fractional Brauer configuration algebra is a locally bounded Frobenius algebra (resp. a locally bounded special multiserial Frobenius algebra). Moreover, we show that over an algebraically closed field, the class of finite-dimensional indecomposable representation-finite fractional Brauer configuration algebras in type S coincides with the class of basic indecomposable finite-dimensional standard representation-finite self-injective algebras.</description>

      <title>Topological K-theory of quasi-BPS categories of symmetric quivers with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous works, we introduced and studied certain categories called quasi-BPS categories associated to symmetric quivers with potential, preprojective algebras, and local surfaces. They have properties reminiscent of BPS invariants/ cohomologies in enumerative geometry, for example they play important roles in categorical wall-crossing formulas.
  In this paper, we make the connections between quasi-BPS categories and BPS cohomologies more precise via the cycle map for topological K-theory. We show the existence of filtrations on topological K-theory of quasi-BPS categories whose associated graded are isomorphic to the monodromy invariant BPS cohomologies. Along the way, we also compute the topological K-theory of categories of matrix factorizations in terms of the monodromy invariant vanishing cycles (a version of this comparison was already known by work of Blanc-Robalo-To\"en-Vezzosi), prove a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem for matrix factorizations, and prove the compatibility between the Koszul equivalence in K-theory and dimensional reduction in cohomology.
  In a separate paper, we use the results from this paper to show that the quasi-BPS categories of K3 surfaces recover the BPS invariants of the corresponding local surface, which are Euler characteristics of Hilbert schemes of points on K3 surfaces.</description>
