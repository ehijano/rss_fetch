      <title>Low-latency Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication with Transmitter Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an information theoretic model of secure integrated sensing and communication, represented as a wiretap channel with action dependent states. This model allows securing part of a transmitted message against a sensed target that eavesdrops the communication, while enabling transmitter actions to change the channel statistics. An exact secrecy-distortion region is given for a physically-degraded channel. A finite-length achievability region is established for the model using an output statistics of random binning method, giving an achievable bound for low-latency applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming with Widely-spaced-array for Multi-user Cross-Near-and-Far-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With multi-GHz bandwidth, Terahertz (THz) beamforming has drawn increasing attention in the sixth generation (6G) and beyond communications. Existing beamforming designs mainly focus on a compact antenna array where typical communication occurs in the far-field. However, in dense multi-user scenarios, only relying on far-field angle domain fails to distinguish users at similar angles. Therefore, a multi-user widely-spaced array (MU-WSA) is exploited in this paper, which enlarges the near-field region to introduce the additional distance domain, leading to a new paradigm of cross-near-and-far-field (CNFF) communication. Under this paradigm, the CNFF channel model is investigated, based on which the subarray spacing $d_s$ and the number of subarrays $K$ in MU-WSA are optimized to maximize the channel capacity. Then, in sub-connected systems, an alternating optimization (AO) beamforming algorithm is proposed to deal with the special block-diagonal format of the analog precoder. For fully-connected systems, a low-complexity steering-vector reconstruction (SVR)-based algorithm is proposed by constructing specialized steering vectors of MU-WSA. Numerical evaluations show that due to distance domain resolutions, the MU-WSA can improve the SE by over $60$% at a power of $20$dBm compared to the compact array. Additionally, the proposed AO algorithm in the SC system can achieve over 80% of the sum (SE) of the FC system while reducing the number of phase shifters by $K^2$, thereby lowering power consumption. The SVR algorithm in the FC system can achieve over 95% of the upper bound of SE but takes only 10% of the running time of the singular vector decomposition (SVD)-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Representations of Entropy and Fixed-Parity Information Quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many information-theoretic quantities have corresponding representations in terms of sets. The prevailing signed measure space for characterising entropy, the $I$-measure of Yeung, is occasionally unable to discern between qualitatively distinct systems. In previous work, we presented a refinement of this signed measure space and demonstrated its capability to represent many quantities, which we called logarithmically decomposable quantities. In the present work we demonstrate that this framework has natural algebraic behaviour which can be expressed in terms of ideals (characterised here as upper-sets), and we show that this behaviour allows us to make various counting arguments and characterise many fixed-parity information quantity expressions. As an application, we give an algebraic proof that the only completely synergistic system of three finite variables $X$, $Y$ and $Z = f(X,Y)$ is the XOR gate.</description>

      <title>Moment Constraints and Phase Recovery for Multireference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multireference alignment (MRA) refers to the problem of recovering a signal from noisy samples subject to random circular shifts. Expectation maximization (EM) and variational approaches use statistical modeling to achieve high accuracy at the cost of solving computationally expensive optimization problems. The method of moments, instead, achieves fast reconstructions by utilizing the power spectrum and bispectrum to determine the signal up to shift. Our approach combines the two philosophies by viewing the power spectrum as a manifold on which to constrain the signal. We then maximize the data likelihood function on this manifold with a gradient-based approach to estimate the true signal. Algorithmically, our method involves iterating between template alignment and projections onto the manifold. The method offers increased speed compared to EM and demonstrates improved accuracy over bispectrum-based methods.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Learning-Based Framework for VNF Caching and Placement Optimization over Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks (LSNs) are integral to supporting a broad range of modern applications, which are typically modeled as Service Function Chains (SFCs). Each SFC is composed of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), where each VNF performs a specific task. In this work, we tackle two key challenges in deploying SFCs across an LSN. Firstly, we aim to optimize the long-term system performance by minimizing the average end-to-end SFC execution delay, given that each satellite comes with a pre-installed/cached subset of VNFs. To achieve optimal SFC placement, we formulate an offline Dynamic Programming (DP) equation. To overcome the challenges associated with DP, such as its complexity, the need for probability knowledge, and centralized decision-making, we put forth an online Multi-Agent Q-Learning (MAQL) solution. Our MAQL approach addresses convergence issues in the non-stationary LSN environment by enabling satellites to share learning parameters and update their Q-tables based on distinct rules for their selected actions. Secondly, to determine the optimal VNF subsets for satellite caching, we develop a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based learning mechanism that operates both offline and continuously in the background during runtime. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MAQL approach achieves near-optimal performance comparable to the DP model and significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, the BO-based approach effectively enhances the request serving rate over time.</description>

      <title>A Double-Difference Doppler Shift-Based Positioning Framework with Ephemeris Error Correction of LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In signals of opportunity (SOPs)-based positioning utilizing low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, ephemeris data derived from two-line element files can introduce increasing error over time. To handle the erroneous measurement, an additional base receiver with a known position is often used to compensate for the effect of ephemeris error when positioning the user terminal (UT). However, this approach is insufficient for the long baseline (the distance between the base receiver and UT) as it fails to adequately correct Doppler shift measurement errors caused by ephemeris inaccuracies, resulting in degraded positioning performance. Moreover, the lack of clock synchronization between the base receiver and UT exacerbates erroneous Doppler shift measurements. To address these challenges, we put forth a robust double-difference Doppler shift-based positioning framework, coined 3DPose, to handle the clock synchronization issue between the base receiver and UT, and positioning degradation due to the long baseline. The proposed 3DPose framework leverages double-difference Doppler shift measurements to eliminate the clock synchronization issue and incorporates a novel ephemeris error correction algorithm to enhance UT positioning accuracy in case of the long baseline. The algorithm specifically characterizes and corrects the Doppler shift measurement errors arising from erroneous ephemeris data, focusing on satellite position errors in the tangential direction. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct comparative analyses across three different scenarios, contrasting its performance with the existing differential Doppler positioning method. The results demonstrate that the proposed 3DPose framework achieves an average reduction of 90% in 3-dimensional positioning errors compared to the existing differential Doppler approach.</description>

      <title>From Concept to Reality: 5G Positioning with Open-Source Implementation of UL-TDoA in OpenAirInterface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, an open-source implementation of the 3GPP Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (UL-TDoA) positioning method using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework. UL-TDoA is a critical positioning technique in 5G networks, leveraging the time differences of signal arrival at multiple base stations to determine the precise location of User Equipment (UE). This implementation aims to democratize access to advanced positioning technology by integrating UL-TDoA capabilities into both the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN) components of OAI, providing a comprehensive and 3GPP-compliant solution.
  The development includes the incorporation of essential protocol procedures, message flows, and interfaces as defined by 3GPP standards. Validation is conducted using two distinct methods: an OAI-RF simulator-based setup for controlled testing and an O-RAN-based Localization Testbed at EURECOM in real-world conditions. The results demonstrate the viability of this open-source UL-TDoA implementation, enabling precise positioning in various environments. By making this implementation publicly available, the study paves the way for widespread research, development, and innovation in the field of 5G positioning technologies, fostering collaboration and accelerating the advancement of cellular network positioning.</description>

      <title>Tele-LLMs: A Series of Specialized Large Language Models for Telecommunications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various fields, from natural language processing to sectors like medicine and finance. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models that lack domain-specific specialization. This lack of specialization results in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations. This paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to the domain. Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques. We also investigate how models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of their training data on this behavior. Leveraging these findings, we develop and open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications. Our evaluations demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on Tele-Eval while retaining their previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Decoding up to Hartmann-Tzeng and Roos bounds for rank codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of linear block codes which simultaneously generalizes Gabidulin codes and a class of skew cyclic codes is defined. For these codes, both a Hartmann-Tzeng-like bound and a Roos-like bound, with respect to their rank distance, are described, and corresponding nearest-neighbor decoding algorithms are presented. Additional necessary conditions so that decoding can be done up to the described bounds are studied. Subfield subcodes and interleaved codes from the considered class of codes are also described, since they allow an unbounded length for the codes, providing a decoding algorithm for them; additionally, both approaches are shown to yield equivalent codes with respect to the rank metric.</description>

      <title>SpikingRx: From Neural to Spiking Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an energy efficient neuromorphic receiver to replace multiple signal-processing blocks at the receiver by a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based module, called SpikingRx. We propose a deep convolutional SNN with spike-element-wise ResNet layers which takes a whole OFDM grid compliant with 5G specifications and provides soft outputs for decoded bits that can be used as log-likelihood ratios. We propose to employ the surrogate gradient descent method for training the SpikingRx and focus on its generalizability and robustness to quantization. Moreover, the interpretability of the proposed SpikingRx is studied by a comprehensive ablation study. Our extensive numerical simulations show that SpikingRx is capable of achieving significant block error rate performance gain compared to conventional 5G receivers and similar performance compared to its traditional NN-based counterparts with approximately 9x less energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Universal tester for multiple independence testing and classical-quantum arbitrarily varying multiple access channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two kinds of different problems. One is the multiple independence testing, which can be considered as a kind of generalization of quantum Stein's lemma. We test whether the quantum system is correlated to the classical system or is independent of it. Here, the null hypothesis is composed of states having the quantum system is correlated to the classical system in an arbitrarily varying form. The second problem is the problem of reliable communication over classical-quantum arbitrarily varying multiple access channels (CQ-AVMAC) and establishing its capacity region by giving multiple achievability techniques. We prove that each of these techniques is optimal by proving a converse. Further, for both these techniques, the decoder designed is a \emph{universal} decoder and can achieve any rate pair in the capacity region without time sharing and also these decoders do not depend on the channel and therefore they are universal. Our result covers the case when the channel parameter is continuous, which has not been studied even in the classical case. Further, both these techniques can be easily generalized to the case when there are $T (T&gt;2)$ senders. The design of each of these decoders is based on the study of multiple independence testing. This approach allows us to study the problem of reliable communication over CQ-AVMAC from the point of view of hypothesis testing. Further, we also give a necessary and sufficient condition for the deterministic code capacity region of CQ-AVMAC to be non-empty.</description>

      <title>OTFS-MDMA: An Elastic Multi-Domain Resource Utilization Mechanism for High Mobility Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By harnessing the delay-Doppler (DD) resource domain, orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) substantially improves the communication performance under high-mobility scenarios by maintaining quasi-time-invariant channel characteristics. However, conventional multiple access (MA) techniques fail to efficiently support OTFS in the face of diverse communication requirements. Recently, multi-dimensional MA (MDMA) has emerged as a flexible channel access technique by elastically exploiting multi-domain resources for tailored service provision. Therefore, we conceive an elastic multi-domain resource utilization mechanism for a novel multi-user OTFS-MDMA system by leveraging user-specific channel characteristics across the DD, power, and spatial resource domains. Specifically, we divide all DD resource bins into separate subregions called DD resource slots (RSs), each of which supports a fraction of users, thus reducing the multi-user interference. Then, the most suitable MA, including orthogonal, non-orthogonal, or spatial division MA (OMA/ NOMA/ SDMA), will be selected with each RS based on the interference levels in the power and spatial domains, thus enhancing the spectrum efficiency. Then, we jointly optimize the user assignment, access scheme selection, and power allocation in all DD RSs to maximize the weighted sum-rate subject to their minimum rate and various practical constraints. Since this results in a non-convex problem, we develop a dynamic programming and monotonic optimization (DPMO) method to find the globally optimal solution in the special case of disregarding rate constraints. Subsequently, we apply a low-complexity algorithm to find sub-optimal solutions in general cases.</description>

      <title>The Error Probability of Spatially Coupled Sparse Regression Codes over Memoryless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Regression Codes (SPARCs) are capacity-achieving codes introduced for communication over the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels and were later extended to general memoryless channels. In particular it was shown via threshold saturation that Spatially Coupled Sparse Regression Codes (SC-SPARCs) are capacity-achieving over general memoryless channels when using an Approximate Message Passing decoder (AMP). This paper, for the first time rigorously, analyzes the non-asymptotic performance of the Generalized Approximate Message Passing (GAMP) decoder of SC-SPARCs over memoryless channels, and proves exponential decaying error probability with respect to the code length.</description>

      <title>A response-adaptive multi-arm design for continuous endpoints based on a weighted information measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-arm trials are gaining interest in practice given the statistical and logistical advantages that they can offer. The standard approach is to use a fixed (throughout the trial) allocation ratio, but there is a call for making it adaptive and skewing the allocation of patients towards better performing arms. However, among other challenges, it is well-known that these approaches might suffer from lower statistical power. We present a response-adaptive design for continuous endpoints which explicitly allows to control the trade-off between the number of patients allocated to the 'optimal' arm and the statistical power. Such a balance is achieved through the calibration of a tuning parameter, and we explore various strategies to effectively select it. The proposed criterion is based on a context-dependent information measure which gives a greater weight to those treatment arms which have characteristics close to a pre-specified clinical target. We also introduce a simulation-based hypothesis testing procedure which focuses on selecting the target arm, discussing strategies to effectively control the type-I error rate. The potential advantage of the proposed criterion over currently used alternatives is evaluated in simulations, and its practical implementation is illustrated in the context of early Phase IIa proof-of-concept oncology clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Adaptive $k$-nearest neighbor classifier based on the local estimation of the shape operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) algorithm is one of the most popular methods for nonparametric classification. However, a relevant limitation concerns the definition of the number of neighbors $k$. This parameter exerts a direct impact on several properties of the classifier, such as the bias-variance tradeoff, smoothness of decision boundaries, robustness to noise, and class imbalance handling. In the present paper, we introduce a new adaptive $k$-nearest neighbours ($kK$-NN) algorithm that explores the local curvature at a sample to adaptively defining the neighborhood size. The rationale is that points with low curvature could have larger neighborhoods (locally, the tangent space approximates well the underlying data shape), whereas points with high curvature could have smaller neighborhoods (locally, the tangent space is a loose approximation). We estimate the local Gaussian curvature by computing an approximation to the local shape operator in terms of the local covariance matrix as well as the local Hessian matrix. Results on many real-world datasets indicate that the new $kK$-NN algorithm yields superior balanced accuracy compared to the established $k$-NN method and also another adaptive $k$-NN algorithm. This is particularly evident when the number of samples in the training data is limited, suggesting that the $kK$-NN is capable of learning more discriminant functions with less data considering many relevant cases.</description>

      <title>Covert Vehicle Misguidance and Its Detection: A Hypothesis Testing Game over Continuous-Time Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a stochastic zero-sum game to analyze the competition between the attacker, who tries to covertly misguide the vehicle to an unsafe region, versus the detector, who tries to detect the attack signal based on the observed trajectory of the vehicle. Based on Girsanov's theorem and the generalized Neyman-Pearson lemma, we show that a constant bias injection attack as the attacker's strategy and a likelihood ratio test as the detector's strategy constitute the unique saddle point of the game. We also derive the first-order and the second-order exponents of the type II error as a function of the data length.</description>

      <title>Robust Non-adaptive Group Testing under Errors in Group Membership Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $p$ samples, each of which may or may not be defective, group testing (GT) aims to determine their defect status by performing tests on $n &lt; p$ `groups', where a group is formed by mixing a subset of the $p$ samples. Assuming that the number of defective samples is very small compared to $p$, GT algorithms have provided excellent recovery of the status of all $p$ samples with even a small number of groups. Most existing methods, however, assume that the group memberships are accurately specified. This assumption may not always be true in all applications, due to various resource constraints. Such errors could occur, eg, when a technician, preparing the groups in a laboratory, unknowingly mixes together an incorrect subset of samples as compared to what was specified. We develop a new GT method, the Debiased Robust Lasso Test Method (DRLT), that handles such group membership specification errors. The proposed DRLT method is based on an approach to debias, or reduce the inherent bias in, estimates produced by Lasso, a popular and effective sparse regression technique. We also provide theoretical upper bounds on the reconstruction error produced by our estimator. Our approach is then combined with two carefully designed hypothesis tests respectively for (i) the identification of defective samples in the presence of errors in group membership specifications, and (ii) the identification of groups with erroneous membership specifications. The DRLT approach extends the literature on bias mitigation of statistical estimators such as the LASSO, to handle the important case when some of the measurements contain outliers, due to factors such as group membership specification errors. We present numerical results which show that our approach outperforms several baselines and robust regression techniques for identification of defective samples as well as erroneously specified groups.</description>

      <title>When resampling/reweighting improves feature learning in imbalanced classification?: A toy-model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A toy model of binary classification is studied with the aim of clarifying the class-wise resampling/reweighting effect on the feature learning performance under the presence of class imbalance. In the analysis, a high-dimensional limit of the feature is taken while keeping the dataset size ratio against the feature dimension finite and the non-rigorous replica method from statistical mechanics is employed. The result shows that there exists a case in which the no resampling/reweighting situation gives the best feature learning performance irrespectively of the choice of losses or classifiers, supporting recent findings in Cao et al. (2019); Kang et al. (2019). It is also revealed that the key of the result is the symmetry of the loss and the problem setting. Inspired by this, we propose a further simplified model exhibiting the same property for the multiclass setting. These clarify when the class-wise resampling/reweighting becomes effective in imbalanced classification.</description>

      <title>Converse for Multi-Server Single-Message PIR with Side Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.09861v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-server single-message private information retrieval is studied in the presence of side information. In this problem, $K$ independent messages are replicatively stored at $N$ non-colluding servers. The user wants to privately download one message from the servers without revealing the index of the message to any of the servers, leveraging its $M$ side information messages. We assume that the servers only know the number of the side information messages available at the user but not their indices. We prove a converse bound on the maximum download rates, which coincides with the known achievability scheme proposed by Kadhe {\it et. al.}. Hence, we characterize the capacity for this problem, which is $(1+\frac{1}{N}+\frac{1}{N^2}+\dots+\frac{1}{N^{\left\lceil \frac{K}{M+1}\right\rceil-1}})^{-1}$. The proof leverages a novel concept that we call {\it virtual side information}, which, for a fixed query and any message, identifies the side information that would be needed in order to recover that message.</description>

      <title>Optical Integrated Sensing and Communication with Light-Emitting Diode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new optical integrated sensing and communication (O-ISAC) framework tailored for cost-effective Light-Emitting Diode (LED) for enhanced Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Unlike prior research on ISAC, which predominantly focused on radio frequency (RF) band, O-ISAC capitalizes on the inherent advantages of the optical spectrum, including the ultra-wide license-free bandwidth, immunity to RF interference, and energy efficiency -- attributes crucial for IoT communications. The communication and sensing in our O-ISAC system unfold in two phases: directionless O-ISAC and directional O-ISAC. In the first phase, distributed optical access points emit non-directional light for communication and leverage small-aperture imaging principles for sensing. In the second phase, we put forth the concept of optical beamforming, using collimating lenses to concentrate light, resulting in substantial performance enhancements in both communication and sensing. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and impressive performance of O-ISAC benchmarked against optical separate communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>The Principle of Uncertain Maximum Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The principle of maximum entropy is a well-established technique for choosing a distribution that matches available information while minimizing bias. It finds broad use across scientific disciplines and in machine learning. However, the principle as defined by is susceptible to noise and error in observations. This forces real-world practitioners to use relaxed versions of the principle in an ad hoc way, negatively impacting interpretation. To address this situation, we present a new principle we call uncertain maximum entropy that generalizes the classic principle and provides interpretable solutions irrespective of the observational methods in use. We introduce a convex approximation and expectation-maximization based algorithm for finding solutions to our new principle. Finally, we contrast this new technique with two simpler generally applicable solutions theoretically and experimentally show our technique provides superior accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a correspondence between a fuzzy linear code and a family of nested linear codes. We also describe the arithmetic of fuzzy linear codes. As a special class of nested linear codes, we consider a family of nested self-orthogonal codes. A linear code is self-orthogonal if it is contained in its dual and self-dual if it is equal to its dual. We introduce a definition of fuzzy self-dual or self-orthogonal codes which include classical self-dual or self-orthogonal codes. As examples, we construct several interesting classes of fuzzy linear codes including fuzzy Hamming codes, fuzzy Golay codes, and fuzzy Reed-Muller codes. We also give a general decoding algorithm for fuzzy linear codes.</description>

      <title>Is Synchronization a Bottleneck for Pilot-Assisted URLLC Links?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework to evaluate the so-called random-coding union bound with parameter $s$ (RCUs) on the achievable error probability in the finite-blocklength regime for a pilot-assisted transmission scheme operating over an imperfectly synchronized and memoryless block-fading waveform channel. Unlike previous results, which disregard the effects of imperfect synchronization, our framework utilizes pilots for both synchronization and channel estimation. Specifically, we provide an algorithm to perform joint synchronization and channel estimation, and verify its accuracy by observing its tightness in comparison with the Cramer-Rao bound. Then, we develop an RCUs bound on the error probability, which applies for a receiver that treats the estimates provided by the algorithm as accurate. Additionally, we utilize the saddlepoint approximation to provide a numerically efficient method for evaluating the RCUs bound in this scenario. Our numerical experiments verify the accuracy of the proposed approximation. Moreover, when the delays are modeled as fully dependent across fading blocks, numerical results indicate that the number of pilot symbols needed to estimate the fading channel gains to the level of accuracy required in ultra-reliable low-latency communication is also sufficient to acquire sufficiently good synchronization. However, when the delays are modeled as independent across blocks, synchronization becomes the bottleneck for the system performance.</description>

      <title>RIS Empowered Near-Field Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies an extremely large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surface (XL-RIS) empowered covert communication system in the near-field region. Alice covertly transmits messages to Bob with the assistance of the XL-RIS, while evading detection by Willie. To enhance the covert communication performance, we maximize the achievable covert rate by jointly optimizing the hybrid analog and digital beamformers at Alice, as well as the reflection coefficient matrix at the XL-RIS. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the joint beamforming design problem. For the hybrid beamformer design, a semi-closed-form solution for fully digital beamformer is first obtained by a weighted minimum mean-square error based algorithm, then the baseband digital and analog beamformers at Alice are designed by approximating the fully digital beamformer via manifold optimization. For the XL-RIS's reflection coefficient matrix design, a low-complexity alternating direction method of multipliers based algorithm is proposed to address the challenge of large-scale variables and unit-modulus constraints. Numerical results unveil that i) the near-field communications can achieve a higher covert rate than the far-field covert communications in general, and still realize covert transmission even if Willie is located at the same direction as Bob and closer to the XL-RIS; ii) the proposed algorithm can enhance the covert rate significantly compared to the benchmark schemes; iii) the proposed algorithm leads to a beam diffraction pattern that can bypass Willie and achieve high-rate covert transmission to Bob.</description>

      <title>Game of Coding: Beyond Honest-Majority Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16643v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coding theory revolves around the incorporation of redundancy into transmitted symbols, computation tasks, and stored data to guard against adversarial manipulation. However, error correction in coding theory is contingent upon a strict trust assumption. In the context of computation and storage, it is required that honest nodes outnumber adversarial ones by a certain margin. However, in several emerging real-world cases, particularly, in decentralized blockchain-oriented applications, such assumptions are often unrealistic. Consequently, despite the important role of coding in addressing significant challenges within decentralized systems, its applications become constrained. Still, in decentralized platforms, a distinctive characteristic emerges, offering new avenues for secure coding beyond the constraints of conventional methods. In these scenarios, the adversary benefits when the legitimate decoder recovers the data, and preferably with a high estimation error. This incentive motivates them to act rationally, trying to maximize their gains. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic formulation for coding, called the game of coding, that captures this unique dynamic where each of the adversaries and the data collector (decoder) have respective utility functions to optimize. The utility functions reflect the fact that both the data collector and the adversary are interested in increasing the chance of data being recoverable by the data collector. Moreover, the utility functions express the interest of the data collector to estimate the input with lower estimation error, but the opposite interest of the adversary. As a first, still highly non-trivial step, we characterize the equilibrium of the game for the repetition code with a repetition factor of 2 for a wide class of utility functions with minimal assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Storing digital data in synthetic DNA faces challenges in ensuring data reliability in the presence of edit errors -- deletions, insertions, and substitutions -- that occur randomly during various phases of the storage process. Current limitations in DNA synthesis technology also require the use of short DNA sequences, highlighting the particular need for short edit-correcting codes. Motivated by these factors, we introduce a systematic code designed to correct random edits while adhering to typical length constraints in DNA storage. We evaluate the performance of the code through simulations and assess its effectiveness within a DNA storage framework, revealing promising results.</description>

      <title>Unified Capacity Results for Free-Space Optical Communication Systems Over Gamma-Gamma Atmospheric Turbulence Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11352v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmit power control, as in the mobile wireless channels, can enable a robust and spectrally efficient communication through atmospheric turbulence in terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) channels. With optical bandwidths in excess of several GHz and eye safety regulations limiting the transmit optical power, the per hertz signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in terrestrial FSO systems can possibly become limited. This is especially true for future high-bandwidth and long-haul terrestrial systems based on coherent optical communications. Hence, power control becomes significant in terrestrial FSO communication systems. However, a comprehensive study of dynamic power adaptation in the existing FSO systems is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we investigate perfectly beam power-controlled terrestrial FSO communication systems with heterodyne detection and direct detection based receivers operating under shot noise-limited conditions. Under these systems considerations, we derive unified exact and asymptotic capacity formulas for the Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels with and without pointing errors. The numerical results highlight the intricate relations of atmospheric turbulence and pointing error parameters in typical terrestrial FSO channel settings. More importantly, a concrete assessment of the impact of the key channel parameters on the capacity performances of the aforementioned FSO systems is performed revealing several novel and interesting insights.</description>

Abstract: At the heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) -- a domain witnessing explosive growth -- the imperative for energy efficiency and the extension of device lifespans has never been more pressing. This paper presents DEEP-IoT, an innovative communication paradigm poised to redefine how IoT devices communicate. Through a pioneering feedback channel coding strategy, DEEP-IoT challenges and transforms the traditional transmitter (IoT devices)-centric communication model to one where the receiver (the access point) play a pivotal role, thereby cutting down energy use and boosting device longevity. We not only conceptualize DEEP-IoT but also actualize it by integrating deep learning-enhanced feedback channel codes within a narrow-band system. Simulation results show a significant enhancement in the operational lifespan of IoT cells -- surpassing traditional systems using Turbo and Polar codes by up to 52.71%. This leap signifies a paradigm shift in IoT communications, setting the stage for a future where IoT devices boast unprecedented efficiency and durability.</description>

      <title>Secure Full-Duplex Communication via Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates physical layer security (PLS) in a movable antenna (MA)-assisted full-duplex (FD) system. In this system, an FD base station (BS) with multiple MAs for transmission and reception provides services for an uplink (UL) user and a downlink (DL) user. Each user operates in half-duplex (HD) mode and is equipped with a single fixed-position antenna (FPA), in the presence of a single-FPA eavesdropper (Eve). To ensure secure communication, artificial noise (AN) is transmitted to obstruct the interception of Eve. The objective of this paper is to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of the UL and DL users by jointly optimizing the beamformers of the BS and the positions of MAs. This paper also proposes an alternating optimization (AO) method to address the non-convex problem, which decomposes the optimization problem into three subproblems and solves them iteratively. Simulation results demonstrate a significant performance gain in the SSR achieved by the proposed scheme compared to the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Codes Correcting Two Bursts of Exactly $b$ Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03113v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate codes designed to correct two bursts of deletions, where each burst has a length of exactly $b$, where $b&gt;1$. The previous best construction, achieved through the syndrome compression technique, had a redundancy of at most $7\log n+O\left(\log n/\log\log n\right)$ bits. In contrast, our work introduces a novel approach for constructing $q$-ary codes that attain a redundancy of at most $5\log n+O(\log\log n)$ bits for all $b&gt;1$ and $q\ge2$. Additionally, for the case where $b=1$, we present a new construction of $q$-ary two-deletion correcting codes with a redundancy of $5\log n+O(\log\log n)$ bits, for all $q&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna (6DMA) for Wireless Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an emerging technology that is able to fully exploit the spatial variation of wireless channels by controlling the 3D positions and 3D rotations of distributed antennas/antenna surfaces at the transmitter/receiver. In this letter, we apply 6DMA at the base station (BS) to enhance its wireless sensing performance over a given set of regions. To this end, we first divide each region into a number of equal-size subregions and select one typical target location within each subregion. Then, we derive an expression for the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the directions of arrival (DoAs) from these typical target locations in all regions, which sheds light on the sensing performance of 6DMA enhanced systems in terms of a power gain and a geometric gain. Next, we minimize the CRB for DoA estimation via jointly optimizing the positions and rotations of all 6DMAs at the BS, subject to practical movement constraints, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem sub-optimally. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the significant improvement in DoA estimation accuracy achieved by the proposed 6DMA sensing scheme as compared to various benchmark schemes, for both isotropic and directive antenna radiation patterns.</description>

      <title>Universality of Approximate Message Passing algorithms and tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13037v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms provide a valuable tool for studying mean-field approximations and dynamics in a variety of applications. Although these algorithms are often first derived for matrices having independent Gaussian entries or satisfying rotational invariance in law, their state evolution characterizations are expected to hold over larger universality classes of random matrix ensembles.
  We develop several new results on AMP universality. For AMP algorithms tailored to independent Gaussian entries, we show that their state evolutions hold over broadly defined generalized Wigner and white noise ensembles, including matrices with heavy-tailed entries and heterogeneous entrywise variances that may arise in data applications. For AMP algorithms tailored to rotational invariance in law, we show that their state evolutions hold over delocalized sign-and-permutation-invariant matrix ensembles that have a limit distribution over the diagonal, including sensing matrices composed of subsampled Hadamard or Fourier transforms and diagonal operators.
  We establish these results via a simplified moment-method proof, reducing AMP universality to the study of products of random matrices and diagonal tensors along a tensor network. As a by-product of our analyses, we show that the aforementioned matrix ensembles satisfy a notion of asymptotic freeness with respect to such tensor networks, which parallels usual definitions of freeness for traces of matrix products.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Routing Based on Fidelity Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How to efficiently distribute entanglement over large-scale quantum networks is still an open problem that greatly depends on the technology considered. In this work, we consider quantum networks where each link is characterized by a trade-off between the entanglement generation rate and fidelity. For such networks, we look at the two following problems: the one of finding the best path to connect any two given nodes, and the problem of finding the best starting node in order to connect three nodes in the network multipartite entanglement routing. Two entanglement distribution models are considered: one where entangled qubits are distributed one at a time, and a flow model where a large number of entangled qubits are distributed simultaneously. The paper proposes of a quite general methodology that uses continuous fidelity curves (i.e., entanglement generation fidelity vs. rate) as the main routing metric. Combined with multi-objective path-finding algorithms, the fidelity curves describing each link allow finding a set of paths that maximize both the end-to-end fidelity and the entanglement generation rate. For the link models and networks considered, it is proven that the algorithm always converges to the optimal solution. It is also shown through simulation that the execution time grows polynomially with the number of network nodes (growing with a power between $1$ and $1.4$, depending on the network)</description>

      <title>On Closed-Form Expressions for the Fisher-Rao Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao distance is the geodesic distance between probability distributions in a statistical manifold equipped with the Fisher metric, which is a natural choice of Riemannian metric on such manifolds. It has recently been applied to supervised and unsupervised problems in machine learning, in various contexts. Finding closed-form expressions for the Fisher-Rao distance is generally a non-trivial task, and those are only available for a few families of probability distributions. In this survey, we collect examples of closed-form expressions for the Fisher-Rao distance of both discrete and continuous distributions, aiming to present them in a unified and accessible language. In doing so, we also: illustrate the relation between negative multinomial distributions and the hyperbolic model, include a few new examples, and write a few more in the standard form of elliptical distributions.</description>

      <title>Estimating Conditional Mutual Information for Dynamic Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic feature selection, where we sequentially query features to make accurate predictions with a minimal budget, is a promising paradigm to reduce feature acquisition costs and provide transparency into a model's predictions. The problem is challenging, however, as it requires both predicting with arbitrary feature sets and learning a policy to identify valuable selections. Here, we take an information-theoretic perspective and prioritize features based on their mutual information with the response variable. The main challenge is implementing this policy, and we design a new approach that estimates the mutual information in a discriminative rather than generative fashion. Building on our approach, we then introduce several further improvements: allowing variable feature budgets across samples, enabling non-uniform feature costs, incorporating prior information, and exploring modern architectures to handle partial inputs. Our experiments show that our method provides consistent gains over recent methods across a variety of datasets.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Entanglement of Distant Features in Adversarial Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15669v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this research, we introduce 'computational entanglement', a phenomenon in overparameterized neural networks where the model exploits noise patterns in ways conceptually linked to the effects of length contraction. More specific, our findings demonstrate that overparameterized feedforward linear networks can easily achieve zero loss by fitting random noise, even with test samples that were never encountered during training. This phenomenon accompanies length contraction, where trained and test samples converge at the same point within a spacetime diagram. Unlike most models that rely on supervised learning, our method operates unsupervised, without the need for labels or gradient-based optimization. Additionally, we show a novel application of computational entanglement: transforming adversarial examples-highly non-robuts inputs imperceptible to human observers-into outputs that are recognizable and robust. This challenges conventional views on non-robust features in adversarial example generation, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms. Our results emphasize the importance of computational entanglement for enhancing model robustness and understanding neural networks in adversarial contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the natural isomorphism between GF(2^h) and GF(2)^h induces a bijection between stabiliser codes on n quqits with local dimension q=2^h and binary stabiliser codes on hn qubits. This allows us to describe these codes geometrically: a stabiliser code over a field of even order corresponds to a so-called quantum set of symplectic polar spaces. Moreover, equivalent stabiliser codes have a similar geometry, which can be used to prove the uniqueness of a [[4,0,3]]_4 stabiliser code and the nonexistence of both a [[7,1,4]]_4 and an [[8,0,5]]_4 stabiliser code.</description>

      <title>Process-and-Forward: Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Over Cooperative Relay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) schemes for image transmission over cooperative relay channels. The relay either amplifies-and-forwards its received signal, called DeepJSCC-AF, or leverages neural networks to extract relevant features from its received signal, called DeepJSCC-PF (Process-and-Forward). We consider both half- and full-duplex relays, and propose a novel transformer-based model at the relay. For a half-duplex relay, it is shown that the proposed scheme learns to generate correlated signals at the relay and source to obtain beamforming gains. In the full-duplex case, we introduce a novel block-based transmission strategy, in which the source transmits in blocks, and the relay updates its knowledge about the input signal after each block and generates its own signal. To enhance practicality, a single transformer-based model is used at the relay at each block, together with an adaptive transmission module, which allows the model to seamlessly adapt to different channel qualities and the transmission powers}. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of DeepJSCC-PF compared to the state-of-the-art BPG image compression algorithm operating at the maximum achievable rate of conventional decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward protocols, in both half- and full-duplex relay scenarios over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels.</description>

Abstract: We determine the higher weight spectra of $q$-ary Reed-Muller codes $C_q=RM_q(2,2)$ for all prime powers $q$. This is equivalent to finding the usual weight distributions of all extension codes of $C_q$ over every field extension of $F_q$ of finite degree. To obtain our results we will utilize well-known connections between these weights and properties of the Stanley-Reisner rings of a series of matroids associated to each code $C_q$. In the process, we are able to explicitly determine all the graded Betti numbers of matroids associated to $C_q$ and its elongations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove bounds on statistical distances between high-dimensional exchangeable mixture distributions (which we call permutation mixtures) and their i.i.d. counterparts. Our results are based on a novel method for controlling $\chi^2$ divergences between exchangeable mixtures, which is tighter than the existing methods of moments or cumulants. At a technical level, a key innovation in our proofs is a new Maclaurin-type inequality for elementary symmetric polynomials of variables that sum to zero and an upper bound on permanents of doubly-stochastic positive semidefinite matrices. Our results imply a de Finetti-style theorem (in the language of Diaconis and Freedman, 1987) and general asymptotic results for compound decision problems, generalizing and strengthening a result of Hannan and Robbins (1955).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of FCNNs (Fully Connected Neural Networks) for designing end-to-end communication systems without taking any inspiration from existing classical communications models or error control coding. This work relies solely on the tools of information theory and machine learning. We investigate the impact of using various cost functions based on mutual information and pairwise distances between codewords to generate robust representations for transmission under strict power constraints. Additionally, we introduce a novel encoder structure inspired by the Barlow Twins framework. Our results show that iterative training with randomly chosen noise power levels while minimizing block error rate provides the best error performance.</description>
