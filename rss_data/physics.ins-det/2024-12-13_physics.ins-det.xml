      <title>Performance of the prototype beam drift chamber for LAMPS at RAON with proton and Carbon-12 beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam Drift Chamber (BDC) is designed to reconstruct the trajectories of incident rare isotope beams provided by RAON (Rare isotope Accelerator complex for ON-line experiments) into the experimental target of LAMPS (Large Acceptance Multi-Purpose Spectrometer). To conduct the performance test of the BDC, the prototype BDC (pBDC) is manufactured and evaluated with the high energy ion beams from HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) facility in Japan. Two kinds of ion beams, 100 MeV proton, and 200 MeV/u $^{12}$C, have been utilized for this evaluation, and the track reconstruction efficiency and position resolution have been measured as the function of applied high voltage. This paper introduces the construction details and presents the track reconstruction efficiency and position resolution of pBDC.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-assisted techniques for Compton-background discrimination in Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors are powerful detectors for gamma-ray spectroscopy. The sensitivity to low-intensity gamma-ray peaks is often hindered by the presence of Compton continuum distributions, originated by gamma-rays emitted at higher energies. This study explores novel, pulse shape-based, machine learning-assisted techniques to enhance Compton background discrimination in Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe TM) detectors. We introduce two machine learning models: an autoencoder-MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). These models differentiate single-site events (SSEs) from multi-site events (MSEs) and train on signal waveforms produced in the detector. The GMM method differs from previous machine learning efforts in that it is fully unsupervised, hence not requiring specific data labelling during the training phase. Being both label-free and simulation-agnostic makes the unsupervised approach particularly advantageous for tasks where realistic, high-fidelity labeling is challenging or where biases introduced by simulated data must be avoided. In our analysis, the full-energy Peak-to-Compton ratio of the 137-Cs, a radionuclide contained in a cryoconite sample, exhibits an improvement from 0.238 in the original spectrum to 0.547 after the ACM data filtering and 0.414 after the GMM data filtering, demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods. The results also showcase an enhancement in the signal-to-background ratio across many regions of interest, enabling the detection of lower concentrations of radionuclides.</description>

      <title>Evidence of enhanced two-level system loss suppression in high-Q, thin film aluminum microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As superconducting kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) continue to grow in popularity for sensitive sub-mm detection and other applications, there is a drive to advance toward lower loss devices. We present measurements of diagnostic thin film aluminum coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators designed to inform ongoing KID development at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The resonators span $\rm f_0 = 3.5 - 4$\,GHz and include both quarter-wave and half-wave resonators with varying coupling capacitor designs. We present measurements of the device film properties and an analysis of the dominant mechanisms of loss in the resonators measured in a dark environment. We demonstrate quality factors of $\rm Q_i^{-1} \approx 3.64 - 8.57 \times10^{-8}$, and observe enhanced suppression of two-level system (TLS) loss in our devices at high internal microwave power levels before the onset of quasiparticle dissipation from microwave heating. We observe deviations from the standard TLS loss model at low powers and temperatures below 60 mK, and use a modified model to describe this behavior.</description>

      <title>Characterizing hole trap production due to proton irradiation in germanium cross-strip detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the effects of high-energy proton damage on charge trapping in germanium cross-strip detectors, with the goal of accomplishing three important measurements. First, we calibrated and characterized the spectral resolution of a spare COSI-balloon detector in order to determine the effects of intrinsic trapping, finding that electron trapping due to impurities dominates over hole trapping in the undamaged detector. Second, we performed two rounds of proton irradiation of the detector in order to quantify, for the first time, the rate at which charge traps are produced by proton irradiation. We find that the product of the hole trap density and cross-sectional area, $[n\sigma]_\mathrm{h}$ follows a linear relationship with the proton fluence, $F_\mathrm{p}$, with a slope of $(5.4\pm0.4)\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{cm/p^{+}}$. Third, by utilizing our measurements of physical trapping parameters, we performed calibrations which corrected for the effects of trapping and mitigated degradation to the spectral resolution of the detector.</description>

      <title>TCAD Simulation of Two Photon Absorption -- Transient Current Technique measurements on Silicon Detectors and LGADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device simulation plays a crucial role in complementing experimental device characterisation by enabling deeper understanding of internal physical processes. However, for simulations to be trusted, experimental validation is essential to confirm the accuracy of the conclusions drawn.In the framework of semiconductor detector characterisation, one powerful tool for such validation is the Two Photon Absorption - Transient Current Technique (TPA-TCT), which allows for highly precise, three-dimensional spatially-resolved characterisation of semiconductor detectors. In this work, the TCAD framework Synopsys Sentaurus is used to simulate depth-resolved TPA-TCT data for both p-type pad detectors (PINs) and Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs). The simulated data are compared against experimentally measured TPA-TCT results. Through this comparison, it is demonstrated that TCAD simulations can reproduce the TPA-TCT measurements, providing valuable insights into the TPA-TCT itself. Another significant outcome of this study is the successful simulation of the gain reduction mechanism, which can be observed in LGADs with increasing densities of excess charge carriers. This effect is demonstrated in an p-type LGAD with a thickness of approximately 286 um. The results confirm the ability of TCAD to model the complex interaction between carrier dynamics and device gain.</description>

      <title>Molten salt ion source using glass capillaries as emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proof of concept of an ion source using a molten salt mixture to produce a beam of desired alkali ions like Cs$^+$ when polarized positively or oxygen complexes like NO$_3^-$ when polarized negatively. Similar to liquid metal ion sources, the ions of the salt are emitted by field evaporation from a Taylor cone formed under the influence of an intense electric field, but unlike liquid metal sources, the meniscus of the Taylor cone is not anchored on the tip of a tungsten needle but rather on the tip of a conical glass capillary containing the molten salt. We succeeded in producing a stable ion beam emission of several $\mu$A for about 50 min. We also discuss the behavior of the molten salt mixture in vacuum conditions, as to our knowledge, molten salts in vacuum conditions are not well documented in the literature, while their properties are essential to the design of the presented ion source.</description>
