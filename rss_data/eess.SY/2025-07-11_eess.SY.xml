      <title>Multilayer GNN for Predictive Maintenance and Clustering in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unplanned power outages cost the US economy over $150 billion annually, partly due to predictive maintenance (PdM) models that overlook spatial, temporal, and causal dependencies in grid failures. This study introduces a multilayer Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to enhance PdM and enable resilience-based substation clustering. Using seven years of incident data from Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric (292,830 records across 347 substations), the framework integrates Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks (temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), fused through attention-weighted embeddings. Our model achieves a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935 +/- 0.0258, outperforming XGBoost and Random Forest by 3.2% and 2.7%, and single-layer GNNs by 10 to 15 percent. Removing the causal layer drops performance to 0.7354 +/- 0.0418. For resilience analysis, HDBSCAN clustering on HierarchicalRiskGNN embeddings identifies eight operational risk groups. The highest-risk cluster (Cluster 5, 44 substations) shows 388.4 incidents/year and 602.6-minute recovery time, while low-risk groups report fewer than 62 incidents/year. ANOVA (p &lt; 0.0001) confirms significant inter-cluster separation. Our clustering outperforms K-Means and Spectral Clustering with a Silhouette Score of 0.626 and Davies-Bouldin index of 0.527. This work supports proactive grid management through improved failure prediction and risk-aware substation clustering.</description>

      <title>Probability-Raising Causality for Uncertain Parametric Markov Decision Processes with PAC Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent decision-making systems are increasingly complicated, making it crucial to verify and understand their behavior for a given specification. A promising approach is to comprehensively explain undesired behavior in the systems modeled by Markov decision processes (MDPs) through formal verification and causal reasoning. However, the reliable explanation using model-based probabilistic causal analysis has not been explored when the MDP's transition probabilities are uncertain. This paper proposes a method to identify potential causes of undesired behaviors in an uncertain parametric MDP (upMDP) using parameter sampling, model checking, and a set covering for the samples. A cause is defined as a subset of states based on a probability-raising principle. We show that the probability of each identified subset being a cause exceeds a specified threshold. Further, a lower bound of the probability that the undesired paths visit the subsets is maximized as much as possible while satisfying a nonredundancy condition. While computing these probabilities is complicated, this study derives probabilistically approximately correct lower bounds of both probabilities by the sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through a path-planning scenario.</description>

      <title>Distributed and adaptive model predictive control for vehicle platoon systems under non-ideal communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty of wireless communication poses significant challenges to platoon control performance. Aiming at alleviating the influence of non-ideal communication on the platoon system, this paper proposes a distributed and adaptive model predictive control (MPC) method. First of all, to deal with the transmission uncertainty caused by non-ideal communication, compensated data packets are customized for each vehicle. Then, an adaptive model predictive control method is proposed to balance the system response speed and tracking accuracy. Furthermore, to reduce the computational requirements of the vehicle platoon system, a predictive time-domain update strategy suitable for non-ideal communication was introduced. Finally, the sufficient conditions for ensuring the feasibility of the MPC algorithm and the stability of the closed-loop platoon control system are theoretically analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the computing resource requirements for solving the optimization problem while ensuring satisfactory system performance.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Probabilistic Constellation Shaping for Optical OFDM Systems with Clipping Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) have emerged as powerful techniques to enhance the performance of optical wireless communications (OWC) systems. While PCS improves spectral efficiency and adaptability, we show that its integration with optical OFDM can inadvertently increase the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the signal, exacerbating clipping distortion due to signal clipping. This letter investigates the impact of PCS on the PAPR of direct current-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) waveforms and proposes an optimization of PCS that maximizes channel capacity, considering clipping distortion. The optimization problem is shown to be complex and non-convex. We thus present a suboptimal yet efficient solving approach based on projected gradient descent to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the conventional uniform signaling, particularly under severe clipping distortion conditions.</description>

      <title>Perspective Chapter: Insights from Kalman Filtering with Correlated Noises Recursive Least-Square Algorithm for State and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the estimation of parameters and states for linear stochastic systems with deterministic control inputs. It introduces a novel Kalman filtering approach called Kalman Filtering with Correlated Noises Recursive Generalized Extended Least Squares (KF-CN-RGELS) algorithm, which leverages the cross-correlation between process noise and measurement noise in Kalman filtering cycles to jointly estimate both parameters and system states. The study also investigates the theoretical implications of the correlation coefficient on estimation accuracy through performance analysis involving various correlation coefficients between process and measurement noises. The research establishes a clear relationship: the accuracy of identified parameters and states is directly proportional to positive correlation coefficients. To validate the efficacy of this algorithm, a comprehensive comparison is conducted among different algorithms, including the standard Kalman filter algorithm and the augmented-state Kalman filter with correlated noises algorithm. Theoretical findings are not only presented but also exemplified through a numerical case study to provide valuable insights into practical implications. This work contributes to enhancing estimation accuracy in linear stochastic systems with deterministic control inputs, offering valuable insights for control system design and state-space modeling.</description>

      <title>PhysioEdge: Multimodal Compressive Sensing Platform for Wearable Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of compressive sensing with real-time embedded systems opens new possibilities for efficient, low-power biomedical signal acquisition. This paper presents a custom hardware platform based on the RP2350 micro-controller, tailored for synchronized multi-modal biomedical monitoring. The system is capable of capturing cardiopulmonary sounds, along with biopotential signals such as phonocardiography (PCG), electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data for posture recognition. To ensure sample-accurate synchronization, a Sub-1GHz radio system is used across multiple nodes. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity enable centralized data aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate the achieved decrease in power consumption when using compressive sensing, efficient multi-node synchronization, and scalability for wireless biomedical monitoring applications. The compact form factor and low-cost design make it suitable for various medical applications, including remote healthcare and long-term monitoring.</description>

      <title>Remote Renewable Energy Hubs: a Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serving the energy demand with renewable energy is hindered by its limited availability near load centres (i.e. places where the energy demand is high). To address this challenge, the concept of Remote Renewable Energy Hubs (RREH) emerges as a promising solution. RREHs are energy hubs located in areas with abundant renewable energy sources, such as sun in the Sahara Desert or wind in Greenland. In these hubs, renewable energy sources are used to synthetise energy molecules. To produce specific energy molecules, a tailored hub configuration must be designed, which means choosing a set of technologies that are interacting with each other as well as defining how they are integrated in their local environment. The plurality of technologies that may be employed in RREHs results in a large diversity of hubs. In order to characterize this diversity, we propose in this paper a taxonomy for accurately defining these hubs. This taxonomy allows to better describe and compare designs of hubs as well as to identify new ones. Thus, it may guide policymakers and engineers in hub design, contributing to cost efficiency and/or improving local integration.</description>

      <title>Ammonia, Methane, Hydrogen and Methanol Produced in Remote Renewable Energy Hubs: a Comparative Quantitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote renewable energy hubs (RREHs) for synthetic fuel production are engineering systems harvesting renewable energy where it is particularly abundant. They produce transportable synthetic fuels for export to distant load centers. This article aims to evaluate the production costs of different energy carriers, and includes a discussion on advantages and disadvantages in terms of technical performance. To do so, we extend the study of Berger et al., (2021) which focuses on methane (CH4) as energy carrier and introduce three new carriers: ammonia (NH3), hydrogen (H2) and methanol (CH3OH). The four different RREHs are located in the Algerian Sahara desert and must serve to the load center, Belgium, a constant electro-fuel demand of 10 TWh per year. The modelling and optimisation of these systems are performed using the modelling language GBOML (Graph-Based Optimisation Modelling Language). Our findings reveal that the three new RREHs, each with its respective carrier (ammonia, hydrogen, and methanol), are all more cost-effective than the methane-based system. Ammonia demonstrates the most favourable cost-to-energy exported ratio.</description>

      <title>Set-Based Control Barrier Functions and Safety Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High performance and formal safety guarantees are common requirements for industrial control applications. Control barrier function (CBF) methods provide a systematic approach to the modularization of safety and performance. However, the design of such CBFs can be challenging, which limits their applicability to large-scale or data-driven systems. This paper introduces the concept of a set-based CBF for linear systems with convex constraints. By leveraging control invariant sets from reachability analysis and predictive control, the set-based CBF is defined implicitly through the minimal scaling of such a set to contain the current system state. This approach enables the development of implicit, data-driven, and high-dimensional CBF representations. The paper demonstrates the design of a safety filter using set-based CBFs, which is suitable for real-time implementations and learning-based approximations to reduce online computational demands. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through comprehensive simulations on a high-dimensional mass-spring-damper system and a motion control task, and it is validated experimentally using an electric drive application with short sampling times, highlighting its practical benefits for safety-critical control.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Smallest Adversarial Load Perturbations that Render DC-OPF Infeasible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the globally smallest load perturbation that renders DC-OPF infeasible? Reliably identifying such "adversarial attack" perturbations has useful applications in a variety of emerging grid-related contexts, including machine learning performance verification, cybersecurity, and operational robustness of power systems dominated by stochastic renewable energy resources. In this paper, we formulate the inherently nonconvex adversarial attack problem by applying a parameterized version of Farkas' lemma to a perturbed set of DC-OPF equations. Since the resulting formulation is very hard to globally optimize, we also propose a parameterized generation control policy which, when applied to the primal DC-OPF problem, provides solvability guarantees. Together, these nonconvex problems provide guaranteed upper and lower bounds on adversarial attack size; by combining them into a single optimization problem, we can efficiently "squeeze" these bounds towards a common global solution. We apply these methods on a range of small- to medium-sized test cases from PGLib, benchmarking our results against the best adversarial attack lower bounds provided by Gurobi 12.0's spatial Branch and Bound solver.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Control Leveraging LLMs: An Agentic Framework for Next-Generation Industrial Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans. In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25 states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance, while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient, language-driven automation in chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Robustness Bounds for Distributed Asynchronous Shortest-Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes convergence times and robustness bounds for asynchronous distributed shortest-path computation. We focus on the Adaptive Bellman--Ford algorithm, a self-stabilizing method in which each agent updates its shortest-path estimate based only on the estimates of its neighbors and forgetting its previous estimate. In the asynchronous framework considered in this paper, agents are allowed to idle or encounter race conditions during their execution of the Adaptive Bellman--Ford algorithm. We build on Lyapunov-based results that develop finite-time convergence and robustness bounds for the synchronous shortest-path setting, in order to produce finite-time convergence and robustness bounds for the asynchronous setting. We also explore robustness against interval-bounded noise processes and establish convergence and robustness guarantees for asynchronous most-probable-path algorithms.</description>

      <title>Classifying Emergence in Robot Swarms: An Observer-Dependent Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergence and swarms are widely discussed topics, yet no consensus exists on their formal definitions. This lack of agreement makes it difficult not only for new researchers to grasp these concepts, but also for experts who may use the same terms to mean different things. Many attempts have been made to objectively define 'swarm' or 'emergence,' with recent work highlighting the role of the external observer. Still, several researchers argue that once an observer's vantage point (e.g., scope, resolution, context) is established, the terms can be made objective or measured quantitatively. In this note, we propose a framework to discuss these ideas rigorously by separating externally observable states from latent, unobservable ones. This allows us to compare and contrast existing definitions of swarms and emergence on common ground. We argue that these concepts are ultimately subjective-shaped less by the system itself than by the perception and tacit knowledge of the observer. Specifically, we suggest that a 'swarm' is not defined by its group behavior alone, but by the process generating that behavior. Our broader goal is to support the design and deployment of robotic swarm systems, highlighting the critical distinction between multi-robot systems and true swarms.</description>

      <title>Discrete Beamforming Optimization for RISs with a Limited Phase Range and Amplitude Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the received power at a user equipment via reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) characterized by phase-dependent amplitude (PDA) and discrete phase shifts over a limited phase range. Given complex RIS coefficients, that is, discrete phase shifts and PDAs, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the optimal solution. To this end, we propose an optimal search algorithm that is proven to converge in linear time within at most NK steps, significantly outperforming the exhaustive search approach that would otherwise be needed for RISs with amplitude attenuation. Furthermore, we introduce a practical quantization framework for PDA-introduced RISs termed amplitude-introduced polar quantization (APQ), and extend it to a novel algorithm named extended amplitude-introduced polar quantization (EAPQ) that works with geometric projections. We derive closed-form expressions to assess how closely the performance of the proposed RIS configuration can approximate the ideal case with continuous phases and no attenuation. Our analysis reveals that increasing the number of discrete phases beyond K = 4 yields only marginal gains, regardless of attenuation levels, provided the RIS has a sufficiently wide phase range R. Furthermore, we also show and quantify that when the phase range R is limited, the performance is sensitive to attenuation for larger R, and sensitive to R when there is less attenuation. Finally, the proposed optimal algorithm provides a generic upper bound that could serve as a benchmark for discrete beamforming in RISs with amplitude constraints.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Kinematic Modeling in Soft Robots: System Identification and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise kinematic modeling is critical in calibration and controller design for soft robots, yet remains a challenging issue due to their highly nonlinear and complex behaviors. To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics. However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction intervals with a theoretical guarantee.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of TFTs 3D Monolithically Integrated on GaN HEMTs using Cascode Configuration with High Breakdown Voltage (&gt;1900V)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates 3D monolithic integration of amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) on Gallium Nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) in a cascode configuration, achieving high breakdown voltage capabilities exceeding 1900 V. Two device configurations, differing in a-IGZO channel thickness (30 nm / 10 nm), are fabricated and evaluated. Sample B, with a 10 nm a-IGZO channel, demonstrates superior electrical performance, including a high ON/OFF current ratio (~10^7), low subthreshold swing (SS), and a high breakdown voltage exceeding 1900 V comparable to standalone GaN power HEMTs. The results highlight the feasibility and potential of 3D integrated TFT on GaN power HEMTs, paving the way for new opportunities for the TFTs for high voltage applications.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Decorrelation-Based Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns, potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach. Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time, high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>BEAVER: Building Environments with Assessable Variation for Evaluating Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment, multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments, and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy learning process.</description>

      <title>Space-Filling Regularization for Robust and Interpretable Nonlinear State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training, the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar. Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty. This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.</description>

      <title>HaLert: A Resilient Smart City Architecture for Post-Disaster Based on Wi-Fi HaLow Mesh and SDN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Events such as catastrophes and disasters are, in most cases, unpredictable. Consequently, reusing existing infrastructures to develop alternative communication strategies after disasters is essential to minimise the impact of these events on the population's ability to communicate and promptly receive alerts from authorities. In this context, the emergence of smart cities, characterised by dense and geographically distributed IoT networks, presents significant potential for such reuse. This work proposes HaLert, a resilient architecture for smart cities based on a Wi-Fi HaLow IEEE 802.11s mesh network, whose resources can be readily reallocated to support a emergency communication system to exchange messages (including text, location, image, audio, and video) between citizens, authorities, and between both parties. To facilitate remote monitoring and configuration of the network, the architecture incorporates the SDN (Software-Defined Networking) paradigm, supported by a LoRa controlled flooding mesh network. A prototype was developed based on this architecture and tested in a real urban scenario comprising both indoor and outdoor environments. The results demonstrated that, despite the significant impact of obstacles, lack of line-of-sight, and terrain slopes on the latency (average latency between 15 and 54.8 ms) and throughput (upload bitrates between 134 and 726 Kbps and download bitrates between 117 and 682 Kbps) of the Wi-Fi HaLow network, it remained stable and resilient, successfully providing all functionalities associated with the HaLert architecture. The tests conducted on the LoRa network revealed a high average message success rate of 94.96%.</description>

      <title>Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: External Forces and Corner Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics, the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted in an attempt to validate the models. In this article, these models are augmented by taking into account the effects of external forces that are modeled as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.</description>

      <title>Conservative Bias Linear Power Flow Approximations: Application to Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power flow equations are central to many problems in power system planning, analysis, and control. However, their inherent non-linearity and non-convexity present substantial challenges during problem-solving processes, especially for optimization problems. Accordingly, linear approximations are commonly employed to streamline computations, although this can often entail compromises in accuracy and feasibility. This paper proposes an approach termed Conservative Bias Linear Approximations (CBLA) for addressing these limitations. By minimizing approximation errors across a specified operating range while incorporating conservativeness (over- or under-estimating quantities of interest), CBLA strikes a balance between accuracy and tractability by maintaining linear constraints. By allowing users to design loss functions tailored to the specific approximated function, the bias approximation approach significantly enhances approximation accuracy. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through several test cases, including its application to a unit commitment problem, where CBLA consistently achieves lower operating costs and improved feasibility compared to traditional linearization methods.</description>

      <title>Vibration-based damage detection of a trainer jet via multiple input tangential interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control engineering is a highly developed field, which includes similarly advanced areas like system identification. In structural dynamics, system identification methods are employed for the extraction of modal parameters, such as natural frequencies and mode shapes, from any structure. In turn, these are the main building blocks of vibration-based damage detection. However, traditional comparisons of these parameters are often ambiguous in complex systems, complicating damage detection and assessment. The modified total modal assurance criterion (MTMAC), a metric well-known in the field of finite element model updating, is extended to address this challenge and is proposed as a metric for damage identification and severity assessment. To support the requirement for precise and robust modal identification of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), the improved Loewner Framework (iLF), known for its reliability and computational performance, is pioneeringly employed within SHM. Since the MTMAC is proposed solely as a damage identification and severity assessment metric, the coordinate modal assurance criterion (COMAC), also a well-established tool, but for damage localisation using mode shapes, is used for completeness. The iLF SHM capabilities are validated through comparisons with traditional methods, including least-squares complex exponential (LSCE) and stochastic subspace identification with canonical variate analysis (SSI-CVA) on a numerical case study of a cantilever beam. Furthermore, the MTMAC is validated against the traditional vibration-based approach, which involves directly comparing natural frequencies and mode shapes. Finally, an experimental dataset from a BAE Systems Hawk T1A trainer jet ground vibration tests is used to demonstrate the iLF and MTMAC capabilities on a real-life, real-size SHM problem, showing their effectiveness in detecting and assessing damage.</description>

      <title>Impact Assessment of Cyberattacks in Inverter-Based Microgrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the evolution of modern power grids has been driven by the growing integration of remotely controlled grid assets. Although Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) enhance operational efficiency, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. The remote accessibility of such critical grid components creates entry points for attacks that adversaries could exploit, posing threats to the stability of the system. To evaluate the resilience of energy systems under such threats, this study employs real-time simulation and a modified version of the IEEE 39-bus system that incorporates a Microgrid (MG) with solar-based IBR. The study assesses the impact of remote attacks impacting the MG stability under different levels of IBR penetration through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations. Namely, we analyze voltage, current, and frequency profiles before, during, and after cyberattack-induced disruptions. The results demonstrate that real-time HIL testing is a practical approach to uncover potential risks and develop robust mitigation strategies for resilient MG operations.</description>

Abstract: This study presents an analytical method for tuning PI controllers in First-Order with Time Delay (FOTD) systems, leveraging the Lambert W function. The Lambert W function enables exact pole placement, yielding analytical expressions for PI gains. The proposed approach identifies a critical condition that achieves a step response without overshoot with minimum settling time, while also providing explicit tuning rules for systems where controlled overshoot is specified. The method demonstrates strong agreement with established empirical Chien-Hrones-Reswick tuning rules for both non-overshooting and overshooting cases, bridging the gap between theoretical analysis and empirical results.</description>

      <title>Collective Bayesian Decision-Making in a Swarm of Miniaturized Robots for Surface Inspection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robot swarms can effectively serve a variety of sensing and inspection applications. Certain inspection tasks require a binary classification decision. This work presents an experimental setup for a surface inspection task based on vibration sensing and studies a Bayesian two-outcome decision-making algorithm in a swarm of miniaturized wheeled robots. The robots are tasked with individually inspecting and collectively classifying a 1mx1m tiled surface consisting of vibrating and non-vibrating tiles based on the majority type of tiles. The robots sense vibrations using onboard IMUs and perform collision avoidance using a set of IR sensors. We develop a simulation and optimization framework leveraging the Webots robotic simulator and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. We consider two existing information sharing strategies and propose a new one that allows the swarm to rapidly reach accurate classification decisions. We first find optimal parameters that allow efficient sampling in simulation and then evaluate our proposed strategy against the two existing ones using 100 randomized simulation and 10 real experiments. We find that our proposed method compels the swarm to make decisions at an accelerated rate, with an improvement of up to 20.52% in mean decision time at only 0.78% loss in accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Granularity Supervised Contrastive Framework for Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Aero-engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) predictions are critical to the safe operation of aero-engines. Currently, the RUL prediction task is mainly a regression paradigm with only mean square error as the loss function and lacks research on feature space structure, the latter of which has shown excellent performance in a large number of studies. This paper develops a multi-granularity supervised contrastive (MGSC) framework from plain intuition that samples with the same RUL label should be aligned in the feature space, and address the problems of too large minibatch size and unbalanced samples in the implementation. The RUL prediction with MGSC is implemented on using the proposed multi-phase training strategy. This paper also demonstrates a simple and scalable basic network structure and validates the proposed MGSC strategy on the CMPASS dataset using a convolutional long short-term memory network as a baseline, which effectively improves the accuracy of RUL prediction.</description>

      <title>HLSTester: Efficient Testing of Behavioral Discrepancies with LLMs for High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-level synthesis (HLS), C/C++ programs with synthesis directives are used to generate circuits for FPGA implementations. However, hardware-specific and platform-dependent characteristics in these implementations can introduce behavioral discrepancies between the original C/C++ programs and the circuits after high-level synthesis. Existing methods for testing behavioral discrepancies in HLS are still immature, and the testing workflow requires significant human efforts. To address this challenge, we propose HLSTester, a large language model (LLM) aided testing framework that efficiently detects behavioral discrepancies in HLS. To mitigate hallucinations in LLMs and enhance prompt quality, the testbenches for original C/C++ programs are leveraged to guide LLMs in generating HLS-compatible testbenches, effectively eliminating certain traditional C/C++ constructs that are incompatible with HLS tools. Key variables are pinpointed through a backward slicing technique in both C/C++ and HLS programs to monitor their runtime spectra, enabling an in-depth analysis of the discrepancy symptoms. To reduce test time, a testing input generation mechanism is introduced to integrate dynamic mutation with insights from an LLM-based progressive reasoning chain. In addition, repetitive hardware testing is skipped by a redundancy-aware filtering technique for the generated test inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-aided testing framework significantly accelerates the testing workflow while achieving higher testbench simulation pass rates compared with the traditional method and the direct use of LLMs on the same HLS programs.</description>

Abstract: Enabled by progress in superconducting technology, several continuous wave linear accelerators are foreseen in the next decade. For these machines, it is of crucial importance to track the main cavity parameters, such as the resonator bandwidth and detuning. The bandwidth yields information on the superconducting state of the cavity. The detuning should be minimized to limit the required power to operate the cavity. The estimation of these parameters is commonly implemented in the digital electronics of the Low-Level RF control system to minimize the computation delay. In this proceeding, we present a way to compute the bandwidth and detuning using a Luenberger observer. In contrast to previous methods, a state observer yields estimations at the native control system sample rate without explicitly filtering the input signals. Additionally, the error convergence properties of the estimations can be controlled intuitively by adjusting gain parameters. Implementation considerations and test results on the derived observer are presented in the manuscript.</description>
