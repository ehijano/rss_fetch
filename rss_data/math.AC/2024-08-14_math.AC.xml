      <title>A random walk on the category of finite abelian $p$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an irreducible Markov chain on the category of finite abelian $p$-groups, whose stationary measure is the Cohen-Lenstra distribution. This Markov chain arises when one studies the cokernel of a random matrix $M$, after conditioning on a submatrix of $M$. We show two surprising facts about this Markov chain. Firstly, it is reversible. Hence, one may regard it is a random walk on finite abelian $p$-groups. The proof of reversibility also explains the appearance of the Cohen-Lenstra distribution in the context of random matrices. Secondly, we can explicitly determine the spectrum of the infinite transition matrix associated to this Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Tame pairs of transseries fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns pairs of models of the theory of the differential field of logarithmic-exponential transseries that are tame as a pair of real closed fields. That is, the smaller model is bounded inside the larger model and there exists a standard part map. This covers for instance the differential fields of hyperseries or surreal numbers or maximal Hardy fields equipped with suitable enlargements of the differential field of transseries. The theory of such pairs is complete and model complete in a natural language and it has quantifier elimination in the same language expanded by two predicates and a standard part map. Additionally, the smaller model is purely stably embedded in the pair, and hence so is the constant field.
  More generally, we study differential-Hensel-Liouville closed pre-$H$-fields, i.e., pre-$H$-fields that are differential-henselian, real closed, and closed under exponential integration, equipped with lifts of their differential residue fields, and establish similar results in that setting relative to the differential residue field.</description>

      <title>Effective generic freeness and applications to local cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a Noetherian domain and $R$ be a finitely generated $A$-algebra. We study several features regarding the generic freeness over $A$ of an $R$-module. For an ideal $I \subset R$, we show that the local cohomology modules ${\rm H}_I^i(R)$ are generically free over $A$ under certain settings where $R$ is a smooth $A$-algebra. By utilizing the theory of Gr\"obner bases over arbitrary Noetherian rings, we provide an effective method to make explicit the generic freeness over $A$ of a finitely generated $R$-module.</description>

      <title>On local divisor class groups of complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Samuel conjectured in 1961 that a (Noetherian) local complete intersection ring that is a UFD in codimension at most three is itself a UFD. It is said that Grothendieck invented local cohomology to prove this fact. Following the philosophy that a UFD is nothing else than a Krull domain (that is, a normal domain, in the Noetherian case) with trivial divisor class group, we take a closer look at the Samuel--Grothendieck Theorem and prove the following generalization: Let $A$ be a local Cohen--Macaulay ring.
  (i) $A$ is a normal domain if and only if $A$ is a normal domain in codimension at most $1$.
  (ii) Suppose that $A$ is a normal domain and a complete intersection. Then the divisor class group of $A$ is a subgroup of the projective limit of the divisor class groups of the localizations $A_p$, where $p$ runs through all prime ideals of height at most $3$ in $A$.
  We use this fact to describe for an integral Noetherian locally complete intersection scheme $X$ the gap between the groups of Weil and Cartier divisors, generalizing in this case the classical result that these two concepts coincide if $X$ is locally a UFD.</description>

      <title>Unmixed polymatroidal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ denote the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$ and $I$ be a polymatroidal ideal of $R$. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive classification of all unmixed polymatroidal ideals. This work addresses a question raised by Herzog and Hibi in [10]</description>
