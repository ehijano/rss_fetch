      <title>Inference-Adaptive Neural Steering for Real-Time Area-Based Sound Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel Neural Steering technique that adapts the target area of a spatial-aware multi-microphone sound source separation algorithm during inference without the necessity of retraining the deep neural network (DNN). To achieve this, we first train a DNN aiming to retain speech within a target region, defined by an angular span, while suppressing sound sources stemming from other directions. Afterward, a phase shift is applied to the microphone signals, allowing us to shift the center of the target area during inference at negligible additional cost in computational complexity. Further, we show that the proposed approach performs well in a wide variety of acoustic scenarios, including several speakers inside and outside the target area and additional noise. More precisely, the proposed approach performs on par with DNNs trained explicitly for the steered target area in terms of DNSMOS and SI-SDR.</description>

      <title>SpeechPrompt: Prompting Speech Language Models for Speech Processing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompting has become a practical method for utilizing pre-trained language models (LMs). This approach offers several advantages. It allows an LM to adapt to new tasks with minimal training and parameter updates, thus achieving efficiency in both storage and computation. Additionally, prompting modifies only the LM's inputs and harnesses the generative capabilities of language models to address various downstream tasks in a unified manner. This significantly reduces the need for human labor in designing task-specific models. These advantages become even more evident as the number of tasks served by the LM scales up. Motivated by the strengths of prompting, we are the first to explore the potential of prompting speech LMs in the domain of speech processing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in converting speech into discrete units for language modeling. Our pioneer research demonstrates that these quantized speech units are highly versatile within our unified prompting framework. Not only can they serve as class labels, but they also contain rich phonetic information that can be re-synthesized back into speech signals for speech generation tasks. Specifically, we reformulate speech processing tasks into speech-to-unit generation tasks. As a result, we can seamlessly integrate tasks such as speech classification, sequence generation, and speech generation within a single, unified prompting framework. The experiment results show that the prompting method can achieve competitive performance compared to the strong fine-tuning method based on self-supervised learning models with a similar number of trainable parameters. The prompting method also shows promising results in the few-shot setting. Moreover, with the advanced speech LMs coming into the stage, the proposed prompting framework attains great potential.</description>

      <title>Melody predominates over harmony in the evolution of musical scales across 96 countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard theory of musical scales since antiquity has been based on harmony, rather than melody. Some recent analyses support either view, and we lack a comparative test on cross-cultural data. We address this longstanding problem through a rigorous, computational comparison of the main theories against 1,314 scales from 96 countries. There is near-universal support for melodic theories, which predict step-sizes of 1-3 semitones. Harmony accounts for the prevalence of some simple-integer-ratio intervals, particularly for music-theoretic scales from Eurasian societies, which may explain their dominance amongst Western scholars. However, harmony poorly predicts scales measured from ethnographic recordings, particularly outside of Eurasia. Overall, we show that the historical emphasis on harmony is misguided and that melody is the primary determinant of the world's musical scales.</description>

      <title>Information and motor constraints shape melodic diversity across cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of possible melodies is unfathomably large, yet despite this virtually unlimited potential for melodic variation, melodies from different societies can be surprisingly similar. The motor constraint hypothesis accounts for certain similarities, such as scalar motion and contour shape, but not for other major common features, such as repetition, song length, and scale size. Here we investigate the role of information constraints arising from limitations on human memory in shaping these hallmarks of melodies. We measure determinants of information rate in 62 corpora of Folk melodies spanning several continents, finding multiple trade-offs that all act to constrain the information rate across societies. By contrast, 39 corpora of Art music from Europe (including Turkey) show longer, more complex melodies, and increased complexity over time, suggesting different cultural-evolutionary selection pressures in Art and Folk music, possibly due to the use of written versus oral transmission. Our parameter-free model predicts the empirical scale degree distribution using information constraints on scalar motion, melody length, and, most importantly, information rate. This provides strong evidence that information constraints during cultural transmission of music limit the number of notes in a scale, and proposes that preference for intermediate melodic complexity is a fundamental constraint on the cultural evolution of melody.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Generative Modeling of Melodic Vocal Contours in Hindustani Classical Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hindustani music is a performance-driven oral tradition that exhibits the rendition of rich melodic patterns. In this paper, we focus on generative modeling of singers' vocal melodies extracted from audio recordings, as the voice is musically prominent within the tradition. Prior generative work in Hindustani music models melodies as coarse discrete symbols which fails to capture the rich expressive melodic intricacies of singing. Thus, we propose to use a finely quantized pitch contour, as an intermediate representation for hierarchical audio modeling. We propose GaMaDHaNi, a modular two-level hierarchy, consisting of a generative model on pitch contours, and a pitch contour to audio synthesis model. We compare our approach to non-hierarchical audio models and hierarchical models that use a self-supervised intermediate representation, through a listening test and qualitative analysis. We also evaluate audio model's ability to faithfully represent the pitch contour input using Pearson correlation coefficient. By using pitch contours as an intermediate representation, we show that our model may be better equipped to listen and respond to musicians in a human-AI collaborative setting by highlighting two potential interaction use cases (1) primed generation, and (2) coarse pitch conditioning.</description>

      <title>Towards measuring fairness in speech recognition: Fair-Speech dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current public datasets for speech recognition (ASR) tend not to focus specifically on the fairness aspect, such as performance across different demographic groups. This paper introduces a novel dataset, Fair-Speech, a publicly released corpus to help researchers evaluate their ASR models for accuracy across a diverse set of self-reported demographic information, such as age, gender, ethnicity, geographic variation and whether the participants consider themselves native English speakers. Our dataset includes approximately 26.5K utterances in recorded speech by 593 people in the United States, who were paid to record and submit audios of themselves saying voice commands. We also provide ASR baselines, including on models trained on transcribed and untranscribed social media videos and open source models.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Mean Opinion Score Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction has made significant progress in specific domains. However, the unstable performance of MOS prediction models across diverse samples presents ongoing challenges in the practical application of these systems. In this paper, we point out that the absence of uncertainty modeling is a significant limitation hindering MOS prediction systems from applying to the real and open world. We analyze the sources of uncertainty in the MOS prediction task and propose to establish an uncertainty-aware MOS prediction system that models aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty by heteroscedastic regression and Monte Carlo dropout separately. The experimental results show that the system captures uncertainty well and is capable of performing selective prediction and out-of-domain detection. Such capabilities significantly enhance the practical utility of MOS systems in diverse real and open-world environments.</description>

      <title>On Class Separability Pitfalls In Audio-Text Contrastive Zero-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-text cross-modal contrastive learning have shown its potential towards zero-shot learning. One possibility for this is by projecting item embeddings from pre-trained backbone neural networks into a cross-modal space in which item similarity can be calculated in either domain. This process relies on a strong unimodal pre-training of the backbone networks, and on a data-intensive training task for the projectors. These two processes can be biased by unintentional data leakage, which can arise from using supervised learning in pre-training or from inadvertently training the cross-modal projection using labels from the zero-shot learning evaluation. In this study, we show that a significant part of the measured zero-shot learning accuracy is due to strengths inherited from the audio and text backbones, that is, they are not learned in the cross-modal domain and are not transferred from one modality to another.</description>

      <title>NEST: Self-supervised Fast Conformer as All-purpose Seasoning to Speech Processing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has been proved to benefit a wide range of speech processing tasks, such as speech recognition/translation, speaker verification and diarization, etc. However, most of these approaches are computationally intensive due to using transformer encoder and lack of sub-sampling. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning model termed as Neural Encoder for Self-supervised Training (NEST). Specifically, we adopt the FastConformer architecture, which has an 8x sub-sampling rate and is faster than Transformer or Conformer architectures. Instead of clustering-based token generation, we resort to fixed random projection for its simplicity and effectiveness. We also propose a generalized noisy speech augmentation that teaches the model to disentangle the main speaker from noise or other speakers. Experiments show that the proposed NEST model improves over existing self-supervised models on a variety of speech processing tasks. Code and checkpoints will be publicly available via NVIDIA NeMo toolkit.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-fine Alignment Makes Better Speech-image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for speech-image retrieval. We utilize speech-image contrastive (SIC) learning tasks to align speech and image representations at a coarse level and speech-image matching (SIM) learning tasks to further refine the fine-grained cross-modal alignment. SIC and SIM learning tasks are jointly trained in a unified manner. To optimize the learning process, we utilize an embedding queue that facilitates efficient sampling of high-quality and diverse negative representations during SIC learning. Additionally, it enhances the learning of SIM tasks by effectively mining hard negatives based on contrastive similarities calculated in SIC tasks. To further optimize learning under noisy supervision, we incorporate momentum distillation into the training process. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 4% in R@1 on two benchmark datasets for the speech-image retrieval tasks. Moreover, as observed in zero-shot experiments, our framework demonstrates excellent generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>EAViT: External Attention Vision Transformer for Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the External Attention Vision Transformer (EAViT) model, a novel approach designed to enhance audio classification accuracy. As digital audio resources proliferate, the demand for precise and efficient audio classification systems has intensified, driven by the need for improved recommendation systems and user personalization in various applications, including music streaming platforms and environmental sound recognition. Accurate audio classification is crucial for organizing vast audio libraries into coherent categories, enabling users to find and interact with their preferred audio content more effectively. In this study, we utilize the GTZAN dataset, which comprises 1,000 music excerpts spanning ten diverse genres. Each 30-second audio clip is segmented into 3-second excerpts to enhance dataset robustness and mitigate overfitting risks, allowing for more granular feature analysis. The EAViT model integrates multi-head external attention (MEA) mechanisms into the Vision Transformer (ViT) framework, effectively capturing long-range dependencies and potential correlations between samples. This external attention (EA) mechanism employs learnable memory units that enhance the network's capacity to process complex audio features efficiently. The study demonstrates that EAViT achieves a remarkable overall accuracy of 93.99%, surpassing state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Which Prosodic Features Matter Most for Pragmatics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate which prosodic features matter most in conveying prosodic functions. We use the problem of predicting human perceptions of pragmatic similarity among utterance pairs to evaluate the utility of prosodic features of different types. We find, for example, that duration-related features are more important than pitch-related features, and that utterance-initial features are more important than utterance-final features. Further, failure analysis indicates that modeling using pitch features only often fails to handle important pragmatic functions, and suggests that several generally-neglected acoustic and prosodic features are pragmatically significant, including nasality and vibrato. These findings can guide future basic research in prosody, and suggest how to improve speech synthesis evaluation, among other applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06371v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present mHuBERT-147, the first general-purpose massively multilingual HuBERT speech representation model trained on 90K hours of clean, open-license data. To scale up the multi-iteration HuBERT approach, we use faiss-based clustering, achieving 5.2x faster label assignment than the original method. We also apply a new multilingual batching up-sampling strategy, leveraging both language and dataset diversity. After 3 training iterations, our compact 95M parameter mHuBERT-147 outperforms larger models trained on substantially more data. We rank second and first on the ML-SUPERB 10min and 1h leaderboards, with SOTA scores for 3 tasks. Across ASR/LID tasks, our model consistently surpasses XLS-R (300M params; 436K hours) and demonstrates strong competitiveness against the much larger MMS (1B params; 491K hours). Our findings indicate that mHuBERT-147 is a promising model for multilingual speech tasks, offering an unprecedented balance between high performance and parameter efficiency.</description>

      <title>Advancing Voice Cloning for Nepali: Leveraging Transfer Learning in a Low-Resource Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voice cloning is a prominent feature in personalized speech interfaces. A neural vocal cloning system can mimic someone's voice using just a few audio samples. Both speaker encoding and speaker adaptation are topics of research in the field of voice cloning. Speaker adaptation relies on fine-tuning a multi-speaker generative model, which involves training a separate model to infer a new speaker embedding used for speaker encoding. Both methods can achieve excellent performance, even with a small number of cloning audios, in terms of the speech's naturalness and similarity to the original speaker. Speaker encoding approaches are more appropriate for low-resource deployment since they require significantly less memory and have a faster cloning time than speaker adaption, which can offer slightly greater naturalness and similarity. The main goal is to create a vocal cloning system that produces audio output with a Nepali accent or that sounds like Nepali. For the further advancement of TTS, the idea of transfer learning was effectively used to address several issues that were encountered in the development of this system, including the poor audio quality and the lack of available data.</description>
