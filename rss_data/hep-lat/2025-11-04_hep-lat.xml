      <title>Hadronic scattering in (1+1)D SU(2) lattice gauge theory from tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first real-time study of hadronic scattering in a (1+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory with fundamental fermions using tensor-network techniques. Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation -- where the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the electric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors of fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to meson--meson, meson--baryon, and baryon--baryon collisions. At strong coupling, the $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely resembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$ sector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become entangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the slower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates ballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables, entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how correlations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a first benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and open the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>opbasis - a Python package to derive minimal operator bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a complete and yet minimal on-shell basis of operators of a given mass-dimension that are compatible with a specific set of transformation properties is the first step in any Effective Field Theory description. This step is the main bottleneck for systematic studies of leading logarithmic corrections to integer-power lattice artifacts in Symanzik Effective Field Theory targeting various local fields and lattice actions. The focus on discrete symmetry transformations in lattice field theory, especially reduced hypercubic spacetime symmetry with Euclidean signature, complicates the use of standard continuum field theory tools.
  Here, a new Python package is being presented that targets the typical lattice field-theorist's use cases. While the main target lies on continuum EFTs describing 4D non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, the applicability can be extended beyond Effective Field Theories. New discrete symmetries, twisted masses, or the introduction of boosts are just a few examples of possible extensions that can be easily implemented by the user. This should allow for a wider range of theories and applications beyond the initial focus of this package.
  The general functionality of the package is explained along the lines of three examples: The $\mathrm{O}(a)$ operator basis of the axial-vector in Wilson QCD, operator bases compatible with the symmetries of unrooted Staggered quarks as well as a pedestrian derivation of a $B^*(\mathbf{p})\pi(-\mathbf{p})$ operator with pseudo-scalar quantum numbers. Each example makes use of an increasing range of features and requires user-defined extensions show-casing the versatility of the package.</description>

      <title>An effective field theory for thermal QCD with 2+1 flavours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We write a long-distance effective field theory (EFT) for QCD at finite temperature just below the crossover temperature $T_c$. The low energy constants (LECs) of this EFT are obtained from lattice measurements of the screening mass of pions at two temperatures for $N_f=2+1$ using lattice results obtained at physical values of pion and Kaon masses, and $N_f=2$ where the lattice simulations were performed with a heavier pion mass. The EFT gives good predictions for other static pion properties for $N_f=2$, where lattice results are available. We show the corresponding predictions for $N_f=2+1$, where they are not yet measured. We demonstrate that EFT gives excellent predictions for the phase diagram in $N_f=2+1$. The predictions for the pressure are investigated, and predictions are also given for a Wick-rotated real-time quantity called the kinetic mass.</description>

      <title>Precision lattice calculation of the hadronic contribution to the running of the electroweak gauge couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an update of our lattice QCD determination of the hadronic contribution to the running of the electromagnetic coupling, $\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(-Q^2)$, and of the electroweak mixing angle in the space-like momentum region up to $Q^2=12\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$. The calculation is based on CLS ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ flavours of $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions, covering five lattice spacings between $0.039$ and $0.085$ fm and a range of pion masses, including the physical point. A refined analysis employing a telescopic window strategy allows for a clean separation of systematic effects across Euclidean distance scales. Statistical precision is further enhanced through low-mode averaging, combined with a spectral reconstruction of the vector-vector correlator at long distances on the most chiral ensembles. We confirm significant tensions of up to $7\sigma$ at space-like virtualities around $Q^2= 1\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$ between our lattice results for $\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(-Q^2)$ and the corresponding data-driven estimates based on $e^+e^-$ cross section data. Combining our lattice data with perturbative QCD via the Euclidean split technique, we obtain at the $Z$-pole $\Delta\alpha_{\mathrm{had}}^{(5)}(M_Z^2) = 0.027813(33)_{\mathrm{lat}}(35)_{\mathrm{pQCD}}$, which is more than two times more precise than recent data-driven estimates. Our result deviates slightly, by $1-2\sigma$, from the value produced by global electroweak fits. For the electroweak mixing angle, we present the hadronic contribution to its running and provide a precise determination of the octet-singlet mixing component $\bar\Pi^{(0,8)}$, in good agreement with phenomenological models but with significantly higher precision.</description>

      <title>Skewness-dependent Moments of Pion GPD from Nonlocal Quark-Bilinear Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of pion valence-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) up to fifth order, $\langle x^4\rangle$, and for the skewness range $[-0.33, 0]$ using operator product expansion of bilocal quark-bilinear operators. The calculations are performed on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.04~\mathrm{fm}$ and valence pion mass $300$ $\mathrm{MeV}$, employing boosted pion states with momenta up to 2.428 GeV and momentum transfers reaching 2.748 GeV$^2$. We employ ratio-scheme renormalization and next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching. At zero skewness, our results are consistent with previous lattice studies. By combining matrix elements at multiple values of skewness and momentum transfer, skewness-dependent moments are obtained through simultaneous polynomiality-constrained fits.</description>

      <title>Chimeric states of matter: Meissner effect without superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is central to how we classify phases of matter: solids break spatial translations, superfluids break particle-number conservation, and superconductors "break" gauge symmetry. Mixed anomalies involving higher-form symmetries, however, present a generalization of spontaneous symmetry breaking that admits a wider and more versatile set of possibilities. We introduce chimeric states of matter, in which aspects of broken and unbroken phases coexist. We find that the Meissner effect -- usually regarded as the defining hallmark of superconductivity -- can occur in media that are resistive or even insulating when probed by electric fields. We demonstrate this by constructing an effective field theory of "symmetry chimerization" and propose that Josephson junction networks could provide a laboratory realization. These results broaden the landscape of possible phases of matter, showing that physical media can mix features of symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken states in a single substrate.</description>

      <title>In-medium mass shifts of $B_c^{(*)}, B_s^{(*)}$ and $D_s^{(*)}$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our predictions for the Lorentz scalar mass shifts of two-flavored heavy mesons, $B_c^{(*)}, B_s^{(*)}$ and $D_s^{(*)}$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The in-medium mass shifts are estimated by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies of the mesons based on a flavor-SU(5) effective Lagrangian approach. In-medium properties necessary for the estimates are calculated by the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The enhanced self-energies of the mesons in symmetric nuclear matter relative to those in free space, yield the negative mass shifts of these mesons.</description>

      <title>Integrated photonic multigrid solver for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations is crucial to analysing and predicting complex, large-scale physical systems but pushes conventional high-performance computers to their limits. Application specific photonic processors are an exciting computing paradigm for building efficient, ultrafast hardware accelerators. Here, we investigate the synergy between multigrid based partial differential equations solvers and low latency photonic matrix vector multipliers. We propose a mixed-precision photonic multigrid solver, that offloads the computationally demanding smoothening procedure to the optical domain. We test our approach on an integrated photonic accelerator operating at 2 GSPS solving a Poisson and Schr\"odinger equation. By offloading the smoothening operation to the photonic system, we can reduce the digital operation by more than 80%. Finally, we show that the photonic multigrid solver potentially reduces digital operations by up to 97 % in lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) calculations, enabling an order-of-magnitude gain in computational speed and efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Mass of the Baryon Junction: a lattice computation in 2 +1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of baryonic flux tubes in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in (2+1) dimensions. A recent next-to-leading-order derivation within the Effective String Theory framework has, for the first time, made explicit the corrections proportional to the mass of the baryon junction M, up to order $1/R^2$ (where $R$ is the length of the confining strings), opening the possibility of its non-perturbative determination. One of the main goals of this paper is, through high precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov loop correlator, to measure for the first time the baryon junction mass. By isolating the predicted $1/R^2$ term in the open string channel, we obtain the value $M/\sqrt{\sigma} = 0.1355(36)$, similar to the phenomenological value which is used to describe hadrons, although our computation was done in (2+1) dimensions. In addition, studying the high temperature behavior of the baryon, we present a new test of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for the SU(3) theory in three dimensions. Focusing on the high temperature regime, just below the deconfinement transition, we compare our lattice results for Polyakov loop correlators with the quantitative predictions obtained by applying conformal perturbation theory to the three-state Potts model in two dimensions and find excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes for Inferring Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extraction of parton distribution functions (PDFs) from experimental or lattice QCD data is an ill-posed inverse problem, where regularization strongly impacts both systematic uncertainties and the reliability of the results. We study a framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to reconstruct PDFs from lattice QCD matrix elements. Within a Bayesian framework, Gaussian processes serve as flexible priors that encode uncertainties, correlations, and constraints without imposing rigid functional forms. We investigate a wide range of kernel choices, mean functions, and hyperparameter treatments. We quantify information gained from the data using the Kullback Leibler divergence. Synthetic data tests demonstrate the consistency and robustness of the method. Our study establishes GPR as a systematic and non-parametric approach to PDF reconstruction, offering controlled uncertainty estimates and reduced model bias in lattice QCD analyses.</description>

      <title>Transversity Generalized Parton Distributions of $\Delta$ with the Diquark Spectator Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show quark transversity generalized parton pistributions (GPDs) of $\Delta^+$ isobar by using the diquark spectator model for the first time. First, this model is tested by electric charge, magnetic-dipole and axial charge form factors, and it is used for calculating the transversity GPDs $H^{qT}_{1,3,5,7}$ of $\Delta^+$. The quark transversity distribution $h_1$ is then obtained from the transversity GPDs in the forward limit. Then, helicity-flip amplitudes are shown numerically by using relations between the helicity amplitudes and the GPDs. Finally, by taking first moments of the GPDs, tensor form factors are obtained and we predict the tensor charge. Experimentally, $N$-$\Delta$ transition GPDs are investigated in deeply virtual Compton scattering and virtual meson-production processes, and generalized distribution amplitudes, which correspond to the $s$-channel GPDs, could be investigated by the two-photon processes $\gamma^* \gamma \to \Delta \bar\Delta$ at the electron-positron colliders. Therefore, the spin-3/2 $\Delta$ GPDs could become interesting quantities experimentally in future.</description>
