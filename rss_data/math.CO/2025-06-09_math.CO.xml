      <title>On the methods of reduction of some types of Marczerwski-Burstin measurable functions to continuous functions on products of perfect sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide product-wise generalizations of certain Marczewski-Burstin bases such as sets with (s)-property and completely Ramsey sets. For each of those we prove - as an analog of classical Luzin's and Eggleston's theorems that functions measurable with respect to those families can be reduced to continuous functions on a product of perfect sets. Moreover we also provide a way to reduce sequences of such functions to continuity, providing generalizations to Laver's extension of Halpern-Lauchli and Harrington theorems.</description>

      <title>Constructing strong starters of orders $3p$: triplication with SAT solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach to building strong starters in cyclic groups of orders $n$ divisible by 3 from starters of smaller orders is presented. A strong starter in $Z_n$ ($n$ odd) is a partition of the set $\{1,2,\dots,n-1\}$ into pairs $\{a_i,b_i\}$ such that all pair sums $a_i+b_i$ are distinct and nonzero modulo $n$ and all differences $\pm(a_i-b_i)$ are distinct and nonzero modulo $n$. A special interest to strong starters of odd orders divisible by 3 is motivated by Horton's conjecture which claims that such starters exist (except when $n=3$ or $9$) but remains unproven since 1989.
  We begin with a strong starter of order $p$ coprime with 3 and describe an algorithm to obtain a Sudoku-type problem modulo 3 whose solution, if exists, yields a strong starter of order $3p$. The process leading from the original to the final starter is called {\em triplication}.
  Besides theoretical aspects of the construction, practicality of this approach is demonstrated. A general-purpose constraint-satisfaction (SAT) solver z3 is used to solve the Sudoku-type problem; various performance statistics are presented.</description>

      <title>New Polynomial Identities and Some Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an elementary approach involving the Euler Beta function and the binomial theorem, we derive two polynomial identities; one of which is a generalization of a known polynomial identity. Two well-known combinatorial identities, namely Frisch's identity and Klamkin's identity, appear as immediate consequences of the polynomial identities. We subsequently establish several combinatorial identities, including a generalization of each of Frisch's identity and Klamkin's identity. Finally, we develop a scheme for deriving combinatorial identities associated with polynomial identities of a certain type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Andrews and Bachraoui discovered several companions for some famous $q$-series formulas, and derived some now identities involving partitions and overpartitions. In this paper, we shall refine their partial results by the number of parts of partitions and furthermore, we also give the combinatorial proofs for those identities.</description>

      <title>Ramsey goodness of stars and fans for the Haj\'os graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, the Ramsey number $R(G_1,G_2)$ denotes the smallest integer $N$ such that any red-blue coloring of the edges of $K_N$ contains either a red $G_1$ or a blue $G_2$. Let $G_1$ be a graph with chromatic number $\chi$ and chromatic surplus $s$, and let $G_2$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices. The graph $G_2$ is said to be Ramsey-good for the graph $G_1$ (or simply $G_1$-good) if, for $n \ge s$, \[R(G_1,G_2)=(\chi-1)(n-1)+s.\]
  The $G_1$-good property has been extensively studied for star-like graphs when $G_1$ is a graph with $\chi(G_1)\ge 3$, as seen in works by Burr-Faudree-Rousseau-Schelp (J. Graph Theory, 1983), Li-Rousseau (J. Graph Theory, 1996), Lin-Li-Dong (European J. Combin., 2010), Fox-He-Wigderson (Adv. Combin., 2023), and Liu-Li (J. Graph Theory, 2025), among others. However, all prior results require $G_1$ to have chromatic surplus $1$. In this paper, we extend this investigation to graphs with chromatic surplus 2 by considering the Haj\'os graph $H_a$. For a star $K_{1,n}$, we prove that $K_{1,n}$ is $H_a$-good if and only if $n$ is even. For a fan $F_n$ with $n\ge 111$, we prove that $F_n$ is $H_a$-good.</description>

      <title>Morse theory and moduli spaces of self-avoiding polygonal linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a smooth manifold is diffeomorphic to a Euclidean space if it admits a Lyapunov-Reeb function. Here a Lyapunov-Reeb function means a smooth function that is proper, bounded from below and possesses only one critical point. As applications, we determine the topology of moduli spaces of self-avoiding polygonal linkages by constructing Lyapunov-Reeb functions, and we prove a conjecture of Gonz\'{a}lez and Sedano-Mendoza on moduli spaces of simple polygons. We further describe foliation structures of these moduli spaces via level sets of Lyapunov-Reeb functions. Finally, we present algorithms for the Carpenter's Rule Problem and several related problems.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture by Starr and log-concavity for random commuting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture by Shannon Starr regarding the asymptotics for the number of tuples of commuting permutations with given number of joint orbits. These numbers generalize unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind which count how many single permutations have a given number of cycles. In the case of pairs of permutations, these numbers are related to D'Arcais polynomials and the Nekrasov-Okounkov formula. As a consequence of the above asymptotics, we confirm a log-concavity conjecture in the regime of typical values for the number of joint orbits. As a result of possible indepentent interest in applied mathematics and mathematical physics, we also provide detailed asymptotics, using Mellin transform techniques, for certain multiple series or multivariate Ramanujan sums which are related to ordinary generating functions of Dirichlet convolutions of power laws. Besides these multiple sums asymptotics, our proofs use bivariate saddle point analysis related to the Meinardus theorem in the delicate case of multiple poles for the associated Dirichlet series.</description>

      <title>Bivariate asymptotics via random walks: application to large genus maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain bivariate asymptotics for the number of (unicellular) combinatorial maps (a model of discrete surfaces) as both the size and the genus grow. This work is related to two research topics that have been very active recently: multivariate asymptotics and large genus geometry.
  Our method consists in studying a linear recurrence for these numbers, and in fact it can be applied to many other linear recurrences. We discuss briefly the generality of our method and future research directions.</description>

      <title>A characterization of all graphs cospectral to the double star $P_2(1,n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the adjacency spectrum of trees with diameter three, also referred to as double stars. Using $P_2(a,b)$ to denote a double star with $ a$ and $b$ leaves at its respective endpoints, we discuss graphs which are cospectral to double stars for various parameters $a$ and $b$. In particular, we give constructions for graphs cospectral to $P_2(1,2k)$ for integers $k$. Lastly, we show that the double star $P_2(1,n)$ is determined by its spectrum when $n$ is odd. That is, if a graph $G$ cospectral to $P_2(1,n)$ for odd $n$, then $G$ is isomorphic to $P_2(1,n)$.</description>

      <title>RSK correspondence for King tableaux with Berele insertion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a bijective RSK correspondence of type C for King tableaux with Berele insertion as a reformulation of Sundaram's correspondence (1986). For its $Q$-symbol, we make use of semistandard oscillating tableaux (SSOT), a new object which Lee (2025) introduced. Further, we show hidden duality of Cauchy identity through RSK correspondences of type A and C. Finally, we prove that the generating function of SSOT is symmetric by constructing a new sort of Bender-Knuth involution.</description>

      <title>The $k$-Total Bondage Number of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a connected, finite undirected graph. A set $S \subseteq V$ is said to be a total dominating set of $G$ if every vertex in $V$ is adjacent to some vertex in $S$. The total domination number, $\gamma_{t}(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a total dominating set in $G$. We define the $k$-total bondage of $G$ to be the minimum number of edges to remove from $G$ so that the resulting graph has a total domination number at least $k$ more than $\gamma_{t}(G)$. We establish general properties of $k$-total bondage and find exact values for certain graph classes including paths, cycles, wheels, complete and complete bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Exponents of 2-multiarrangements of three lines over fields of positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freeness of multiarrangements is extremely important in the study of freeness of hyperplane arrangements. In particular, the exponents of 2-multiarrangement play an important role in freeness of 3-arrangement. However, it is not easy to compute exponents in general. Wakamiko (2007) determined bases and the exponents for multiarrangements of three lines over a field of characteristic zero. In this paper, we study the exponents of multiarrangements of three lines for the case of positive characteristic. We provide an effective algorithm for computing the exponents. Furthermore, we prove that the multiplicity lattice has plenty of symmetries. We also discuss the validity of bases constructed from binomial expansions in the case of positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomials of semimatroids and their connections to matroids, hyperplane arrangements and graph colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We primarily investigate the properties of characteristic polynomials of semimatroids. In particular, we provide a combinatorial interpretation of their coefficients, generalizing the Whitney's Broken Circuit Theorem. We also prove that the unsigned coefficients of the characteristic polynomial form a unimodal and log-concave sequence, extending the Rota-Heron-Welsh Conjecture to semimatroids. Furthermore, we present convolution identities for the multiplicative characteristic and Tutte polynomials of semimatroids using the M\"obius conjugation. Finally, motivated by Kochol's work, we introduce assigning matroids to establish connections among semimatroids, hyperplane arrangements, and graph colorings, with a particular focus on their characteristic polynomials.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on the Anti-Ramsey Number of Independent Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-colored graph is called \textit{rainbow graph} if all the colors on its edges are distinct. Given a positive integer $n$ and a graph $G$, the \textit{anti-Ramsey number} $ar(n,G)$ is defined to be the minimum number of colors $r$ such that there exists a rainbow copy of $G$ in any exactly $r$-edge-coloring of $K_n$.
  Wu et al. (Anti-Ramsey numbers for vertex-disjoint triangles, \emph{Discrete. Math.}, \textbf{346} (2022), 113123) determined the anti-Ramsey number $ar(n, kK_3)$ for $n\geq 2k^2-k+2 $. In this paper, we extend this result by improving the lower bound on $n$ to $n\geq 15k+57$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for all $\mu&gt;0, t\in (0,1)$ and sufficiently large $n\in 4\mathbb{N}$, if $G$ is an edge-weighted complete graph on $n$ vertices with a weight function $w: E(G)\rightarrow [0,1]$ and the minimum weighted degree $\delta^w(G)\geq (\tfrac{1+3t}{4}+\mu)n$, then $G$ contains a $K_4$-factor where each copy of $K_4$ has total weight more than $6t$. This confirms a conjecture of Balogh--Kemkes--Lee--Young for the tetrahedron case.</description>

      <title>Extending the Affirmative Action Problem: mixing numbers and integrated colorings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a graph whose vertices are colored in one of two colors, say black or white. A white vertex is called integrated if it has at least as many black neighbors as white neighbors, and similarly for a black vertex. The coloring as a whole is integrated if every vertex is integrated. A classic exercise in graph theory, known as the Affirmative Action Problem, is to prove that every finite simple graph admits an integrated coloring. The solution can be neatly summarized with the one-liner: "maximize the number of balanced edges," that is, the edges that connect neighbors of different colors. However, not all integrated colorings advertise the maximum possible number of balanced edges.
  In this paper, we characterize and enumerate the integrated colorings for complete graphs, bicliques, paths, and cycles. We also derive the distributions and extremal values for the mixing numbers (the number of balanced edges) across all integrated colorings over these families of graphs. For paths and cycles in particular, we use the quasi-powers framework for probability generating functions to prove a central limit theorem for the mixing number of random integrated colorings. Lastly, we obtain an upper bound for the number of integrated colorings over any fixed graph via the second-moment method. A specialized bound for the number of integrated colorings over a regular graph is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Sperner's colorings of hypergraphs arising from edgewise triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Sperner's labelings of $H^\pi_{k,q}$, the hypergraph whose hyperedges are facets of the edgewise triangulation of a $(k-1)$-simplex defined by a permutation $\pi\in \mathbb{S}_{k-1}$. Mirzakhani and Vondr\' ak showed that the greedy coloring of $H^{\mathrm{Id}}_{k,q}$ produces the maximal number of monochromatic hyperedges. The line graph of $H_{k,q}^\pi$ is built from the copies of the graph $G_\pi$ that represents which subsets of consecutive numbers of $[k-1]$ are contiguous in $\pi$. We characterize these graphs in terms of dissections a regular $k$-gon and also show how they encode the adjacency relation between a hypersimplex and the facets of its alcoved triangulation. The natural action of the dihedral group $D_k$ on a regular $k$-gon and graphs $G_\pi$ extends on the group of permutations $\mathbb S_{k-1}$. Independent sets of the graphs $G_\pi$ of the permutations that are not invariant under the rotation are used to define a class of Sperner's colorings that produce more monochromatic hyperedges then the greedy colorings. This colorings are also optimal for a certain permutations.</description>

      <title>Shellings of Tropical Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shellability of the boundary complex of an unbounded polyhedron is investigated. To this end, it is necessary to pass to a suitable compactification, e.g., by one point. This observation can be exploited to prove that any tropical hypersurface is shellable. Under the hood there is a subtle interplay between the duality of polyhedral complexes and their shellability. Translated into discrete Morse theory, that interplay entails that the tight span of an arbitrary regular subdivision is collapsible, but not shellable in general.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem between arbitrary sets and $k$-coordinatable sets in finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the cardinality of the distance set $\Delta(A, B)$ determined by two subsets $A$ and $B$ of the $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. Assuming that $A$ or $B$ lies in a $k$-coordinate plane up to translations and rotations, we prove that if $|A||B| &gt; 2q^d$, then $|\Delta(A, B)| &gt; q/2$, where $|\Delta(A, B)|$ denotes the number of distinct distances between elements of $A$ and $B$. In particular, we show that our result recovers the sharp $(d+1)/2$ threshold for the Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem in odd dimensions, where distances are determined by a single set. As an application, we also obtain an improved result on the Box distance problem posed by Borges, Iosevich, and Ou, in the case where $2$ is a square in $\mathbb{F}_q$.</description>

      <title>Refinement of a conjecture on positive square energy of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph of order $n$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_1(G)\geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n(G)$. Define \[s^+(G)=\sum_{\lambda_i &gt;0} \lambda_i^2(G), \quad s^-(G)=\sum_{\lambda_i&lt;0} \lambda_i^2(G).\] It was conjectured by Elphick, Farber, Goldberg and Wocjan that for every connected graph $G$ of order $n$, $s^+(G) \ge n-1.$ We verify this conjecture for graphs with domination number at most 2. We then strengthen the conjecture as follows: if $G$ is a connected graph of order $n$ and size $m \geq n+1$, then $s^+(G) \geq n$. We prove this conjecture for claw-free graphs and graphs with diameter 2.</description>

      <title>Changing Bases with Pipe Dream Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger introduced Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials to study the cohomology and K-theory of the complete flag variety. We present explicit combinatorial rules for expressing Grothendieck polynomials in the basis of Schubert polynomials, and vice versa, using the bumpless pipe dreams (BPDs) of Lam, Lee, and Shimozono. A key advantage of BPDs is that they are naturally back stable, which allows us to give a combinatorial formula for expanding back stable Grothendieck polynomials in terms of back stable Schubert polynomials. We also provide pipe dream interpretations for the rules originally given by Lenart (Grothendieck to Schubert) and Lascoux (Schubert to Grothendieck), which were previously formulated in terms of binary triangular arrays. We give new proofs of these results, relying on Knutson's co-transition recurrences. As a consequence, we obtain a formula for expanding Grothendieck polynomials into Schubert polynomials using chains in Bruhat order. The key connection between the pipe dream and BPD change of basis formulas is the canonical bijection of Gao and Huang. We show that co-permutations are preserved by this map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the theory of $p$-modulus of a family of infinite paths on an infinite-rooted tree and then explore its interpretation and properties. One key result is the formulation of $p$-modulus on the infinite tree as a limit of $p$-modulus on truncated trees, with a formula given in terms of a series. Analogous to the existing theory for finite graphs, the $1$-modulus of a family of descending paths in an infinite tree is related to the minimum cut problem, the $2$-modulus is related to effective resistance, and the $\infty$-modulus is related to the length of shortest paths. Another key result is the existence of a critical $p$-value for radially symmetric infinite binary trees, which assigns a kind of dimension to the boundaries</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates perfect state transfer in Grover walks, a model of discrete-time quantum walks. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of perfect state transfer on graphs belonging to an association scheme. Our focus includes specific association schemes, namely the Hamming and Johnson schemes. We characterize all graphs on the classes of Hamming and Johnson schemes that exhibit perfect state transfer. Furthermore, we study perfect state transfer on distance-regular graphs. We provide complete characterizations for exhibiting perfect state transfer on distance-regular graphs of diameter $2$ and diameter $3$, as well as integral distance-regular graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \v{S}olt\'es' hypergraph is a hypergraph for which the removal of any of its vertices does not change its total distance. We prove that every uniform \v{S}olt\'es' hypergraph has order at least $10$, there exist uniform \v{S}olt\'es' hypergraphs for almost every order or uniformity, and there exist a non-regular uniform \v{S}olt\'es' hypergraph. By also providing infinitely many weighted \v{S}olt\'es' graphs, we conclude that \v{S}olt\'es' problem can be answered positively for the most natural generalisations of graphs.</description>

      <title>Introducing a vertex polynomial invariant for embedded graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ribbon group action extends geometric duality and Petrie duality by defining two embedded graphs as twisted duals precisely when they lie within the same orbit under this group action. Twisted duality yields numerous novel properties of fundamental graph polynomials. In this paper, we resolve a problem raised by Ellis-Monaghan and Moffatt [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 364 (2012), 1529--1569] for vertex counts by introducing the vertex polynomial: a generating function quantifying vertex distribution across orbits under the ribbon group action. We establish its equivalence via transformations of boundary component enumeration and derive recursive relations through edge deletion, contraction, and twisted contraction. For bouquets, we prove the polynomial depends only on signed intersection graphs. Finally, we provide topological interpretations for the vertex polynomial by connecting this polynomial to the interlace polynomial and the topological transition polynomial.</description>

Abstract: We present a construction of a family of non-periodic tilings using elementary tools such as modular arithmetic and vector geometry. These tilings exhibit a distinct type of structural regularity, which we term modulo-staggered rotational symmetry. The construction is self-contained and does not rely on previous tiling theories or systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the complexity of refuting the existence of a perfect matching in spectral expanders with an odd number of vertices, in the Polynomial Calculus (PC) and Sum of Squares (SoS) proof system. Austrin and Risse [SODA, 2021] showed that refuting perfect matchings in sparse $d$-regular \emph{random} graphs, in the above proof systems, with high probability requires proofs with degree $\Omega(n/\log n)$. We extend their result by showing the same lower bound holds for \emph{all} $d$-regular graphs with a mild spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry of Cactus, Pascal, and Pappus Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rank-three matroids, known as point-line configurations, and their associated matroid varieties, defined as the Zariski closures of their realization spaces. Our focus is on determining finite generating sets of defining equations for these varieties, up to radical, and describing the irreducible components of the corresponding circuit varieties. We generalize the notion of cactus graphs to matroids, introducing a family of point-line configurations whose underlying graphs are cacti. Our analysis includes several classical matroids, such as the Pascal, Pappus, and cactus matroids, for which we provide explicit finite generating sets for their associated matroid ideals. The matroid ideal is the ideal of the matroid variety, whose construction involves a saturation step with respect to all the independence relations of the matroid. This step is computationally very expensive and has only been carried out for very small matroids. We provide a complete generating set of these ideals for the Pascal, Pappus, and cactus matroids. The proofs rely on classical geometric techniques, including liftability arguments and the Grassmann--Cayley algebra, which we use to construct so-called bracket polynomials in these ideals. In addition, we prove that every cactus matroid is realizable and that its matroid variety is irreducible.</description>

      <title>A Note on Reconfiguration Graphs of Cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a reconfiguration setting, each clique of a graph $G$ is viewed as a set of tokens placed on vertices of $G$ such that no vertex has more than one token and any two tokens are adjacent. Additionally, three well-known reconfiguration rules have been studied in the literature: Token Jumping ($\mathsf{TJ}$, which involves moving a token to any unoccupied vertex), Token Sliding ($\mathsf{TS}$, which involves moving a token to an adjacent unoccupied vertex), and Token Addition/Removal ($\mathsf{TAR}$, which involves either adding or removing exactly one token). Given a graph $G$ and a reconfiguration rule $\mathsf{R} \in \{\mathsf{TS}, \mathsf{TJ}, \mathsf{TAR}\}$, a reconfiguration graph of cliques of $G$ is the graph whose vertices are cliques of $G$ and two vertices (cliques of $G$) are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by applying $\mathsf{R}$ exactly once. In this paper, we initiate the study on structural properties of reconfiguration graphs of cliques and prove a number of interesting results, most of which are under the $\sfTS$ and $\sfTJ$ rules.</description>

      <title>Divisibility of Griesmer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider Griesmer codes, namely those linear codes meeting the Griesmer bound. Let $C$ be an $[n,k,d]_q$ Griesmer code with $q=p^f$, where $p$ is a prime and $f\ge1$ is an integer. In 1998, Ward proved that for $q=p$, if $p^e|d$, then $p^e|\mathrm{wt}(c)$ for all $c\in C$. In this paper, we show that if $q^e|d$, then $C$ has a basis consisting of $k$ codewords such that the first $\min\left\{e+1,k\right\}$ of them span a Griesmer subcode with constant weight $d$ and any $k-1$ of them span a $[g_q(k-1,d),k-1,d]_q$ Griesmer subcode. Using the $p$-adic algebraic method together with this basis, we prove that if $q^e|d$, then $p^e|\mathrm{wt}(c)$ for all $c\in C$. Based on this fact, using the geometric approach with the aforementioned basis, we show that if $p^e|d$, then $\Delta |{\rm wt}(c)$ for all $c\in C$, where $\Delta=\left\lceil p^{e-(f-1)(q-2)}\right\rceil$.</description>

      <title>#P is Sandwiched by One and Two #2DNF Calls: Is Subtraction Stronger Than We Thought?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical class in the realm of counting complexity is #P. It is well known that the problem of counting the models of a propositional formula in disjunctive normal form (#DNF) is complete for #P under Turing reductions. On the other hand, #DNF $\in$ spanL and spanL $\not\subseteq$ #P unless NL = NP. Hence, the class of functions logspace-reducible to #DNF is a strict subset of #P under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions. By contrast, we show that two calls to a (restricted) #2DNF oracle suffice to capture gapP, namely, that the logspace many-one closure of the subtraction between the results of two #2DNF calls is gapP. Because #P $\not\subseteq$ gapP, #P is strictly contained between one and two #2DNF oracle calls.
  Surprisingly, the propositional formulas needed in both calls are linear-time computable, and the reduction preserves interesting structural as well as symmetry properties, leading to algorithmic applications. We show that a single subtraction suffices to compensate for the absence of negation while still capturing gapP, i.e., our results carry over to the monotone fragments of #2SAT and #2DNF. Since our reduction is linear-time, it preserves sparsity and, as a consequence we obtain a sparsification lemma for both #2SAT and #2DNF. This has only been known for kSAT with k $\geq$ 3 and respective counting versions. We further show that both #2DNF calls can be combined into a single call if we allow a little postprocessing (computable by AC0- or TC0-circuits). Consequently, we derive refined versions of Toda's Theorem: PH $\subseteq$ [#MON2SAT]$^{log}_{TC0}$ = [#MON2DNF]$^{log}_{TC0}$ and PH $\subseteq$ [#IMPL2SAT]$^{log}_{AC0}$. Our route to these results is via structure-aware reductions that preserve parameters like treewidth up to an additive overhead. The absence of multiplicative overhead indeed yields parameterized SETH-tight lower bounds.</description>

      <title>CNFs and DNFs with Exactly $k$ Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model counting is a fundamental problem that consists of determining the number of satisfying assignments for a given Boolean formula. The weighted variant, which computes the weighted sum of satisfying assignments, has extensive applications in probabilistic reasoning, network reliability, statistical physics, and formal verification. A common approach for solving weighted model counting is to reduce it to unweighted model counting, which raises an important question: {\em What is the minimum number of terms (or clauses) required to construct a DNF (or CNF) formula with exactly $k$ satisfying assignments?}
  In this paper, we establish both upper and lower bounds on this question. We prove that for any natural number $k$, one can construct a monotone DNF formula with exactly $k$ satisfying assignments using at most $O(\sqrt{\log k}\log\log k)$ terms. This construction represents the first $o(\log k)$ upper bound for this problem. We complement this result by showing that there exist infinitely many values of $k$ for which any DNF or CNF representation requires at least $\Omega(\log\log k)$ terms or clauses. These results have significant implications for the efficiency of model counting algorithms based on formula transformations.</description>

      <title>On the Fixed-Length-Burst Levenshtein Ball with Unit Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a length-$n$ sequence $\bm{x}$ over a $q$-ary alphabet. The \emph{fixed-length Levenshtein ball} $\mathcal{L}_t(\bm{x})$ of radius $t$ encompasses all length-$n$ $q$-ary sequences that can be derived from $\bm{x}$ by performing $t$ deletions followed by $t$ insertions. Analyzing the size and structure of these balls presents significant challenges in combinatorial coding theory. Recent studies have successfully characterized fixed-length Levenshtein balls in the context of a single deletion and a single insertion. These works have derived explicit formulas for various key metrics, including the exact size of the balls, extremal bounds (minimum and maximum sizes), as well as expected sizes and their concentration properties. However, the general case involving an arbitrary number of $t$ deletions and $t$ insertions $(t&gt;1)$ remains largely uninvestigated. This work systematically examines fixed-length Levenshtein balls with multiple deletions and insertions, focusing specifically on \emph{fixed-length burst Levenshtein balls}, where deletions occur consecutively, as do insertions. We provide comprehensive solutions for explicit cardinality formulas, extremal bounds (minimum and maximum sizes), expected size, and concentration properties surrounding the expected value.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of 2-step Transit Probabilities in 2-Coloured Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that the vertices of a regular graph are coloured red and blue with an equal number of each (we call this a balanced colouring). Since the graph is undirected, the number of edges from a red vertex to a blue vertex is clearly the same as the number of edges from a blue vertex to a red vertex. However, if instead of edges we count walks of length 2 which do not stay within their starting colour class, then this symmetry disappears. Our aim in this paper is to investigate how extreme this asymmetry can be.
  Our main question is: Given a $d$-regular graph, for which pairs $(x,y)\in[0,1]^2$ is there a balanced colouring for which the probability that a random walk starting from a red vertex stays within the red class for at least $2$ steps is $x$, and the corresponding probability for blue is $y$?
  Our most general result is that for any $d$-regular graph, these pairs lie within the convex hull of the $2d$ points $\left\{\left(\frac{l}{d},\frac{l^2}{d^2}\right),\left(\frac{l^2}{d^2},\frac{l}{d}\right) :0\leq l\leq d\right\}$.
  Our main focus is the torus for which we prove both sharper bounds and existence results via constructions. In particular, for the $2$-dimensional torus, we show that asymptotically, the region in which these pairs of probabilities can lie is exactly the convex hull of: \[ \left\{\left(0,0\right),\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4}\right),\left(\frac{3}{4},\frac{9}{16}\right),\left(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2}\right),\left(\frac{9}{16},\frac{3}{4}\right),\left(1,1\right)\right\} \]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a precise min-max theorem for the following problem. Let $G$ be an Eulerian graph with a specified set of edges $S \subseteq E(G)$, and let $b$ be a vertex of $G$. Then what is the maximum integer $k$ so that the edge-set of $G$ can be partitioned into $k$ non-zero $b$-trails? That is, each trail must begin and end at $b$ and contain an odd number of edges from~$S$. This theorem is motivated by a connection to vertex-minors and yields two conjectures of M\'{a}\v{c}ajov\'{a} and \v{S}koviera as corollaries.</description>

      <title>An imperceptible connection between the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and the Terwilliger algebras of Grassmann graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ are expressible in terms of Hahn polynomials. The phenomenon can be explained by an algebra homomorphism $\natural$ from the universal Hahn algebra $\mathcal H$ into $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)\otimes U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. Let $\Omega$ denote a finite set of size $D$ and $2^\Omega$ denote the power set of $\Omega$. It is generally known that $\mathbb C^{2^\Omega}$ supports a $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-module. Let $k$ denote an integer with $0\leq k\leq D$ and fix a $k$-element subset $x_0$ of $\Omega$. By identifying $\mathbb C^{2^\Omega}$ with $\mathbb C^{2^{\Omega\setminus x_0}}\otimes \mathbb C^{2^{x_0}}$ this induces a $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)\otimes U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-module structure on $\mathbb C^{2^\Omega}$ denoted by $\mathbb C^{2^\Omega}(x_0)$. Pulling back via $\natural$ the $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)\otimes U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-module $\mathbb C^{2^\Omega}(x_0)$ forms an $\mathcal H$-module. When $1\leq k\leq D-1$ the $\mathcal H$-module $\mathbb C^{2^\Omega}(x_0)$ enfolds the Terwilliger algebra of the Johnson graph $J(D,k)$ with respect to $x_0$. This result connects these two seemingly irrelevant topics: The Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and the Terwilliger algebras of Johnson graphs. Unfortunately some steps break down in the $q$-analog case. By making detours, the imperceptible connection between the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and the Terwilliger algebras of Grassmann graphs is successfully disclosed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inclusion ideal graph of a commutative unitary ring $R$ is the (undirected) graph $In(R)$ whose vertices all non-trivial ideals of $R$ and two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if one of them is a proper subset of the other one. In this paper, the metric dimension of $In(R)$ is discussed. Moreover, the structure of the resolving graph of $In(R)$ is characterized and as an application, we compute the strong metric dimension of $In(R)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite set of integers such that the first few gaps between its consecutive elements equal $a$, while the remaining gaps equal $b$, we study dense packings of its translates on the line. We obtain an explicit lower bound on the corresponding optimal density, conjecture its tightness, and prove it in case one of the gap lengths, $a$ or $b$, appears only once. This is equivalent to a Motzkin problem on the independence ratio of certain integer distance graphs.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of Hom complexes of graph homomorphisms whose codomains are cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For simple graphs $G$ and $H$, the Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is a polyhedral complex whose vertices are the graph homomorphisms $G\to H$ and whose edges connect the pairs of homomorphisms which differ in a single vertex of $G$. Hom complexes play an important role in an algebro-topological approach to the graph coloring problem. It is known that $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a disjoint union of points and circles when both $G$ and $H$ are cycles. We generalize this known result by showing that the same holds whenever $G$ is connected and $H$ is a cycle. To this end, we explicitly construct the universal cover of each connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ and prove that it is contractible. Additionally, we provide a simple criterion to determine whether the connected component containing a given homomorphism is homotopy equivalent to a point or circle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since K\H{o}v\'ari, S\'os, and Tur\'an proved upper bounds for the Zarankiewicz problem in 1954, much work has been undertaken to improve these bounds, and some have done so by restricting to particular classes of graphs. In 2017, Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl proved better bounds for semialgebraic binary relations, and this work was extended by Do in the following year to arbitrary semialgebraic relations. In this paper, we show that Zarankiewicz bounds in the shape of Do's are enjoyed by all relations satisfying the distal regularity lemma, an improved version of the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma satisfied by relations definable in distal structures (a vast generalisation of o-minimal structures).</description>

      <title>Hindrance from a wasteful partial linkage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $ D=(V,E) $ be a (possibly infinite) digraph and $ A,B\subseteq V $. A hindrance consists of an $ AB $-separator $ S $ together with a set of disjoint $ AS $-paths linking a proper subset of $ A $ onto $ S $. Hindrances and configurations guaranteeing the existence of hindrances play an essential role in the proof of the infinite version of Menger's theorem and are important in the context of certain open problems as well. This motivates the investigation of circumstances under which hindrances appear. In this paper we show that if there is a ``wasteful partial linkage'', i.e. a set $ \mathcal{P} $ of disjoint $ AB $-paths with fewer unused vertices in $ B $ than in $ A $, then there exists a hindrance.</description>

Abstract: Mansour and Shattuck introduced the notion of water cells for integer compositions in 2018. We focus on compositions with parts restricted to 1 and 2 and consider the array of counts for such compositions of $n$ with $k$ water cells, establishing generating functions for the columns and diagonal sums, recurrences within the array in the spirit of Pascal's lemma, and connections to other restricted compositions. Most of our proofs are combinatorial, but we also make connections to Riordan arrays.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$. A spanning $k$-tree of $G$ is a spanning tree with the maximum degree at most $k$, and a spanning $k$-ended-tree of $G$ is a spanning tree at most $k$ leaves, where $k\geq2$ is an integer. This paper establishes some spectral conditions for the existence of spanning $k$-trees or spanning $k$-ended-trees in $t$-connected graphs, which generalize the results of Fan et al. (2022) and Zhou (2010), and improve the results of Fiedler et al. (2010), Ao et al. (2023) and Ao et al. (2025).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture remains open for nearly three centuries. Recently Goldbach graphs are introduced to relate the problem with the literature of Graph Theory. It is shown that the connectedness of the graphs is equivalent to the affirmative answer of the conjecture. Some modified version of the graphs, say, near Goldbach graphs are shown to be Hamiltonian for small number of vertices. In this context, we introduce a class of graphs, namely, prime multiple missing graphs such that near Goldbach graphs are finite intersections of these graphs. We study these graphs for primes 3,5 and in general for any odd prime p. We prove that these graphs are connected with diameter at most 3 and Hamiltonian for even (&gt;2) vertices. Next the intersection of prime multiple missing graphs for primes 3 and 5 are studied. We prove that these graphs are connected with diameter at most 4 and they are also Hamiltonian for even (&gt;2) vertices. We observe that the diameters of finite Goldbach graphs and near Goldbach graphs are bounded by 5 (up to 10000 vertices). We believe further study on these graphs with big data analysis will help to understand structures of near Goldbach graphs.</description>

Abstract: A family of sets is intersecting if every pair of its members has an element in common. Such a family of sets is called a star if some element is in every set of the family. Given a graph $G$, let $\mu(G)$ denote the size of the smallest maximal independent set of $G$. In 2005, Holroyd and Talbot conjectured the following generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem: for $1\le r\le \mu(G)/2$, there is a maximum size intersecting family of independent $r$-sets that is a star. In this paper we present the history of this conjecture and survey the results that have supported it over the last 20 years.</description>

      <title>Supports for Outerplanar and Bounded Treewidth Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and construction of sparse supports for hypergraphs derived from subgraphs of a graph $G$. For a hypergraph $(X,\mathcal{H})$, a support $Q$ is a graph on $X$ s.t. $Q[H]$, the graph induced on vertices in $H$ is connected for every $H\in\mathcal{H}$.
  We consider \emph{primal}, \emph{dual}, and \emph{intersection} hypergraphs defined by subgraphs of a graph $G$ that are \emph{non-piercing}, (i.e., each subgraph is connected, their pairwise differences remain connected).
  If $G$ is outerplanar, we show that the primal, dual and intersection hypergraphs admit supports that are outerplanar. For a bounded treewidth graph $G$, we show that if the subgraphs are non-piercing, then there exist supports for the primal and dual hypergraphs of treewidth $O(2^{tw(G)})$ and $O(2^{4tw(G)})$ respectively, and a support of treewidth $2^{O(2^{tw(G)})}$ for the intersection hypergraph. We also show that for the primal and dual hypergraphs, the exponential blow-up of treewidth is sometimes essential.
  All our results are algorithmic and yield polynomial-time algorithms (when the treewidth is bounded). The existence and construction of sparse supports is a crucial step in the design and analysis of PTASs and/or sub-exponential time algorithms for several packing and covering problems.</description>

      <title>Three Tone Networks and a Tessellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices signifying major chords and twelve black vertices signifying minor chords. This so-called Levi graph uniquely determines the combinatorial geometry of a remarkable configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in the real projective plane with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of the four principal hexacycles and the three principal octacycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century voice leading, can be read off rather directly as properties of the configuration. We show how analogous tone networks can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music.</description>

      <title>Sombor index of clean graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with the vertex set $V (G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. The Sombor index of $G$, $SO(G)$, is defined as $\sum_{uv\in E(G)} \sqrt{deg(u)^2 + deg(v)^2}$, where $deg(u)$ is the degree of vertex $u$ in $V (G)$. The clean graph of a ring R, denoted by $Cl(R)$, is a graph with vertex set $\{(e, u) : e \in Id(R), u \in U(R)\}$ and two distinct vertices $(e, u)$ and$(f, v)$ are adjacent if and only if $ef = 0$ or $uv = 1$ ($Id(R)$ and $U(R)$ are the sets of idempotents and unit elements of R, respectively). The induced subgraph on $\{(e, u) : e \in Id^{*}(R), u \in U(R)\}$ is denoted by $Cl_2(R)$. In this paper, $SO(Cl2(\mathbb{Z}_n))$, for different values of the positive integer $n$, is investigated.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of graphs associated to the Basilica group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.10505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the foundation of the spectral analysis of the Laplacian on the orbital Schreier graphs of the Basilica group, the iterated monodromy group of the quadratic polynomial $z^2-1$. This group is an important example in the class of self-similar amenable but not elementary amenable finite automata groups studied by Grigorchuk, \.Zuk, \v Suni\'c, Bartholdi, Vir\'ag, Nekrashevych, Kaimanovich, Nagnibeda et al. We prove that the spectrum of the Laplacian has infinitely many gaps and that the support of the KNS Spectral Measure is a Cantor set. Moreover, on a generic blowup, the spectrum coincides with this Cantor set, and is pure point with localized eigenfunctions and eigenvalues located at the endpoints of the gaps.</description>

      <title>Sandpile group of infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite connected graph $G$ and a non-empty subset $S$ of its vertices thought of sinks, the so-called critical group (or sandpile group) $C(G, S)$ has been studied for a long time. We present a class of graphs where such an extension can be made in a unified way. Similar extension was made by Maes, C. and Redig, F. and Saada, E., but we propose a more algebraic point of view.
  Namely, consider a $C$-net $S\subset \mathbb Z^2$. We define a sandpile dynamics on $\mathbb Z^2$ with the set $S$ of sinks. For such a choice of sinks, a relaxation of any bounded state is well defined. This allows us to define a group $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ of recurrent states of this model. We show that $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ is isomorphic to a group of $S^1$-valued discrete harmonic functions on $\mathbb Z^2\setminus S$.
  Examples of $S$, for which $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ has no torsion or has all torsions, are provided. Pontryagin dual point of view is investigated. A discussion about perspectives of a sandpile group for $\mathbb Z^2$ as a projective limit concludes this work.</description>

      <title>An introduction to graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a graduate-level introduction to graph theory, corresponding to a quarter-long course. It covers simple graphs, multigraphs as well as their directed analogues, and more restrictive classes such as tournaments, trees and arborescences. Among the features discussed are Eulerian circuits, Hamiltonian cycles, spanning trees, the matrix-tree and BEST theorems, proper colorings, Turan's theorem, bipartite matching and the Menger and Gallai--Milgram theorems. The basics of network flows are introduced in order to prove Hall's marriage theorem.
  Around a hundred exercises are included (without solutions).</description>

      <title>Resilience of Rademacher chaos of low degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resilience of a Rademacher chaos is the maximum number of adversarial sign-flips that the chaos can sustain without having its largest atom probability significantly altered. Inspired by probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of linear Rademacher chaos, obtained by Bandeira, Ferber, and Kwan (Advances in Mathematics, Vol. $319$, $2017$), we provide probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low degree.
  Our main results distinguish between Rademacher chaos of order two and those of higher order. In that, our first main result pertains to the resilience of decoupled bilinear Rademacher forms where different asymptotic behaviour is observed for sparse and dense matrices. For our second main result, we bootstrap our first result in order to provide resilience guarantees for quadratic Rademacher chaos. Our third main result, generalises the first and handles the resilience of decoupled Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low order.
  Our results for decoupled Rademacher chaos of order two and that of higher order whilst are established through the same conceptual framework, differ substantially. A difference incurred due to the implementation of the same conceptual argument. The order two result is established using Dudley's maximal inequality for sub-Gaussian processes, the Hanson-Wright inequality, as well as the Kolmogorov-Rogozin inequality. To handle higher order chaos, appeals to Dudley's inequality as well as the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with tools suited for random tensors. Appeals to the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with appeals to a concentration result for random tensors put forth by Adamczak and Wolff.
  Our results are instance-dependent and thus allow for the efficient computation of resilience guarantees provided the order of the chaos is constant.</description>

      <title>Stable Menus of Public Goods: A Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a matching problem between agents and public goods, in settings without monetary transfers. Since goods are public, they have no capacity constraints. There is no exogenously defined budget of goods to be provided. Rather, each provided good must justify its cost by being utilized by sufficiently many agents, leading to strong complementarities in the "preferences" of goods. Furthermore, goods that are in high demand given other already-provided goods must also be provided. The question of the existence of a stable solution (a menu of public goods to be provided) exhibits a rich combinatorial structure. We uncover sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for guaranteeing the existence of a stable solution, and derive both positive and negative results for strategyproof stable matching.</description>

      <title>The complexity of computing the period and the exponent of a digraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The period of a strongly connected digraph is the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all its cycles. The period of a digraph is the least common multiple of the periods of its strongly connected components. These notions play an important role in the theory of Markov chains and the analysis of powers of nonnegative matrices. While the time complexity of computing the period is well-understood, little is known about its space complexity. We show that the problem of computing the period of a digraph is NL-complete, even if all its cycles are contained in the same strongly connected component. However, if the digraph is strongly connected, we show that this problem becomes L-complete. For primitive digraphs (that is, strongly connected digraphs of period one), there always exists a number $m$ such that there is a path of length exactly $m$ between every two vertices. We show that computing the smallest such $m$, called the exponent of a digraph, is NL-complete. The exponent of a primitive digraph is a particular case of the index of convergence of a nonnegative matrix, which we also show to be computable in NL, and thus NL-complete.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Macaulay2 package SCMAlgebras. It provides functions for computing the modules of deficiency and the filter ideals, in order to check whether a module or an ideal is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. After the basic algebraic notions and results are recalled, the main features of the package are described through examples</description>

      <title>On minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of clique-whiskered graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a minimal free resolution of the cover ideals of clique-whiskered graphs. In particular, Cohen--Macaulay chordal graphs, clique corona graphs, and Cohen--Macaulay Cameron--Walker graphs are examples of clique-whiskered graphs. We also introduce multi-clique-whiskered graphs as a generalization of both clique-whiskered graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique-whiskered graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen--Macaulay. Moreover, we provide formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of their edge ideals. Finally, we construct minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of both multi-clique-whiskered graphs and very well-covered graphs.</description>

      <title>Graph quandles: Generalized Cayley graphs of racks and right quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve two open problems of Valeriy Bardakov about Cayley graphs of racks and graph-theoretic realizations of right quasigroups. We also extend Didier Caucal's classification of labeled Cayley digraphs to right quasigroups and related algebraic structures like quandles.
  First, we characterize markings of graphs that realize racks. As an application, we construct rack-theoretic (di)graph invariants from permutation representations of graph automorphism groups. We describe how to compute these invariants with general results for path graphs and cycle graphs.
  Second, we show that all right quasigroups are realizable by edgeless graphs and complete (di)graphs. Using Schreier (di)graphs, we also characterize Cayley (di)graphs of right quasigroups Q that realize Q. In particular, all racks are realizable by their full Cayley (di)graphs.
  Finally, we give a graph-theoretic characterization of labeled Cayley digraphs of right-cancellative magmas, right-divisible magmas, right quasigroups, racks, quandles, involutory racks, and kei.</description>
