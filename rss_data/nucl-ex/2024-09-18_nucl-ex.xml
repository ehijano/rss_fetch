      <title>Investigating charm quark energy loss in medium with the nuclear modification factor of D$^0$-tagged jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ of charm jets, identified by the presence of a D$^0$ meson among the jet constituents, has been measured for the first time in Pb-Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The D$^0$ mesons and their charge conjugates are reconstructed from the hadronic decay D$^0\to \mathrm K^{-}\pi^{+}$. Jets are reconstructed from D$^0$-meson candidates and charged particles using the anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$ algorithm with jet resolution parameter $R=0.3$, in the jet transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) range $5&lt; p_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{ch~jet}&lt;50$ GeV/$c$ and pseudorapidity $|\eta^\mathrm{ch~jet}| &lt; 0.6$. A hint of reduced suppression in the charm-jet $R_\mathrm{AA}$ is observed in comparison to inclusive jets in central Pb-Pb collisions with a significance of about 2$\sigma$ in $20&lt; p_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{ch~jet}&lt;50$ GeV/$c$, suggesting the in-medium energy loss to depend on both the difference between quark and gluon coupling strength (Casimir colour-charge effect) and quark mass (dead-cone effect). The data are compared with model calculations that include mass effects in the in-medium energy loss. Among these, LIDO provides the best description of the data, highlighting the role of mass effects in interpreting the results.</description>

      <title>Coherent J/$\psi$ photoproduction at midrapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent J/$\psi$ photoproduction cross section is measured for the first time at midrapidity in peripheral to semicentral Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. The centrality differential cross section ${\rm d} \sigma/ {\rm d}y$ is reported for the centrality range 40-90%, together with the doubly-differential cross section ${\rm d}^2 \sigma /{\rm d}y {\rm d} p_{\rm T}$, extracted in two peripheral centrality classes. The J/$\psi$ mesons are reconstructed in the dielectron channel, in the rapidity interval $|y| &lt;$ 0.9 using the ALICE central barrel detectors. The J/$\psi$ cross section at midrapidity is statistically compatible to the earlier ALICE measurement at forward rapidity and at the same centre-of-mass energy, and shows only a mild centrality dependence over the covered range. Several sets of theoretical calculations taking into account the hadronic overlap in the collisions but ignoring possible final-state effects from a hot expanding medium are found to give a fairly good description of the current measurements within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effects of precise mass measurements of Ru and Pd isotopes on machine learning mass modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic masses are a foundational quantity in our understanding of nuclear structure, astrophysics and fundamental symmetries. The long-standing goal of creating a predictive global model for the binding energy of a nucleus remains a significant challenge, however, and prompts the need for precise measurements of atomic masses to serve as anchor points for model developments. We present precise mass measurements of neutron-rich Ru and Pd isotopes performed at the Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade facility at Argonne National Laboratory using the Canadian Penning Trap mass spectrometer. The masses of $^{108}$Ru, $^{110}$Ru and $^{116}$Pd were measured to a relative mass precision $\delta m/m \approx 10^{-8}$ via the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique, and represent an improvement of approximately an order of magnitude over previous measurements. These mass data were used in conjunction with the physically interpretable machine learning (PIML) model, which uses a mixture density neural network to model mass excesses via a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The effects of our new mass data on a Bayesian-updating of a PIML model are presented.</description>

      <title>Pion Boer-Mulders function using a contact interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetry preserving treatment of a vector $\otimes$ vector contact interaction (SCI) is used as the basis for calculations of the two pion transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs); namely, that for unpolarised valence degrees-of-freedom and the analogous Boer-Mulders (BM) function. Amongst other things, the analysis enables the following themes to be addressed: the quark current mass dependence of pion TMDs; the impact of the gauge link model on the positivity constraint that bounds the BM function relative to the unpolarised TMD; the equivalence of direct diagrammatic and light-front wave function TMD calculations; and the size of the BM shift. Interpreted astutely, these SCI results enable one to draw insightful pictures of pion TMDs.</description>

      <title>Photo-nuclear reaction rates of $^{157,159}$Ho and $^{163,165}$Tm and their impact in the $\gamma$--process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable photo-nuclear reaction rates at the stellar conditions are essential to understand the origin of the heavy stable neutron-deficient isotopes between $^{74}$Se and $^{196}$Hg-p-nuclei, however, many reaction rates of relevance still have to rely on the Hauser-Feshbach model due to rare experimental progress. One such case is in the mass range of 160 for Dy, Er, Ho and Tm isotopes. In this work we attempt to constrain the Hauser-Feshbach model in the TALYS package by reproducing the available experimental data of $^{160}$Dy($p,\gamma$)$^{161}$Ho and $^{162}$Er($p,\gamma$)$^{163}$Tm in the $A\sim 160$ mass region, and examine the effects of level density, gamma strength function and the optical model potential. The constrained model then allows us to calculate the reaction rates of $^{157, 159}$Ho($\gamma$, $p$) and $^{163,165}$Tm($\gamma$, $p$) for the $\gamma$-process nucleosynthesis in carbon-deflagration SNe Ia model. Our recommended rates differ from the JINA REACLIB by more than 1 order of magnitude in the temperature range of 2-3 GK. This results in the changes of final abundance of $p$-nuclei in the $A\sim 160$ mass range by -5.5-3\% from those with JINA, which means that the ($\gamma$, $p$) reactions uncertainty is not predominant for the synthesis of these nuclei.</description>

      <title>Measurement of f$_{1}$(1285) production in pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{{\textit s}}}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first measurement of the f$_{1}$(1285) resonance using the ALICE detector in inelastic proton--proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The resonance is reconstructed at midrapidity ($|y| &lt;$ 0.5) through the hadronic decay channel f$_{1} (1285) \rightarrow \mathrm{K^{0}_{S} K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}}$. Key measurements include the determination of its mass, transverse-momentum integrated yield, and average transverse momentum. Additionally, the ratio of the transverse-momentum integrated yield of f$_{1}$(1285) to pion is compared with calculations from the canonical statistical hadronization model. The model calculation, assuming a zero total strangeness content for f$_{1}$(1285), reproduces the data within 1$\sigma$ deviation, shedding light on the quark composition of f$_{1}$(1285).</description>

      <title>First measurement of $\mathrm{D_{s1}}(1^{+})(2536)^+$ and $\mathrm{D_{s2}^{*}(2^{+})(2573)^+}$ production in proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production yields of the orbitally excited charm-strange mesons $\mathrm{D_{s1}(1^{+})(2536)^+}$ and $\mathrm{D_{s2}^{*}(2^{+})(2573)^+}$ were measured for the first time in proton--proton (pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} =13$ TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The $\mathrm{D_{s1}^+}$ and $\mathrm{D_{s2}^{*+}}$ mesons were measured at midrapidity ($|y|&lt;0.5$) in minimum-bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions in the transverse-momentum interval $2 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 24$ GeV/$c$. Their production yields relative to the $\mathrm{D_{s}^{+}}$ ground-state yield were found to be compatible between minimum-bias and high-multiplicity collisions, as well as with previous measurements in $\mathrm{e^\pm p}$ and $\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}$ collisions. The measured $\mathrm{D_{s1}^+/D_{s}^{+}}$ and $\mathrm{D_{s2}^{*+}/D_{s}^{+}}$ yield ratios are described by statistical hadronization models and can be used to tune the parameters governing the production of excited charm-strange hadrons in Monte Carlo generators, such as PYTHIA 8.</description>

      <title>The ALICE 3 detector concept for LHC Runs 5 and 6 and its physics performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LHC Run 5 and 6 data taking phases will bring unprecedented luminosity in high-energy proton-proton and in heavy-ion collisions. The ALICE Collaboration proposes a next-generation experiment, ALICE 3, specifically designed to operate with the future LHC. ALICE 3 will feature a large pixel-based tracking system covering eight units of pseudorapidity, complemented by advanced particle identification systems. These include silicon time-of-flight layers, a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, a muon identification system, and an electromagnetic calorimeter. By placing the vertex detector on a retractable plate inside the beam pipe, a track pointing resolution better than 10 microns can be achieved for the transverse momentum range $p_T$&gt;200 MeV/c. ALICE 3 will be capable of innovative measurements of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and explore new frontiers in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The detailed study of thermal and dynamical properties of QGP will be made possible by measuring low-$p_T$ heavy-flavour production, including beauty hadrons, multi-charm baryons, and charm-charm correlations. Precise multi-differential measurements of dielectron emission will allow for the exploration of chiral-symmetry restoration and the time-evolution of QGP temperature. In addition to QGP studies, ALICE 3 will make unique contributions to the physics of the hadronic phase, through femtoscopic studies of charm meson interaction potentials and searches for nuclei containing charm. This contribution covers the detector design, expected physics performance, and the current status of detector research and development.</description>

      <title>Non-maximal entanglement of photons from positron-electron annihilation demonstrated using a novel plastic PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the state-of-the-art Positron Emission Tomography (PET), information about the polarization of annihilation photons is not available. Current PET systems track molecules labeled with positron-emitting radioisotopes by detecting the propagation direction of two photons from positron-electron annihilation. However, annihilation photons carry more information than just the site where they originated. Here we present a novel J-PET scanner built from plastic scintillators, in which annihilation photons interact predominantly via the Compton effect, providing information about photon polarization in addition to information on photon direction of propagation. Theoretically, photons from the decay of positronium in a vacuum are maximally entangled in polarization. However, in matter, when the positron from positronium annihilates with the electron bound to the atom, the question arises whether the photons from such annihilation are maximally entangled. In this work, we determine the distribution of the relative angle between polarization orientations of two photons from positron-electron annihilation in a porous polymer. Contrary to prior results for positron annihilation in aluminum and copper, where the strength of observed correlations is as expected for maximally entangled photons, our results show a significant deviation. We demonstrate that in porous polymer, photon polarization correlation is weaker than for maximally entangled photons but stronger than for separable photons. The data indicate that more than 40% of annihilations in Amberlite resin lead to a non-maximally entangled state. Our result indicates the degree of correlation depends on the annihilation mechanism and the molecular arrangement. We anticipate that the introduced Compton interaction-based PET system opens a promising perspective for exploring polarization correlations in PET as a novel diagnostic indicator.</description>

      <title>Review of nonflow estimation methods and uncertainties in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective anisotropic flow, where particles are correlated over the entire event, is a prominent phenomenon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and is sensitive to the properties of the matter created in those collisions. It is often measured by two- and multi-particle correlations and is therefore contaminated by nonflow, those genuine few-body correlations unrelated to the global event-wise correlations. Many methods have been devised to estimate nonflow contamination with various degrees of successes and difficulties. Here, we review those methods pedagogically, discussing the pros and cons of each method, and give examples of ballpark estimate of nonflow contamination and associated uncertainties in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We hope such a review of the various nonflow estimation methods in a single place would prove helpful to future researches.</description>

      <title>Investigating baryon-strangeness and charge-strangeness correlations in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To explore the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions and the properties of quark$-$gluon plasma, the ALICE collaboration at CERN has conducted an extensive analysis of the correlations among net-conserved quantities, namely net-baryon, net-charge, and net-strangeness. These correlations are essential for understanding the QCD phase structure, as they are directly connected to ratios of thermodynamic susceptibilities calculated in lattice QCD. This analysis focuses on the correlations between net-kaon and net-proton, as well as net-kaon and net-charge, in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, where net-proton and net-kaon serve as effective proxies for net-baryon and net-strangeness, respectively. A comparison with theoretical predictions from the Thermal-FIST model sheds light on the role of resonance decays and the effects of charge conservation laws in shaping these correlations. Furthermore, the measurements show sensitivity to the correlation volume in which these conservation laws are applied, underscoring the importance of modeling the underlying dynamics to fully understand the experimental results on fluctuations and correlations in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>First constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by neutron star binaries probe the physics of matter at supra nuclear densities. During the late inspiral, tidal deformations raised on each star by the gravitational field of its companion depend crucially on the star's internal properties. The misalignment of a star's tidal bulge with its companion's gravitational field encodes the strength of internal dissipative processes, which imprint onto the phase of the gravitational waves emitted. We here analyze GW data from the GW170817 (binary neutron star) event detected by LIGO and Virgo and find the first constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of a neutron star. From this constraint, \emph{assuming} a temperature profile for each star in the binary, we obtain an order of magnitude bound on the averaged bulk ($\zeta$) and shear ($\eta$) viscosity of each star during the inspiral.: $\zeta \lesssim 10^{31} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\eta \lesssim 10^{28} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1} $. We forecast that these bounds could be improved by two orders of magnitude with third-generation detectors, like Cosmic Explorer, using inspiral data. These constraints already inform nuclear physics models and motivate further theoretical work to better understand the interplay between viscosity and temperature in the late inspiral of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The Proton Charge Radius from Dimuon Photoproduction off the Proton</title>

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of measuring the proton charge radius through dimuon photoproduction off a proton target. Our findings indicate that the Bethe-Heitler mechanism, which dominates at small momentum transfers, allows for an extraction of the proton electromagnetic form factors in the extremely low $Q^2$ region below $10^{-3}$ GeV$^2$ in the spacelike region, when the incident photon beam energy exceeds several hundred MeV. The optimal kinematical region and a sensitivity study of the proton charge radius from dimuon photoproduction are presented. Such a measurement is expected to provide an alternative to the elastic muon-proton scattering measurements such as MUSE at PSI and AMBER at CERN.</description>
