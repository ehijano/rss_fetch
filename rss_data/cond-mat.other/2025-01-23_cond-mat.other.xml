      <title>Ferroelectricity in undoped HfO2 down to one-unit-cell on Si substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hafnium oxide (HfO2), particularly at low-dimensional scales, exhibits extensive promising applications in ultrahigh density devices like low-power logic and non-volatile memory devices due to its compatibility with current semiconductor technology1-5. However, achieving ferroelectricity (FE) at ultimate scale especially in undoped HfO2 remains challenging as the non-centrosymmetric FE phase, so-called O-III (space group: Pca21) is metastable and FE has a strong tendency of depolarization with the decrease in thickness6. Up to now, this phase has usually stabilized via doping with other elements7-9. But the minimum film thickness is still limited to 1 nm, about 2-unit-cell, to keep FE8. Thinner and undoped films, conducive to further miniature device size and avoid contamination during deposition process, have been a challenge to fabricate on Si substrates. Herein, we report the robust FE observed in undoped HfO2 ultrathin films directly grown on Si substrate via atomic layer deposition (ALD) and post-heat treat in vacuum. The so-fabricated ferroelectric O-III phase contains about 4.48 at% oxygen vacancy, is robust even monoclinic phase (space group: P21/c) coexists. The spontaneous and switchable polarization is remarkably stable, still surviving even in films down to 0.5 nm (one-unit-cell). Our results show the robust FE O-III phase can be obtained in films down to one-unit-cell in thickness on Si, providing a practical way to fabricating this important material in thickness limit.</description>

      <title>Is there a conflict between causality and diamagnetism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a handful of other seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. Nature naturally does not mind this, and experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in optical media.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in Krylov Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermalization in closed non-integrable quantum systems using the Krylov basis. We demonstrate that for thermalization to occur, the matrix representation of typical local operators in the Krylov basis should exhibit a specific tridiagonal form with all other elements in the matrix are exponentially small, reminiscent of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Within this framework, we propose that the nature of thermalization, whether weak or strong, can be examined by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. Moreover, we analyze the variance of Lanczos coefficients as another probe for the nature of thermalization. One observes that although the variance of Lanczos coefficients may capture certain features of thermalization, it is not as effective as the infinite time average of complexity.</description>

      <title>Zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance at the 10-9 level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition in a cluster spin chain coupled with free spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</description>
