      <title>On algebraic sums, trees and ideals in the Baire space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work in the Baire space $\mathbb{Z}^\omega$ equipped with the coordinate-wise addition $+$. Consider a $\sigma-$ideal $\mathcal{I}$ and a family $\mathbb{T}$ of some kind of perfect trees. We are interested in results of the form: for every $A\in \mathcal{I}$ and a tree $T\in\mathbb{T}$ there exists $T'\in \mathbb{T}, T'\subseteq T$ such that $A+\underbrace{[T']+[T']+\dots +[T']}_{\text{n--times}}\in \mathcal{I}$ for each $n\in\omega$. Explored tree types include perfect trees, uniformly perfect trees, Miller trees, Laver trees and $\omega-$Silver trees. The latter kind of trees is an analogue of Silver trees from the Cantor space. Besides the standard $\sigma$-ideal $\mathcal{M}$ of meager sets, we also analyze $\mathcal{M}_-$ and fake null sets $\mathcal{N}$. The latter two are born out of the characterizations of their respective analogues in the Cantor space. The key ingredient in proofs were combinatorial characterizations of these ideals in the Baire space.</description>

      <title>Bi-Filtration and Stability of TDA Mapper for Point Cloud Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carlsson, Singh and Memoli's TDA mapper takes a point cloud dataset and outputs a graph that depends on several parameter choices. Dey, Memoli, and Wang developed Multiscale Mapper for abstract topological spaces so that parameter choices can be analyzed via persistent homology. However, when applied to actual data, one does not always obtain filtrations of mapper graphs. DBSCAN, one of the most common clustering algorithms used in the TDA mapper software, has two parameters, \textbf{$\epsilon$} and \textbf{MinPts}. If \textbf{MinPts = 1} then DBSCAN is equivalent to single linkage clustering with cutting height \textbf{$\epsilon$}. We show that if DBSCAN clustering is used with \textbf{MinPts $&gt;$ 2}, a filtration of mapper graphs may not exist except in the absence of free-border points; but such filtrations exist if DBSCAN clustering is used with \textbf{MinPts = 1} or \textbf{2} as the cover size increases, \textbf{$\epsilon$} increases, and/or \textbf{MinPts} decreases. However, the 1-dimensional filtration is unstable. If one adds noise to a data set so that each data point has been perturbed by a distance at most \textbf{$\delta$}, the persistent homology of the mapper graph of the perturbed data set can be significantly different from that of the original data set. We show that we can obtain stability by increasing both the cover size and \textbf{$\epsilon$} at the same time. In particular, we show that the bi-filtrations of the homology groups with respect to cover size and $\epsilon$ between these two datasets are \textbf{2$\delta$}-interleaved.</description>

      <title>On isometric universality of spaces of metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A metric space $(M, d)$ is said to be universal for a class of metric spaces if all metric spaces in the class can be isometrically embedded into $(M, d)$. In this paper, for a metrizable space $Z$ possessing abundant subspaces, we first prove that the space of bounded metrics on $Z$ is universal for all bounded metric spaces (with restricted cardinality). Next, in contrast, we show that if $Z$ is an infinite discrete space, then the space of metrics on $Z$ is universal for all separable metric spaces. As a corollary of our results, if $Z$ is non-compact, or uncountable and compact, then the space of metrics on $Z$ is universal for all compact metric spaces. In addition, if $Z$ is compact and countable, then there exists a compact metric space that can not be isometrically embedded into the space of metrics on $Z$.</description>

      <title>Finite-index phenomena and the topology of bundle singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical branched cover is an open surjection of compact Hausdorff spaces with uniformly bounded finite fibers and analogously, a quantum branched cover is a unital $C^*$ embedding admitting a finite-index expectation. We show that whenever a compact Hausdorff space $Z$ contains a one-point compactification of an uncountable set, the incidence correspondence attached to the space of cardinality-$(\le n)$ subsets of $Z$ (for $n\ge 3$) is a classical branched cover that does not dualize to a quantum one. In particular, when $Z$ is dyadic, the resulting $C^*$ embeddings are quantum branched covers precisely when $Z$ is also metrizable. This provides a partial converse to an earlier result of the author's (to the effect that continuous, unital, subhomogeneous $C^*$ bundles over compact metrizable spaces are quantum branched) and settles negatively a question of Blanchard-Gogi\'{c}.
  There are also some positive results identifying classes of compact Hausdorff spaces (e.g. extremally disconnected or orderable) with the property that all (continuous, unital) $C^*$ bundles based thereon are quantum branched.</description>

      <title>Comparing functional countability and exponential separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A space is functionally countable if every real-valued continuous function has countable image. A stronger property recently defined by Tkachuk is exponentially separability. We start by studying these properties in GO spaces, where we extend results by Tkachuk and Wilson, and prove a conjecture by Dow. We also study some subspaces of products that are functionally countable and the influence of the $G_\delta$-topology on exponential separability. Finally, we give some examples of functionally countable spaces that are separable and uncountable.</description>
