      <title>Altruism Improves Congestion in Series-Parallel Nonatomic Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interested routing polices from individual users in a system can collectively lead to poor aggregate congestion in routing networks. The introduction of altruistic agents, whose goal is to benefit other agents in the system, can seemingly improve aggregate congestion. However, it is known in that in some network routing problems, altruistic agents can actually worsen congestion compared to that which would arise in the presence of a homogeneously selfish population. This paper provides a thorough investigation into the necessary conditions for altruists to be guaranteed to improve total congestion. In particular, we study the class of series-parallel non-atomic congestion games, where one sub-population is altruistic and the other is selfish. We find that a game is guaranteed to have improved congestion in the presence of altruistic agents (even if only a small part of the total population) compared to the homogeneously selfish version of the game, provided the network is symmetric, where all agents are given access to all paths in the network, and the series-parallel network for the game does not have sub-networks which emulate Braess's paradox -- a phenomenon we refer to as a Braess-resistant network. Our results appear to be the most complete characterization of when behavior that is designed to improve total congestion (which we refer to as altruism) is actually guaranteed to do so.</description>

      <title>Tree Splitting Based Rounding Scheme for Weighted Proportional Allocations with Subsidy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of allocating $m$ indivisible items to a set of $n$ heterogeneous agents, aiming at computing a proportional allocation by introducing subsidy (money). It has been shown by Wu et al. (WINE 2023) that when agents are unweighted a total subsidy of $n/4$ suffices (assuming that each item has value/cost at most $1$ to every agent) to ensure proportionality. When agents have general weights, they proposed an algorithm that guarantees a weighted proportional allocation requiring a total subsidy of $(n-1)/2$, by rounding the fractional bid-and-take algorithm. In this work, we revisit the problem and the fractional bid-and-take algorithm. We show that by formulating the fractional allocation returned by the algorithm as a directed tree connecting the agents and splitting the tree into canonical components, there is a rounding scheme that requires a total subsidy of at most $n/3 - 1/6$.</description>

      <title>Robustness of voting mechanisms to external information in expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of voting algorithms often overlook informational externalities shaping individual votes. For example, pre-polling information often skews voters towards candidates who may not be their top choice, but who they believe would be a worthwhile recipient of their vote. In this work, we aim to understand the role of external information in voting outcomes. We study this by analyzing (1) the probability that voting outcomes align with external information, and (2) the effect of external information on the total utility across voters, or social welfare. In practice, voting mechanisms elicit coarse information about voter utilities, such as ordinal preferences, which initially prevents us from directly analyzing the effect of informational externalities with standard voting mechanisms. To overcome this, we present an intermediary mechanism for learning how preferences change with external information which does not require eliciting full cardinal preferences. With this tool in hand, we find that voting mechanisms are generally more likely to select the alternative most favored by the external information, and when external information reflects the population's true preferences, social welfare increases in expectation.</description>

      <title>Poset Positional Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of positional games, supplementing them with a restriction on the order in which the elements of the board are allowed to be claimed. We introduce poset positional games, which are positional games with an additional structure -- a poset on the elements of the board. Throughout the game play, based on this poset and the set of the board elements that are claimed up to that point, we reduce the set of available moves for the player whose turn it is -- an element of the board can only be claimed if all the smaller elements in the poset are already claimed.
  We proceed to analyse these games in more detail, with a prime focus on the most studied convention, the Maker-Breaker games. First we build a general framework around poset positional games. Then, we perform a comprehensive study of the complexity of determining the game outcome, conditioned on the structure of the family of winning sets on the one side and the structure of the poset on the other.</description>

      <title>Deep Automated Mechanism Design for Integrating Ad Auction and Allocation in Feed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E-commerce platforms usually present an ordered list, mixed with several organic items and an advertisement, in response to each user's page view request. This list, the outcome of ad auction and allocation processes, directly impacts the platform's ad revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV). Specifically, the ad auction determines which ad is displayed and the corresponding payment, while the ad allocation decides the display positions of the advertisement and organic items. The prevalent methods of segregating the ad auction and allocation into two distinct stages face two problems: 1) Ad auction does not consider externalities, such as the influence of actual display position and context on ad Click-Through Rate (CTR); 2) The ad allocation, which utilizes the auction-winning ad's payment to determine the display position dynamically, fails to maintain incentive compatibility (IC) for the advertisement. For instance, in the auction stage employing the traditional Generalized Second Price (GSP) , even if the winning ad increases its bid, its payment remains unchanged. This implies that the advertisement cannot secure a better position and thus loses the opportunity to achieve higher utility in the subsequent ad allocation stage. Previous research often focused on one of the two stages, neglecting the two-stage problem, which may result in suboptimal outcomes...</description>

      <title>Fair Lotteries for Participatory Budgeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In pursuit of participatory budgeting (PB) outcomes with broader fairness guarantees, we initiate the study of lotteries over discrete PB outcomes. As the projects have heterogeneous costs, the amount spent may not be equal ex ante and ex post. To address this, we develop a technique to bound the amount by which the ex-post spend differs from the ex-ante spend -- the property is termed budget balanced up to one project (BB1). With respect to fairness, we take a best-of-both-worlds perspective, seeking outcomes that are both ex-ante and ex-post fair. Towards this goal, we initiate a study of ex-ante fairness properties in PB, including Individual Fair Share (IFS), Unanimous Fair Share (UFS) and their stronger variants, as well as Group Fair Share (GFS). We show several incompatibility results between these ex-ante fairness notions and existing ex-post concepts based on justified representation. One of our main contributions is a randomized algorithm which simultaneously satisfies ex-ante Strong UFS, ex-post full justified representation (FJR) and ex-post BB1 for PB with binary utilities.</description>
