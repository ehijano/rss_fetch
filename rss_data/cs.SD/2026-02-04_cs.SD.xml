      <title>VividVoice: A Unified Framework for Scene-Aware Visually-Driven Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and define a novel task-Scene-Aware Visually-Driven Speech Synthesis, aimed at addressing the limitations of existing speech generation models in creating immersive auditory experiences that align with the real physical world. To tackle the two core challenges of data scarcity and modality decoupling, we propose VividVoice, a unified generative framework. First, we constructed a large-scale, high-quality hybrid multimodal dataset, Vivid-210K, which, through an innovative programmatic pipeline, establishes a strong correlation between visual scenes, speaker identity, and audio for the first time. Second, we designed a core alignment module, D-MSVA, which leverages a decoupled memory bank architecture and a cross-modal hybrid supervision strategy to achieve fine-grained alignment from visual scenes to timbre and environmental acoustic features. Both subjective and objective experimental results provide strong evidence that VividVoice significantly outperforms existing baseline models in terms of audio fidelity, content clarity, and multimodal consistency. Our demo is available at https://chengyuann.github.io/VividVoice/.</description>

      <title>When Noise Lowers The Loss: Rethinking Likelihood-Based Evaluation in Music Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of music large language models (LLMs) demands robust methods of evaluating output quality, especially in distinguishing high-quality compositions from "garbage music". Curiously, we observe that the standard cross-entropy loss -- a core training metric -- often decrease when models encounter systematically corrupted music, undermining its validity as a standalone quality indicator. To investigate this paradox, we introduce noise injection experiment, where controlled noise signal of varying lengths are injected into musical contexts. We hypothesize that a model's loss reacting positively to these perturbations, specifically a sharp increase ("Peak" area) for short injection, can serve as a proxy for its ability to discern musical integrity. Experiments with MusicGen models in the audio waveform domain confirm that Music LLMs respond more strongly to local, texture-level disruptions than to global semantic corruption. Beyond exposing this bias, our results highlight a new principle: the shape of the loss curve -- rather than its absolute value -- encodes critical information about the quality of the generated content (i.e., model behavior). We envision this profile-based evaluation as a label-free, model-intrinsic framework for assessing musical quality -- opening the door to more principled training objectives and sharper benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Augmentation for Medical Audio Classification: A Preliminary Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical audio classification remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, subtle discriminative features, and substantial intra-class variability, often compounded by class imbalance and limited training data. Synthetic data augmentation has been proposed as a potential strategy to mitigate these constraints; however, prior studies report inconsistent methodological approaches and mixed empirical results. In this preliminary study, we explore the impact of synthetic augmentation on respiratory sound classification using a baseline deep convolutional neural network trained on a moderately imbalanced dataset (73%:27%). Three generative augmentation strategies (variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models) were assessed under controlled experimental conditions. The baseline model without augmentation achieved an F1-score of 0.645. Across individual augmentation strategies, performance gains were not observed, with several configurations demonstrating neutral or degraded classification performance. Only an ensemble of augmented models yielded a modest improvement in F1-score (0.664). These findings suggest that, for medical audio classification, synthetic augmentation may not consistently enhance performance when applied to a standard CNN classifier. Future work should focus on delineating task-specific data characteristics, model-augmentation compatibility, and evaluation frameworks necessary for synthetic augmentation to be effective in medical audio applications.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Music Captioning with Music Metadata LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music captioning, or the task of generating a natural language description of music, is useful for both music understanding and controllable music generation. Training captioning models, however, typically requires high-quality music caption data which is scarce compared to metadata (e.g., genre, mood, etc.). As a result, it is common to use large language models (LLMs) to synthesize captions from metadata to generate training data for captioning models, though this process imposes a fixed stylization and entangles factual information with natural language style. As a more direct approach, we propose metadata-based captioning. We train a metadata prediction model to infer detailed music metadata from audio and then convert it into expressive captions via pre-trained LLMs at inference time. Compared to a strong end-to-end baseline trained on LLM-generated captions derived from metadata, our method: (1) achieves comparable performance in less training time over end-to-end captioners, (2) offers flexibility to easily change stylization post-training, enabling output captions to be tailored to specific stylistic and quality requirements, and (3) can be prompted with audio and partial metadata to enable powerful metadata imputation or in-filling--a common task for organizing music data.</description>

      <title>GRAM: Spatial general-purpose audio representations for real-world environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio foundation models learn general-purpose audio representations that facilitate a wide range of downstream tasks. While the performance of these models has greatly increased for conventional single-channel, dry audio clips, their success in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise is limited. Furthermore, most audio foundation models ignore the spatial dimension of real-world acoustic environments, ruling out tasks involving sound localization. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a general-purpose real-world audio model that employs a multi-channel masked autoencoder to efficiently learn spatial audio representations. We evaluated GRAM and other audio foundation models in a standardized manner on high-quality simulations of naturalistic, spatial acoustic environments as well as recordings of real-world environments and release these two complementary benchmark task suites: NatHEAR and RealSELD. Our results demonstrate that GRAM outperforms all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models on NatHEAR and the clean, single-channel version HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also shows state-of-the-art localization performance in simulated environments and generalizes efficiently to real-world recordings in RealSELD. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advance toward robust spatial audio foundation models for real-world environments.</description>

      <title>PACE: Pretrained Audio Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio is a fundamental modality for analyzing speech, music, and environmental sounds. Although pretrained audio models have significantly advanced audio understanding, they remain fragile in real-world settings where data distributions shift over time. In this work, we present the first systematic benchmark for audio continual learning (CL) with pretrained models (PTMs), together with a comprehensive analysis of its unique challenges. Unlike in vision, where parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has proven effective for CL, directly transferring such strategies to audio leads to poor performance. This stems from a fundamental property of audio backbones: they focus on low-level spectral details rather than structured semantics, causing severe upstream-downstream misalignment. Through extensive empirical study, we identify analytic classifiers with first-session adaptation (FSA) as a promising direction, but also reveal two major limitations: representation saturation in coarse-grained scenarios and representation drift in fine-grained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PACE, a novel method that enhances FSA via a regularized analytic classifier and enables multi-session adaptation through adaptive subspace-orthogonal PEFT for improved semantic alignment. In addition, we introduce spectrogram-based boundary-aware perturbations to mitigate representation overlap and improve stability. Experiments on six diverse audio CL benchmarks demonstrate that PACE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking an important step toward robust and scalable audio continual learning with PTMs.</description>

      <title>CoCoEmo: Composable and Controllable Human-Like Emotional TTS via Activation Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotional expression in human speech is nuanced and compositional, often involving multiple, sometimes conflicting, affective cues that may diverge from linguistic content. In contrast, most expressive text-to-speech systems enforce a single utterance-level emotion, collapsing affective diversity and suppressing mixed or text-emotion-misaligned expression. While activation steering via latent direction vectors offers a promising solution, it remains unclear whether emotion representations are linearly steerable in TTS, where steering should be applied within hybrid TTS architectures, and how such complex emotion behaviors should be evaluated. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of activation steering for emotional control in hybrid TTS models, introducing a quantitative, controllable steering framework, and multi-rater evaluation protocols that enable composable mixed-emotion synthesis and reliable text-emotion mismatch synthesis. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that emotional prosody and expressive variability are primarily synthesized by the TTS language module instead of the flow-matching module, and also provide a lightweight steering approach for generating natural, human-like emotional speech.</description>

      <title>D3PIA: A Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model for Piano Accompaniment Generation From Lead sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating piano accompaniments in the symbolic music domain is a challenging task that requires producing a complete piece of piano music from given melody and chord constraints, such as those provided by a lead sheet. In this paper, we propose a discrete diffusion-based piano accompaniment generation model, D3PIA, leveraging local alignment between lead sheet and accompaniment in piano-roll representation. D3PIA incorporates Neighborhood Attention (NA) to both encode the lead sheet and condition it for predicting note states in the piano accompaniment. This design enhances local contextual modeling by efficiently attending to nearby melody and chord conditions. We evaluate our model using the POP909 dataset, a widely used benchmark for piano accompaniment generation. Objective evaluation results demonstrate that D3PIA preserves chord conditions more faithfully compared to continuous diffusion-based and Transformer-based baselines. Furthermore, a subjective listening test indicates that D3PIA generates more musically coherent accompaniments than the comparison models.</description>

      <title>EarResp-ANS : Audio-Based On-Device Respiration Rate Estimation on Earphones with Adaptive Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Respiratory rate (RR) is a key vital sign for clinical assessment and mental well-being, yet it is rarely monitored in everyday life due to the lack of unobtrusive sensing technologies. In-ear audio sensing is promising due to its high social acceptance and the amplification of physiological sounds caused by the occlusion effect; however, existing approaches often fail under real-world noise or rely on computationally expensive models. We present EarResp-ANS, the first system enabling fully on-device, real-time RR estimation on commercial earphones. The system employs LMS-based adaptive noise suppression (ANS) to attenuate ambient noise while preserving respiration-related acoustic components, without requiring neural networks or audio streaming, thereby explicitly addressing the energy and privacy constraints of wearable devices. We evaluate EarResp-ANS in a study with 18 participants under realistic acoustic conditions, including music, cafeteria noise, and white noise up to 80 dB SPL. EarResp-ANS achieves robust performance with a global MAE of 0.84 CPM , reduced to 0.47 CPM via automatic outlier rejection, while operating with less than 2% processor load directly on the earphone.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Evidence Weighting for Audio-Spatiotemporal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many machine learning systems have access to multiple sources of evidence for the same prediction target, yet these sources often differ in reliability and informativeness across inputs. In bioacoustic classification, species identity may be inferred both from the acoustic signal and from spatiotemporal context such as location and season; while Bayesian inference motivates multiplicative evidence combination, in practice we typically only have access to discriminative predictors rather than calibrated generative models. We introduce \textbf{F}usion under \textbf{IN}dependent \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{H}ypotheses (\textbf{FINCH}), an adaptive log-linear evidence fusion framework that integrates a pre-trained audio classifier with a structured spatiotemporal predictor. FINCH learns a per-sample gating function that estimates the reliability of contextual information from uncertainty and informativeness statistics. The resulting fusion family \emph{contains} the audio-only classifier as a special case and explicitly bounds the influence of contextual evidence, yielding a risk-contained hypothesis class with an interpretable audio-only fallback. Across benchmarks, FINCH consistently outperforms fixed-weight fusion and audio-only baselines, improving robustness and error trade-offs even when contextual information is weak in isolation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on CBI and competitive or improved performance on several subsets of BirdSet using a lightweight, interpretable, evidence-based approach.

      <title>The Alignment Curse: Cross-Modality Jailbreak Transfer in Omni-Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end trained omni-models have significantly improved multimodal understanding. At the same time, safety red-teaming has expanded beyond text to encompass audio-based jailbreak attacks. However, an important bridge between textual and audio jailbreaks remains underexplored. In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming. We further demonstrate strong cross-model transferability and show that text-transferred audio attacks remain effective even under a stricter audio-only access threat model.</description>

      <title>Automated Dysphagia Screening Using Noninvasive Neck Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pharyngeal health plays a vital role in essential human functions such as breathing, swallowing, and vocalization. Early detection of swallowing abnormalities, also known as dysphagia, is crucial for timely intervention. However, current diagnostic methods often rely on radiographic imaging or invasive procedures. In this study, we propose an automated framework for detecting dysphagia using portable and noninvasive acoustic sensing coupled with applied machine learning. By capturing subtle acoustic signals from the neck during swallowing tasks, we aim to identify patterns associated with abnormal physiological conditions. Our approach achieves promising test-time abnormality detection performance, with an AUC-ROC of 0.904 under 5 independent train-test splits. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using noninvasive acoustic sensing as a practical and scalable tool for pharyngeal health monitoring.</description>

      <title>A Multi-decoder Neural Tracking Method for Accurately Predicting Speech Intelligibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: EEG-based methods can predict speech intelligibility, but their accuracy and robustness lag behind behavioral tests, which typically show test-retest differences under 1 dB. We introduce the multi-decoder method to predict speech reception thresholds (SRTs) from EEG recordings, enabling objective assessment for populations unable to perform behavioral tests; such as those with disorders of consciousness or during hearing aid fitting. Approach: The method aggregates data from hundreds of decoders, each trained on different speech features and EEG preprocessing setups to quantify neural tracking (NT) of speech signals. Using data from 39 participants (ages 18-24), we recorded 29 minutes of EEG per person while they listened to speech at six signal-to-noise ratios and a quiet story. NT values were combined into a high-dimensional feature vector per subject, and a support vector regression model was trained to predict SRTs from these vectors. Main Result: Predictions correlated significantly with behavioral SRTs (r = 0.647, p &lt; 0.001; NRMSE = 0.19), with all differences under 1 dB. SHAP analysis showed theta/delta bands and early lags had slightly greater influence. Using pretrained subject-independent decoders reduced required EEG data collection to 15 minutes (3 minutes of story, 12 minutes across six SNR conditions) without losing accuracy.</description>

      <title>VioPTT: Violin Technique-Aware Transcription from Synthetic Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While automatic music transcription is well-established in music information retrieval, most models are limited to transcribing pitch and timing information from audio, and thus omit crucial expressive and instrument-specific nuances. One example is playing technique on the violin, which affords its distinct palette of timbres for maximal emotional impact. Here, we propose VioPTT (Violin Playing Technique-aware Transcription), a lightweight cascade model that directly transcribes violin playing technique in addition to pitch onset and offset. Furthermore, we release MOSA-VPT, a novel, high-quality synthetic violin playing technique dataset to circumvent the need for manually labeled annotations. Leveraging this dataset, our model demonstrated strong generalization to real-world note-level violin technique recordings in addition to achieving state-of-the-art transcription performance. To our knowledge, VioPTT is the first to jointly combine violin transcription and playing technique prediction within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Speech Synthesizers Can Learn from Multiple Teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) is inherently a "one-to-many" mapping characterized by intrinsic uncertainty, yet current paradigms often oversimplify it into a deterministic regression task. While continuous-valued autoregressive (AR) models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to discrete codec-based approaches, they typically rely on a fixed-variance prior, fundamentally constraining generation to a static point estimate that ignores the dynamic variability of natural speech. To bridge this gap, we propose BELLE (Bayesian evidential learning with language modelling), a framework that shifts from deterministic prediction to principled Bayesian inference without increasing model parameters or inference latency. By modeling the acoustic target as a Normal-Inverse-Gamma distribution, BELLE captures data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. To enable accurate variance estimation on standard single-reference datasets, we introduce a "one-to-many" training strategy that leverages synthetic samples as a statistical support set, allowing the model to learn robust distributional properties rather than merely imitating teacher artifacts. Experiments demonstrate that BELLE, trained on only ~5k hours of data, outperforms leading open-source models trained on 50k hours (achieving a 25.8% relative WER reduction) and naturally supports high-quality streaming generation.

      <title>Do Models Hear Like Us? Probing the Representational Alignment of Audio LLMs and Naturalistic EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in integrating speech perception with language understanding. However, whether their internal representations align with human neural dynamics during naturalistic listening remains largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically examine layer-wise representational alignment between 12 open-source Audio LLMs and Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across 2 datasets. Specifically, we employ 8 similarity metrics, such as Spearman-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), to characterize within-sentence representational geometry. Our analysis reveals 3 key findings: (1) we observe a rank-dependence split, in which model rankings vary substantially across different similarity metrics; (2) we identify spatio-temporal alignment patterns characterized by depth-dependent alignment peaks and a pronounced increase in RSA within the 250-500 ms time window, consistent with N400-related neural dynamics; (3) we find an affective dissociation whereby negative prosody, identified using a proposed Tri-modal Neighborhood Consistency (TNC) criterion, reduces geometric similarity while enhancing covariance-based dependence. These findings provide new neurobiological insights into the representational mechanisms of Audio LLMs.</description>

      <title>AlignAtt: Using Attention-based Audio-Translation Alignments as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention is the core mechanism of today's most used architectures for natural language processing and has been analyzed from many perspectives, including its effectiveness for machine translation-related tasks. Among these studies, attention resulted to be a useful source of information to get insights about word alignment also when the input text is substituted with audio segments, as in the case of the speech translation (ST) task. In this paper, we propose AlignAtt, a novel policy for simultaneous ST (SimulST) that exploits the attention information to generate source-target alignments that guide the model during inference. Through experiments on the 8 language pairs of MuST-C v1.0, we show that AlignAtt outperforms previous state-of-the-art SimulST policies applied to offline-trained models with gains in terms of BLEU of 2 points and latency reductions ranging from 0.5s to 0.8s across the 8 languages.</description>

      <title>AudioJailbreak: Jailbreak Attacks against End-to-End Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied recently, but they exclusively focused on the attack scenario where the adversary can fully manipulate user prompts (named strong adversary) and limited in effectiveness, applicability, and practicability. In this work, we first conduct an extensive evaluation showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to-speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AUDIOJAILBREAK, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audios do not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into the perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios is concealed by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating reverberation into the perturbation generation. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, and/or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AUDIOJAILBREAK is also applicable to a more practical and broader attack scenario where the adversary cannot fully manipulate user prompts (named weak adversary). Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AUDIOJAILBREAK, in particular, it can jailbreak openAI's GPT-4o-Audio and bypass Meta's Llama-Guard-3 safeguard, in the weak adversary scenario. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their robustness, especially for the newly proposed weak adversary.</description>

      <title>CodecSlime: Temporal Redundancy Compression of Neural Speech Codec via Dynamic Frame Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have been widely used in audio compression and various downstream tasks. Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which allocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However, speech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result, many tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences. To address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for compressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on neural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and architecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and Melt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When integrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR ($\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to 32% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and similar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also enables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a single model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently outperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates. Audio samples are available at https://acadarmeria.github.io/codecslime/.</description>

      <title>Evaluating High-Resolution Piano Sustain Pedal Depth Estimation with Musically Informed Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluation for continuous piano pedal depth estimation tasks remains incomplete when relying only on conventional frame-level metrics, which overlook musically important features such as direction-change boundaries and pedal curve contours. To provide more interpretable and musically meaningful insights, we propose an evaluation framework that augments standard frame-level metrics with an action-level assessment measuring direction and timing using segments of press/hold/release states and a gesture-level analysis that evaluates contour similarity of each press-release cycle. We apply this framework to compare an audio-only baseline with two variants: one incorporating symbolic information from MIDI, and another trained in a binary-valued setting, all within a unified architecture. Results show that the MIDI-informed model significantly outperforms the others at action and gesture levels, despite modest frame-level gains. These findings demonstrate that our framework captures musically relevant improvements indiscernible by traditional metrics, offering a more practical and effective approach to evaluating pedal depth estimation models.</description>

      <title>Modeling Sarcastic Speech: Semantic and Prosodic Cues in a Speech Synthesis Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sarcasm is a pragmatic phenomenon in which speakers convey meanings that diverge from literal content, relying on an interaction between semantics and prosodic expression. However, how these cues jointly contribute to the recognition of sarcasm remains poorly understood. We propose a computational framework that models sarcasm as the integration of semantic interpretation and prosodic realization. Semantic cues are derived from an LLaMA 3 model fine-tuned to capture discourse-level markers of sarcastic intent, while prosodic cues are extracted through semantically aligned utterances drawn from a database of sarcastic speech, providing prosodic exemplars of sarcastic delivery. Using a speech synthesis testbed, perceptual evaluations demonstrate that both semantic and prosodic cues independently enhance listeners' perception of sarcasm, with the strongest effects emerging when the two are combined. These findings highlight the complementary roles of semantics and prosody in pragmatic interpretation and illustrate how modeling can shed light on the mechanisms underlying sarcastic communication.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation of Piano Dynamics and Metrical Structure with a Multi-task Multi-Scale Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating piano dynamic from audio recordings is a fundamental challenge in computational music analysis. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-task network that jointly predicts dynamic levels, change points, beats, and downbeats from a shared latent representation. These four targets form the metrical structure of dynamics in the music score. Inspired by recent vocal dynamic research, we use a multi-scale network as the backbone, which takes Bark-scale specific loudness as the input feature. Compared to log-Mel as input, this reduces model size from 14.7 M to 0.5 M, enabling long sequential input. We use a 60-second audio length in audio segmentation, which doubled the length of beat tracking commonly used. Evaluated on the public MazurkaBL dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks. This work sets a new benchmark for piano dynamic estimation and delivers a powerful and compact tool, paving the way for large-scale, resource-efficient analysis of musical expression.</description>
