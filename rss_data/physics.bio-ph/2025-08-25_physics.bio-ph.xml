      <title>Multiscale Growth Kinetics of Model Biomolecular Condensates Under Passive and Active Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living cells exhibit a complex organization comprising numerous compartments, among which are RNA- and protein-rich membraneless, liquid-like organelles known as biomolecular condensates. Energy-consuming processes regulate their formation and dissolution, with (de-)phosphorylation by specific enzymes being among the most commonly involved reactions. By employing a model system consisting of a phosphorylatable peptide and homopolymeric RNA, we elucidate how enzymatic activity modulates the growth kinetics and alters the local structure of biomolecular condensates. Under passive condition, time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron source reveals a nucleation-driven coalescence mechanism maintained over four decades in time, similar to the coarsening of simple binary fluid mixtures. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that peptide-decorated RNA chains assembled shortly after mixing constitute the relevant subunits. In contrast, actively-formed condensates initially display a local mass fractal structure, which gradually matures upon enzymatic activity before condensates undergo coalescence. Both types of condensate eventually reach a steady state but fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates a peptide diffusivity twice higher in actively-formed condensates consistently with their loosely-packed local structure. We expect multiscale, integrative approaches implemented with model systems to link effectively the functional properties of membraneless organelles to their formation and dissolution kinetics as regulated by cellular active processes.</description>

      <title>ML-PWS: Estimating the Mutual Information Between Experimental Time Series Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.</description>

      <title>Noisy active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise threads every scale of the natural world. Once dismissed as mere background hiss, it is now recognized as both a currency of information and a source of order in systems driven far from equilibrium. From nanometer-scale motor proteins to meter-scale bird flocks, active collectives harness noise to break symmetry, explore decision landscapes, and poise themselves at the cusp where sensitivity and robustness coexist. We review the physics that underpins this paradox: how energy-consuming feedback rectifies stochastic fluctuations, how multiplicative noise seeds patterns and state transitions, and how living ensembles average the residual errors. Bridging single-molecule calorimetry, critical flocking, and robophysical swarms, we propose a unified view in which noise is not background blur but a tunable resource for adaptation and emergent order in biology and engineered active matter.</description>

      <title>Modelling the impact of synovial fluid elasticity on tangential stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rheological properties of synovial fluid have been observed to substantially impact its lubricating behaviour. While numerous studies have illustrated the importance of its shear-dependent viscosity, the impact of synovial fluid elasticity for oscillatory joint motion is far less characterised. Hence we consider how elasticity impacts the tangential stress, and thus friction, exerted on confining surfaces in rheological models of synovial fluid on the length and time scales of oscillatory joint motion, though in a simplified setting rather than considering the full complexity of a joint. Minor changes in the elastic constitutive equation from a canonical upper convected Oldroyd-B model lead to fundamentally different scalings and predictions for tangential stress compared to either a Newtonian fluid and an Oldroyd-B fluid. In particular, polymer elasticity within physiological fluids is predicted to have a profound effect on friction both within the oscillating joint and more generally, in turn suggesting further examination of synovial fluid elasticity in experimental and modelling studies.</description>

      <title>Objective comparison of methods to decode anomalous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.06766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deviations from Brownian motion leading to anomalous diffusion are found in transport dynamics from quantum physics to life sciences. The characterization of anomalous diffusion from the measurement of an individual trajectory is a challenging task, which traditionally relies on calculating the trajectory mean squared displacement. However, this approach breaks down for cases of practical interest, e.g., short or noisy trajectories, heterogeneous behaviour, or non-ergodic processes. Recently, several new approaches have been proposed, mostly building on the ongoing machine-learning revolution. To perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition, the Anomalous Diffusion challenge (AnDi). Participating teams applied their algorithms to a commonly-defined dataset including diverse conditions. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, machine-learning-based approaches achieved superior performance for all tasks. The discussion of the challenge results provides practical advice for users and a benchmark for developers.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion and Emergent Universality in Coupled Memory-Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how simple local interactions give rise to emergent exploration patterns is a fundamental question in statistical physics. We introduce a minimal model of two coupled agents that avoid retracing their own paths while being attracted to the trails left by one another. This system is inspired by, but not limited to, pheromone-guided insect navigation. The coupling of self-avoidance and attraction generates rich emergent behavior, including distinct anomalous diffusion regimes, non-Gaussian position distributions, and compressed exponential encounter statistics. Most notably, we identify new universality classes for coupled random walks, characterized by unique scaling laws and distributional properties that, to our knowledge, have not been previously reported. These findings advance the theoretical understanding of coupled stochastic processes with memory and interaction feedback, providing a framework for exploring transport phenomena in a broad range of multi-agent systems beyond biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. It is known that environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</description>

      <title>Optical Tweezers as a Tool for Quantitative Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers equipped with position detection allow for application of piconewton-scale forces and high-temporal-resolution measurements of nanometer-scale motion. While typically used for trapping microscopic objects, the optical tweezer detection pathway can also be used for a microscopy technique sensitive to nanometer-sized structures. Optical tweezers most commonly use back-focal-plane detection to determine the position of the trapped object. This technique involves analyzing the interference pattern between scattered and unscattered light. Despite the reliance on interference, we show that an image of an extended object can be understood as a sum of the images of individual point-like particles that make up the object. This allows for optical tweezers with back-focal-plane detection to be used as an imaging tool capable of determining the mass distribution of scanned structures. Furthermore, the sample-orientation-dependent detector response allows for a unique method of background subtraction. We demonstrate the quantitative imaging capabilities of optical tweezer microscopy by determining the size distributions multiple nearby particles and measuring the changing diameter of collagen fibrils. The background subtraction technique is demonstrated by imaging surface-bound microtubules with a strong background from protein aggregate co-adsorption. Optical tweezer microscopy allows for quantitative imaging of objects far from the coverslip surface. This makes it an excellent tool for studying the link between the structure and mechanics of microscopic systems.</description>
