      <title>Assessment of tabulated-chemistry models for lean premixed strained hydrogen flames with low-dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive a priori analysis of tabulated-chemistry models for both laminar and turbulent lean premixed hydrogen flames in strained counterflow configuration. Particular focus is drawn on differential and preferential diffusion effects and the synergistic interaction of thermodiffusive instabilities and turbulence that existing models struggle to capture. Through detailed assessment of various modelling approaches at unfiltered and filtered grids, we identify significant limitations in traditional unstretched flamelet manifolds, particularly their strong filter dependence and systematic reaction rate mispredictions. To address these challenges, we introduce and evaluate novel strained flamelet approaches, including: (1) a one-dimensional manifold constructed from a single strained flamelet that provides computationally efficient and reliable consumption speed predictions at coarser grids, and (2) a two-dimensional manifold combining fixed strain with varying equivalence ratio that demonstrates improved performance in predicting the local reaction rates across multiple grid resolutions. Additionally, we develop a correction methodology derived from laminar simulations that significantly improves consumption speed predictions of unstretched flamelet manifolds in turbulent settings. Unlike previous works, our solutions maintain computational efficiency without increasing manifold dimensionality, keeping memory costs unchanged. These advancements provide guidance for developing reliable LES models that properly account for differential and preferential diffusion and strain effects in practical hydrogen combustion systems.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Hybrid RANS-LES and WALE Formulations for Wake and Resistance Prediction of the BB2 Submarine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submarine hydrodynamics presents unique challenges in accurately predicting flow separation, wake structure, and resistance due to complex geometry and turbulent behaviour at high Reynolds (Re) numbers. Traditional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches are often limited in resolving unsteady flow structures and turbulence in the near and far regions. To address these limitations, hybrid RANS-LES models such as Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) offer improved performance in capturing near-wall vortical structures. The capturing of turbulent vortices and wake structures significantly contributes to conduct hydrodynamic noise analysis. Detailed resolution and understanding of these coherent structures help minimize hydroacoustic signatures, essential for submarines' stealth characteristics. Based on prior studies, Breuer et al. (2003) reported that RANS failed to capture unsteady vortex shedding, producing only steady results even in 3D simulations. In contrast, DES and LES successfully resolved asymmetric shedding across different grid resolutions. Spalart (2009) reported that DES is more effective than RANS or LES for high Re flows, although it suffers from challenges related to ambiguous grids and nonmonotonic grid refinement behaviour. Whereas Liang \&amp; Xue (2014) found that DES predicts tip vortex flow characteristics more accurately than RANS-SA and can capture complex 3D vortex structures. In addition, Guilmineau et al. (2018) demonstrated that the IDDES model accurately predicts recirculation bubbles and aligns more closely with experimental data for flow prediction. Long et al. (2021) confirmed the capability of DDES in simulating cavitating flows around hydrofoils and marine propellers. Lungu (2022) highlighted the efficiency and accuracy of the hybrid IDDES-SST model in DARPA submarine simulations. Zhang et al. (2023) also noted that URANS struggles with resolving small-scale turbulence structures, whereas IDDES is better suited for predicting complex phenomena such as ship air wake asymmetry. Nevertheless, capturing the unsteadiness and turbulence fluctuations scales is extremely challenging because the cell size requirements should suit each turbulence model employed. Thus, as a continuation of the prior work of Abidin et al. (2024), the unsteady simulation with high mesh resolution at $U_m=1.8235$ m/s and Re of $3.6\times 10^6$ to generate the asymmetrical wake dynamic and vortical structure. The current research expands the methodology by parameterizing the meshes and numerical scheme based on Taylor microscale refinement with respect to the characteristic length of (L, B and D) of submarine, particularly focusing on hybrid turbulence model and WALE to observe the ability to resolve turbulence in the wake region. The transient simulations were performed initially using wall-resolved mesh (76x10^6 cells) at y^+ &lt; 5 and then wall-modelled mesh (56x10^6 to 74x10^6 cells) at y^+ &gt; 30, which produced notably different and more detailed results (vortices and turbulence fluctuation) than previous steady-state RANS simulations without risking the accuracy of quantity of interest (global resistance).</description>

      <title>Rational Compact Modeling of Transient Forced Laminar Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although transient convection is ubiquitous in natural and manmade phenomena, few research works attempted to make a compact model for it, altogether, others attempted a compact model that contradicts problem physics. The correct modelling pattern is deduced here analytically for a simple geometry, but it can readily be used for many common applications such as the transient heating of an evacuated solar tube due to temporary cloud shading or for a more precise model of transient building wall heating in a zero-energy building approach. As opposed to detailed model, which is based on the governing PDE with a fixed and rigid boundary and initial conditions, usually solved numerically, aiming at obtaining temperatures everywhere and at any time for a prescribed boundary and initial conditions, the compact model on the contrary is based on a few simple equations, and aims at giving directly the relation between heat flux and the temperature difference producing it, for any boundary and initial conditions. For transient convection prevails as of today an unphysical approach consisting of modeling it by using a time variant thermal resistance. In this work, starting from the energy PDE, applied to a simple but typical transient forced convection problem, we will get analytically the correct modelling pattern. This has two main advantages: It replaces the classical unphysical approach, with a pair of time constants, one for each important temperature (the fluid bulk and that near the wall), which has an evident physical meaning and can be readily extended to more complex geometries. In contrast with the time varying resistance model, one and the same model as deduced here can be reused for any arbitrary time varying function of the input heat flux. Model validation was made by comparing with a fully blown CFD simulation.</description>

      <title>The relationship between surface features and sub-surface turbulence: simulations and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows close beneath a free water surface are of central importance in the Earth system, yet remain relatively little studied with many open questions. We study the degree of correlation between surface motion and sub-surface velocities, comparing data from direct numerical simulation to a new experimental setup where the free-surface motion and sub-surface velocity field are measured simultaneously in a jet-stirred tank. A previous study showed a close correlation between the time series of mean-square surface divergence and the surface features (Babiker \&amp; al., 2023 \emph{J.~Fluid Mech.} {\bf 964}, R2); we find that the normalised cross-correlation between mean-square horizontal divergence at vertical position $z$ ($\beta(z)=\partial_xu+\partial_yv$, with $z$ the vertical coordinate and $u,v$ the velocity in horizontal directions $x,y$, respectively) and relative surface area covered by persistent surface features (`dimples' and `scars') decreases slowly with depth but remains significant even two integral scales beneath the surface. Although turbulent Reynolds numbers differ by an order of magnitude between simulation and experiment, the same scaling and behaviour is found for all quantities we consider when scaled by the integral scale. Our results demonstrate that although surface-to-bulk correlations may appear weak when covariance between surface and velocity quantities is made point-to-point for the full surface, conditional quantities guided by visible surface features can yield significant information about the largest, most energetic flow events even beyond the blockage layer.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of small bubbles in turbulence in non-dilute conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows laden with small bubbles are ubiquitous in many natural and industrial environments. From the point of view of numerical modeling, to be able to handle a very large number of small bubbles in direct numerical simulations, one traditionally relies on the one-way coupling paradigm. There, bubbles are passively advected and are non-interacting, implicitly assuming dilute conditions. Here, we study bubbles that are four-way coupled, where both the feedback on the fluid and excluded-volume interactions between bubbles are taken into account. We find that, while the back-reaction from the bubble phase onto the fluid phase remains energetically small under most circumstances, the excluded-volume interactions between bubbles can have a significant influence on the Lagrangian statistics of the bubble dynamics. We show that as the volume fraction of bubbles increases, the preferential concentration of bubbles in filamentary high-vorticity regions decreases as these strong vortical structures get filled up; this happens at a volume fraction of around one percent for $\textrm{Re}_\lambda=O(10^2)$. We furthermore study the influence on the Lagrangian velocity structure function as well as pair dispersion, and find that, while the mean dispersive behavior remains close to that obtained from one-way coupling simulations, some evident signatures of bubble collisions can be retrieved from the structure functions and the distribution of the dispersion, even at very small volume fractions. This work not only teaches us about the circumstances under which four-way coupling becomes important, but also opens up new directions towards probing and ultimately manipulating coherent vortical structures in small-scale turbulence using bubbles.</description>

      <title>Consistent kinetic modeling of compressible flows with variable Prandtl numbers: Double-distribution quasi-equilibrium approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A consistent kinetic modeling and discretization strategy for compressible flows across all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios is developed using the quasi-equilibrium approach within two of the most widely used double-distribution frameworks. The methodology ensures accurate recovery of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, including all macroscopic moments and dissipation rates, through detailed hydrodynamic limit analysis and careful construction of equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium attractors. Discretization is performed using high-order velocity lattices with a static reference frame in a discrete velocity Boltzmann context to isolate key modeling aspects such as the necessary requirements on expansion and quadrature orders. The proposed models demonstrate high accuracy, numerical stability and Galilean invariance across a wide range of Mach numbers and temperature ratios. Separate tests for strict conservation and measurements of all dissipation rates confirm these insights for all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios. Simulations on a sensitive two-dimensional shock-vortex interaction excellently reproduce viscous Navier-Stokes-Fourier-level physics. The proposed models establish an accurate, efficient and scalable framework for kinetic simulations of compressible flows with moderate supersonic speeds and discontinuities at arbitrary Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios, offering a valuable tool for studying complex problems in fluid dynamics and paving the way for future extensions to the lattice Boltzmann context, by application of correction terms, as well as high-Mach and hypersonic regimes, employing target-designed reference frames.</description>

      <title>Stability of surfactant-laden double-layered viscoelastic fluids flowing over an inclined plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear dynamics and instability mechanisms of double-layered weakly viscoelastic fluid flowing over an inclined plane are analyzed in the presence of insoluble surfactant at both the free surface and interface. The constitutive equation of the non-Newtonian flow field follows the rheological property of Walters' $B^{''}$ model. The Orr-Sommerfeld-type boundary value problem is derived using the classical normal-mode approach and numerically solved within the framework of the Chebyshev spectral collocation method. Numerical analysis detects three distinct types of instabilities: surface, interface, and interface surfactant modes. The viscoelasticity of both the top and bottom layers strengthens the surface wave instability in the longwave region. On the other hand, the behavior of interfacial wave instability depends on both viscosity and density stratification. Stronger top-layer viscoelasticity suppresses interfacial instability, while increased bottom-layer viscoelasticity amplifies it, provided the viscosity ratio $m&gt;1$. However, in the case of $m&lt;1$, top-layer viscoelasticity provides strong interfacial wave stabilization in the longwave region but becomes comparatively weak in the shortwave regime. The viscoelasticity of the bottom layer has a destabilizing/stabilizing effect on the interfacial wave in the longwave/shortwave regions. Meanwhile, top-layer viscoelasticity stabilizes the interfacial surfactant mode. However, this mode can be destabilized in the vicinity of the instability threshold but is effectively stabilized far away from the onset of instability by higher bottom-layer viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Physical significance of artificial numerical noise in direct numerical simulation of turbulence"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Liao and Qin [J. Fluid Mech. 1008, R2 (2025)] claimed that numerical noise in direct numerical simulation of turbulence using the deterministic Navier-Stokes equations is "approximately equivalent" to the physical noise arising from random molecular motion (thermal fluctuations). We show here that it this claim not supported by their results and that it contradicts other results in the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the numerical implementation of thermal fluctuations in their so-called "clean numerical simulations" is incorrect.</description>

      <title>Wind Farm Dynamics over a Diurnal Cycle: Analysis of a Comprehensive Large Eddy Simulation, Web-Services Accessible Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheric boundary layer undergoes significant changes throughout a diurnal cycle, affecting wind turbine performance and wakes in wind farms. Wind farm Large Eddy Simulations (LES) under such conditions provide rich datasets to study the underlying dynamics and identify important trends. Here, we describe a comprehensive open dataset generated using LES of an 8-turbine wind farm consisting of four rows of two turbines. To avoid specifying either prescribed surface temperature or heat flux, a local 1D soil heat conduction model is used with time-periodic solar surface heating, coupled to LES. After several days of low-resolution LES, an approximately time periodic behavior is achieved, after which high-resolution LES is continued during a 24-hour period. Analysis of the LES data reveals that wind turbine wakes have a significant impact on the temperature field and spatial surface heat flux patterns and exhibiting increased surface temperature behind the wind farm at night under the specific conditions of the simulation (dry unvegetated soil, clear sky). We observe that for a few morning hours the first row of wind turbines generates less power compared to the last row. Detailed analyses of the data using innovative web-services facilitated data access tools reveal that during the morning transition, the presence of a low-level jet and the wind farm blockage effect combine to cause cooling and a reduction in wind speed at hub height upstream of the wind farm. In addition, larger turbulence levels exist downstream in the wind farm, explaining the larger power production of downstream turbines.</description>

      <title>On the existence of fibered three-dimensional perfect fluid equilibria without continuous Euclidean symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02955v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following Lortz, we construct a family of smooth steady states of the ideal, incompressible Euler equation in three dimensions that possess no continuous Euclidean symmetry. As in Lortz, they do possess a planar reflection symmetry and, as such, all the orbits of the velocity are closed. Different from Lortz, our construction has a discrete m-fold symmetry and is foliated by invariant cylindrical level sets of a non-degenerate Bernoulli pressure. Such examples narrow the scope of validity of Grad's conjecture that the only solutions with a continuous symmetry can be fibered by pressure surfaces.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural-operator Predictive Control for Drag Reduction in Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing turbulence control effects for wall friction numerically is a significant challenge since it requires expensive simulations of turbulent fluid dynamics. We instead propose an efficient deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for modeling and control of turbulent flows. It is model-based RL for predictive control (PC), where both the policy and the observer models for turbulence control are learned jointly using Physics Informed Neural Operators (PINO), which are discretization invariant and can capture fine scales in turbulent flows accurately. Our PINO-PC outperforms prior model-free reinforcement learning methods in various challenging scenarios where the flows are of high Reynolds numbers and unseen, i.e., not provided during model training. We find that PINO-PC achieves a drag reduction of 39.0\% under a bulk-velocity Reynolds number of 15,000, outperforming previous fluid control methods by more than 32\%.</description>

      <title>FoilDiff: A Hybrid Transformer Backbone for Diffusion-based Modelling of 2D Airfoil Flow Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of flow fields around airfoils is crucial for aerodynamic design and optimisation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</description>

      <title>Numerical Demonstration of Kolmogorov Scaling in Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two leading models of isotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence have competing predictions: $k^{-5/3}$ (Kolmogorov) and $k^{-3/2}$ (Iroshnikov-Kraichnan) scalings. This paper identifies the valid MHD turbulence model using high-resolution numerical and diagnostics-structure functions, intermittency exponents, and energy spectra and fluxes of imbalance MHD. The energy spectra of our forced MHD simulations on $8192^2$, $4096^2$, $1024^3$, and $512^3$ support Kolmogorov's k^{-5/3} spectrum over Iroshnikov-Kraichnan's k^{-3/2} spectrum, but the difference in the spectral exponents is small. However, the numerically computed third-order structure functions and intermittency exponents support Kolmogorov scaling in both two and three dimensions. Also, the energy fluxes of the imbalance MHD follow the predictions of Kolmogorov scaling. These results would help in better modelling of solar wind, solar corona, and dynamos.</description>

      <title>Modeling the dynamics of an oil drop driven by a surface acoustic wave in the underlying substrate</title>

Abstract: We present a theoretical study, supported by simulations and experiments, on the spreading of a silicone oil drop under MHz-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) excitation in the underlying solid substrate. Our time-dependent theoretical model uses the long wave approach and considers interactions between fluid dynamics and acoustic driving. While similar methods have analyzed micron-scale oil and water film dynamics under SAW excitation, acoustic forcing was linked to boundary layer flow, specifically Schlichting and Rayleigh streaming, and acoustic radiation pressure. For the macroscopic drops in this study, acoustic forcing arises from Reynolds stress variations in the liquid due to changes in the intensity of the acoustic field leaking from the SAW beneath the drop and the viscous dissipation of the leaked wave. Contributions from Schlichting and Rayleigh streaming are negligible in this case. Both experiments and simulations show that after an initial phase where the oil drop deforms to accommodate acoustic stress, it accelerates, achieving nearly constant speed over time, leaving a thin wetting layer. Our model indicates that the steady speed of the drop results from the quasi-steady shape of its body. The drop speed depends on drop size and SAW intensity. Its steady shape and speed are further clarified by a simplified traveling wave-type model that highlights various physical effects. Although the agreement between experiment and theory on drop speed is qualitative, the results' trend regarding SAW amplitude variations suggests that the model realistically incorporates the primary physical effects driving drop dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an oscillatory boundary layer over a sediment bed in Euler-Lagrange simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an oscillatory boundary layer developing over a bed of collisional and freely evolving sediment grains. We perform Euler-Lagrange simulations at Reynolds numbers $\mathrm{Re}_\delta= 200$, 400, and 800, density ratio $\rho_p/\rho_f = 2.65$, Galileo number $\mathrm{Ga} = 51.9$, maximum Shields numbers from $5.60 \times 10^{-2}$ to $2.43 \times 10^{-1}$, based on smooth wall configuration, and Keulegan-Carpenter number from $134.5$ to $538.0$. We show that the dynamics of the oscillatory boundary layer and sediment bed are strongly coupled due to two mechanisms: (I) bed permeability, which leads to flow penetration deep inside the sediment layer, a slip velocity at the bed-fluid interface, and the expansion of the boundary layer, and (II) particle motion, which leads to rolling-grain ripples at $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 400$ and $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 800$. While at $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 200$ the sediment bed remains static during the entire cycle, the permeability of the bed-fluid interface causes a thickening of the boundary layer. With increasing $\mathrm{Re}_\delta$, the particles become mobile, which leads to rolling-grain ripples at $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 400$ and suspended sediment at $\mathrm{Re}_\delta = 800$. Due to their feedback force on the fluid, the mobile sediment particles cause greater velocity fluctuations in the fluid. Flow penetration causes a progressive alteration of the fluid velocity gradient near the bed interface, which reduces the Shields number based upon bed shear stress.</description>

      <title>Chaotic advection in a steady three-dimensional MHD flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the 3D stationary flow of a weakly conducting fluid in a cubic cavity, driven by the Lorentz force created by two permanent magnets and a weak constant current. Our goal is to determine the conditions leading to efficient mixing within the cavity. The flow is composed of a large recirculation cell created by one side magnet, superposed to two recirculation cells created by a central magnet perpendicular to the first one. The overall structure of this flow, obtained here by solving the Stokes equations with Lorentz forcing, is similar to the tri-cellular model flow studied by Toussaint et. al. (Phys. Fluids. 7, 1995). Chaotic advection in this flow is analyzed by means of Poincar\'e sections, Lyapunov exponents and expansion entropies. In addition, we quantify the quality of mixing by computing contamination rates, homogeneity, as well as mixing times. Though individual vortices have poor mixing properties, the superposition of both flows creates chaotic streamlines and efficient mixing.</description>

      <title>ZipGAN: Super-Resolution-based Generative Adversarial Network Framework for Data Compression of Direct Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of high-performance computing has enabled the generation of large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of turbulent flows, driving the need for efficient compression/decompression techniques that reduce storage demands while maintaining fidelity. Traditional methods, such as the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), cannot achieve compression ratios of 8 or higher for complex turbulent flows without introducing significant encoding/decoding errors. On the other hand, a super-resolution-based generative adversarial network (SR-GAN), called ZipGAN, can accurately reconstruct fine-scale features, preserving velocity gradients and structural details, even at a compression ratio of 512, thanks to the more efficient representation of the data in a compact latent space. Additional benefits are ascribed to adversarial training. The high GAN training time is significantly reduced with a progressive transfer learning approach and, once trained, they can be applied independently of the Reynolds number. It is demonstrated that ZipGAN can enhance dataset temporal resolution without additional simulation overhead by generating high-quality intermediate fields from compressed snapshots. The ZipGAN discriminator can reliably evaluate the quality of decoded fields, ensuring fidelity even in the absence of original DNS fields. Hence, ZipGAN compression/decompression method presents a highly efficient and scalable alternative for large-scale DNS storage and transfer, offering substantial advantages over the DWT methods in terms of compression efficiency, reconstruction fidelity, and temporal resolution enhancement.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a compressible gas injected into a confined porous layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underground gas storage is a critical technology in global efforts to mitigate climate change. In particular, hydrogen storage offers a promising solution for integrating renewable energy into the power grid. When injected into the subsurface, hydrogen's low viscosity compared to the resident brine causes a bubble of hydrogen trapped beneath caprock to spread rapidly into an aquifer through release of a thin gas layer above the brine, complicating recovery. In long aquifers, the large viscous pressure drop between source and outlet induces significant pressure variations, potentially leading to substantial density changes in the injected gas. To examine the role of gas compressibility in the spreading dynamics, we use long-wave theory to derive coupled nonlinear evolution equations for the gas pressure and gas/liquid interface height, focusing on the limit of long domains, weak gas compressibility and low gas/liquid viscosity ratio. Simulations are supplemented with a comprehensive asymptotic analysis of parameter regimes. Unlike the near-incompressible limit, in which gas spreading rates are dictated by the source strength and viscosity ratio, and compressive effects are transient, we show how compression of the main gas bubble can generate dynamic pressure changes that are coupled to those in the thin gas layer that spreads over the liquid, with compressive effects having a sustained influence along the layer. This coupling allows compressibility to reduce spreading rates and gas pressures. We characterise this behaviour via a set of low-order models that reveal dominant scalings, highlighting the role of compressibility in mediating the evolution of the gas layer.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear input-output analysis of transitional shear flows using small-signal finite-gain $\mathcal{L}_p$ stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This SSFG Lp stability theorem can predict permissible forcing amplitudes below which a finite nonlinear input-output gain can be maintained. Our analysis employs Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) and Sum-of-Squares (SOS) as the primary tools to search for a quadratic Lyapunov function of an unforced nonlinear system. The resulting Lyapunov function can certify the SSFG Lp stability of a nonlinear input-output system. We demonstrate the applicability of the SSFG Lp stability theorem using a nine-mode shear flow model with a random body force. The predicted nonlinear input-output Lp gain is consistent with numerical simulations; the Lp norm of the output from numerical simulations remains bounded by the theoretical prediction from SSFG Lp stability theorem, with the gap between simulated and theoretical bounds narrowing as $p \rightarrow \infty$. The input-output gain obtained from the nonlinear SSFG Lp stability theorem is higher than the linear Lp gain. Both nonlinear Lp gain and linear Lp gain are valid for each $p\in [1,\infty]$, and such generalizability leads to much higher upper bounds on input-output gain than those predicted by linear L2 gain. The SSFG Lp stability theorem requires the input forcing to be smaller than a permissible forcing amplitude to maintain finite input-output gain, which is an inherently nonlinear behavior that cannot be predicted by linear input-output analysis. We also identify such permissible forcing amplitude using numerical simulations and bisection search, where below such forcing amplitude the output norm at any time will be lower than a given threshold value. The permissible forcing amplitude identified from the SSFG Lp stability theorem is conservative but also consistent with that obtained by numerical simulations and bisection search.</description>

      <title>Impact of porous media heterogeneity on convective mixing in a Rayleigh-B\'enard instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the effect of the heterogeneity of a porous medium on convective mixing. We consider a system where a Rayleigh-B\'enard instability is triggered by a temperature difference between the top and bottom boundaries. Heterogeneity is represented by multi-Gaussian log-normally distributed permeability fields. We explore the effect of the Rayleigh number, the variance and correlation length of the log-permeability field on the fingering patterns, heat flux, mixing state and flow structure. Heat flux increases for all heterogeneous cases compared to the homogeneous ones. When heterogeneity is weak and the horizontal correlation length small, flux exhibits minimal sensitivity to the variance of the log-permeability. When the correlation length increases, flux increases proportionally to the log-permeability variance. The mixing state is evaluated through the temperature variance and the intensity of segregation. Both take higher values, compared to their homogeneous analogues, when the correlation length and the variance of the permeability are increased. This indicates that even if heat flux increases, the system is less well mixed. The flow structure shows that in homogeneous and weakly heterogeneous cases there is a relation between the location of high strain rate and stagnation point, while for strongly heterogeneous cases, high strain rate zones are linked to high permeability areas near the boundaries, where temperature plume originate. The interface width tends to decrease as the variance and the correlation length of the permeability field are augmented, suggesting that the interface undergoes a higher stretching in heterogeneous porous media.</description>
