      <title>Hierarchical Interferometric Bayesian Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) achieves the highest angular resolution in astronomy. VLBI measures corrupted Fourier components, known as visibilities. Reconstructing on-sky images from these visibilities is a challenging inverse problem, particularly for sparse arrays such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), where incomplete sampling and severe calibration errors introduce significant uncertainty in the image. To help guide convergence and control the uncertainty in image reconstructions, regularization on the space of images is utilized, such as enforcing smoothness or similarity to a fiducial image. Coupled with this regularization is the introduction of a new set of parameters that modulate its strength. We present a hierarchical Bayesian imaging approach (Hierarchical Interferometric Bayesian Imaging, HIBI) that enables the quantification of uncertainty for al parameters. Incorporating instrumental effects within HIBI is straightforward, allowing for simultaneous imaging and calibration of data. To showcase HIBI's effectiveness and flexibility, we build a simple imaging model based on Markov random fields and demonstrate how different physical components can be included, e.g., black hole shadow size, and their uncertainties can be inferred. For example, while the original EHT publications were unable to constrain the ring width of M87*, HIBI measures a width of $9.3\pm 1.3\,\mu{\rm as}$. We apply HIBI to image and calibrate EHT synthetic data, real EHT observations of M87*, and multifrequency observations of \oj287. Across these tests, HIBI accurately recovers a wide variety of image structures and quantifies their uncertainties. HIBI is publicly available in the Comrade.jl VLBI software repository.</description>

      <title>The Northern High Time Resolution Universe pulsar survey -- II. Single-pulse search set-up and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey is an all-sky survey looking for pulsars and other radio transients. A new single-pulse (SP) search pipeline is presented, tailored to the northern part of the HTRU survey collected with the 100m Effelsberg Radio Telescope. In a selection of this data, synthetic SPs are injected with frequency-time structures resembling those of the detected Fast Radio Burst (FRB) population and processed by the pipeline to characterize its performance. Therefore, several new software toolkits have been developed (FRBfaker and RFIbye) to enable the injection of SPs with complex frequency-time structures and cope with the Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in the survey's data. The operation of these toolkits is described alongside the overall functionality of the SP pipeline. Qualification of the pipeline confirmed that it is ready to process all the HTRU-North data. Additionally, the survey's sensitivity to SPs, the impact of RFI thereon, the performance of the deep-learning classifier FETCH, and some insights that may be used to improve the pipeline's performance in the future are determined. Within the small data sample analysed, 21 known pulsars and a RRAT are detected. In addition, eight faint SP trains that might originate from yet undiscovered neutron stars and 141 isolated SP candidates were discovered.</description>

      <title>A Deep Multimodal Multi--Head Neural Network for Joint Estimation of Stellar Age, Lifetime, and Evolutionary Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of stellar parameters -- stellar age, lifetime, and evolutionary stage -- remains a fundamental challenge in astrophysics. We introduce a hybrid deep learning architecture combining multimodal spectroscopic and photometric data from SDSS DR17. The model comprises a Multi-Layer Perceptron for numerical features and a CNN with a Vision Transformer for spectra, with three output heads for age, lifetime, and evolutionary stage prediction. Training labels are derived from MIST v1.2 isochrones, with evolutionary stage binned into five classes (Hot, Medium, Cool, Subgiant, Red Giant). We conduct multi-phase evaluation: Phase I explores model architectures and data balancing strategies, Phase II tunes architectural complexity, and Phase III optimizes the multi-task loss composition. The final model achieves a balance between precision (Age RMSE 0.093 in $\log(\mathrm{yrs})$) and physical realism. Monte Carlo Dropout confirms well-calibrated uncertainties, enabling meaningful astrophysical interpretation and establishing a new benchmark for multimodal stellar parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Synthesis imaging with a lunar orbit array: I. global sky map and its systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based radio astronomical observation at frequencies below 30 MHz is hampered by the Ionosphere and radio frequency interference (RFI). The Discovering Sky at the Longest wavelength (DSL) mission, also known as the Hongmeng mission, employs a linear array of satellites on a circular orbit around the Moon to make interferometric observations in this band. Though vastly different from the usual ground-based arrays, the interferometric visibility data collected by such an array is linearly related to the sky map, and the reconstruction is in principle an inversion problem of linear mapping. In this paper, we investigate a number of issues in the algorithm of global map reconstruction, focusing on the impact of sub-pixel noise induced by the finite pixelization of the sky, and errors due to regularization. We find that in the reconstruction process, if one builds up the beam matrix, which relates the sky pixels to the visibilities, by naively evaluating its elements at each of the pixel centers, then the sub-pixel noise can give rise to a significant aliasing effect. However, this effect can be effectively mitigated by a simple pixel-averaging method. Based on evaluation of the image quality using the correlation coefficient between the input and reconstructed map, and the signal-to-noise ratio, we discuss the selection strategy of the regularization parameter, and show that the sky can be well reconstructed with a reasonable choice of the regularization parameter.</description>

      <title>TDLight: A Framework for Incremental Light Curve Management and Smart Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of time-domain surveys, the volume of light curves has increased rapidly. However, many survey projects, such as Gaia, still rely on offline batch-processing workflows in which data are calibrated, merged, and released only after an observing phase is completed. This latency delays scientific analysis and causes many high-value transient events to be buried in archival data, missing the window for timely follow-up. While existing alert brokers handle heterogeneous data streams, it remains difficult to deploy a unified framework that combines high-performance incremental storage with real-time classification on local infrastructure. To address this challenge, we propose TDLight, a scalable system that adapts the time-series database TDengine (a high-performance IoT database) for astronomical data using a one-table-per-source schema. This architecture supports high-throughput ingestion, achieving 954,000 rows s^-1 for archived data and 541,000 rows s^-1 for incremental streams, while Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix) indexing enables efficient cone-search queries. Building on this storage layer, we integrate the pre-trained hierarchical Random Forest classifier from the LEAVES framework to construct an incremental classification pipeline. Using the LEAVES dataset, we simulate data accumulation and evaluate a trigger-based strategy that performs early classification at specific observational milestones. In addition, by monitoring the evolution of classification probabilities, the system identifies "high-value candidates" -- sources that show high early confidence but later undergo significant label shifts. TDLight is released as an open-source Dockerized environment, providing a deployable infrastructure for next-generation time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fast Radio Transient Detection with Mask R-CNN Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, fast radio transient searches are conducted on dedispersed time series using thresholding techniques based on the statistical properties of the data. However, peaks in dedispersed time series do not directly provide information on the nature of the source. In the DM-time domain, the S/N variation of real, dispersed astrophysical signals forms a characteristic bow tie shape, whereas radio frequency interference (RFI) can take multiple different forms. We have developed a method that bypasses the thresholding step of traditional single-pulse searches in favour of a direct DM-time domain image analysis. The backbone of our pipeline is a Mask R-CNN, a deep learning model designed for object detection, enabling it to identify the bow tie signature and distinguish real sources from RFI. Previous deep learning models often include a snippet of the DM-time domain in their input. We have trained the model on simulated bursts injected on top of real MeerKAT noise observations. We tested the model on MeerKAT follow-up observations of the repeater FRB20240114A and we were able to recover all bursts with a signal-to-noise above the traditional threshold, while detecting two bursts that were fainter. Our new approach considerably reduces the number of candidates above a nominal threshold while being capable of running in real time for typical surveys. We also propose a modified version of the traditional dedispersion plan optimised for this method.</description>

      <title>A search for photometric variability towards the globular cluster M3 with the TWenty Inch Survey Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the commissioning results and first scientific observations from the newly installed TWIST observatory - a 50 cm telescope equipped with an sCMOS camera providing a $36.1\times24.1$ arcmin$^2$ field of view - housed in the former SuperWASP-North enclosure. We conducted a 67-night, 199-day baseline white-light monitoring campaign centred on the globular cluster M3 aimed at characterizing stellar variability within the cluster while also assessing the photometric performance of the newly commissioned system. We report the discovery of four new SX Phoenicis variables (V301-304), confirm their cluster membership, and identify fundamental-mode pulsation in one, allowing an independent period-luminosity-based distance estimate to M3. We revisited 231 previously known RR Lyrae stars, providing updated period measurements for 203 and white-light amplitudes for 198. We detected Blazhko-like modulation in 53 stars and characterized the modulation parameters for 28. Notably, we measure periods and amplitudes for the unclassified variables V286 and V287 for the first time. We also identify three foreground flaring M dwarfs, and assess the feasibility of detecting microlensing events in M3, concluding that expected rates are negligible. Alongside the scientific results, we introduce a new correction technique for flat-field images affected by scattered light and present a full characterization of the observatory's photometric capabilities. These results demonstrate the scientific utility of TWIST for high-cadence time-domain surveys using modest-aperture instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Classification of Transient Astronomical Object Light Curves Using LSTM Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for classifying transient astronomical object light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) dataset. The original fourteen object classes were reorganized into five generalized categories (S-Like, Fast, Long, Periodic, and Non-Periodic) to address class imbalance. After preprocessing with padding, temporal rescaling, and flux normalization, a bidirectional LSTM network with masking layers was trained and evaluated on a test set of 19,920 objects. The model achieved strong performance for S-Like and Periodic classes, with ROC area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.95 and 0.99, and Precision-Recall AUC values of 0.98 and 0.89, respectively. However, performance was significantly lower for Fast and Long classes (ROC AUC of 0.68 for Long class), and the model exhibited difficulty distinguishing between Periodic and Non-Periodic objects. Evaluation on partial light curve data (5, 10,and 20 days from detection) revealed substantial performance degradation, with increased misclassification toward the S-Like class. These findings indicate that class imbalance and limited temporal information are primary limitations, suggesting that class balancing strategies and preprocessing techniques focusing on detection moments could improve performance.</description>

      <title>Vision-Guided Optic Flow Navigation for Small Lunar Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Private lunar missions are faced with the challenge of robust autonomous navigation while operating under stringent constraints on mass, power, and computational resources. This work proposes a motion-field inversion framework that uses optical flow and rangefinder-based depth estimation as a lightweight CPU-based solution for egomotion estimation during lunar descent. We extend classical optical flow formulations by integrating them with depth modeling strategies tailored to the geometry for lunar/planetary approach, descent, and landing, specifically, planar and spherical terrain approximations parameterized by a laser rangefinder. Motion field inversion is performed through a least-squares framework, using sparse optical flow features extracted via the pyramidal Lucas-Kanade algorithm. We verify our approach using synthetically generated lunar images over the challenging terrain of the lunar south pole, using CPU budgets compatible with small lunar landers. The results demonstrate accurate velocity estimation from approach to landing, with sub-10% error for complex terrain and on the order of 1% for more typical terrain, as well as performances suitable for real-time applications. This framework shows promise for enabling robust, lightweight on-board navigation for small lunar missions.</description>

      <title>Wave Front Sensing demodulated at the difference frequency between two phase-modulation sidebands in a compound interferometer configuration for a gravitational-wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise alignment sensing and control are essential for maintaining the stability of laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, "Phase-Modulated-sideband $\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing" (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieved stable interferometer locking for over one hour. These results demonstrate that PMPMWFS offers an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>JWST COMPASS: Insights into the Systematic Noise Properties of NIRSpec/G395H From a Uniform Reanalysis of Seven Transmission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has already observed near-infrared transmission spectra of over a dozen super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. While some observations have allowed astronomers to characterize sub-Neptunes in unprecedented detail, small feature amplitudes and poorly-understood systematics have led to ambiguous results for others. Using the first seven targets from the COMPASS program, which is currently surveying 12 small planet atmospheres using NIRSpec/G395H, we investigate these timeseries systematics. We implement a model that uses the principle components of the normalized pixel fluxes to account for variations in the shape and position of the spectral trace. We find that observations with a smaller number of groups-per-integration benefit most profoundly from the use of this model, and that systematics are particularly strong between 2.8 and 3.5 $\mu$m. Despite these systematics, \texttt{pandexo} is a relatively accurate predictor of the precision of the spectra, with real error bars on average 5\% larger in NRS1 and 12\% larger in NRS2 than predicted. We compute new limits on metallicity and opaque pressure level for each target and compare these to previous results from the COMPASS program. Next, we co-add spectra from multiple targets to reduce the effective noise in the combined spectra in hopes of detecting transmission features in common between the targets, but this exercise does not yield compelling evidence any signals. We find that a handful of additional transits are sufficient to break the degeneracy between metallicity and aerosols for the majority of our targets, pointing towards the possibility of unraveling the mysteries of these worlds with future allocations of JWST time.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian statistical analysis of 897 pulsar flux density spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive re-evaluation of pulsar radio spectra using the largest curated dataset of calibrated flux densities to date, comprising 897 pulsars, and employing a robust Bayesian framework for model comparison alongside frequentist methods. Contrary to the established consensus that pulsar spectra are predominantly simple power laws, our analysis reveals that complex spectral shapes with curvature or breaks are in fact the norm. The broken power law emerges as the most common spectral shape, accounting for 60\% of pulsars, while the simple power law describes only 13.5\%, with 68.8\% of pulsars decisively favoring curved or broken models. We further identify 74 confident gigahertz-peaked spectrum pulsars, and demonstrate that millisecond pulsars frequently exhibit spectral curvature. A key finding is that the previously reported dominance of the simple power law was largely a statistical artifact of the frequentist method used in earlier work. These findings substantially revise the prevailing view of pulsar spectra and establish a critical, model-classified foundation for future theoretical work.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of Galactic Atomic Hydrogen Position-Position-Velocity Filaments</title>

Abstract: We present a catalog of 3D Galactic HI filaments over 1/3 of the sky using Galactic Arecibo L-band Feed Array HI (GALFA-HI) data. The 3D filaments are defined to be linear HI features that are continuous in position-position-velocity (PPV) and are found with fil3d, an algorithm that expands on the 2D FilFinder. The catalog contains 3333 HI filaments between +/- 50 km/s at a range of Galactic positions. 1542 of the PPV filaments are identified as local at the distance of the wall of the Local Bubble, and 209 are likely at the disk-halo interface of our Galaxy. The catalog and properties of the PPV filaments are obtained after an unsharp mask (USM) is applied to the data. The widths of the filaments are consistently ~12' (0.34 pc at 100 pc), and constrained by the 4' resolution. The local filaments have median properties of N_HI = $6 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, M_HI = 0.17 M_sun, FWHM = 3.2 km/s, and length of 6.4 pc. The disk-halo population has similar column densities, but the median FWHM = 7.7 km/s, consistent with them being higher z-height, warmer structures. The L $\propto$ M$^{0.5}$ relationship found for the HI filaments and their bundling on the sky are consistent with a hierarchical structure, and is likely related to turbulence playing a role in their formation.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Variational Autoencoders for Joint Data Compression and Component Extraction</title>

Abstract: Geostationary hyperspectral satellites generate terabytes of data daily, creating critical challenges for storage, transmission, and distribution to the scientific community. We present a variational autoencoder (VAE) approach that achieves x514 compression of NASA's TEMPO satellite hyperspectral observations (1028 channels, 290-490nm) with reconstruction errors 1-2 orders of magnitude below the signal across all wavelengths. This dramatic data volume reduction enables efficient archival and sharing of satellite observations while preserving spectral fidelity. Beyond compression, we investigate to what extent atmospheric information is retained in the compressed latent space by training linear and nonlinear probes to extract Level-2 products (NO2, O3, HCHO, cloud fraction). Cloud fraction and total ozone achieve strong extraction performance (R^2 = 0.93 and 0.81 respectively), though these represent relatively straightforward retrievals given their distinct spectral signatures. In contrast, tropospheric trace gases pose genuine challenges for extraction (NO2 R^2 = 0.20, HCHO R^2 = 0.51) reflecting their weaker signals and complex atmospheric interactions. Critically, we find the VAE encodes atmospheric information in a semi-linear manner - nonlinear probes substantially outperform linear ones - and that explicit latent supervision during training provides minimal improvement, revealing fundamental encoding challenges for certain products. This work demonstrates that neural compression can dramatically reduce hyperspectral data volumes while preserving key atmospheric signals, addressing a critical bottleneck for next-generation Earth observation systems.

      <title>From LIGO to Fiber- Compact Sagnac Interferometer for Gravitational-Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detection has transformed astrophysics, granting us direct access to black hole mergers, neutron star collisions, and the cataclysms of stellar death. Yet the great observatories of today, LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and the planned Einstein Telescope, rest on Michelson interferometers that, despite their triumphs, confront fundamental barriers of scale, cost, and environmental vulnerability. We envision a new path, a Sagnac-based fiber interferometer that leverages reciprocity and inherent robustness. Its meter-scale, modular design compact enough to fit within a small facility, offers dramatic gains in scalability and affordability over kilometer scale Michelson systems. Tunable to frequency bands where conventional detectors lose sensitivity, it opens the door to compact, versatile, and accessible GW observatories, empowering universities and research centers worldwide. Linked together in a global network, such facilities could transcend mere detection, they could localize cosmic sources and reconstruct them into images, much as black holes were first directly revealed, ushering in a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy and multi-messenger discovery.</description>

      <title>STORMY : A Real-time Triggering Framework using Yamagawa Solar Spectrograph for Active Solar Emission Observations with the MWA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some of the most interesting insights into solar physics and space weather come from studying radio emissions associated with solar activity, which remain inherently unpredictable. Hence, a real-time triggering system is needed for solar observations with the versatile new-generation radio telescopes to efficiently capture these episodes of solar activity with the precious and limited solar observing time. We have developed such a system, Solar Triggered Observations of Radio bursts using MWA and Yamagawa (STROMY) for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the precursor for the low frequency telescope of upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO). It is based on near-real-time data from the Yamagawa solar spectrograph, located at a similar longitude to the MWA. We have devised, implemented, and tested algorithms to perform an effective denoising of the data to identify signatures of solar activity in the Yamagawa data in near real-time. End-to-end tests of triggered observations have been successfully carried out at the MWA. STORMY is operational at the MWA for the routine solar observations, a timely development in the view of the ongoing solar maximum. We present this new observing framework and discuss how it can enable efficient capturing of event-rich solar data with existing instruments, like the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) etc., and pave the way for triggered observing with the SKAO, especially the SKA-Low.</description>

      <title>Enhancing low energy reconstruction and classification in KM3NeT/ORCA with transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescope, still under construction, has not yet reached its full potential in neutrino reconstruction capability. When training any deep learning model, no explicit information about the physics or the detector is provided, thus they remain unknown to the model. This study leverages the strengths of transformers by incorporating attention masks inspired by the physics and detector design, making the model understand both the telescope design and the neutrino physics measured on it. The study also shows the efficacy of transformers on retaining valuable information between detectors when doing fine-tuning from one configurations to another.</description>

      <title>The TEQUILA catalog of variables in TESS full-frame images: Differential photometry light curves from the first two years of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar variability and transient events provide critical insights into astrophysics, accelerated by missions like CoRoT, Kepler, and K2. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) adds a unique combination of long baseline and all-sky coverage, though extracting light curves from full-frame images (FFIs) is challenging due to scattered light and blending. We processed TESS FFIs to produce TEQUILA (TESS quick-look and light curve analysis), a comprehensive catalog of variable point sources from the prime mission, enabling diverse studies without requiring raw data processing. We used difference image analysis, constructing reference images from quality-filtered FFIs for each CCD across sectors 1-26. Iterative subtraction mitigated systematics, and light curves were created using aperture photometry for sources varying in residual images. The pipeline yields over six million light curves, including stellar variables, transients, systematics, and moving objects. Approximately $6 \times 10^5$ span multiple sectors, with roughly $10^3$ from continuous viewing zones. We achieve median differential variability noise of $10^{-3}$ to $10^0$ for sources between 5.0 and 16.0 Tmag, while typical photometric RMS variability ranges from $10^{-2}$ to $10^1$. A convolutional neural network identifies light curves caused by instrumental noise, assigning a confidence score to each classification. To avoid confusion with astrophysical variables, we also flag light curves prompted by known Solar System objects (SSOs). All light curves are accessible via MAST as a High-Level Science Product. This catalog serves as a discovery tool for new variables; future work will refine methods and extend coverage to the TESS extended mission.</description>

      <title>Neural surrogates for designing gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.</description>

      <title>Inferring Magnetic Field Morphology and Dust Scattering Geometry from Mid-IR Polarimetry: the Extended Aitken Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Aitken method is a useful approach for decomposing mid-IR polarimetry of silicates in astronomical sources into emissive and absorptive components. Here we extend this method to include the effects of polarization caused by scattering from graphite or similar particles along the same sightlines. To demonstrate the extended method, we apply it in the analysis of CanariCam multi-wavelength imaging polarimetry observations of the Egg Nebula, W3 IRS5, and W51 IRS2, and also spectropolarimetry of W3 IRS5. We compare these results with those obtained with the original Aitken method and show that the Egg Nebula observations are fit better when this third component is incorporated into the analysis. Polarimetry observations of W3 IRS5 are also fit better with the extended Aitken method, but the original method suffices to fit many sightlines. Observations of W51 IRS2 are fit well by either the original or extended Aitken method. Including scattering by dust in the decomposition of polarimetry observations of the Egg Nebula and W3 IRS5 produces better results for the emissive and absorptive components, and in particular for the position angle (PA) of those components. The distribution of the difference between absorptive and emissive PA is then found to be more peaked at a single angle, nearly perpendicular. This supports the theory that mid-IR polarization arises from elongated dust grains aligned along magnetic field lines, since then the PA of emissive and absorptive polarization would be perpendicular. When significant scattering is not present the extended method produces the same results as the original method.</description>

      <title>Trade-off Analysis for Lunar Augmented Navigation Service (LANS) Constellation Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The establishment of a sustainable human presence on the Moon demands robust positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services capable of supporting both surface and orbital operations. This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off analysis of lunar frozen-orbit constellations for the Lunar Augmented Navigation Service (LANS), focusing on how the number of satellites and orbital parameters influence coverage, position dilution of precision (PDOP), orbit determination accuracy, receiver noise, and orbit insertion cost. Three Walker-constellation families based on frozen elliptical and circular orbits are examined to characterize their relative advantages across different semi-major axes and inclinations. Results show that larger semi-major axes enhance both polar and global coverage, though the optimal inclination depends on the constellation type and target service region. The south elliptical lunar frozen orbit (ELFO) Walker constellation provides superior performance for polar coverage and PDOP, whereas the circular lunar frozen orbit (CLFO) Walker configuration achieves the best global uniformity. Orbit determination errors and receiver noise both increase with larger semi-major axes and higher inclinations, reflecting weaker geometric observability and reduced received signal power at apolune for eccentric orbits. Orbit insertion analysis reveals clear trade-offs among transfer duration, characteristic energy ($C_3$) at trans-lunar injection, and insertion $\Delta V$: shorter transfers require higher insertion $\Delta V$, while low-energy transfers achieve smaller $\Delta V$ at the cost of months-long durations and higher $C_3$. These findings provide a systematic framework for designing LANS constellations for both regional and global coverage.</description>

      <title>StarDICE IV: correcting visible photometry from atmospheric gray extinction using thermal infrared observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation ground-based surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time require photometric calibration that is both long-term stable and spatially uniform at the sub-percent level, even during non-photometric conditions. Achieving this precision motivates new approaches to characterize atmospheric transmission, particularly to mitigate gray extinction from clouds. The StarDICE experiment aims to establish a metrology chain linking laboratory standards to astrophysical fluxes with 1 mmag accuracy in the $\textit{griz}$ bands, a goal for which controlling variable atmospheric effects is essential. We present a method that corrects photometric measurements using simultaneous radiometric information from an infrared thermal camera. The gray-extinction model is fit on an image-by-image basis using thermal radiance excess and the difference between synthetic and instrumental fluxes of calibration stars, without requiring assumptions about the spatial structure of extinction. The method relies on a forward model that incorporates environmental monitoring, radiative-transfer simulations, and Gaia DR3 stellar catalogs. Using data from a remote observing system that repeatedly monitored two fields under diverse atmospheric conditions, we show that the corrections reduce residuals between corrected and reference magnitudes and produce extinction maps with 2-arcmin resolution and $\sim$0.01 mag accuracy. Using this technique, we can recover data acquired under non-photometric conditions with a precision comparable to data obtained under photometric conditions. For the most affected exposures, the mean absolute error improves from 0.64 to 0.11 mag, and temporal extinction variations can be reduced to 0.025 mag per source. We discuss the implications of this technique for future surveys and outline directions for further refinement.</description>

      <title>Detection of Lensed Gravitational Waves from dark matter halos with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lensed gravitational waves (GWs) provide a new window into the study of dark matter substructures, yet the faint interference signatures they produce are buried in detector noise. To address this challenge, we develop a deep learning framework based on a residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network for lensed GW identification under multiband observations. The model directly processes multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems, covering the early inspiral observed by the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the late inspiral observed by the Einstein Telescope (ET), corresponding approximately to the wave-optics and geometrical-optics regimes, respectively. It enables end-to-end classification of five classes: pure noise, unlensed GWs, and three representative lensed GWs corresponding to singular isothermal sphere (SIS), cored isothermal sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. A dataset of 10^6 simulated samples was constructed with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 100. The deep learning model with multiband observations achieves an accuracy of 97.0% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.97, significantly exceeding the single-detector performance, where DECIGO and ET reach 72.8% and 62.3%, respectively. Even in the low-SNR regime (SNR &lt; 20), the model maintains an accuracy above 63%, while in the high-SNR regime (SNR &gt; 80), its accuracy approaches 99.8%. These results demonstrate that multiband GW observations effectively enhance the detection of lensed GWs within complex noise environments, providing a robust and efficient pathway for the automated identification of lensed GWs in future multiband observations.</description>

      <title>Topmetal-L: A Low Noise Charge-Sensitive Pixel Sensor for POLAR2/LPD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: POLAR-2 is a next-generation space astronomy platform led by China, with its core scientific objective focused on high-precision polarization measurements of gamma-ray bursts. As one of its key payloads, the Low-energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is designed to perform wide-field surveys to capture X-ray polarization information from gamma-ray bursts in the 2$\sim$10 keV energy range. This paper presents Topmetal-L, a dedicated charge-sensitive pixel sensor developed for the LPD prototype upgrade. Fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS process in 2024, the chip integrates a 356 $\times$ 512 pixel array with a pixel pitch of 45 $\mu$m. Each pixel incorporates a 26 $\times$ 26 $\mu$m$^2$ charge-collecting window and is capable of simultaneously outputting both energy and position information of deposited charges. Topmetal-L has been systematically optimized for power consumption, noise performance, and readout efficiency. It exhibits an input dynamic range of 0$\sim$4 ke$^{-}$, a typical charge-to-voltage conversion gain of 76.04 $\mu$V/e$^{-}$, an average equivalent noise charge of approximately 22.8 e$^{-}$, a sensitive area exceeding 3.69 cm$^2$, and a total power consumption of 720 mW per chip. To meet the requirements of large-area, high-frame-rate readout for gas-based polarization detectors, a sentinel readout scheme is proposed, reducing the full-frame readout time to 730 $\mu$s. A prototype Topmetal-L-based gas polarization detection system was evaluated across key energies: it exhibited a residual modulation of 0.26% $\pm$ 0.45% at 5.90 keV, a modulation factor of 66.67% $\pm$ 0.45% for a linearly polarized 8.05 keV source, and a count rate saturated at 15 k counts$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$$\cdot$s$^{-1}$ when tested at 5.40 keV.</description>

      <title>Residual neural networks to classify the high frequency emission in core-collapse supernova gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new methodology to explore the morphology of the High Frequency Feature (HFF), i.e., the dominant, rising-frequency GW emission from a proto-neutron star in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). We used a residual neural network (ResNet50) to perform multi-class classification of image samples constructed from time-frequency Morlet wavelet scalograms. We defined a three-class problem by categorizing the HFF slope as Steep, Moderate, or Low, according to physically informed ranges. The ResNet50 model was optimized with phenomenological waveforms injected into real noise from the LIGO-Virgo O3b observing run and then tested with numerically simulated CCSN waveforms embedded in the same real noise. At galactic distances of 1 kpc and 5 kpc with H1 and L1 data and 1 kpc with V1 data, we obtained highly accurate results (test accuracies from 0.8933 to 0.9867), which show the feasibility of our methodology. For further distances, we observed declines in test accuracy until 0.8000 with H1 and L1 data at 10 kpc and until 0.5933 with V1 data at 10 kpc, which we attribute to limitations in the input datasets. Our methodology is sufficiently general to enable early-stage characterization of the HFF in real interferometric data.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the Known Unknowns: A Parametric Framework to Incorporate Systematic Waveform Errors in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PE for GW merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the Bayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced during the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function. However, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ across the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data analysis pipeline is an active area of research. We introduce parametrizations for the uncertainties in the amplitude and phase of the reference waveform model. When the error budget in the amplitude and phase of the waveform model, as a function of frequency, is known, it can be used as a prior distribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors can be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any knowledge of waveform uncertainty error budgets. Through zero-noise injections and PE recoveries, we demonstrate that even 1%-2% of errors in relative phase to the actual waveform model, for a GW150914-like signal and advanced LIGO detector sensitivity, can introduce biases in the recovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for waveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By analyzing a series of simulated signals from mergers with precessing orbits and recovering them using a non-spinning waveform model, we demonstrate that we can reduce the ratio of systematic errors to statistical errors. This approach allows us to address scenarios where specific physical effects are missing in waveform modeling. The code that implements our parametrization for performing PE is available as a Python package "pycbc_wferrors_plugin", compatible with the PyCBC open source GW analysis library.</description>

      <title>A method for statistical research on binary stars using radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are fundamental to astrophysics, providing critical insights into stellar evolution, galactic dynamics, and fundamental physics. However, the high dimensionality of orbital parameters and observational constraints present significant challenges in statistically characterizing their properties. In this study, we propose and implement a novel algorithm, the Differential Velocity Cumulative Distribution (DVCD), to analyze binary star systems using radial velocity data. The DVCD method demonstrates superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches, reducing computation time by factors of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ under comparable conditions.
  We applied the DVCD algorithm to red giant samples from APOGEE DR16, dividing the dataset into 16 subsets based on $\log g$ and M/H. Our findings reveal that the binary fraction decreases with decreasing surface gravity and increasing metallicity, offering valuable constraints on the evolutionary processes of binary stars. This study underscores the potential of the DVCD method for large-scale statistical analyzes of binary systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of LSST $u$-band Survey Strategy on Photometric Redshift Estimation and the Detection of Lyman-break Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), promising to discover billions of galaxies out to redshift 7, using six photometric bands ($ugrizy$) spanning the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. The exact number of and quality of information about these galaxies will depend on survey depth in these six bands, which in turn depends on the LSST survey strategy: i.e., how often and how long to expose in each band. $u$-band depth is especially important for photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimation and for detection of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). In this paper we use a simulated galaxy catalog and an analytic model for the LBG population to study how recent updates and proposed changes to Rubin's $u$-band throughput and LSST survey strategy impact photo-$z$ accuracy and LBG detection. We find that proposed variations in $u$-band strategy have a small impact on photo-$z$ accuracy for $z &lt; 1.5$ galaxies, but the outlier fraction, scatter, and bias for higher redshift galaxies varies by up to 50%, depending on the survey strategy considered. The number of $u$-band dropout LBGs at $z \sim 3$ is also highly sensitive to the $u$-band depth, varying by up to 500%, while the number of $griz$-band dropouts is only modestly affected. Under the new $u$-band strategy recommended by the Rubin Survey Cadence Optimization Committee, we predict $u$-band dropout number densities of $110$ deg$^{-2}$ (3200 deg$^{-2}$) in year 1 (10) of LSST. We discuss the implications of these results for LSST cosmology.</description>

      <title>The Detection-vs-Retrieval Challenge: Titan as an Exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cassini's observations of Titan's atmosphere are exemplary benchmarks for exoplanet atmospheric studies owing to (1) their precision and (2) our independent knowledge of Titan. Leveraging these observations, we perform retrievals (i.e., analyses) of Titan's transmission spectrum to investigate the strengths/limitations of exoplanet atmospheric retrievals with a particular focus on the underlying assumptions regarding the molecular species included in the retrieval. We find that multiple hydrocarbons can be ``retrieved'' depending on the selection made ahead of a retrieval. More importantly, we find that the estimates of other parameters such as the abundance of key absorbers like methane can be biased by $\sim$0.5 dex (by a factor of $\sim$3) due to such choices. This shows that beyond the possible misidentification of a molecular feature (e.g., current debate surrounding dimethyl sulfide, DMS, in K2-18 b), the implicit molecular detections made pre-retrieval to avoid retrieving for hundreds of molecules at a time can bias a large range of parameters. We thus recommend sensitivity analysis to assess the dependencies of atmospheric inferences on such selections in tandem with complementary information (e.g., chemistry models) to support any pre-retrieval selection. Finally, we introduce an independent path to constrain the dominant atmospheric constituent, even when lacking observable absorption feature (e.g., H$_2$ and N$_2$) through the scale height.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$. The $&gt;3.7\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton is significantly contributed by one system whose relative 3D velocity between the pair exceeds the Newtonian escape velocity. This system is not likely to be a chance association but may be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of the Absolute Sky Brightness at 60 to 350 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.</description>

      <title>Systematics mitigation for catalogue-based angular power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has developed a formalism for computing angular power spectra directly from catalogues containing field values at discrete positions on the sky, thereby circumventing the need to create pixelised maps of the fields, as well as avoiding aliasing and finite-resolution effects. We adapt this formalism to incorporate template deprojection for mitigating systematic biases in the measured angular power spectra. We also introduce an alternative method of mitigating the `deprojection bias' - the loss of modes induced by deprojection - employing simple simulations to compute a transfer function. We find that this approach performs at least as well as existing methods, and is relatively insensitive to how well one can guess the true power spectrum of the observed field, except at the largest scales ($\ell \lesssim 3$). Additionally, we develop exact expressions for the bias introduced by deprojection in the shot-noise component, which further improves the accuracy of this approach. We test our formalism on simulated datasets, demonstrating its applicability both to discretely sampled fields, and to the special case of galaxy clustering, with the survey selection function defined in terms of a random catalogue or as a continuous sky map. After removing the bias in the shot noise and correcting for the remaining mode loss using a transfer function, our formalism produces unbiased measurements of the angular power spectrum in all scenarios tested here. Finally, we apply our formalism to real data and show it produces results consistent with the standard map-based pseudo-$C_\ell$ formalism. We implement our method in the public code NaMaster.</description>

      <title>ReplicationBench: Can AI Agents Replicate Astrophysics Research Papers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants, and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows. However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under 20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale, expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.</description>
