      <title>Geometric developmental principles for the emergence of brain-like weighted and directed neuronal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain networks exhibit remarkable structural properties, including high local clustering, short path lengths, and heavy-tailed weight and degree distributions. While these features are thought to enable efficient information processing with minimal wiring costs, the fundamental principles that generate such complex network architectures across species remain unclear. Here, we analyse single-neuron resolution connectomes across five species (C. Elegans, Platynereis, Drosophila M., zebrafish and mouse) to investigate the fundamental wiring principles underlying brain network formation. We show that distance-dependent connectivity alone produces small-world networks, but fails to generate heavy-tailed distributions. By incorporating weight-preferential attachment, which arises from spatial clustering of synapses along neurites, we reproduce heavy-tailed weight distributions while maintaining small-world topology. Adding degree-preferential attachment, linked to the extent of dendritic and axonal arborization, enables the generation of heavy-tailed degree distributions. Through systematic parameter exploration, we demonstrate that the combination of distance dependence, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment is sufficient to reproduce all characteristic properties of empirical brain networks. Our results reveal that activity-independent geometric constraints during neural development can account for the conserved architectural principles observed across evolutionarily distant species, suggesting universal mechanisms governing neural circuit assembly.</description>

      <title>Technical Note: Low-Dose Simulation for Grating-Based X-Ray Dark-Field Radiography Using a Virtually Decreased Irradiation Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: X-ray dark-field radiography uses small-angle scattering to visualize the structural integrity of lung alveoli. To study the influence of dose reduction on clinical dark-field radiographs, one can simulate low-dose images by virtually reducing the irradiated area. However, these simulations can exhibit stripe artifacts. Purpose: Validation of the low-dose simulation algorithm reported by Schick &amp; Bast et al., PLoS ONE, 2024. Furthermore, we want to demonstrate that stripe artifacts observed in simulated images at very low-dose levels are introduced by limitations of the algorithm and would not appear in actual low-dose dark-field images. Methods: Dark-field radiographs of an anthropomorphic chest phantom were acquired at different tube currents equaling different radiation doses. Based on the measurement with a high radiation dose, dark-field radiographs corresponding to lower radiation doses were simulated by virtually reducing the irradiated area. The simulated low-dose radiographs were evaluated by a quantitative comparison of the dark-field signal using different regions of interests. Results: Dark-field radiographs acquired at one quarter of the standard dose were artifact-free. The dark-field signal differed from the simulated radiographs by up to 10%. Algorithm-induced stripe artifacts decrease the image quality of the simulated radiographs. Conclusions: Virtually reducing the irradiation area is a simple approach to generate low-dose radiographs based on images acquired with scanning-based dark-field radiography. However, as the algorithm creates stripe artifacts in the dark-field images, particularly at higher dose reductions, that are not present in measured low-dose images, simulated images have reduced image quality compared to their measured counterparts.</description>

      <title>Deformable bodies in a 3-dimensional viscous flow: Vorticity-Stream vector formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When simulating three-dimensional flows interacting with deformable and elastic obstacles, current methods often encounter complexities in the governing equations and challenges in numerical implementation. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical formulation for simulating incompressible viscous flows at low Reynolds numbers in the presence of deformable interfaces. Our method employs a vorticity-stream vector formulation that significantly simplifies the fluid solver, transforming it into a set of coupled Poisson problems. The body-fluid interface is modeled using a phase field, allowing for the incorporation of various free-energy models to account for membrane bending and surface tension. In contrast to existing three-dimensional approaches, such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods or boundary-integral techniques, our formulation is lightweight and grounded in classical fluid mechanics principles, making it implementable with standard finite-difference techniques. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by simulating the evolution of a single vesicle or droplet in Newtonian Poiseuille and Couette flows under different free-energy models, successfully recovering canonical axisymmetric shapes and stress profiles. Although this work primarily focuses on single-body dynamics in Newtonian suspending fluids, the framework can be extended to include body forces, inertial effects, and viscoelastic media.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the scale dependence of the Reynolds number in correlated fluctuating fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the incompressible Navier--Stokes equation, the Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re}$) is a dimensionless parameter quantifying the relative importance of inertial over viscous forces. In the low-$\mathrm{Re}$ regime ($\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$), the flow dynamics are commonly approximated by the linear Stokes equation. Here we show that, within the framework of spatially fluctuating hydrodynamics, this linearization breaks down when the thermal noise is spatially correlated, even if $\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$. We perform direct numerical simulations of spatially correlated fluctuating hydrodynamics in both one and two dimensions. In one dimension, the linearized dynamics exhibit significantly slower relaxation of high-wavenumber Fourier modes than the full nonlinear dynamics. In two dimensions, an analogous discrepancy arises in the particle velocity autocorrelation function, which decays more slowly in the correlated linear Stokes case than in the correlated nonlinear Navier--Stokes case. In both settings, spatial correlations inhibit viscous momentum diffusion at small scales, leading to prolonged relaxation under the linear dynamics, whereas nonlinear mode coupling accelerates small-scale relaxation. Thus, the interplay between nonlinear coupling and viscous damping becomes scale dependent, invalidating the use of a single global Reynolds number. Taken together, these findings show that, for spatially correlated fluctuating fluids, the effective Reynolds number must be reinterpreted as a scale-dependent quantity.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of axis formation in $\textit{Hydra}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of a body axis is a fundamental step in the development of multicellular organisms. In simple systems such as $\textit{Hydra}$, growing evidence suggests that mechanical forces generated by collective cellular activity play a central role in this process. Here, we explore a physical mechanism for axis formation based on the coupling between active stresses and tissue elasticity. We analyse the elastic deformation induced by activity-generated stresses and show that, owing to the spherical topology of the tissue, forces globally condense toward configurations in which both elastic strain and nematic defect localise at opposite poles. These mechanically selected states define either a polar or apolar head-food axis. To characterize the condensed regime, we introduce a compact parametrization of of the active force and flux distributions, enabling analytical predictions and direct comparison with experiments. Using this framework, we calculate experimentally relevant observables, including areal strain, lateral pressure, and normal displacements during muscular contraction, as well as the detailed structure of topological defect complexes in head and foot regions. Together, our results identify a mechanical route by which active tissues can spontaneously break symmetry at the organismal scale, suggesting a general physical principle underlying body-axis specification during morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Three Dimensional Traction Force Microscopy Framework for Uncovering the Mechanics of Bio-Adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel, versatile traction force microscopy framework for quantifying three-dimensional (3D) interfacial forces during bio-adhesion by integrating in situ stereo digital image correlation with finite element (FE) simulation. The method enables accurate measurement of microscale displacements and force distributions at the interfaces in both dry and wet environments, addressing limitations of conventional microscopy techniques related to limited measurement scales, restricted fields of view, and surface disturbance from contact or fluorescence. An analytical model was developed to guide the design of a deformable substrate, supporting selection of substrate material and thickness of the substrate. System accuracy was examined through steel ball compression experiments, which were validated against FE simulations. The framework was applied to marine mussel plaque adhesion under 15 directional tension to characterize interfacial traction force distributions. Sensitivity analyses examined the effects of Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and constitutive models on the results. This approach offers a versatile platform for investigating interfacial mechanics in adhesives, with broad relevance to bioengineering applications.</description>
