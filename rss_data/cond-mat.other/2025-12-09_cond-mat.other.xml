      <title>Moir\'e pattern multiplicity driven by electronic effects in two-dimensional CrCl3/Au heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns are a central motif in van der Waals heterostructures arising from the superposition of two-dimensional (2D) incommensurate lattices. These patterns reveal a wealth of correlated effects, influencing electronic, magnetic, and structural phenomena. While diffraction techniques typically resolve multiple moir\'e wave-vectors corresponding to the incommensurate nature of the underlying lattices, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) often reveals only a dominant superperiod. In this work, we address this apparent discrepancy through an STM study of a twisted monolayer of CrCl3 on Au(111). We observe the coexistence of several moir\'e patterns at a fixed twist angle, whose relative intensity depends on the tunneling bias. Fourier analysis of STM data uncovers hidden higher-order moir\'e components not visible in STM topographic images, while spectroscopy maps reveal that the spectral weight of each pattern varies with electron energy. Our results establish that STM selectively probes on the same area distinct moir\'e modulations depending on electronic confinement, providing a unified framework that reconciles real space and reciprocal space observations of complex moir\'e superstructures.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence of N\'eel-order-driven Magneto-optical Kerr Effect in an Altermagnetic Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is investigated in hematite, a collinear antiferromagnetic insulator, across a broad wavelength spectrum. By combining the optical measurements with magnetometry results, we unambiguously demonstrate that the N\'eel-order contribution dominates the MOKE signal, while contributions from net magnetization and external magnetic fields are negligible. This conclusion is quantitatively supported by first-principles calculations, and qualitatively by a symmetry analysis that the N\'eel contribution appears at the first order in spin-orbit coupling while the magnetization contribution starts only at the third order. This study clarifies the altermagnetic origin of the pronounced MOKE in hematite, underscoring the potential of altermagnets as a promising new class of magneto-optical materials.</description>

      <title>Tunable Narrowband Terahertz Radiation from van der Waals Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) spectral range is central to high-speed communication, precision metrology, sensing technologies, and a range of fundamental scientific investigations. Achieving these capabilities in practical systems increasingly demands chip-scale integration of THz photonic components that are typically bulky. In this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a unique platform for integrated nonlinear photonics in the visible and near-infrared regimes, and extending this framework into the THz domain would constitute a significant advance. Here, we report tunable, intense, and narrowband THz radiation from ferroelectric niobium oxyhalides. Through halogen substitution and alloying, we achieve continuous and precise control over the emission frequency from 3.1 to 5.8 THz. We show that the narrowband THz radiation is driven by phonons associated with the ferroelectric polarization. We further demonstrate dynamic and nonvolatile control of the polarity of the coherent THz wave with external electric field. This work demonstrates efficient narrowband THz emission from vdW ferroeletrics and provides microscopic insight into its origin, paving the way for on-chip THz technology for a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Radiation resistance of refractory high-entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Response of refractory high-entropy alloys MoNbTaVW and HfNbTaTiZr to ultrafast radiation is modelled with the hybrid code XTANT-3, combining tight-binding molecular dynamics with the transport Monte Carlo and Boltzmann equation. A two-temperature state with elevated electronic temperature and a cold atomic lattice is studied. The parameters of the electronic system in such a state are studied: electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter with the electronic temperatures up to ~25,000 K. It is also demonstrated that the two refractory alloys do not show signs of nonthermal melting up to the deposited doses of ~10 eV/atom, making them more radiation resistant than the Cantor alloy or stainless steel. These results suggest that heavy-element high-entropy alloys are more radiation resistant than those containing only lighter elements. Damage in irradiated HfNbTaTiZr starts with the selective diffusion of Ti atoms, forming a transient superionic-like state.</description>

      <title>Odd viscosity and anomalous Hall effect in two dimensional electron systems with smooth disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A microscopic theory of odd viscosity in two-dimensional electron systems with smooth disorder and spin-orbit interaction is developed. It is shown that spin-orbit scattering gives rise to an off-diagonal component of the viscosity tensor. Hydrodynamic equations for spin and electric currents are derived for electrons interacting with smooth disorder. The contribution of odd viscosity to the anomalous Hall effect is calculated.</description>

      <title>Extreme Strain Controlled Correlated Metal-Insulator Transition in the Altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated flat bands and altermagnetism are two important directions in quantum materials, centred respectively on interaction-dominated phases and symmetry-enforced spin-textured states, yet both derive from lattice symmetry and orbital hybridization. This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction as a Way to Turn It into a Field-Free Vortex Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key elements in practical spintronics, enabling not only conventional tasks such as data storage, transmission, and processing but also the implementation of compute-in-memory processing elements, facilitating the development of efficient hardware for neuromorphic computing. The functionality of an MTJ is determined by the properties of its free layer (FL) and reference layer (RL) with fixed magnetization, separated by an MgO tunnel barrier. This paper presents a mechanism for reconfiguring the RL, which is the upper layer of a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet, enabling a reversible transition from a single-domain state to a vortex magnetic state with different core positions. When the RL is in the vortex state, it generates a spin current with a vortex-like polarization distribution, enabling stable vortex oscillations in the FL even in the absence of external magnetic fields. This effect has been confirmed in MTJs with diameters ranging from 400 to 1000 nm. It is demonstrated, using experimental data with comparative micromagnetic simulation, that the pinning antiferromagnet retains a long term memory of previous reannealing states resulting in a deformation of the vortex polarised spin current, which in turn introduces a strong dynamical vortex core polarity symmetry breaking. The analogue reprogrammable nature of both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ demonstrate different possible routes for the introduction of non-volatility into radiofrequency spintronic neuromorphic paradigms.</description>

      <title>Hidden Moir\'e Topology of Low-Symmetry Weyl Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological materials are defined by the correspondence between bulk topology and boundary states, yet this correspondence becomes enigmatic on low-symmetry surfaces where bulk and surface periodicities are inherently mismatched. Here we reveal a hidden moir\'e topology emerging on the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy uncovers closed Fermi-arc loops and momentum-space moir\'e modulations, phenomena unanticipated in conventional topological theory. We show that these emerge from incomplete bulk projection and multi-cell interference governed by a least-common-multiple framework. Least-common-multiple guided DFT and Green's-function calculations quantitatively reproduce the observed spectra, establishing the universality of this commensuration rule. These findings transform a long-standing paradox of bulk-boundary correspondence into a new paradigm of momentum-space moir\'e reconstruction, bridging crystalline and quasicrystalline topologies and opening routes to flat-band engineering on complex surfaces.</description>

      <title>A Dimensionally Consistent Size-Strain Plot Method for Crystallite Size and Microstrain Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak broadening analysis remains a cornerstone for quantifying crystallite size and lattice microstrain in materials. Among various approaches, the Size Strain Plot (SSP) method is widely employed for its conceptual simplicity and ease of use. However, this study reveals that the equation most commonly applied in SSP analysis is dimensionally inconsistent, a critical flaw that has gone largely unnoticed and replicated across decades of materials research. This pervasive error raises concerns about the validity of a significant body of published microstructural data. By tracing the historical origin of the misformulated equation, we demonstrate how a seemingly minor oversight evolved into a widely accepted standard practice within the field. We then present a dimensionally consistent formulation that restores physical meaning and analytical reliability to the SSP method. The corrected framework re-establishes the SSP approach as a robust and physically valid tool for XRD-based microstructural characterization. \en</description>
