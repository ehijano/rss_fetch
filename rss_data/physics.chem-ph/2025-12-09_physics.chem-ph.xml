      <title>Accelerating Materials Discovery: Learning a Universal Representation of Chemical Processes for Cross-Domain Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental validation of chemical processes is slow and costly, limiting exploration in materials discovery. Machine learning can prioritize promising candidates, but existing data in patents and literature is heterogeneous and difficult to use. We introduce a universal directed-tree process-graph representation that unifies unstructured text, molecular structures, and numeric measurements into a single machine-readable format. To learn from this structured data, we developed a multi-modal graph neural network with a property-conditioned attention mechanism. Trained on approximately 700,000 process graphs from nearly 9,000 diverse documents, our model learns semantically rich embeddings that generalize across domains. When fine-tuned on compact, domain-specific datasets, the pretrained model achieves strong performance, demonstrating that universal process representations learned at scale transfer effectively to specialized prediction tasks with minimal additional data.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Computational Approaches for Accelerated Drug Discovery: Integrating Quantum Mechanics, Statistical Thermodynamics, and Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting protein-ligand binding free energies (BFEs) remains a central challenge in drug discovery, particularly because the most reliable methods, such as free energy perturbation (FEP), are computationally intensive and difficult to scale. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical framework that combines Mining Minima sampling with quantum mechanically refined ligand partial charges, QM/MM interaction evaluation, and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)-based electronic energy correction. This design enables explicit treatment of polarization, charge redistribution, and electronic correlation effects that are often underestimated in purely classical scoring schemes, while retaining computational efficiency. Across 23 protein targets and 543 ligands, the method achieves a mean absolute error of about 1.10 kcal/mol with strong rank-order fidelity (Pearson R = 0.75, Spearman rho = 0.76, Kendall tau = 0.57), consistent with the performance of contemporary FEP protocols. Notably, the workflow requires only about 25 minutes per ligand on standard compute resources, resulting in an approximate 20-fold reduction in computational cost relative to alchemical free energy approaches. This level of accuracy and efficiency makes the method well-suited for high-throughput lead optimization and iterative design cycles in pharmaceutical discovery. The framework also provides a natural foundation for future integration with machine learning models to enable predictive, large-scale, and adaptive screening strategies.</description>

      <title>Why are diffuse atomic orbitals needed for accurate electronic wave functions of even neutral molecules?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate description of electron correlation energies in molecules requires either basis set extrapolation or the use of explicitly-correlated wave functions that address the deficiencies of standard determinantal expansions at short interelectronic distances. Practical and robust explicitly-correlated F12 methods require the use of standard or specialized atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that include diffuse AOs, even for neutral species. Although modern reduced-scaling formulations of explicitly-correlated many-body methods have become routinely applicable to molecules with hundreds of atoms, application of F12 methods to large molecular systems can be severely hampered due to the onset of ill-conditioning spurred by the presence of diffuse AOs in the F12-appropriate orbital basis sets. Here we re-examine why diffuse AOs are necessary for application of F12 methods. To help such an investigation, we developed a dual-basis formulation of traditional and F12 coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) methods in which the reference (occupied) and correlating (virtual) orbitals are expanded in separate AO basis sets. Our conclusion is that diffuse AOs are fundamentally important for the traditional (non-F12) description of dynamical correlation; the necessity of diffuse AOs in F12 calculations arises indirectly due to the dramatic reduction of the basis set error by the F12 terms such that the error due to the lack of diffuse AOs becomes comparable to the residual basis set incompleteness. The dual-basis CC methods are suggested as an important candidate formalism for accurate (in particular, F12) reduced-scaling many-body methods in extended systems.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Differential Hot-charge Emission Spectroscopy: The Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-level alignment (ELA) at buried interfaces between electrode and molecular materials sets charge injection barriers, carrier selectivity, and ultimately device efficiency, yet it is challenging to quantify under operating conditions. Hot-charge emission spectroscopy (HotES) probes ELA by injecting ballistic carriers across a tunneling oxide. Yet, the technique inherently convolutes the molecular response with a strong, energy-dependent tunneling background, complicating the isolation of the true ELA. We introduce synchronous differential HotES (sd-HotES), defined as the ratio of the differential conductance of the hot-charge and tunneling channels of the HotES. Physical modeling and numerical simulations validate that this ratio directly reconstructs the intrinsic molecular charge transmission, enabling the threshold-free and probe-bias-insensitive extraction of ELA. By effectively eliminating the masking tunneling background, sd-HotES substantially boosts detection sensitivity; weak spectral features previously hidden in conventional HotES become clearly resolvable, as demonstrated in lock-in simulations including realistic noise. This study establishes the fundamental operating principles of sd-HotES and highlights it as a powerful, broadly applicable strategy for accessing buried interface properties for the study of molecular and hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>ExPUFFIN: Thermodynamic Consistent Viscosity Prediction in an Extended Path-Unifying Feed-Forward Interfaced Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06927v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of liquid viscosity is essential for process design and simulation, yet remains challenging for novel molecules. Conventional group-contribution models struggle with isomer discrimination, large molecules, and parameter availability, while purely data-driven graph neural networks (GNNs) demand large datasets and offer limited interpretability. Even when feasible to be applied, purely data-driven models lack thermodynamic consistency in their predictions and are not a reliable solution. This work introduces ExPUFFIN, an extended version of the Path-unifying Feed-Forward Interfaced Network, consisting of a hybrid GNN-based framework that directly predicts temperature-dependent viscosities of pure hydrocarbons from molecular graphs, while enforcing mechanistic inductive biases in the output layer to ensure thermodynamic consistency. Molecular information is given as graph structures, encoded as a graph convolutional network, and mapped to an inductive bias neuron based on two thermophysical correlations: a three-parameter Andrade-type equation and a four-parameter empirical viscosity-temperature relation. The accuracy of these models is compared with a solely data-driven prediction. The Andrade-based ExPUFFIN variant reduces RMSE compared to the purely data-driven baseline of 37 percent and yields smooth, physically consistent interpolation and extrapolation of viscosity-temperature curves, properties that are not observed in purely data-driven models. The empirical ExPUFFIN model provides comparable accuracy while retaining robust trends. Overall, embedding physics-based structure in GNN outputs improves accuracy, robustness, and transferability, enabling reliable viscosity predictions for complex hydrocarbon molecules. The approach is readily extendable to other properties and significantly broader chemical domains.</description>

      <title>Unitary Coupled-Cluster based Self-Consistent Electron Propagator Theory for Electron-Detached and Electron-Attached States: A Quadratic Unitary Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles Method and Benchmark Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unitary coupled-cluster (UCC)-based self-consistent electron propagator theory (EPT) is proposed for the description of electron-detached and electron-attached states. Two practical schemes, termed IP/EA-UCC3 and IP/EA-qUCCSD, are developed and implemented within the UCC singles and doubles (UCCSD) framework using the perturbative and commutator-based truncation strategy for the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\bar{H}$. The numerical performance of these UCC-based EPT methods is extensively evaluated against full configuration interaction (FCI) reference data and compared with established approaches, including IP/EA-ADC(3), IP/EA-ADC(4) and IP/EA-EOM-CCSD. Benchmark calculations demonstrate that IP-qUCCSD achieves the highest overall accuracy among Hermitian ionized-state methods for one-hole (1h)-dominated IPs of closed-shell systems, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.19 eV and standard deviation (SD) of 0.13 eV. Remarkably, despite the absence of triple-excitation contributions, IP-qUCCSD outperforms the higher-order ADC(4) method. For one-particle (1p)-dominated EA calculations, all tested methods exhibit comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional RMSD projections for reaction path visualization and validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and may often be trajectory dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization trajectories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension surface defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using radial basis functions. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We validate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements.</description>

      <title>An effective bath state approach to model infrared spectroscopy and intramolecular dynamics in complex molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a molecule contains more than a few atoms, its full-dimensional dynamics becomes untractable, especially when introducing temperature effects. In such a case, it can be interesting to focus only on a few degrees of freedom and to model the rest of the molecule as a finite-dimensional bath. In this prospect, we extend the effective bath state (EBS) method that we had first developed and benchmarked in [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{160}, 044107 (2024)] to describe the spectroscopy and intramolecular dynamics of complex isolated molecules. The EBS method is a system-bath approach based on the coarse-graining of the bath into a reduced set of effective energy states. It allows for a significant reduction of the bath dimension and makes finite-temperature calculations more accessible. In order to treat a realistic molecule, the method is extended to include polynomial couplings in the bath coordinates. The ability of the method to model temperature-resolved infrared spectra and to follow population transfers between the vibrational modes of the molecule is first tested on a 10-mode model system. The extended method is then applied to the realistic case of phenylacetylene.</description>

      <title>Modular Construction of Jastrow Factors for the Transcorrelated Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the reuse of terms in the Jastrow factor between systems for use in the transcorrelated method, to reduce the number of optimisable parameters for a given system. In particular, we propose a workflow in which atom-specific parts of Jastrow factors, optimised in atoms, may be reused in the molecule, with only a few parameters in the electron-electron part of the Jastrow left to optimise, while maintaining performance. We find that the modified workflow not only reduces the number of terms needing to be optimised, but also improves the accuracy of xTC-CCSD(T) energies.</description>

      <title>XMCQDPT2-Fidelity Transfer-Learning Potentials and a Wavepacket Oscillation Model with Power-Law Decay for Ultrafast Photodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central pursuit in theoretical chemistry is the accurate simulation of photochemical reactions, which are governed by nonadiabatic transitions through conical intersections. Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for constructing the necessary potential energy surfaces, but applying it to excited states faces a fundamental barrier: the cost of generating high-level quantum chemistry data. We overcome this challenge by developing machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) that achieve multi-state multi-reference perturbation theory accuracy through various techniques, such as transfer, multi-state, and $\Delta$-learning. Applied to the methaniminium cation, our highest-fidelity transfer-learning model uncovers its complete photodissociation landscape following S$_2$ photoexcitation. The comprehensive XMCQDPT2/SA(3)-CASSCF(12,12) electronic structure description captures all competing decay channels, including S$_1$ branching into photoisomerization and direct H$_2$-loss pathways. Our results show that the population dynamics generally depends on the MLIP model, correlating with its performance. At the same time, the introduction of MLIP-uncertainty corrections based on the predictions of an ensemble of models brings different approaches into agreement, validating this metric as essential for reliable dynamics. To interpret the population dynamics, we introduce a wavepacket oscillation model - a mechanistically transparent, power-law kinetics framework that extracts state-specific lifetimes directly from first-principles simulations. The model quantitatively reproduces the ultrafast decay, creating a direct link between quantum transition probabilities and classical rate constants. The kinetic fits yield channel-specific lifetimes, supporting the recently discovered photochemical pathway mediated by a novel $\sigma\pi^*/S_0$ conical intersection.</description>

      <title>Mapping Still Matters: Coarse-Graining with Machine Learning Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07692v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling enables molecular simulations to reach time and length scales inaccessible to fully atomistic methods. For classical CG models, the choice of mapping, that is, how atoms are grouped into CG sites, is a major determinant of accuracy and transferability. At the same time, the emergence of machine learning potentials (MLPs) offers new opportunities to build CG models that can in principle learn the true potential of the mean force for any mapping. In this work, we systematically investigate how the choice of mapping influences the representations learned by equivariant MLPs by studying liquid hexane, amino acids, and polyalanine. We find that when the length scales of bonded and nonbonded interactions overlap, unphysical bond permutations can occur. We also demonstrate that correctly encoding species and maintaining stereochemistry are crucial, as neglecting either introduces unphysical symmetries. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting CG mappings compatible with modern architectures and guide the development of transferable CG models.</description>

      <title>Analytic First Derivatives of Aufbau Suppressed Coupled Cluster Theory and their Perturbative Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derived and implemented analytic first derivatives for Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster theory to calculate the one-body reduced density matrix, from which excited state natural orbitals and one-body properties, like atomic populations and dipole moments, are obtained. We utilized the natural orbitals to refine the ASCC solution for simple valence and Rydberg systems, exploring the process of repeatedly solving the ASCC equations in successive natural orbital bases to achieve independence from the starting molecular orbitals. For dipole moments in small molecules where high-level comparison data is available, we find that the accuracy of ASCC essentially matches that of linear response and equation-of-motion coupled cluster as long as care is taken to preserve the response's perturbative completeness.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Photoinduced Carrier Transfer in Fluorinated Quasi-2D Perovskites Governing Enhanced Photocurrent Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) metal halide perovskites exhibit rich phase heterogeneity that profoundly influences light-matter interactions and charge transport. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing carrier transfer across distinct phases remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate effective electron-hole separation in fluorinated multilayered quasi-2D perovskite films nominally prepared for three layers, using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The films are revealed to comprise a heterogeneous phase distribution (with 1, 2, 3 layers and bulk) naturally stacked along the growth direction. Our ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, show the type-two band alignment between the small-n (layer number) phases and the bulk. This alignment drives charge separation via both direct and sequential carrier transfer mechanisms, whereby electrons preferentially migrate into the bulk domains while holes accumulate in the small-n layers, extending even to single layer phase-a process only rarely observed in previous studies. The nearly symmetric transfer times of electrons and holes yield an efficient and balanced spatial separation of carriers. Global target analysis employing a carrier transfer model quantitatively reproduces the spectral evolution, providing a rigorous validation of the mechanism. Nonetheless, we found photocurrent enhancement in the diode devices of this quasi-2D perovskite as a consequence of the efficient transfer of photocarriers in the opposite directions. This work delivers a comprehensive picture of interphase charge transfer in fluorinated quasi-2D perovskites and highlights strategies to engineer directional separation pathways for high-performance photovoltaic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>From orbital analysis to active learning: an integrated strategy for the accelerated design of TADF emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters must satisfy two competing requirements: small singlet-triplet energy gaps for thermal upconversion and sufficient spin-orbit coupling for fast reverse intersystem crossing. Predicting these properties accurately demands expensive calculations. We address this using a validated semi-empirical protocol (GFN2-xTB geometries, sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB excited states) on 747 molecules, combined with charge-transfer descriptors from Natural Transition Orbital analysis. The hole-electron spatial overlap She emerges as a key predictor, accounting for 21% of feature importance for the triplet state alone. Our best model (Support Vector Regression) reaches MAE = 0.024 eV and R2 = 0.96 for $\Delta E_{ST}$. Active learning reduces the data needed to reach target accuracy by approximately 25% compared to random sampling. Three application domains are explored: NIR-emitting probes for bioimaging, photocatalytic sensitizers, and fast-response materials for photodetection.</description>

      <title>Deep learning recognition and analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds based on experimental and synthetic infrared absorption spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are organic molecules that have low boiling points and therefore easily evaporate into the air. They pose significant risks to human health, making their accurate detection the crux of efforts to monitor and minimize exposure. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy enables the ultrasensitive detection at low-concentrations of VOCs in the atmosphere by measuring their IR absorption spectra. However, the complexity of the IR spectra limits the possibility to implement VOC recognition and quantification in real-time. While deep neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used for the recognition of complex data structures, they typically require massive datasets for the training phase. Here, we create an experimental VOC dataset for nine different classes of compounds at various concentrations, using their IR absorption spectra. To further increase the amount of spectra and their diversity in term of VOC concentration, we augment the experimental dataset with synthetic spectra created via conditional generative NNs. This allows us to train robust discriminative NNs, able to reliably identify the nine VOCs, as well as to precisely predict their concentrations. The trained NN is suitable to be incorporated into sensing devices for VOCs recognition and analysis.</description>

      <title>MaxwellLink: A unified framework for self-consistent light-matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in light-matter simulations is bridging the disparate time and length scales of electrodynamics and molecular dynamics. Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of external molecular drivers. This decoupled architecture allows users to seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Crucially, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. Benefiting from the socket-based design, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics.</description>

      <title>GENIUS: An Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Design and Execution of Simulation Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive atomistic simulations have propelled materials discovery, yet routine setup and debugging still demand computer specialists. This know-how gap limits Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), where state-of-the-art codes exist but remain cumbersome for non-experts. We address this bottleneck with GENIUS, an AI-agentic workflow that fuses a smart Quantum ESPRESSO knowledge graph with a tiered hierarchy of large language models supervised by a finite-state error-recovery machine. Here we show that GENIUS translates free-form human-generated prompts into validated input files that run to completion on $\approx$80% of 295 diverse benchmarks, where 76% are autonomously repaired, with success decaying exponentially to a 7% baseline. Compared with LLM-only baselines, GENIUS halves inference costs and virtually eliminates hallucinations. The framework democratizes electronic-structure DFT simulations by intelligently automating protocol generation, validation, and repair, opening large-scale screening and accelerating ICME design loops across academia and industry worldwide.</description>

      <title>Compression-driven jamming in porous cohesive aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I investigate the compression-driven jamming behavior of two-dimensional porous aggregates composed of cohesive, frictionless disks. Three types of initial aggregates are prepared using different aggregation procedures, namely, reaction-limited aggregation (RLA), ballistic particle-cluster aggregation (BPCA), and diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), to elucidate the influence of aggregate morphology. Using distinct-element-method simulations with a shrinking circular boundary, I numerically obtain the pressure as a function of the packing fraction $\phi$. For the densest RLA and the intermediate BPCA aggregates, a clear jamming transition is observed at a critical packing fraction $\phi_{\rm J}$, below which the pressure vanishes and above which a finite pressure emerges; the transition is less distinct for the most porous DLA aggregates. The jamming threshold depends on the initial structure and, when extrapolated to infinite system size, approaches $\phi_{\rm J} = 0.765 \pm 0.004$ for RLA, $0.727 \pm 0.004$ for BPCA, and $0.602 \pm 0.023$ for DLA, where the errors denote the standard error. Above $\phi_{\rm J}$, the pressure follows $P \approx A {( \phi - \phi_{\rm J} )}^{2}$, which implies that the bulk modulus $K$ of jammed aggregates is proportional to $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Rigid-cluster analysis of jammed aggregates shows that the average coordination number within the largest rigid cluster increases linearly with $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Taken together, these relations suggest that the elastic response of compressed porous aggregates is analogous to that of random spring networks.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Parallelized, GPU-Accelerated Photochemical Model, XODIAC, with Built-in Equilibrium Chemistry and Multiple Chemical Networks for Exoplanetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has delivered high-quality atmospheric observations and expanded the known chemical inventory of exoplanetary atmospheres, opening new avenues for atmospheric chemistry modeling to interpret these data. Here, we present XODIAC, a fast, GPU-accelerated, one-dimensional photochemical model with a built-in equilibrium chemistry solver, an updated thermochemical database, and three chemical reaction networks. This framework enables comparative atmospheric chemistry studies, including the newly developed XODIAC-2025 network, a state-of-the-art C-H-O-N-P-S-Metals network, linking 594 species through 7,720 reactions. The other two are existing, publicly available C-H-O-N-S and C-H-O-N-S-Metals networks, from the established photochemical models VULCAN and ARGO, respectively, which are commonly used in the community. The XODIAC model has been rigorously benchmarked on the well-studied hot Jupiter HD 189733 b, with results compared against these two models. Benchmarking shows excellent agreement and demonstrates that, when the same chemical network and initial conditions are used, the numerical scheme for solving atmospheric chemistry does not significantly affect the results. We also revisited the atmospheric chemistry of HD 189733 b and performed a comparative analysis across the three networks. Sulfur chemistry shows the least variation across networks, carbon chemistry shows slightly more, and phosphorus chemistry varies the most, primarily due to the introduction of unique PHO and PN pathways comprising 390 reactions in the XODIAC-2025 network. These findings highlight XODIAC's capability to advance exoplanetary atmospheric chemistry and provide a robust framework for comparative exoplanetology.</description>

      <title>Nanocrystals Heterostructures based on Halide Perovskites and Metal Sulfides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of nanocrystal heterostructures composed of CsPbCl3 and PbS domains sharing an epitaxial interface. We were able to promote the growth of a PbS domain (in competition with the more commonly observed Pb4S3Cl2 one) on top of the CsPbCl3 domain by employing Mn2$^+$ ions, the latter acting most likely as scavengers of Cl$^-$ ions. Complete suppression of the Pb4S3Cl2 domain growth was then achieved by additionally selecting an appropriate sulfur source (bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide, which also acted as scavenger of Cl$^-$ ions), and reaction temperature. In the heterostructures, emission from the perovskite domain was quenched, while emission from the PbS domain was observed, pointing to a type-I band alignment, as confirmed by calculations. These heterostructures in turn could be exploited to prepare second-generation heterostructures through selective ion exchange on the individual domains (halide ion exchange on CsPbCl3, cation exchange on PbS). We demonstrate the cases of Cl$^-$ to Br$^-$ and Pb2$^+$ to Cu$^+$ exchanges, which deliver CsPbBr3@PbS and CsPbCl3@Cu2-xS epitaxial heterostructures, respectively.</description>

      <title>Polaron-Driven Spin Funneling through Rashba-Split Bands in Mixed-Phase Quasi-Two-Dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) exhibit pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as a result of their heavy metal constituents, leading to distinctive electronic properties such as Rashba type band splitting which make them promising candidates for next generation spintronic applications. Here, using circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and polarization dependent pump-probe spectroscopy, we found that spin polarization is present across all phases of our two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) mixed-phase perovskites, (C6H7SNH3)2 (CH3NH3)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n=1-4), irrespective of the number of inorganic layers. The origin of these spin polarized bands is attributed to the Rashba effect. Interestingly, the highly disordered nature of this system facilitates remarkably efficient ultrafast funneling of photoexcited spin-polarized excitons from the pure 2D phase (n=1) to higher-n phases at room temperature. We demonstrate that significant polaron formation due to the inherent soft crystal lattice and higher exciton-phonon interaction is responsible for the observed spin funneling effect in mixed-phase 2D RP perovskites. Polaron act as a protective mechanism for spin-polarized excitons, preserving their spin information through the screening of omnipresent phonon-induced momentum scattering. These findings not only offer valuable guidance for the design of 2D RP perovskites with pronounced Rashba effects but also unveil a compelling class of solution-processed perovskites capable of efficient spin-preserving energy transport at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Improving the Stability of Colloidal CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals with an Alkylphosphonium Bromide as Surface Ligand Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we synthesised a phosphonium-based ligand, trimethyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium bromide (TTP-Br), and employed it in the post-synthesis surface treatment of Cs-oleate-capped CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the NCs increased from 60% to more than 90%, as a consequence of replacing Cs-oleate with TTP-Br ligand pairs. Density functional theory calculations revealed that TTP+ ions bind to the NC surface by occupying Cs+ surface sites and orienting one of their P-CH3 bonds perpendicular to the surface, akin to quaternary ammonium passivation. Importantly, TTP-Br-capped NCs exhibited higher stability in air compared to didodecyldimethylammonium bromide-capped CsPbBr3 NCs (which is considered a benchmark system), retaining 90% of their PLQY after six weeks of air exposure. Light-emitting diodes fabricated with TTP-Br-capped NCs achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.2 %, demonstrating the potential of phosphonium-based molecules as surface ligands for CsPbBr3 NCs in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Generalized density functional theory framework for the non-linear density response of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: III-V colloidal quantum dots are widely studied for their applications as detectors and emitters from visible to short-wave infrared. They might also be used in the mid-infrared if they can be stably n-doped to access their intraband transitions. Mid-infrared intraband transitions are therefore studied for InAs, InAs/InP, and InAs/ZnSe colloidal quantum dots with an energy gap at 1.4 micron. Using electrochemistry, the quantum dot films show state-resolved mobility, state-resolved electron filling, and intraband absorption in the 3-8 micron range. The InAs/ZnSe films need a more reducing potential than InAs, but the InAs/InP films need a lower reduction potential. As a result, we found that dry films of InAs/InP dots show stable n-doping of the 1Se state, with a steady-state intraband absorption in the 3-5 micron range, and intraband luminescence at 5 micron. low-toxicity, high thermal stability, and stable n-doping, InAs quantum dots become an interesting material for mid-infrared applications.</description>

Abstract: In orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT), an equation exists for $\psi = \sqrt n$, the square root of the ground state electron density $n$. We show that $\psi$ cannot be expanded as a linear combination of elements of a complete set of basis functions except in the case of one or two electron systems. This is unlike the case for the ground state of a system of identical bosons in which the square root of the ground state bosonic density can have an expansion as a linear combination of elements of a complete set of basis functions.</description>

Abstract: Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) require vast amounts of atomic structure data to learn forces and energies, and their performance continues to improve with training set size. Meanwhile, the even greater quantities of accompanying data in the Hamiltonian matrix H behind these datasets has so far gone unused for this purpose. Here, we provide a recipe for integrating the orbital interaction data within H towards training pipelines for atomic-level properties. We first introduce HELM ("Hamiltonian-trained Electronic-structure Learning for Molecules"), a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian prediction model which bridges the gap between Hamiltonian prediction and universal MLIPs by scaling to H of structures with 100+ atoms, high elemental diversity, and large basis sets including diffuse functions. To accompany HELM, we release a curated Hamiltonian matrix dataset, 'OMol_CSH_58k', with unprecedented elemental diversity (58 elements), molecular size (up to 150 atoms), and basis set (def2-TZVPD). Finally, we introduce 'Hamiltonian pretraining' as a method to extract meaningful descriptors of atomic environments even from a limited number atomic structures, and repurpose this shared embedding space to improve performance on energy-prediction in low-data regimes. Our results highlight the use of electronic interactions as a rich and transferable data source for representing chemical space.</description>

      <title>Double-pair Coulomb and Breit photon correction to the correlated relativistic energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simplest, algebraic quantum-electrodynamical corrections, due to the double-negative energy subspace and instantaneous interactions, are computed to the no-pair energy of two-spin-1/2-fermion systems. Numerical results are reported for two-electron atoms with a clamped nucleus and positronium-like genuine two-particle systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation provides the theoretical framework, and numerical methods have been developed for its equal-time time-slice. In practice, it requires solving a sixteen-component eigenvalue equation with a two-particle Dirac Hamiltonian, including the appropriate interaction. The double-pair corrections can either be included in the interaction part of the eigenvalue equation or treated as a perturbation to the no-pair Hamiltonian.

Abstract: Mineral dust aerosols strongly influence Earth's climate by acting as ice-nucleating particles (INPs). Feldspar minerals, particularly K-feldspar, are recognized as dominant INPs, and a previous study attributed this behavior to (100) surfaces exposed at defects. Using machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate ice nucleation on all K-feldspar surfaces. We identify the (110) surface, exposed at defects such as steps, as the most active plane for ice formation. This surface uniquely structures interfacial water into an arrangement resembling that on the (110) surface of cubic ice, providing an optimal template for nucleation. Using advanced sampling, we directly observe the formation of clusters with cubic-ice structure and their orientation agrees with experiment. These results provide a molecular-level explanation of how ice forms in our planet's atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Learning of Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are a promising approach to balance the accuracy of quantum mechanics with the efficiency of classical potentials, yet selecting an optimal model amid increasingly diverse architectures that delivers reliable force predictions and stable simulations remains a core pratical challenge. Here we introduce EL-MLFFs, an ensemble learning framework that uses a stacking methodology to integrate predictions from diverse base MLFFs. Our approach constructs a graph representation where a graph neural network (GNN) acts as a meta-model to refine the initial force predictions. We present two meta-model architectures: a computationally efficient direct fitting model and a physically-principled conservative model that ensures energy conservation. The framework is evaluated on a diverse range of systems, including single molecules (methane), surface chemistry (methanol/Cu(100)), molecular dynamics benchmarks (MD17), and the MatPES materials dataset. Results show that EL-MLFFs improves predictive accuracy across these domains. For molecular systems, it reduces force errors and improves the simulation stability compared to base models. For materials, the method yields lower formation energy errors on the WBM test set. The EL- MLFFs framework offers a systematic approach to address challenges of model selection and the accuracy-stability trade-off in molecular and materials simulations.</description>

      <title>Look the Other Way: Designing 'Positive' Molecules with Negative Data via Task Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., `positive' molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions' - without accessing any positively labeled data - and moving models in the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed on 33 design experiments with distinct molecular entities (small molecules, proteins), model architectures, and scales, molecular task arithmetic generated more diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules in general. Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable complex design properties, such as good docking scores to a protein. With its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic bears the potential to become the de facto transfer learning strategy for de novo molecule design.</description>

      <title>A Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian Model for Hyperthermal Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisions of atoms and molecules with metal surfaces create electronic excitations in the metal, leading to nonadiabatic energy dissipation, inelastic scattering, and sticking. Mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulation methods, such as molecular dynamics with electronic friction, are able to capture nonadiabatic energy loss during dynamics at metal surfaces. Hydrogen atom scattering from semiconductors, on the other hand, exhibits strong adsorbate-surface energy transfer only when the projectile kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the substrate. Electronic friction fails to describe this effect. Here, we report a first-principles parameterization of a simple Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian model of hydrogen atom gas-surface scattering on Ge(111)$c(2\times8)$, for which hyperthermal scattering experiments have been reported. We subsequently perform independent-electron surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics simulations on this model, and validate these results through numerically exact quantum-dynamical simulations using the hierarchical equation of motion approach. While mean-field dynamics yield weak nonadiabatic energy loss that is independent of the initial kinetic energy, independent electron surface hopping simulations qualitatively agree with the experimental observation that nonadiabatic energy dissipation only occurs if the initial kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the surface.</description>

      <title>Quantum Seniority-based Subspace Expansion: Linear Combinations of Short-Circuit Unitary Transformations for the Electronic Structure Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum SENiority-based Subspace Expansion (Q-SENSE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that interpolates between the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Configuration Interaction (CI) methods. It constructs Hamiltonian matrix elements on a quantum device and solves the resulting eigenvalue problem classically. Unlike other expansion-based methods -- such as Quantum Subspace Expansion (QSE), Quantum Krylov Algorithms, and the Non-Orthogonal Quantum Eigensolver -- Q-SENSE introduces seniority operators as artificial symmetries to construct orthogonal basis states. This seniority-symmetry-based approach reduces one of the primary limitations of VQE on near-term quantum hardware -- circuit depth -- at the cost of measuring additional matrix elements. The artificial symmetries also reduce the number of Hamiltonian terms that must be measured, as only a small fraction of the terms couple basis states in different seniority subspaces. With all these merits, Q-SENSE offers a scalable and resource-efficient route to quantum advantage on near-term quantum devices and in the early fault-tolerant regime.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Exact Unitary Transformations for Many-body Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact unitary transformations play a central role in the analysis and simulation of many-body quantum systems, yet the conditions under which they can be carried out exactly and efficiently remain incompletely understood. We show that exact transformations arise whenever the adjoint action of a unitary's generator defines a linear map within a finite-dimensional operator space. In this regime, there exists a finite-degree polynomial that annihilates the adjoint map, rendering the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion finite. We identify the role of Lie algebras and their modules in producing finite BCH expansions in all known cases. This perspective brings together previously disparate examples of exact transformations under a single unifying principle and clarifies how algebraic relations between generators and transformed operators determine the polynomial degree of the transformation. We illustrate this framework for previously known cases of efficient unitary transformations including unitary coupled-cluster and Pauli product generators. Using this framework, we propose a new class of fermionic generators that can be used for efficient transformations. The result establishes sufficient algebraic conditions for when exact unitary transformations are possible and provides new strategies for reducing their computational cost in quantum simulation and constructing feasible unitary transformations.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanoscale Molecular Organization in Liquid Crystals via Cryogenic Atom Probe Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While liquid crystals (LCs) have been extensively studied, obtaining a comprehensive nanoscale picture of their molecular organization remains challenging, as conventional techniques face an intrinsic trade-off between spatial and chemical resolution. Here, cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) is introduced as a new analytical approach for LC materials, using 4'-Pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) and 4'-Octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) as representative model compounds. This was enabled by a tailored cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) protocol optimized for small organic molecules. The method enables controlled field evaporation of both intact molecules and diagnostic fragments, achieving over 90% molecular retention while preserving four characteristic dissociation patterns. By spatially correlating these fragmentation profiles with the local electric field derived from the tip geometry, we reveal field-directed dissociation pathways of CB molecules. In parallel, the distribution of intact molecular ions enables nanoscale visualization of material structure: we resolve homogeneous mixing of 5CB and 8CB in the nematic phase and directly observe the sub-nanometer crystalline layering in a supercooled 8CB sample, with contrast to the surrounding amorphous matrix suggesting the presence of a solid-liquid interface. This work establishes cryo-APT as a new powerful analytical platform for LC research and reveals its broad potential for application in soft matter systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal stability originates the vanishing of the specific heats at the absolute zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the vanishing of the heat capacities as $T\to0^+$ and the thermal stability is examined. The heat capacities vanish as fast as or faster than $T$ as $T\to0^+$ for states at the phase space boundary ($T=0$) to sustain the standard thermal stability criterion $U_{ss}&gt;0$. Conversely, weakly vanishing heat capacities, which signify a loss of curvature in $U(S)$ at $T=0$, are the signature of a critical condition precisely at $T=0$, as exemplified in marginal Fermi liquids. Therefore, the vanishing of the specific heat should be viewed not as a new law but as a confirmatory result of the existing framework of thermodynamics.</description>
