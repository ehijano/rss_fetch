      <title>Inelastic dilatancy as a mechanism for coseismic fluid depressurization of a shallow fault zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrologic observations and experimental studies indicate that inelastic dilation from coseismic fault damage can cause substantial pore pressure reduction, yet most near-fault hydromechanical models ignore such inelastic effects. Here, we present a 3-D groundwater flow model incorporating the effects of inelastic dilation based on an earthquake dynamic rupture model with inelastic off fault deformation, both on pore pressure and permeability enhancement. Our results show that inelastic dilation causes mostly notable depressurization within 1 to 2 km off the fault at shallow depths (&lt; 3 km). We found agreement between our model predictions and recent field observations, namely that both sides of the fault can experience large magnitude (~tens of meters) water level drawdowns. For comparison, simulations considering only elastic strain produced smaller water level changes (~several meters) and contrasting signs of water level change on either side of the fault. The models show that inelastic dilation is a mechanism for coseismic fault depressurization at shallow depths. While the inelastic dilation is a localized phenomenon which is most pronounced in the fault zone, the pressure gradients produced in the coseismic phase have a broader effect, increasing fluid migration back into the fault zone in the postseismic phase. We suggest field hydrologic measurements in the very near field (1 to 2 km) of active faults could capture damage-related pore pressure signals produced by inelastic dilation, helping improve our understanding of fault mechanics and groundwater management near active faults.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Geotechnical Engineering: A Critical Assessment of PINNs and Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods -- physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), deep operator networks (DeepONet), and graph network simulators (GNS) -- are increasingly proposed for geotechnical problems. This paper tests these methods against traditional solvers on canonical problems: wave propagation and beam-foundation interaction. PINNs run 90,000 times slower than finite difference with larger errors. DeepONet requires thousands of training simulations and breaks even only after millions of evaluations. Multi-layer perceptrons fail catastrophically when extrapolating beyond training data -- the common case in geotechnical prediction. GNS shows promise for geometry-agnostic simulation but faces scaling limits and cannot capture path-dependent soil behavior. For inverse problems, automatic differentiation through traditional solvers recovers material parameters with sub-percent accuracy in seconds. We recommend: use automatic differentiation for inverse problems; apply site-based cross-validation to account for spatial autocorrelation; reserve neural networks for problems where traditional solvers are genuinely expensive and predictions remain within the training envelope. When a method is four orders of magnitude slower with less accuracy, it is not a viable replacement for proven solvers.</description>

      <title>When the Earth and Sky Dance: Seismic Shakes Meet Weather Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new modelling approach shows how the Earth's hidden vibrations may drive global weather dynamics and atmospheric pressure variations, hinting that the planet's own beat could be imprinted on our climate. The atmospheric rotational patterns of the mean sea level pressure, in connection to the development of powerful storms, are shown to be caused by Earth's rotational elastic dynamics and earthquake-induced oscillations. These seismic excitations are discussed in relation to storm formation and the global atmospheric patterns of high-pressure regions.</description>

      <title>Anomaly detection in satellite imagery through temporal inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.</description>

      <title>Melting curve of correlated iron at Earth's core conditions from machine-learned DFT+DMFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable constraints on iron's melting curve at Earth's inner-core boundary require accurate finite-temperature electronic correlations, yet DFT+DMFT calculations remain too costly for large-scale thermodynamic sampling. Here, we develop a machine-learning accelerator for charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT by training E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks to predict the local self-energy and Fermi level from atomic environments, providing an efficient warm start to the DMFT self-consistency loop. Using high-throughput data for Fe, FeO, and NiO, we obtain a 2-4 times reuduction in DMFT iterations. Leveraging this improvement, we generate correlated energies and forces for Fe at core pressures, train a neural-network interatomic potential, and determine the melting curve via two-phase coexistence simulations. We obtain a predicted melting temperature of 6225 K at 330 GPa.</description>

      <title>Backward similarity solution of the Boussinesq groundwater equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer resting on a horizontal impermeable layer with a boundary condition of a rapid increase in the source water level is considered in this work. The newly introduced condition, referred to as the backward power-law head condition, represents a situation where the water level in the adjacent water body increases more rapidly than do conventional problems, which can only represent a situation akin to a traveling wave under rising water level conditions, given its consideration of infinite time. This problem admits the similarity transformation which allows the nonlinear partial differential equation to be converted into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation via the Boltzmann transformation. The reduced boundary value problem is interpreted as the initial value problem for a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which can be numerically solved via Shampine's method. The numerical solutions are in good agreement with Kalashinikov's special solution, which is also introduced into the Boussinesq equation. We find that the solution is consistent with the limit of the forward power-law head condition. The new approximate analytical solution and the associated wetting front position are derived by assuming that the solution has the form of quadratic polynomials, which enables the description of the time progression of a real front position. The obtained approximation is compared to Shampine's solution to check the accuracy. Furthermore, the finite element method is applied to the original partial differential equation (PDE), which validates Shampine's solution for use as a benchmark.</description>
