      <title>Literature Filtering for Systematic Reviews with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying critical research within the growing body of academic work is an essential element of quality research. Systematic review processes, used in evidence-based medicine, formalise this as a procedure that must be followed in a research program. However, it comes with an increasing burden in terms of the time required to identify the important articles of research for a given topic. In this work, we develop a method for building a general-purpose filtering system that matches a research question, posed as a natural language description of the required content, against a candidate set of articles obtained via the application of broad search terms. Our results demonstrate that transformer models, pre-trained on biomedical literature then fine tuned for the specific task, offer a promising solution to this problem. The model can remove large volumes of irrelevant articles for most research questions.</description>

      <title>Twitter should now be referred to as X: How academics, journals and publishers need to make the nomenclatural transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we note how academics, journals and publishers should no longer refer to the social media platform Twitter as such, rather as X. Relying on Google Scholar, we found 16 examples of papers published in the last months of 2023 - essentially during the transition period between Twitter and X - that used Twitter and X, but in different ways. Unlike that transition period in which the binary Twitter/X could have been used in academic papers, we suggest that papers should no longer refer to Twitter as Twitter, but only as X, except for historical studies about that social media platform, because such use would be factually incorrect.</description>
