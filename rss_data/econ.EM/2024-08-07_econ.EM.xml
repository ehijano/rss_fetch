      <title>A nonparametric test for diurnal variation in spot correlation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The association between log-price increments of exchange-traded equities, as measured by their spot correlation estimated from high-frequency data, exhibits a pronounced upward-sloping and almost piecewise linear relationship at the intraday horizon. There is notably lower-on average less positive-correlation in the morning than in the afternoon. We develop a nonparametric testing procedure to detect such deterministic variation in a correlation process. The test statistic has a known distribution under the null hypothesis, whereas it diverges under the alternative. It is robust against stochastic correlation. We run a Monte Carlo simulation to discover the finite sample properties of the test statistic, which are close to the large sample predictions, even for small sample sizes and realistic levels of diurnal variation. In an application, we implement the test on a monthly basis for a high-frequency dataset covering the stock market over an extended period. The test leads to rejection of the null most of the time. This suggests diurnal variation in the correlation process is a nontrivial effect in practice.</description>

      <title>Efficient Asymmetric Causality Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03137v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric causality tests are increasingly gaining popularity in different scientific fields. This approach corresponds better to reality since logical reasons behind asymmetric behavior exist and need to be considered in empirical investigations. Hatemi-J (2012) introduced the asymmetric causality tests via partial cumulative sums for positive and negative components of the variables operating within the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. However, since the n residuals across the equations in the VAR model are not independent, the ordinary least squares method for estimating the parameters is not efficient. Additionally, asymmetric causality tests mean having different causal parameters (i.e., for positive or negative components), thus, it is crucial to assess not only if these causal parameters are individually statistically significant, but also if their difference is statistically significant. Consequently, tests of difference between estimated causal parameters should explicitly be conducted, which are neglected in the existing literature. The purpose of the current paper is to deal with these issues explicitly. An application is provided, and ten different hypotheses pertinent to the asymmetric causal interaction between two largest financial markets worldwide are efficiently tested within a multivariate setting.</description>

      <title>PySDTest: a Python/Stata Package for Stochastic Dominance Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce PySDTest, a Python/Stata package for statistical tests of stochastic dominance. PySDTest implements various testing procedures such as Barrett and Donald (2003), Linton et al. (2005), Linton et al. (2010), and Donald and Hsu (2016), along with their extensions. Users can flexibly combine several resampling methods and test statistics, including the numerical delta method (D\"umbgen, 1993; Hong and Li, 2018; Fang and Santos, 2019). The package allows for testing advanced hypotheses on stochastic dominance relations, such as stochastic maximality among multiple prospects. We first provide an overview of the concepts of stochastic dominance and testing methods. Then, we offer practical guidance for using the package and the Stata command pysdtest. We apply PySDTest to investigate the portfolio choice problem between the daily returns of Bitcoin and the S&amp;P 500 index as an empirical illustration. Our findings indicate that the S&amp;P 500 index returns second-order stochastically dominate the Bitcoin returns.</description>
