      <title>WEAVE First Light Observations: Origin and Dynamics of the Shock Front in Stephan's Quintet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the large-scale shock front in Stephan's Quintet, a byproduct of past and ongoing interactions. Using integral-field spectroscopy from the new William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (WEAVE), recent 144 MHz observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), and archival data from the Very Large Array and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we obtain new measurements of key shock properties and determine its impact on the system. Harnessing the WEAVE large integral field unit's (LIFU) field of view (90 $\times$ 78 arcsec$^{2}$), spectral resolution ($R\sim2500$) and continuous wavelength coverage across the optical band, we perform robust emission line modeling and dynamically locate the shock within the multi-phase intergalactic medium (IGM) with higher precision than previously possible. The shocking of the cold gas phase is hypersonic, and comparisons with shock models show that it can readily account for the observed emission line ratios. In contrast, we demonstrate that the shock is relatively weak in the hot plasma visible in X-rays (with Mach number of $\mathcal{M} \sim 2 - 4$), making it inefficient at producing the relativistic particles needed to explain the observed synchrotron emission. Instead, we propose that it has led to an adiabatic compression of the medium, which has increased the radio luminosity ten-fold. Comparison of the Balmer line-derived extinction map with the molecular gas and hot dust observed with JWST suggests that pre-existing dust may have survived the collision, allowing the condensation of H$_{2}$ - a key channel for dissipating the shock energy.</description>

      <title>A Glimpse at the New Redshift Frontier Through Abell S1063</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of five galaxy candidates at redshifts between $15.9&lt;z&lt;18.6$ in JWST observations from the GLIMPSE survey. These robust sources were identified using a combination of Lyman-break selection and photometric redshift estimates. The ultra-deep NIRCam imaging from GLIMPSE, combined with the strong gravitational lensing of the Abell S1063 galaxy cluster, allows us to probe an intrinsically fainter population (down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17.5$ mag) than previously achievable. These galaxies have absolute magnitudes ranging from $M_{\rm UV}= -17.7$ to $-18.0$ mag, with UV continuum slopes between $\beta \simeq -2.3$ and $\beta \simeq -3.0$, consistent with young, dust-free stellar populations. The number density of these objects, log$_{\rm 10}$ ($\phi$/[Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$])=$-3.43^{+0.28}_{-0.64}$ at $M_{\rm UV}=-18$ is in clear tension with pre-JWST theoretical predictions, extending the over-abundance of galaxies from $z\sim10$ to $z\sim 18.6$. These results, together with the scarcity of brighter galaxies in other public surveys, suggest a steep decline in the bright-end of the UV luminosity function at $z \sim 17$, implying efficient star formation and possibly a close connection to the halo mass function at these redshifts. Testing a variety of star formation histories suggests that these sources are plausible progenitors of the unusually UV-bright galaxies that JWST now routinely uncovers at $z = 10-14$. Overall, our results indicate that the luminosity distribution of the earliest star-forming galaxies could be shifting towards fainter luminosities, implying that future surveys of cosmic dawn will need to explore this faint luminosity regime.</description>

      <title>CHANCES, The Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey: selection and initial characterization of clusters and superclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CHANCES, the CHileAN Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey, will study the evolution of galaxies in and around ${\sim}$150 massive galaxy clusters, from the local universe out to z=0.45. CHANCES will use the new 4MOST Spectroscopic Survey Facility on the VISTA 4m telescope to obtain spectra for ${\sim}$500,000 galaxies with magnitudes $r_\mathrm{AB} &lt; 20.5$, providing comprehensive spectroscopic coverage of each cluster out to $5r_{200}$. Its wide and deep scope will trace massive and dwarf galaxies from the surrounding filaments and groups to the cores of galaxy clusters, enabling the study of galaxy pre-processing and the role of the evolving environment on galaxy evolution. In this paper we present and characterize the sample of clusters and superclusters to be targeted by CHANCES. We used literature catalogues based on X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect to define the cluster sample in a homogeneous way, with attention to cluster mass and redshift, as well as the availability of ancillary data. We calibrated literature mass estimates from various surveys against each other and provide an initial mass estimate for each cluster, which we used to define the radial extent of the 4MOST coverage. We also present an initial assessment of the structure surrounding these clusters based on the redMaPPer red-sequence algorithm as a preview of some of the science CHANCES will enable.</description>

      <title>Radial Metallicity Gradients for the Chemically Selected Galactic Thin Disc Main-Sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {We present the radial metallicity gradients within the Galactic thin disc population through main-sequence stars selected on the chemical plane using GALAH DR3 accompanied with Gaia DR3 astrometric data. The [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Mg/H] radial gradients are estimated for guiding radius as $-0.074\pm 0.006$, $+0.004\pm0.002$, $-0.074\pm0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ and for the traceback early orbital radius as $-0.040\pm0.002$, $+0.003\pm 0.001$, $-0.039\pm 0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ for 66,545 thin-disc stars, respectively. Alteration of the chemical structure within the Galactic disc caused by the radial orbital variations complicates results for the radial metallicity gradient. The effect of radial orbital variations on the metallicity gradients as a function on time indicates the following results: (i) The presence of a gradient along the disc throughout the time for which the model provides similar prediction, (ii) the radial orbital variations becomes more pronounced with the age of the stellar population and (iii) the effect of radial orbital variations on the metallicity gradients is minimal. The effect of radial orbital variations is found to be at most 6\% which does not statistically affect the radial gradient results. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the chemical evolution within the Galactic disc and provide an important basis for further research.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic and Environmental Effects on the Distribution of Star Formation in TNG100 Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present radial profiles of luminosity-weighted age, $age_L$, and $\Delta \Sigma_{SFR}$ for various populations of high- and low- mass central and satellite galaxies in the TNG100 cosmological simulation. Using these profiles, we investigate the impact of intrinsic and environmental factors on the radial distribution of star formation. For both central galaxies and satellites, we investigate the effects of black hole mass, cumulative AGN feedback energy, morphology, halo mass, and local galaxy overdensity on the profiles. In addition, we investigate the dependence of radial profiles of the satellite galaxies as a function of the redshifts at which they joined their hosts, as well as the net change in star-forming gas mass since the satellites joined their host. We find that high-mass ($M_*&gt;10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$) central and satellite galaxies show evidence of inside-out quenching driven by AGN feedback. Effects from environmental processes only become apparent in averaged profiles at extreme halo masses and local overdensities. We find that the dominant quenching process for low-mass galaxies ($M_*&lt;10^{10} M_{\odot}$) is environmental, generally occurring at low halo mass and high local galaxy overdensity for low-mass central galaxies and at high host halo masses for low-mass satellite galaxies. Overall, we find that environmental processes generally drive quenching from the outside-in.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of the tidal tails of open star clusters in direct N-body integrations in Milgrom-law dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical QUMOND-simulations of star clusters orbiting in a Galactic disk potential show that the leading tidal arm of open star clusters contains tendentially more members than the trailing arm. However, these type of simulations are performed by solving the field-equations of QUMOND and already become non-practical for star cluster masses at around 5000 Msun. Nearby star clusters have masses of 1000 Msun or ~1000 particles and less/fewer and can currently not be simulated reliably in field-theoretical formulations of MOND. In order to handle particle numbers below the QUMOND-limit the star cluster is simulated in Milgrom-law dynamics (MLD): Milgrom's law is postulated to be valid for discrete systems in vectorial form. In order to suppress the Newtonisation of compact subsystems in the star cluster the gravitational force is softened below particle distances of 0.001 pc ~206 AU. Thus, MLD can only be considered as an approximation of a full MOND-theoretical description of discrete systems which are internally in the MOND regime. The MLD equations of motion are integrated by the standard Hermite scheme generally applied to Newtonian N-body systems, which is extended to solve for the accelerations and jerks associated with Milgrom's law. It is found that the tidal tails of a low-mass star cluster are populated asymmetrically in the MLD-treatment, very similar to the QUMOND simulations of the higher-mass star clusters. In the MLD-simulations the leading tail hosts up to twice as many members than the trailing arm and the low-mass open star cluster dissolves approximately 25% faster than in the respective Newtonian case.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: A galaxy-wide outflow in a Compton-thick mini-BAL quasar at z = 3.5 probed in emission and absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the distribution and properties of ionised gas in outflows driven by AGN is crucial for understanding the feedback mechanisms at play in extragalactic environments. In this study, we explore the connection between ionised outflows traced by rest-frame UV absorption and optical emission lines in GS133, a Compton thick AGN at z = 3.47. We combine observations from the JWST NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) with archival VLT VIMOS long-slit spectroscopic data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We perform a multi-component kinematic decomposition of the UV and optical line profiles to derive the physical properties of the absorbing and emitting gas in GS133. Our kinematic decomposition reveals two distinct components in the optical lines. The first component likely traces a rotating disk with a dynamical mass of 2e10 Msun. The second component corresponds to a galaxy-wide, bi-conical outflow, with a velocity of 1000 km/s and an extension of 3 kpc. The UV absorption lines show two outflow components, with bulk velocities v_out = -900 km/s and -1900 km/s, respectively. This characterises GS133 as a mini-BAL system. Balmer absorption lines with similar velocities are tentatively detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. Both photoionisation models and outflow energetics suggest that the ejected absorbing gas is located at 1-10 kpc from the AGN. We use 3D gas kinematic modelling to infer the orientation of the [O III] bi-conical outflow, and find that a portion of the emitting gas resides along our line of sight, suggesting that [O III] and absorbing gas clouds are partially mixed in the outflow. The derived mass-loading factor (i.e. the mass outflow rate divided by the SFR) of 1-10, and the kinetic coupling efficiency (i.e. the kinetic power divided by LAGN) of 0.1-1% per cent suggest that the outflow in GS133 provides significant feedback on galactic scales.</description>

      <title>G321.93-0.01: A Rare Site of Multiple Hub-Filament Systems with Evidence of Collision and Merging of Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hub-filament systems (HFSs) are potential sites of massive star formation (MSF). To understand the role of filaments in MSF and the origin of HFSs, we conducted a multi-scale and multi-wavelength observational investigation of the molecular cloud G321.93-0.01. The $^{13}$CO($J$ = 2-1) data reveal multiple HFSs, namely, HFS-1, HFS-2, and a candidate HFS (C-HFS). HFS-1 and HFS-2 exhibit significant mass accretion rates ($\dot{M}_{||}$ $&gt; 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) to their hubs (i.e., Hub-1 and Hub-2, respectively). Hub-1 is comparatively massive, having higher $\dot{M}_{||}$ than Hub-2, allowing to derive a relationship $\dot{M}_{||} \propto M^{\beta}_{\rm{hub}}$, with $\beta \sim1.28$. Detection of three compact HII regions within Hub-1 using MeerKAT 1.28 GHz radio continuum data and the presence of a clump (ATL-3), which meets Kauffmann &amp; Pillai's criteria for MSF, confirm the massive star-forming activity in HFS-1. We find several low-mass ALMA cores (1-9 $M_{\odot}$) inside ATL-3. The presence of a compact HII region at the hub of C-HFS confirms that it is active in MSF. Therefore, HFS-1 and C-HFS are in relatively evolved stages of MSF, where massive stars have begun ionizing their surroundings. Conversely, despite a high $\dot{M}_{||}$, the non-detection of radio continuum emission toward Hub-2 suggests it is in the relatively early stages of MSF. Analysis of $^{13}$CO($J$ = 2-1) data reveals that the formation of HFS-1 was likely triggered by the collision of a filamentary cloud about 1 Myr ago. In contrast, the relative velocities ($\gtrsim 1$ km s$^{-1}$) among the filaments of HFS-2 and C-HFS indicate their formation through the merging of filaments.</description>

      <title>Learning the Universe: Cosmological and Astrophysical Parameter Inference with Galaxy Luminosity Functions and Colours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first direct cosmological and astrophysical parameter inference from the combination of galaxy luminosity functions and colours using a simulation based inference approach. Using the Synthesizer code we simulate the dust attenuated ultraviolet--near infrared stellar emission from galaxies in thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS suite, including the Swift-EAGLE, Illustris-TNG, Simba &amp; Astrid galaxy formation models. For each galaxy we calculate the rest-frame luminosity in a number of photometric bands, including the SDSS $\textit{ugriz}$ and GALEX FUV &amp; NUV filters; this dataset represents the largest catalogue of synthetic photometry based on hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations produced to date, totalling &gt;200 million sources. From these we compile luminosity functions and colour distributions, and find clear dependencies on both cosmology and feedback. We then perform simulation based (likelihood-free) inference using these distributions, and obtain constraints on both cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Both colour distributions and luminosity functions provide complementary information on certain parameters when performing inference. Most interestingly we achieve constraints on $\sigma_8$, describing the clustering of matter. This is attributable to the fact that the photometry encodes the star formation--metal enrichment history of each galaxy; galaxies in a universe with a higher $\sigma_8$ tend to form earlier and have higher metallicities, which leads to redder colours. We find that a model trained on one galaxy formation simulation generalises poorly when applied to another, and attribute this to differences in the subgrid prescriptions, and lack of flexibility in our emission modelling. The photometric catalogues are publicly available at: https://camels.readthedocs.io/ .</description>

      <title>Aeos: Transport of metals from minihalos following Population III stellar feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how stellar feedback from the first stars (Population III) distributes metals through the interstellar and intergalactic medium using the star-by-star cosmological hydrodynamics simulation, Aeos. We find that energy injected from the supernovae of the first stars is enough to expel a majority of gas and injected metals beyond the virial radius of halos with mass $M_* \lesssim 10^7$ M$_\odot$, regardless of the number of supernovae. This prevents self-enrichment and results in a non-monotonic increase in metallicity at early times. Most minihalos ($M \gtrsim 10^5 \, \rm M_\odot$) do not retain significant fractions of the yields produced within their virial radii until they have grown to halo masses of $M \gtrsim 10^7 \, \rm M_\odot$. The loss of metals to regions well beyond the virial radius delays the onset of enriched star formation and extends the period that Population III star formation can persist. We also explore the contributions of different nucleosynthetic channels to 10 individual elements. On the timescale of the simulation (lowest redshift $z=14.3$), enrichment is dominated by core-collapse supernovae for all elements, but with a significant contribution from asymptotic giant branch winds to the s-process elements, which are normally thought to only be important at late times. In this work, we establish important mechanisms for early chemical enrichment which allows us to apply Aeos in later epochs to trace the evolution of enrichment during the complete transition from Population III to Population II stars.</description>

      <title>Determining the absolute chemical abundance of nitrogen and sulfur in the quasar outflow of 3C298</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Quasar outflows are key players in the feedback processes that influence the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium. The chemical abundance of these outflows provides crucial insights into their origin and impact. Aims. To determine the absolute abundances of nitrogen and sulfur and the physical conditions of the outflow seen in quasar 3C298. Methods. We analyze archival spectral data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for 3C298. We measure Ionic column densities from the absorption troughs and compare the results to photoionization predictions made by the Cloudy code for three different spectral energy distributions (SED), including MF87, UVsoft, and HE0238 SEDs. We also calculate the ionic column densities of excited and ground states of N iii to estimate the electron number density and location of the outflow using the Chianti atomic database. Results. The MF87, UVsoft, and HE0238 SEDs yield nitrogen and sulfur abundances at super-solar, solar, and sub-solar values, respectively, with a spread of 0.4 to 3 times solar. Additionally, we determined an electron number density of log(ne) greater than 3.3 cm-3, with the outflow possibly extending up to a maximum distance of 2.8 kpc. Conclusions. Our results indicate solar metallicity within a 60 percent uncertainty range, driven by variations in the chosen SED and photoionization models. This study underscores the importance of SEDs impact on determining chemical abundances in quasars outflows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering a wider range of possible abundances, spanning from sub solar to super solar values.</description>

      <title>A study of the star clusters' population in the giant molecular cloud G174+2.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure, interstellar absorption, color-magnitude diagrams, kinematics, and dynamical state of embedded star clusters in the star-forming region associated with the giant molecular cloud G174+2.5. Our investigation is based on photometric data from the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey catalog and astrometric data from the Gaia DR3 catalogs. First, we recover all the known embedded clusters and candidate clusters in the region using surface density maps. Then, for the detected clusters, we determine their general parameters: the center positions, radii, number of stars, and reddening. To evaluate the reddening, we use both the NICEST algorithm and the Q-method. Both methods produce consistent extinction maps in the regions of the four studied clusters. However, the Q-method yields a much smaller color scatter in the CMD. For four clusters in particular (S235~North-West, S235~A-B-C, S235~Central, and S235~East1+East2), we were able to compute individual membership probabilities, the cluster distances, the cluster masses, and their average proper motions. By building on these results, we have studied the clusters' kinematics and dynamics. Moreover, we estimate the mass of the gas component and the star formation efficiency (SFE) in the regions of these four clusters. Finally, we provide an estimate of the total energy of the stellar and gas components in the area of these four clusters to determine whether the clusters are bound (here we consider a `cluster' as the system `stars + gas'). The gravitational bound strongly depends on the region for which we estimate the gas mass. If we consider the mass of the entire cloud, all these four clusters turn out to be bound.</description>

      <title>The properties of the interstellar medium in dusty, star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2-4$: The shape of the CO spectral line energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxy populations exhibits diverse physical properties. We investigate the $^{12}$CO excitation of twelve dusty, luminous star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2-4$ by combining observations of the $^{12}$CO from $J_{\rm up} = 1$ to $J_{\rm up} = 8$. The spectral line energy distribution (SLED) has a similar shape to NGC 253, M82, and local ULIRGs, with much stronger excitation than the Milky Way inner disc. By combining with resolved dust continuum sizes from high-resolution $870$-$\mu$m ALMA observations and dust mass measurements determined from multi-wavelength SED fitting, we measure the relationship between the $^{12}$CO SLED and probable physical drivers of excitation: star-formation efficiency, the average intensity of the radiation field $\langle U\rangle$, and the star-formation rate surface density. The primary driver of high-$J_{\rm up}$ $^{12}$CO excitation in star-forming galaxies is star-formation rate surface density. We use the ratio of the CO($3-2$) and CO($6-5$) line fluxes to infer the CO excitation in each source and find that the average ratios for our sample are elevated compared to observations of low-redshift, less actively star-forming galaxies and agree well with predictions from numerical models that relate the ISM excitation to the star-formation rate surface density. The significant scatter in the line ratios of a factor $\approx 3$ within our sample likely reflects intrinsic variations in the ISM properties which may be caused by other effects on the excitation of the molecular gas, such as cosmic ray ionization rates and mechanical heating through turbulence dissipation.</description>

      <title>Bird's-eye View of Molecular Gas across Stephan's Quintet Galaxy Group and Intra-group Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the large-scale distribution and kinematics of cold molecular gas across the compact galaxy group Stephan's Quintet, based on CO(2-1) observations performed with the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) and CO(1-0) data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). We find coherent structures of molecular gas associated with the galaxies and intra-group medium, which follow the distribution of warm H$_{2}$ previously seen with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). CO is associated with a ridge of shocked gas that crosses the galaxy group, and with a spiral arm of the intruding galaxy NGC7318b, which interacts with the intra-group medium along the ridge. Although the ridge contains widespread shocks, turbulent gas, and warm H$_{2}$, the CO lines are narrower than elsewhere in Stephan's Quintet (FWHM~25-65 km/s), indicative of settled cold gas. At a distinctly different velocity, CO is found in the active galaxy NGC7319 and Northern star-forming region SQ-A. A bridge of turbulent molecular gas connects NGC7319 with the ridge, covering a gap of ~700 km/s between these structures. The gas excitation ranges from $L'_{\rm CO(2-1)}$/$L'_{\rm CO(1-0)}$ ~ 0.3 in the bridge and SQ-A, to ~0.5 along the ridge, to near unity in the center of NGC7319. We also detect either a molecular outflow or turbulent molecular gas associated with the radio source in NGC7319. These ACA data are part of a program with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and JWST to study molecular gas physics from the largest to the smallest scales across the intra-group medium of Stephan's Quintet.</description>

      <title>The MUSE Extremely Deep Field: Classifying the Spectral Shapes of Lya Emitting Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hydrogen Lyman-alpha (Lya) line shows a large variety of shapes which is caused by factors at different scales, from the interstellar medium to the intergalactic medium. This work aims to provide a systematic inventory and classification of the spectral shapes of Lya emission lines to understand the general population of high-redshift Lya emitting galaxies (LAEs). Using the data from the MUSE eXtremely Deep Field, we select 477 galaxies at z=2.8-6.6. We develop a method to classify Lya emission lines in four spectral and three spatial categories, by combining a spectral analysis with a narrow-band image analysis. We measure spectral properties, such as the peak separation and the blue-to-total flux ratio. To ensure a robust sample for statistical analysis, we define a final unbiased sample of 206 galaxies by applying thresholds for signal-to-noise ratio, peak separation, and Lya luminosity. Our analysis reveals that between 32% and 51% of the galaxies exhibit double-peaked profiles. This fraction seems to evolve dependently with the Lya luminosity, while we don't notice a severe decrease of this fraction with redshift. A large amount of these double-peaked profiles shows blue-dominated spectra, suggesting unique gas dynamics and inflow characteristics in some high-redshift galaxies. Among the double-peaked galaxies, 4% are spurious detections. Around 20% out of the 477 sources of the parent sample lie in a complex environment, meaning there are other clumps or galaxies at the same redshift within a distance of 30kpc. Our results suggest that the Lya double-peak fraction may trace the evolution of IGM attenuation, but faintest galaxies are needed to be observed at high redshift. In addition, it is crucial to obtain secure systemic redshifts for LAEs to better constrain the nature of the double-peaks.</description>

      <title>Not Just a Dot: the complex UV morphology and underlying properties of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze 99 photometrically selected Little Red Dots (LRDs) at z ~ 4-8 in the GOODS fields, leveraging ultra-deep JADES NIRCam short-wavelength (SW) data. We examine the morphology of 30 LRDs; the remaining 69 are predominantly compact, i.e. are strongly dominated by sources &lt; 400 pc in diameter and lack extended components even in stacked SW band images. Among the LRDs selected for morphological analysis, 50% show at least two distinct, associated sources or galaxy components, while the others appear as single sources with highly asymmetric structures. We find median stellar masses of log10(M*/Msun) = 9.07(-0.08)(+0.11) for pure stellar models with Av ~ 1.16(+0.11)(-0.21) mag, and log10(M*/Msun) = 9.67(+0.17)(-0.27) for models including AGNs, where Av ~ 2.74(+0.55)(-0.71) mag, consistent with recent results showing LRDs tend to have high stellar masses and dust content when fitted with AGN models. NIRSpec spectra are available for 15 sources, 6 of which fall within the morphological analysis sample and show multiple components. Among these 15, broad H-alpha emission is detected in 40%, with full-width half-maximum (FWHM) ranging from 1200 to 2900 km/s. One source exhibits broad H-beta emission with FWHM = 2000 +/- 500 km/s. Analysis of line ratios probing the interstellar medium (ISM) reveals a composite nature, indicating AGN activity combined with stellar processes. These findings suggest LRDs have a mixed nature, with AGN signatures in some cases linked to disturbed morphologies observed at rest-frame UV wavelengths.</description>

      <title>UPdec-Webb: A Dataset for Coaddition of JWST NIRCam Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the application of the image coaddition algorithm, Up-sampling and PSF Deconvolution Coaddition (UPDC), for stacking multiple exposure images captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam). By addressing the point spread function (PSF) effect, UPDC provides visually enhanced and sharper images. Furthermore, the anti-aliasing and super-resolution capabilities of UPDC make it easier to deblend sources overlapped on images, yielding a higher accuracy of aperture photometry. We apply this algorithm to the SMACS J0723 imaging data. Comparative analysis with the Drizzle algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in detecting faint sources, achieving accurate photometry, and effectively deblending (super-resolution) closely packed sources. {As a result, we have newly detected a pair of close binary stars that were previously unresolvable in the original exposures or the Drizzled image.} These improvements significantly benefit various scientific projects conducted by JWST. The resulting dataset, named "UPdec-Webb", can be accessible through the official website of the Chinese Virtual Observatory (ChinaVO).</description>

      <title>3D Localization of FRB 20190425A for Its Potential Host Galaxy and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are high-energy, short-duration phenomena in radio astronomy. Identifying their host galaxies can provide insights into their mysterious origins. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to identifying potential host galaxies in three-dimensional space. We use FRB 20190425A and GW190425 as an example to illustrate our method. Recently, due to spatial and temporal proximity, the potential association of GW190425 with FRB 20190425A has drawn attention, leading to the identification of a likely host galaxy, UGC 10667, albeit without confirmed kilonova emissions. We search for the host galaxy of FRB 20190425A with a full CHIME localization map. Regardless of the validity of the association between GW190425 and FRB 20190425A, we identify an additional potential host galaxy (SDSS J171046.84+212732.9) from the updated GLADE galaxy catalog, supplementing the importance of exploring the new volume. We employed various methodologies to determine the most probable host galaxy of GW190424 and FRB 20190425A, including a comparison of galaxy properties and constraints on their reported observation limits using various Kilonova models. Our analysis suggests that current observations do not definitively identify the true host galaxy. Additionally, the Kilonova models characterized by a gradual approach to their peak are contradicted by the observational upper limits of both galaxies. Although the absence of optical emission detection raises doubts, it does not definitively disprove the connection between GW and FRB.</description>

      <title>First Calculations of Starspot Spectra based on 3D Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate calculations of starspot spectra are essential for multiple applications in astronomy. The current standard is to represent starspot spectra by spectra of stars that are cooler than the quiet star regions. This implies approximating a starspot as a non-magnetic 1D structure in radiative-convective equilibrium, parametrizing convective energy transport by mixing length theory. It is the inhibition of convection by the starspot magnetic field that is emulated by using a lower spot temperature relative to the quiet stellar regions. Here, we take a different approach avoiding the approximate treatment of convection and instead self-consistently accounting for the interaction between matter, radiation, and the magnetic field. We simulate spots on G2V, K0V, M0V stars with the 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics code MURaM and calculate spectra ($R \approx 500$ from 250~nm to 6000~nm) using ray-by-ray radiative transfer with the MPS-ATLAS code. We find that the 1D models fail to return accurate umbral and penumbral spectra on K0V and M0V stars where convective and radiative transfer of energy is simultaneously important over a broad range of atmospheric heights rendering mixing length theory inaccurate. However, 1D models work well for G2V stars, where both radiation and convection significantly contribute to energy transfer only in a narrow region near the stellar surface. Quantitatively, the 1D approximation leads to errors longward of 500 nm of about 50\% for both umbral and penumbral flux contrast relative to quiet star regions on M0V stars, and less than 2\% (for umbrae) and 10\% (for penumbrae) for G2V stars.</description>

      <title>Probing dark matter halo profiles with multi-band observations of gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the potential of multiband gravitational wave observations to constrain the properties of static dark matter spikes around intermediate-mass ratio inspirals. The influence of dark matter on the orbital evolution of the compact binary is incorporated as a correction to the inspiral Newtonian gravitational waveform. We show that the observations from the proposed space-based detector GWSat, sensitive within the deci-Hz frequency band, when combined with that of the third-generation ground-based detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will produce significantly improved error estimates for all parameters. In particular, our results demonstrate that the joint multiband approach substantially refines the bounds on the dark matter spike parameters-namely, the power-law index and spike density-by factors of approximately $10^6$ and $10^3$, respectively, compared to observations employing only third-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at Low Metallicity X. Physical Parameters and Feedback of Massive Stars in the LMC N11 B Star-Forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars lead the ionization and mechanical feedback within young star-forming regions. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal galaxy for studying individual massive stars and quantifying their feedback contribution to the environment. We analyze eight exemplary targets in LMC N11 B from the Hubble UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program, using novel spectra from HST (COS and STIS) in the UV, and from VLT (X-shooter) in the optical. We model the spectra of early to late O-type stars by using state-of-the-art PoWR atmosphere models. We determine the stellar and wind parameters (e.g., $T_\star$, $\log g$, $L_{\star}$, $\dot{M}$, $v_\infty$) of the analyzed objects, chemical abundances (C, N, O), ionizing and mechanical feedback ($Q_\mathrm{H}$, $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{I}}}$, $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{II}}}$, $L_\mathrm{mec}$) and X-rays. We report ages of $2-4.5$ Myr and masses of $30-60$ $M_\odot$ for the analyzed stars in N11 B, consistent with a scenario of sequential star formation. We note that the observed wind-momentum luminosity relation is consistent with theoretical predictions. We detect nitrogen enrichment in most of the stars, up to a factor of seven. However, we do not find a correlation between nitrogen enrichment and projected rotational velocity. Finally, based on their spectral type, we estimate the total ionizing photons injected from the O-type stars in N11 B into its environment. We report $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{H}$)$=50.5$ ph s$^{-1}$, $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{I}}}$)$=49.6$ ph s$^{-1}$ and $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{II}}}$)$=44.4$ ph s$^{-1}$, consistent with the total ionizing budget in N11.</description>

Abstract: Massive black holes (MBHs) exist in the Galactic center (GC) and other nearby galactic nuclei. As natural outcome of galaxy mergers, some MBHs may have a black hole (BH) companion. In this paper, assuming that the MBHs in the GC and some nearby galaxies are in binaries with orbital periods ranging from months to years (gravitational-wave frequency $\sim1-100$\,nHz), we investigate the detectability of gravitational-waves from these binary MBHs (BBHs) and constraints on the parameter space for the existence of BBHs in the GC, LMC, M31, M32, and M87, that may be obtained by current/future pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. We find that a BBH in the GC, if any, can be revealed by the Square Kilometer Array PTA (SKA-PTA) if its mass ratio $q\gtrsim10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ and semimajor axis $a\sim20-10^3$\,AU. The existence of a BH companion of the MBH can be revealed by SKA-PTA with $\sim20$-year observations in M31 if $q\gtrsim10^{-4}$ and $a\sim10^2-10^4$\,AU or in M87 if $q\gtrsim10^{-5}$ and $a\sim10^3-2\times10^4$\,AU, but not in LMC and M32 if $q\ll1$. If a number of milli-second stable pulsars with distances $\lesssim0.1-1$\,pc away from the central MBH in the GC, LMC, M32, or M31, can be detected in future and applied to PTAs, the BH companion with mass even down to $\sim100M_\odot$, close to stellar masses, can be revealed by such PTAs. Future PTAs are expected to provide an independent way to reveal BBHs and low-mass MBH companions in the GC and nearby galaxies, improving our understandings of the formation and evolution of MBHs and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the BE99 method for the study of outflowing gas in protostellar jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An established method measuring the hydrogen ionisation fraction in shock excited gas is the BE99 method, which utilises six bright forbidden emission lines of [SII]6716, 6731, [NII]6548, 6583, and [OI]6300, 6363. We aim to extent the BE99 method by including more emission lines in the blue and near-infrared part of the spectrum ($\lambda$ = 3500-11000A), and considering higher hydrogen ionisation fractions ($x_e &gt; 0.3$). In addition, we investigate how a non-equilibrium state of the gas and the presence of extinction influence the BE99 technique. We find that plenty additional emission line ratios can in principle be exploited as extended curves (or stripes) in the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram. If the BE99 equilibrium is reached and extinction is corrected for, all stripes overlap in one location in the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram indicating the existing gas parameters. The application to the Par Lup 3-4 outflow shows that the classical BE99 lines together with the [NI]5198+5200 lines do not meet in one locationin the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram. This indicates that the gas parameters derived from the classical BE99 method are not fully consistent with other observed line ratios. A multi-line approach is necessary to determine the gas parameters. From our analysis we derive $n_e \sim$ 45 000 cm^-3 - 53000 cm^-3 , $T_e$ = 7600K - 8000K, and $x_e \sim$ 0.027 - 0.036 for the Par Lup 3-4 outflow. For the 244-440 Proplyd we were able to use the line ratios of [SII]6716+6731, [OI]6300+6363, and [OII]7320, 7330 in the BE99 diagram to estimate the ionisation fraction at knot E3 ($x_e = 0.58 \pm 0.05$). In conclusion, exploiting new line ratios reveals more insights on the state of the gas. Our analysis indicates, however, that a multi-line approach is more robust in deriving gas parameters, especially for high density gas.</description>

      <title>The distribution and morphologies of Fornax Cluster dwarf galaxies suggest they lack dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their low surface brightness, dwarf galaxies are particularly susceptible to tidal forces. The expected degree of disturbance depends on the assumed gravity law and whether they have a dominant dark halo. This makes dwarf galaxies useful for testing different gravity models. In this project, we use the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) dwarf galaxy catalogue to compare the properties of dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster with those predicted by the Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) standard model of cosmology and Milgromian dynamics (MOND). We construct a test particle simulation of the Fornax system. We then use the MCMC method to fit this to the FDS distribution of tidal susceptibility $\eta$ (half-mass radius divided by theoretical tidal radius), the fraction of dwarfs that visually appear disturbed as a function of $\eta$, and the distribution of projected separation from the cluster centre. This allows us to constrain the $\eta$ value at which dwarfs should get destroyed by tides. Accounting for an $r'$-band surface brightness limit of 27.8 magnitudes per square arcsec, the required stability threshold is $\eta_{\textrm{destr}} = 0.25^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $ 1.88^{+0.85}_{-0.53}$ in MOND. The $\Lambda$CDM value is in tension with previous $\textit{N}$-body dwarf galaxy simulations, which indicate that $\eta_{\textrm{destr}} \approx 1$. Our MOND $\textit{N}$-body simulations indicate that $\eta_{\textrm{destr}} = 1.70 \pm 0.30$, which agrees well with our MCMC analysis of the FDS. We therefore conclude that the observed deformations of dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster and the lack of low surface brightness dwarfs towards its centre are incompatible with $\Lambda$CDM expectations but well consistent with MOND.</description>

      <title>TEMPLATES: Direct Abundance Constraints for Two Lensed Lyman-Break Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using integrated spectra for two gravitationally lensed galaxies from the JWST TEMPLATES Early Release Science program, we analyze faint auroral lines, which provide direct measurements of the gas-phase chemical abundance. For the brighter galaxy, SGAS1723$+$34 ($z = 1.3293$), we detect the [OIII]$\lambda4363$, [SIII]$\lambda6312$, and [OII]$\lambda\lambda$7320,7330 auroral emission lines, and set an upper limit for the [NII]$\lambda5755$ line. For the second galaxy, SGAS1226$+$21 ($z = 2.925$), we do not detect any auroral lines, and report upper limits. With these measurements and upper limits, we constrain the electron temperatures in different ionization zones within both of these galaxies. For SGAS1723$+$34, where auroral lines are detected, we calculate direct oxygen and nitrogen abundances, finding an N/O ratio consistent with observations of nearby ($z\sim 0$) galaxies. These observations highlight the potent combination of JWST and gravitational lensing to measure faint emission lines in individual distant galaxies and to directly study the chemical abundance patterns in those galaxies.</description>

      <title>Assessing the accuracy of the star formation rate measurements by direct star count in molecular clouds</title>

Abstract: Star formation estimates based on the counting of YSOs is commonly applied to nearby star-forming regions in the Galaxy. With this method, the SFRs are measured using the counts of YSOs in a particular protostellar Class, a typical protostellar mass, and the lifetime associated with this Class. However, the assumptions underlying the validity of the method such as that of a constant star formation history (SFH) and whether the method is valid for all protostellar Classes has never been fully tested. In this work, we use Monte Carlo models to test the validity of the method. We build synthetic clusters in which stars form at times that are randomly drawn from a specified SFH. The latter is either constant or time-dependent with a burst like behavior. The masses of the protostars are randomly drawn from an IMF which can be either similar to that of the Milky Way field or be variable . For each star in every cluster, the lifetimes associated with the different protostellar classes are also randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution functions centered around their most likely value as suggested by the observations. We find that only the SFR derived using the Class 0 population can reproduce the true SFR at all epochs, and this is true irrespective of the shape of the SFH. For a constant SFH, the SFR derived using the more evolved populations of protostars (Classes I, F, II, and III) reproduce the real SFR only at later epochs which correspond to epochs at which their numbers have reached a steady state. For a time-dependent burst-like SFH, all SFR estimates based on the number counts of the evolved populations fail to reproduce the true SFR. We also show how the offsets between Class I and Class II based SFRs and the true SFR plotted as a function of the number ratios of Class I and Class II versus Class III YSOs can be used in order to constrain the SFH of observed molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Bursty Star Formation in Dwarfs is Sensitive to Numerical Choices in Supernova Feedback Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulations of galaxy formation are mostly unable to resolve the energy-conserving phase of individual supernova events, having to resort to subgrid models to distribute the energy and momentum resulting from stellar feedback. However, the properties of these simulated galaxies, including the morphology, stellar mass formed and the burstiness of the star formation history, are highly sensitive to numerical choices adopted in these subgrid models. Using the {\small SMUGGLE} stellar feedback model, we compute idealized simulations of a $M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{10} \, \msun$ dwarf galaxy, a regime where most simulation codes predict significant burstiness in star formation, resulting in strong gas flows that lead to the formation of dark matter cores. We find that by varying only the directional distribution of momentum imparted from supernovae to the surrounding gas, while holding the total momentum per supernova constant, bursty star formation may be amplified or completely suppressed, and the total stellar mass formed can vary by as much as a factor of $\sim 3$. In particular, when momentum is primarily directed perpendicular to the gas disk, less bursty and lower overall star formation rates result, yielding less gas turbulence, more disky morphologies and a retention of cuspy dark matter density profiles. An improved understanding of the non-linear coupling of stellar feedback into inhomogeneous gaseous media is thus needed to make robust predictions for stellar morphologies and dark matter core formation in dwarfs independent of uncertain numerical choices in the baryonic treatment.</description>

      <title>QSO MUSEUM II: Search for extended Ly$\alpha$ emission around eight $z \sim 3$ quasar pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended Ly$\alpha$ emission is routinely found around single quasars (QSO) across cosmic time. However, few studies have investigated how such emission changes in fields with physically associated QSO pairs, which should reside in dense environments and are predicted to be linked through intergalactic filaments. We present VLT/MUSE snapshot observations (45 min./source) to unveil extended Ly$\alpha$ emission on scales of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around the largest sample of physically associated QSO pairs to date, encompassing 8 pairs (14 observed QSOs) at $z$~3 with $i$-band magnitude between 18 and 22.75. The pairs are either at close (~50-100 kpc, 5 pairs) or wide (~450-500 kpc, 3 pairs) separation with velocity differences of $\Delta$v &lt; 2000 km s$^{-1}$. We detect extended emission around 12 of the 14 targeted QSOs and investigate the luminosity, size, kinematics and morphology of these Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. On average, they span 90 kpc and are 2.8 $\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ bright. Irrespective of the QSOs' projected distance, the nebulae often (~45 %) extend toward the other QSO in the pair, leading to asymmetric emission whose flux-weighted centroid is at an offset position from any QSO location. We show that large nebulae are preferentially aligned with the large-scale structure as traced by the two QSOs, and conclude that the cool gas (10$^4$ K) in the CGM traces well the direction of cosmic web filaments. Additionally, the radial profile of the Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness around QSO pairs can be described by a power law with a shallower slope (~$-1.6$) with respect to single QSOs (~$-2$), indicative of increased CGM densities out to large radii and/or enhanced contribution from the intergalactic medium (IGM). The sample presented in this study contains excellent targets for ultra-deep observations to directly study filamentary IGM structures in emission.</description>

      <title>Effects of grain temperature distribution on organic protostellar envelope chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Dust grains in circumstellar envelopes are likely to have a spread-out temperature distribution. Aims. To investigate how trends in temperature distribution between small and large grains affect the hot corino chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) and warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC). Methods. A multi-grain multi-layer astrochemical code with an up-to-date treatment of surface chemistry was used with three grain temperature trends: grain temperature proportional to grain radius to the power -1/6 (Model M-1/6), to 0 (M0), and to 1/6 (M1/6). The cases of hot corino and WCCC chemistry were investigated, for a total of six models. The essence of these changes is for the main ice reservoir - small grains - having higher (M-1/6) or lower (M1/6) temperature than the surrounding gas. Results. The chemistry of COMs shows better agreement with observations in models M-1/6 and M1/6 than in Model M0. Model M-1/6 shows best agreement for WCCC because earlier mass-evaporation of methane ice from small grains induces the WCCC phenomenon at lower temperatures. Conclusions. Models considering several grain populations with different temperatures can more precisely reproduce circumstellar chemistry.</description>

      <title>Unveiling dust, molecular gas, and high star formation efficiency in extremely UV bright star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 2.1-3.6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analysed ALMA FIR (1.3 mm) dust continuum and CO emission of 12 starburst galaxies at $z\sim 2.1-3.6$, selected for their extreme brightness in the rest-UV with $M_{\rm UV} = -23.4$ to $-24.7$. We also analysed VLT HAWK-I $H$- and $K_{\rm s}$-band images. The galaxies are characterised by negligible dust attenuations with blue UV spectral slopes ($-2.62$ to $-1.84$), very young stellar populations of $\sim 10$ Myr, and powerful starbursts with a high mean specific star formation rate of $\rm 112~Gyr^{-1}$, placing them $\sim 1.5$~dex above the main sequence at similar redshifts and stellar masses ($M_{\rm stars} \sim (1.5-4.6)\times 10^9~M_{\odot}$). The FIR dust continuum emission revealed in 9 galaxies yields IR luminosities of $(5.9-28.3)\times 10^{11}~L_{\odot}$ and large dust masses barely produced by SNe within the 10~Myr timescale. The CO emission detected in 8 galaxies evidence large molecular gas masses with a mean molecular gas fraction of 82%. The corresponding star formation efficiencies reach $\gtrsim 40$%, with amazingly short molecular gas depletion timescales between &lt;13 Myr and 71 Myr. These unique properties never reported in previously studied galaxies highlight that these galaxies are likely caught at the very beginning of their stellar mass build-up and undergo a very efficient and fast conversion of gas into stars that can only result from the gas collapse within very short free-fall times. We find that the feedback-free starburst model seems to be able to explain the formation of these galaxies. To reconcile the co-spatial FIR dust emission with the UV-bright unattenuated emission, we speculate about radiation-driven outflows that can temporarily remove dust at the location of the starburst and expel dust at large distances in line with the measured large FIR effective radii ($\rm 1.7~kpc - 5~kpc$) in comparison to very compact stellar radii.</description>

      <title>The magnetic field in quiescent star-forming filament G16.96+0.27</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 850 {\mu}m thermal dust polarization observations with a resolution of 14.4"(~ 0.13 pc) towards an infrared dark cloud G16.96+0.27 using JCMT/POL-2. The average magnetic field orientation, which roughly agrees with the larger-scale magnetic field orientation traced by the Planck 353 GHz data, is approximately perpendicular to the filament structure. The estimated plane-of-sky magnetic field strength is ~ 96 {\mu}G and ~ 60 {\mu}G using two variants of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi methods. We calculate the virial and magnetic critical parameters to evaluate the relative importance of gravity, the magnetic field, and turbulence. The magnetic field and turbulence are both weaker than gravity, but magnetic fields and turbulence together are equal to gravity, suggesting that G16.96+0.27 is in a quasi-equilibrium state. The cloud-magnetic-field alignment is found to have a trend moving away from perpendicularity in the dense regions, which may serve as a tracer of potential fragmentation in such quiescent filaments.</description>

Abstract: Large sky spectroscopic surveys have reached the scale of photometric surveys in terms of sample sizes and data complexity. These huge datasets require efficient, accurate, and flexible automated tools for data analysis and science exploitation. We present the Galaxy Spectra Network/GaSNet-II, a supervised multi-network deep learning tool for spectra classification and redshift prediction. GaSNet-II can be trained to identify a customized number of classes and optimize the redshift predictions for classified objects in each of them. It also provides redshift errors, using a network-of-networks that reproduces a Monte Carlo test on each spectrum, by randomizing their weight initialization. As a demonstration of the capability of the deep learning pipeline, we use 260k Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra from Data Release 16, separated into 13 classes including 140k galactic, and 120k extragalactic objects. GaSNet-II achieves 92.4% average classification accuracy over the 13 classes (larger than 90% for the majority of them), and an average redshift error of approximately 0.23% for galaxies and 2.1% for quasars. We further train/test the same pipeline to classify spectra and predict redshifts for a sample of 200k 4MOST mock spectra and 21k publicly released DESI spectra. On 4MOST mock data, we reach 93.4% accuracy in 10-class classification and an average redshift error of 0.55% for galaxies and 0.3% for active galactic nuclei. On DESI data, we reach 96% accuracy in (star/galaxy/quasar only) classification and an average redshift error of 2.8% for galaxies and 4.8% for quasars, despite the small sample size available. GaSNet-II can process ~40k spectra in less than one minute, on a normal Desktop GPU. This makes the pipeline particularly suitable for real-time analyses of Stage-IV survey observations and an ideal tool for feedback loops aimed at night-by-night survey strategy optimization.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>Automated Identification and Segmentation of Hi Sources in CRAFTS Using Deep Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying neutral hydrogen (\hi) galaxies from observational data is a significant challenge in \hi\ galaxy surveys. With the advancement of observational technology, especially with the advent of large-scale telescope projects such as FAST and SKA, the significant increase in data volume presents new challenges for the efficiency and accuracy of data processing.To address this challenge, in this study, we present a machine learning-based method for extracting \hi\ sources from the three-dimensional (3D) spectral data obtained from the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS). We have carefully assembled a specialized dataset, HISF, rich in \hi\ sources, specifically designed to enhance the detection process. Our model, Unet-LK, utilizes the advanced 3D-Unet segmentation architecture and employs an elongated convolution kernel to effectively capture the intricate structures of \hi\ sources. This strategy ensures a reliable identification and segmentation of \hi\ sources, achieving notable performance metrics with a recall rate of 91.6\% and an accuracy of 95.7\%. These results substantiate the robustness of our dataset and the effectiveness of our proposed network architecture in the precise identification of \hi\ sources. Our code and dataset is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/fishszh/HISF}.</description>

      <title>CO Observations of the Type Ia Supernova Remnant 3C 397 by the Nobeyama 45-m Radio Telescope: Possible Evidence for the Single-Degenerated Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new CO observation toward the Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 397 using the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope at an unprecedent angular resolution of $\sim$18''. We newly found that the CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ = 55.7-62.2 km s$^{-1}$ (60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud) shows a good spatial correspondence with the radio continuum shell. We also found an expanding gas motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud with an expansion velocity of $\sim$3 km s$^{-1}$, which is thought to be formed by the pre-and/or post-supernova feedback. By considering the positions of Galactic spiral arms and the X-ray/HI absorption studies, we concluded that 3C 397 is physically associated with the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud rather than the previously known CO cloud at $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ $\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$. Given that the previously measured pre-shock density is $\sim$2-5 cm$^{-3}$, the expanding motion of the 60 km s$^{-1}$ cloud was likely formed by the pre-supernova feedback known as optically thick wind. The scenario is consistent with that 3C 397 exploded inside a wind-blown bubble as a single degenerate system.</description>

      <title>Classification of Wolf Rayet stars using Ensemble-based Machine Learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a robust Machine Learning classifier model utilizing the eXtreme-Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm for improved classification of Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars based on Infrared (IR) colors and positional attributes. For our study, we choose an extensive dataset of 6555 stellar objects (from 2MASS and AllWISE data releases) lying in the Milky Way (MW) with available photometric magnitudes of different types including WR stars. Our XGB classifier model can accurately (with an 86\% detection rate) identify a sufficient number of WR stars against a large sample of non-WR sources. The XGB model outperforms other ensemble classifier models such as the Random Forest. Also, using the XGB algorithm, we develop a WR sub-type classifier model that can differentiate the WR subtypes from the non-WR sources with a high model accuracy ($&gt;60\%$). Further, we apply both XGB-based models to a selection of 6457 stellar objects with unknown object types, detecting 58 new WR star candidates and predicting sub-types for 10 of them. The identified WR sources are mainly located in the Local spiral arm of the MW and mostly lie in the solar neighborhood.</description>
