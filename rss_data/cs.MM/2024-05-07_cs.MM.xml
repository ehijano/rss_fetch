      <title>Task Presentation and Human Perception in Interactive Video Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive video retrieval is a cooperative process between humans and retrieval systems. Large-scale evaluation campaigns, however, often overlook human factors, such as the effects of perception, attention, and memory, when assessing media retrieval systems. Consequently, their setups fall short of emulating realistic retrieval scenarios. In this paper, we design novel task presentation modes based on concepts in media memorability, implement the pipelines necessary for processing target video segments, and build a custom experimental platform for the final evaluation. In order to study the effects of different task representation schemes, we conduct a large crowdsourced experiment. Our findings demonstrate that the way in which the target of a video retrieval task is presented has a substantial influence on the difficulty of the retrieval task and that individuals can successfully retrieve a target video segment despite reducing or even altering the provided hints, opening up a discussion around future evaluation protocols in the domain of interactive media retrieval.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap for Multilingual, Multimodal Domain Independent Deception Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deception, a prevalent aspect of human communication, has undergone a significant transformation in the digital age. With the globalization of online interactions, individuals are communicating in multiple languages and mixing languages on social media, with varied data becoming available in each language and dialect. At the same time, the techniques for detecting deception are similar across the board. Recent studies have shown the possibility of the existence of universal linguistic cues to deception across domains within the English language; however, the existence of such cues in other languages remains unknown. Furthermore, the practical task of deception detection in low-resource languages is not a well-studied problem due to the lack of labeled data. Another dimension of deception is multimodality. For example, a picture with an altered caption in fake news or disinformation may exist. This paper calls for a comprehensive investigation into the complexities of deceptive language across linguistic boundaries and modalities within the realm of computer security and natural language processing and the possibility of using multilingual transformer models and labeled data in various languages to universally address the task of deception detection.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Illusions: Understanding Human Perception of Audiovisual Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of contemporary deepfakes has attracted significant attention in machine learning research, as artificial intelligence (AI) generated synthetic media increases the incidence of misinterpretation and is difficult to distinguish from genuine content. Currently, machine learning techniques have been extensively studied for automatically detecting deepfakes. However, human perception has been less explored. Malicious deepfakes could ultimately cause public and social problems. Can we humans correctly perceive the authenticity of the content of the videos we watch? The answer is obviously uncertain; therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the human ability to discern deepfake videos through a subjective study. We present our findings by comparing human observers to five state-ofthe-art audiovisual deepfake detection models. To this end, we used gamification concepts to provide 110 participants (55 native English speakers and 55 non-native English speakers) with a webbased platform where they could access a series of 40 videos (20 real and 20 fake) to determine their authenticity. Each participant performed the experiment twice with the same 40 videos in different random orders. The videos are manually selected from the FakeAVCeleb dataset. We found that all AI models performed better than humans when evaluated on the same 40 videos. The study also reveals that while deception is not impossible, humans tend to overestimate their detection capabilities. Our experimental results may help benchmark human versus machine performance, advance forensics analysis, and enable adaptive countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Language Models as Black-Box Optimizers for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05950v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale datasets have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on downstream tasks when fine-tuned with minimal data. However, many VLMs rely on proprietary data and are not open-source, which restricts the use of white-box approaches for fine-tuning. As such, we aim to develop a black-box approach to optimize VLMs through natural language prompts, thereby avoiding the need to access model parameters, feature embeddings, or even output logits. We propose employing chat-based LLMs to search for the best text prompt for VLMs. Specifically, we adopt an automatic hill-climbing procedure that converges to an effective prompt by evaluating the performance of current prompts and asking LLMs to refine them based on textual feedback, all within a conversational process without human-in-the-loop. In a challenging 1-shot image classification setup, our simple approach surpasses the white-box continuous prompting method (CoOp) by an average of 1.5% across 11 datasets including ImageNet. Our approach also outperforms both human-engineered and LLM-generated prompts. We highlight the advantage of conversational feedback that incorporates both positive and negative prompts, suggesting that LLMs can utilize the implicit gradient direction in textual feedback for a more efficient search. In addition, we find that the text prompts generated through our strategy are not only more interpretable but also transfer well across different VLM architectures in a black-box manner. Lastly, we apply our framework to optimize the state-of-the-art black-box VLM (DALL-E 3) for text-to-image generation, prompt inversion, and personalization.</description>

      <title>CLIP as RNN: Segment Countless Visual Concepts without Training Endeavor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary image segmentation methods require a fine-tuning step on mask labels and/or image-text datasets. Mask labels are labor-intensive, which limits the number of categories in segmentation datasets. Consequently, the vocabulary capacity of pre-trained VLMs is severely reduced after fine-tuning. However, without fine-tuning, VLMs trained under weak image-text supervision tend to make suboptimal mask predictions. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a novel recurrent framework that progressively filters out irrelevant texts and enhances mask quality without training efforts. The recurrent unit is a two-stage segmenter built upon a frozen VLM. Thus, our model retains the VLM's broad vocabulary space and equips it with segmentation ability. Experiments show that our method outperforms not only the training-free counterparts, but also those fine-tuned with millions of data samples, and sets the new state-of-the-art records for both zero-shot semantic and referring segmentation. Concretely, we improve the current record by 28.8, 16.0, and 6.9 mIoU on Pascal VOC, COCO Object, and Pascal Context.</description>
