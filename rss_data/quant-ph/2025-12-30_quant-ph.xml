      <title>A quantum advection-diffusion solver using the quantum singular value transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for the simulation of the linear advection-diffusion equation based on block encodings of high order finite-difference operators and the quantum singular value transform. Our complexity analysis shows that the higher order methods significantly reduce the number of gates and qubits required to reach a given accuracy. The theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations of one- and two-dimensional benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Wigner Cat Phases: A finely tunable system for exploring the transition to quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to chaos for quantum dynamics is quantified via a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} forms a pedagogically accessible family of systems in simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed localized phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve during these transitions. Characterization of transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap ratios with statistical uncertainty quantifications that strengthens the robustness of evidence of transitions. The transition is identified as {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, because of the shape of empirical spectral densities, which depens on the tuneable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE appear to be an ideal tool to study {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of physical systems under different localisation and disorder strengths.</description>

      <title>Bell-Inequality Violation for Continuous, Non-Projective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many solid-state quantum platforms do not permit sharp, projective measurements but instead yield continuous voltage or field traces under weak, non-demolition readout. In such systems, standard Bell tests based on dichotomic projective measurements are not directly applicable, raising the question of how quantum nonlocality can be certified from continuous time-series data. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that Bell-CHSH inequality violation can be extracted from continuous, non-projective measurements without assuming any specific collapse model or phase distribution. We show that sufficiently long continuous measurements of a single entangled pair sample its internal phase-probability structure, enabling effective dichotomic observables to be constructed through phase-sensitive projections and coarse-graining. The resulting Bell correlator is governed by two experimentally accessible resources: intrinsic single-qubit phase spread and nonlocal phase locking between qubits. We benchmark the resulting estimator against conventional projective-measurement CHSH tests implemented via quantum-circuit simulations using Qiskit, finding quantitative agreement in the Bell-violating regime without parameter fitting. Classical deterministic correlations cannot violate the CHSH bound, whereas quantum phase-locked systems recover the nonlinear angular dependence characteristic of entanglement. Our results provide a practical route to demonstrating Bell nonlocality in platforms where measurements are inherently continuous and weak.</description>

      <title>Non-Relativistic Quantum Particle Confined on a Cylindrical Surface under a Stark-like Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the influence of a Stark-like perturbative potential on a quantum particle confined to a cylindrical surface (QPCS) and its implications for extra-dimensional theories. The QPCS framework is particularly relevant to Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory, which postulates extra spatial dimensions to unify electromagnetism and gravity. In KK theory, these extra dimensions are typically hidden and require high-energy conditions for detection. Motivated by the challenge of uncovering these dimensions more feasibly, this research applies a perturbative potential of the form \hat{H}_{\text{SL}} = \beta zV_{o_{z}}(\theta) to a QPCS characterized by length \textit{L} and radius R_{o}. This potential is inspired by the Stark effect in hydrogen atoms, where energy level splitting serves as an indicator of an external influence. The study demonstrates that, for a degenerate configuration (R_{o} = \frac{L}{\pi}), the Stark-like perturbation effectively induces energy level splitting, which can be interpreted as a means of revealing hidden dimensions. The first-order energy correction in this scenario depends explicitly on the quantum numbers n_{z} and n_{\theta}, highlighting the potential for this approach to probe extra-dimensional effects in lower-energy quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Partial Collapse and Ensemble Invariance under Continuous Quantum Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefunction collapse is often regarded as an unavoidable consequence of quantum measurement. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can extract information without disturbing the physical steady-state ensemble. Using the stochastic master equation formalism, we identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite the presence of measurement-induced collapse at the level of individual quantum trajectories. This separation between conditional collapse and ensemble invariance leads to a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is transient and continuously counteracted by dissipation and drive. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and show-that it holds over a finite range of measurement strengths. Our results clarify how information gain and measurement backaction can be dynamically decoupled in open quantum systems, with implications for continuous quantum sensing and the foundations of nonprojective measurement.</description>

      <title>Decoherence challenges in Nanoscience: A Quantum Phase Space perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum decoherence, the process by which a quantum system loses its coherence through interaction with an environment and becomes classical-like, represents both the fundamental mechanism for the quantum-to-classical transition and a major challenge to realizing scalable nanoscale quantum technologies. This work introduces a novel theoretical framework based on Quantum Phase Space (QPS) to address the dual challenge of characterizing environment-selected pointer states and modeling decoherence dynamics across different regimes. Within this framework, pointer states for particle motion are identified as the minimum-uncertainty states, those that saturate the quantum uncertainty relation, thereby constituting the closest quantum analogue to classical phase-space points. The structure of the QPS, encoded in a variance-covariance matrix, is shown to be directly shaped by environmental properties. A time-independent matrix corresponds to Markovian (memoryless) decoherence, described by constant diffusion and friction coefficients, while a time-dependent matrix captures non-Markovian dynamics, characterized by environmental memory and information backflow. This unified geometric formalism, applied to both Lindblad and Non-Markovian master equations, enables us to derive explicit relations between environmental parameters and phase-space structure, as demonstrated in a specific illustrative example. This approach has the potential to serve as a powerful tool for modeling decoherence in nanoscience and could inform new principles for designing mitigation strategies and harnessing non-Markovian effects for quantum technologies. The QPS framework may thus bridge fundamental theory and practical quantum engineering, offering a promising coherent pathway to understand, control, and exploit decoherence at the nanoscience frontier.</description>

      <title>A Time-Symmetric Variational Formulation of Quantum Mechanics with Emergent Schr\"odinger Dynamics and Objective Boundary Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a time-symmetric variational formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in which Schr\"odinger dynamics and a Bohm-type guidance law arise as emergent Euler-Lagrange optimality conditions rather than postulates. The formulation is expressed in terms of probability density and current fields subject to a continuity constraint and two-time boundary conditions. A Fisher-information regularization term generates the quantum potential, yielding the Schr\"odinger equation when the optimality system is expressed in complex form. Unlike standard Bohmian mechanics, which requires an auxiliary Quantum Equilibrium Hypothesis ($P = |\psi|^2$), our primal-dual formulation satisfies the Born rule by construction. The trajectories emerge not from an external guidance wave, but as the unique hydrodynamic flow minimizing the Fisher-regularized action between two-time boundary constraints. Deterministic trajectories thus emerge only as effective, coarse-grained descriptions, with randomness entering objectively at the interface of boundary constraints.</description>

      <title>Resonance matching of 2-$\delta$ and 3-$\delta$ potentials in 1D Quantum Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether a 3-$\delta$ system with positive coupling strengths can approximate the transmission spectrum of a 2-$\delta$ resonance system with opposite-sign couplings for $k &lt;3$. Theoretical analysis establishes exact isospectrality -- perfectly matched transmission spectrum -- is impossible for physically non-trivial configurations, while numerical experiments identify the minimal constraint set for practicability. These results establish both the practical limits and achievable accuracy of resonance matching under sign constraints, with implications for understanding spectral non-uniqueness in quantum scattering problems.</description>

      <title>Casimir Arc Plate Geometry: Computational Analysis of Thickness Constraints for Gold and Silver Nanomembranes in MEMS Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir &gt; U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for preparing various exotic modifications of Schr\"odinger cat states by coupling a semiclassical oscillator to a system of qubits. Varying the number of qubits and parameters of the quantum quench performed in the coupled system, we bring the oscillator into a~highly non-classical state composed of an arbitrary number of partly coherent wavepackets in tunable proportions and motion relations. The method can be implemented with the aid of current experimental techniques and may find applications in quantum information and sensing protocols.</description>

      <title>The Lieb-Robinson correlation function for long disordered transverse-field Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse-field Ising model is useful for studying interacting qubit arrays. The Lieb--Robinson correlation function can be used to characterize the propagation of quantum information in Ising chains. Considerable work has been done to establish bounds on this correlation function in various circumstances. To actually calculate the value of the correlation function directly typically requires a state space which grows exponentially with system size, and so is intractable for all but relatively small systems. We employ a recently-developed method that enables direct calculation of the value of the Lieb--Robinson correlation function and which scales linearly with system size. This enables the computation for systems with many hundreds of qubits, revealing the propagation of quantum information down the chain. We extend this technique to the problem of Ising chains with randomly disordered coupling strengths. Increasing disorder causes localization of the quantum correlations and halts propagation of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Circuit Framework for Two-Stage Stochastic Programming via QAOA Integrated with a Quantum Generative Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-stage stochastic programming often discretizes uncertainty into scenarios, but scenario enumeration makes expected recourse evaluation scale at least linearly in the scenario count. We propose qGAN-QAOA, a unified quantum-circuit workflow in which a pre-trained quantum generative adversarial network encodes the scenario distribution and QAOA optimizes first-stage decisions by minimizing the full two-stage objective, including expected recourse cost. With the qGAN parameters fixed after training, we evaluate the objective as the expectation value of a problem Hamiltonian and optimize only the QAOA variational parameters. We interpret non-anticipativity as a condition on measurement outcome statistics and prove that the first-stage measurement marginal is independent of the scenario. For uniformly discretized uncertainty, the diagonal operator encoding the uncertainty admits a sparse Pauli-Z expansion via the Walsh--Hadamard transform, yielding polylogarithmic scaling of gate count and circuit depth with the number of scenarios. Numerical experiments on the stochastic unit commitment problem (UCP) with photovoltaic (PV) uncertainty compare the expected cost of the proposed method with classical expected-value and two-stage stochastic programming baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of qGAN-QAOA as a two-stage decision model.</description>

      <title>Quasi-harmonic spectra from branched Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the canonical quantization to assess the spectrum of the modified Emden equation $\ddot{x} + kx\dot{x} + \omega^2 x + \frac{k^2}{9}x^3 = 0$, which is an isochronous case of the Li\'enard-Kukles equation. While its classical isochronicity and canonical quantization, leading to polynomial solutions with an exactly-equispaced spectrum have been discussed earlier, including in the recent paper [Int. J. Theor. Phys. 64, 212 (2025)], the present study focuses on the quantization of its branched Hamiltonians. For small $k$, we show numerically that the resulting energy spectrum is no longer perfectly harmonic but only approximately equispaced, exhibiting quasi-harmonic behavior characterized by deviations from uniform spacing. Our numerical results are precisely validated by analytical calculations based on perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We present separability criteria based on local symmetric measurements. These experimental plausible criteria are shown to be more efficient in detecting entanglement than the current counterparts by detailed examples. Furthermore, we generalize the separability criteria from bipartite to arbitrary multipartite systems. These criteria establish a richer connection between the quantum entanglement and the probabilities of local measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Noise Spectroscopy of Nanoscale Charge Defects in Silicon Carbide at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nanoscale charge environment critically influences semiconductor physics and device performance. While conventional bulk characterization techniques provide volume-averaged defect properties, they lack the spatial resolution to resolve nanoscale charge heterogeneity and identify microscopic noise sources. Here, we utilize single PL5 centers in 4H-SiC as room-temperature broadband quantum sensors to fill in the gap. We report the first real-time, nanoscale observation of singlecharge tunneling dynamics in a commercial semiconductor at room temperature, by monitoring the random telegraph noise using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). This capability enables an electrical noise imaging technique, showing distinct noise variations across different wafer substrates. By employing dynamical decoupling, we extend noise spectroscopy from near-DC to MHz frequencies, uncovering significant noise spectral density correlations across frequency bands. Finally, we probe MHz-GHz noise and identify its origin via T1 relaxation spectroscopy, obtaining the first nanoscale electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic fingerprint of charge defects in SiC. These techniques open avenues for characterizing noise environments in semiconductor devices, providing critical insights for optimizing SiC fabrication processes, defect control, and advancing quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is commonly assumed to be fragile at ambient temperature and over macroscopic distances, where thermal noise and dissipation are expected to rapidly suppress nonclassical correlations. Here we show that this intuition fails for collective quantum modes whose dynamics is governed by reduced open-system channels rather than by microscopic thermal equilibrium. For two spatially separated collective modes, we derive an exact entanglement boundary based on the positivity of the partial transpose, valid in the symmetric resonant limit. From this result we obtain an explicit minimum collective fluctuation amplitude, expressed entirely in measurable noise, bandwidth, dissipation, and distance-dependent coupling parameters, required to sustain steady-state entanglement at finite temperature. We further show that large collective occupation suppresses but does not eliminate quantum phase diffusion, so the steady state remains phase symmetric and does not collapse to a classical mean-field despite macroscopic signal amplitudes. Stochastic simulations of the reduced open-system dynamics, together with matched classical correlated-noise null models analyzed through an identical pipeline, confirm that entanglement witnesses are violated only in the quantum regime. Our results establish a minimal, platform-independent framework connecting collective-mode dynamics, noise injection, distance, and operational certification of macroscopic entanglement.</description>

      <title>Entanglement protection induced by mixed noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to the conventional view that noise is detrimental, we show that mixed noise can protect entanglement in a two-atom-cavity system. Specifically, the leakage of the cavity and the stochastic atom-cavity couplings are modeled as two types of noises. From the analytical derivation of the dynamical equations, the mechanism of the entanglement protection is revealed as the high-frequency(HF) noise in the atom-cavity couplings could suppress the decoherence caused by the cavity leakage, thus protect the entanglement. We investigate the entanglement protection induced by mixed noise constructed from diverse noise types, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, flicker noise, and telegraph noise. Numerical simulations demonstrate that entanglement protection depends critically on the proportion of HF components in the power spectral density of the mixed noise. Our work establishes that enhanced HF components are essential for effective noise-assisted entanglement protection, offering key insights for noise engineering in practical open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum preferential attachment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum internet is a rapidly developing technological reality, yet, it remains unclear what kind of quantum network structures might emerge. Since indirect quantum communication is already feasible and preserves absolute security of the communication channel, a new node joining the quantum network does not need to connect directly to its desired target. Instead, in our proposed quantum preferential attachment model, it uniformly randomly connects to any node within the proximity of the target, including, but not restricted to, the target itself. This local flexibility is found to qualitatively change the global network behavior, leading to two distinct classes of complex network architectures, both of which are small-world, but neither of which is scale-free. Our numerical findings are supported by rigorous analytic results, in a framework that incorporates quantum and classical variants of preferential attachment in a unified phase diagram. Besides quantum networks, we expect that our results will have broad implications for classical scenarios where there is flexibility in establishing new connections.</description>

      <title>Experimental Joint Estimation of Phase and Phase Diffusion via Deterministic Bell Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate phase estimation plays a pivotal role in quantum metrology, yet its precision is significantly affected by noise, particularly phase-diffusive noise caused by phase drift. To address this challenge, the joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion has emerged as an effective approach, transforming the problem into a multi-parameter estimation task. However, the incompatibility between optimal measurements for different parameters prevents single-copy measurements from reaching the fundamental precision limits defined by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. Meanwhile, collective measurements performed on multiple identical copies can mitigate this incompatibility and thus enhance the precision of joint parameter estimation. This work experimentally demonstrates joint phase and phase-diffusion estimation using deterministic Bell measurements on a two-qubit system. A linear optical network is employed to implement both parameter encoding and deterministic Bell measurements, achieving improved estimation precision compared to any separable measurement strategy. This work proposes a new framework for phase estimation under phase-diffusive noise and underscores the substantial advantages of collective measurements in multi-parameter quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Modeling Noise in Quantum Computing of Scalar Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds potential for accelerating the simulation of fluid dynamics. However, hardware noise in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era significantly distorts simulation accuracy. Although error magnitudes are frequently quantified, the specific physical effects of quantum noise on flow simulation results remain largely uncharacterized. We investigate the influence of gate noise on the quantum simulation of one-dimensional scalar convection. By employing a quantum spectral algorithm where ideal time advancement affects only Fourier phases, we isolate and analyze noise-induced artifacts in spectral magnitudes. We derive a theoretical transition matrix based on Hamming distances between computational basis states to predict spectral decay, and then validate this model against density-matrix simulations and experiments on a superconducting quantum processor. Furthermore, using data-driven sparse regression, we demonstrate that quantum noise manifests in the effective partial differential equation primarily as artificial diffusion and nonlinear source terms. These findings suggest that quantum errors can be modeled as deterministic physical terms rather than purely stochastic perturbations.</description>

Abstract: Solving interacting multi-particle systems is a central challenge in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the computation of ground states and ground-state energies for the He-H+ and H2O molecules using quantum computing techniques. We employ the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), implemented both on a quantum computer simulator and on an IBM quantum device. The resulting energies are benchmarked against exact ground-state energies obtained via classical methods. Simulations of the H2O molecule were performed on Nottingham's High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry effects in homodyne and heterodyne measurements: Positive operator-valued measures and asymptotic security of Gaussian continuous variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Gaussian approximation describing photocount statistics for both the homodyne and the double homodyne (heterodyne) measurements to study asymmetry effects arising from imbalance of the beam splitters and variations in quantum efficiencies of the photodetectors. After computing the $Q$ symbols of the positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) of noisy measurements that take into account the asymmetry effects, the operator representations for the POVMs are obtained in the form that assumes applying the additive noise quantum channel to the POVMs of noiseless (ideal) measurements. For double homodyne detection, it was found that the noiseless measurements should generally be expressed in terms of the projectors onto squeezed-states and the corresponding squeezed-state operator representation of POVM along with the measurement noise channel depend on the squeezing parameter that lies in the interval dictated by the condition for the excess noise covariance matrix to be positive semi-definite. The analytical results are used to perform analysis of the asymptotic security of the Gaussian-modulated continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol in the untrusted-noise scenario where the measurement noise is assumed to be accessible to an adversary. The inherent non-uniqueness of the operator representation for the double-homodyne POVM manifests itself in the squeezing dependent Holevo information that needs to be additionally optimized. For both types of the measurements, the mutual information, the Holevo information and the asymptotic secret fraction are sensitive to asymmetry effects leading to degraded performance of the protocol.</description>

      <title>1d-qt-ideal-solver: 1D Idealized Quantum Tunneling Solver with Absorbing Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 1d-qt-ideal-solver, an open-source Python library for simulating one-dimensional quantum tunneling dynamics under idealized coherent conditions. The solver implements the split-operator method with second-order Trotter-Suzuki factorization, utilizing FFT-based spectral differentiation for the kinetic operator and complex absorbing potentials to eliminate boundary reflections. Numba just-in-time compilation achieves performance comparable to compiled languages while maintaining code accessibility. We validate the implementation through two canonical test cases: rectangular barriers modeling field emission through oxide layers and Gaussian barriers approximating scanning tunneling microscopy interactions. Both simulations achieve exceptional numerical fidelity with machine-precision energy conservation over femtosecond-scale propagation. Comparative analysis employing information-theoretic measures and nonparametric hypothesis tests reveals that rectangular barriers exhibit moderately higher transmission coefficients than Gaussian barriers in the over-barrier regime, though Jensen-Shannon divergence analysis indicates modest practical differences between geometries. Phase space analysis confirms complete decoherence when averaged over spatial-temporal domains. The library name reflects its scope: idealized signifies deliberate exclusion of dissipation, environmental coupling, and many-body interactions, limiting applicability to qualitative insights and pedagogical purposes rather than quantitative experimental predictions. Distributed under the MIT License, the library provides a deployable tool for teaching quantum mechanics and preliminary exploration of tunneling dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Self-Healing of Trotter Errors in Digitized Counterdiabatic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trotter errors in digitized quantum dynamics arise from approximating time-ordered evolution under noncommuting Hamiltonian terms with a product formula. In the adiabatic regime, such errors are known to exhibit long-time self-healing [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{131}, 060602 (2023)], where discretization effects are effectively suppressed. Here we show that self-healing persists at finite evolution times once nonadiabatic errors induced by finite-speed ramps are compensated. Using counterdiabatic driving to cancel diabatic transitions and isolate discretization effects, we study both noninteracting and interacting spin models and characterize the finite-time scaling with the Trotter steps and the total evolution time. In the instantaneous eigenbasis of the driven Hamiltonian, the leading digital error maps to an effective harmonic perturbation whose dominant Fourier component yields an analytic upper bound on the finite-time Trotter error and reveals the phase-cancellation mechanism underlying self-healing. Our results establish finite-time self-healing as a generic feature of digitized counterdiabatic protocols, clarify its mechanism beyond the long-time adiabatic limit, and provide practical guidance for high-fidelity state preparation on gate-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Measuring out-of-time-order correlators on a quantum computer based on an irreversibility-susceptibility method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) is a powerful tool for probing quantum information scrambling, a fundamental process by which local information spreads irreversibly throughout a quantum many-body system. Experimentally measuring the OTOC, however, is notoriously challenging due to the need for time-reversed evolution. Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei. We also conduct a detailed comparative analysis of all three methods, revealing method-dependent behaviors in the measured OTOC. This work not only validates these protocols as practical tools for exploring quantum chaos on near-term hardware but also offers crucial insights into their respective advantages and limitations, providing a practical framework for future experimental investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discretizing Helmholtz problems via finite elements yields linear systems whose efficient solution remains a major challenge for classical computation. In this paper, we investigate how variational quantum algorithms could address this challenge. We first show that, for regular meshes, a block encoding of the operators $A$ and $A^\dagger A$ arising from the high-order finite element discretisation of Helmholtz problems can be designed, resulting in a quantum circuit of depth $\mathcal{O}(p^3\mathrm{poly}\log(Np))$ with $N$ the number of elements and $p$ the order of the finite elements. Then we apply our algorithm to a one-dimensional Helmholtz problem with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for various wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>A method for robust spin relaxometry in the presence of imperfect state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin relaxometry based on quantum spin systems has developed as a valuable tool in medical and condensed matter systems, offering the advantage of operating without the need for external DC or RF fields. Spin relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers has been applied to paramagnetic sensing using both single crystal diamond and nanodiamond materials. However, these methods often suffer from artifacts and systematic uncertainties, particularly due to imperfect spin state preparation, leading to artificially fast T$_1$ relaxation times. Current analysis techniques fail to adequately account for these issues, limiting the precision of parameter estimation. In this work, we introduce a minimal fitting procedure that enables more robust parameter estimation in the presence of imperfect spin polarization. Our model improves upon existing approaches by offering more accurate fits and provides a framework for efficiently parallelizing single-spin dynamics studies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a new Rydberg gate design based on the original $\pi-2\pi-\pi$ protocol [Jaksch, et. al. Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 2208 (2000)] that is modified to enable high fidelity operation without requiring a strong Rydberg interaction. The gate retains the $\pi-2\pi-\pi$ structure with an additional detuning added to the $2\pi$ pulse on the target qubit. The protocol reaches within a factor of 2.39 (1.68) of the fundamental fidelity limit set by Rydberg lifetime for equal (asymmetric) Rabi frequencies on the control and target qubits. We generalize the gate protocol to arbitrary controlled phases. We design optimal target-qubit phase waveforms to generalize the gate across a range of interaction strengths and we find that, within this family of gates, the constant-phase protocol is time-optimal for a fixed laser Rabi frequency and tunable interaction strength. Robust control methods are used to design gates that are robust against variations in Rydberg Rabi frequency or interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Simulating Fully Gauge-Fixed SU(2) Hamiltonian Dynamics on Digital Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems offer novel methods for probing the dynamics of the Standard Model and its constituent gauge theories. Extracting low-energy predictions from such simulations rely on formulating systematically-improvable representations of lattice gauge theory Hamiltonians that are efficient at all values of the gauge coupling. One such candidate representation for SU(2) is the fully gauge-fixed Hamiltonian defined in the mixed basis. This work focuses on the quantum simulation of the smallest non-trivial system: two plaquettes with open boundary conditions. A mapping of the continuous gauge field degrees of freedom to qubit-based representations is developed. It is found that as few as three qubits per plaquette is sufficient to reach per-mille level precision on predictions for observables. Two distinct algorithms for implementing time evolution in the mixed basis are developed and analyzed in terms of quantum resource estimates. One algorithm has favorable scaling in circuit depth for large numbers of qubits, while the other is more practical when qubit count is limited. The latter algorithm is used in the measurement of a real-time observable on IBM's Heron superconducting quantum processor, ibm_fez. The quantum results match classical predictions at the percent-level. This work lays out a path forward for two- and three-dimensional simulations of larger systems, as well as demonstrating the viability of mixed-basis formulations for studying the properties of SU(2) gauge theories at all values of the gauge coupling.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Lie-Algebraic Pretraining and Non-Variational QWOA for the MaxCut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading candidate for achieving quantum advantage in combinatorial optimization on Near-Term Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However, random initialization of the variational parameters typically leads to vanishing gradients, rendering standard variational optimization ineffective. This paper provides a comparative performance analysis of two distinct strategies designed to improve trainability: Lie algebraic pretraining framework that uses Lie-algebraic classical simulation to find near-optimal initializations, and non-variational QWOA (NV-QWOA) that targets a restrict parameter subspace covered by 3 hyperparameters. We benchmark both methods on the unweighted Maxcut problem using a circuit depth of $p = 256$ across 200 Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and 200 3-regular graphs, each with 16 vertices. Both approaches significantly improve upon the standard randomly initialized QWOA. NV-QWOA attains a mean approximation ratio of 98.9\% in just 60 iterations, while the Lie-algebraic pretrained QWOA improves to 77.71\% after 500 iterations. That optimization proceeds more quickly for NV-QWOA is not surprising given its significantly smaller parameter space, however, that an algorithm with so few tunable parameters reliably finds near-optimal solutions is remarkable. These findings suggest that the structured parameterization of NV-QWOA offers a more robust training approach than pretraining on lower-dimensional auxiliary problems. Future work is needed to confirm scaling to larger problem sizes and to asses generalization to other problem classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a counterexample to the optimality conjecture in convex quantum channel optimization proposed by Coutts et al. The conjecture posits that for nuclear norm minimization problems in quantum channel optimization, the dual certificate of an optimal solution can be uniquely determined via the spectral calculus of the Choi matrix. By constructing a counterexample in 2-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we disprove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Any DOF All at Once: Single Photon State Tomography in a Single Measurement Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum technologies utilize various degrees of freedom (DOFs) of light, such as polarization, frequency, and spatial modes, to encode quantum information. In the effort of further improving channel capacity and increasing the complexity of available quantum operations, high-dimensional and hyperentangled states are now gaining interest. Efficiently measuring these high dimensional states is challenging due to the large number of measurements required for reconstructing the full density matrix via quantum state tomography (QST), and the fact that each measurement requires some modification in the experimental setup. Here, we propose a framework for reconstructing the density matrix of a single-photon hyperentangled across multiple DOFs using a single intensity-measurement obtainable from traditional cameras, and discuss extensions for multiphoton hyperentangled states. Our method hinges on the spatial DOF of the photon and uses it to encode information from other DOFs. We numerically demonstrate this method for single-photon OAM-spin and OAM-frequency entangled states using an ideal coupler and a multimode fiber, to perform the spatial information mixing and encoding. This technique simplifies the experimental setup and reduces acquisition time compared to traditional QST based methods. Moreover, it allows recovery of DOFs that conventional cameras cannot detect, such as polarization, thus eliminating the need for projection measurements.</description>

      <title>Agency under indefinite causality: operational eternalism in higher-order quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After two decades of research on indefinite causality, a philosophical lesson emerges: the tension between operational quantum theory and dynamical spacetime physics is unbridgeable if one believes both types of theories to be fundamental. We interpret this tension through operational eternalism, a stance analogous to the block-universe view but applied to information rather than geometry. Inputs and outputs are primary givens, while agents are secondary constructs arising from specific groupings of data. Agency is perspectival: from Alice's perspective Bob may not qualify as an observer, and vice versa. These results redefine the observer in the operational approach as a tool to avoid non-causality. They also provide a criterion for Wigner's friends as a class of causally compatible agents.</description>

      <title>Optimal Threshold for Fracton Codes and Nearly Saturated Code Capacity in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fracton codes have been intensively studied as novel topological states of matter, yet their fault-tolerant properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the optimal thresholds of self-dual fracton codes, in particular the checkerboard code, against stochastic Pauli noise. By utilizing a statistical-mechanical mapping combined with large-scale parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate the optimal code capacity of the checkerboard code to be $p_{th} \simeq 0.108(2)$. This value is the highest among known three-dimensional codes and nearly saturates the theoretical limit for topological codes. Our results further validate the generalized entropy relation for two mutually dual models, $H(p_{th}) + H(\tilde{p}_{th}) \approx 1$, and extend its applicability beyond standard topological codes. This verification indicates the Haah's code also possesses a code capacity near the theoretical limit $p_{th} \approx 0.11$. These findings highlight fracton codes as highly resilient quantum memory and demonstrate the utility of duality techniques in analyzing intricate quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Quantum batteries with K-regular graph generators: A no-go for quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular graphs find broad applications ranging from quantum communication to quantum computation. Motivated by this, we investigate the design of a quantum battery based on a K-regular graph, where K denotes the number of edges incident on each vertex. We prove that a 0-regular graph battery exhibits extractable work that scales linearly with the system-size when charged using a K-regular graph. This linear scaling is shown to persist even when the charging is implemented via a collective K-regular charger with power-law decaying interactions. While no superlinear scaling is observed, the work output is found to improve systematically with increasing regularity K. Furthermore, by introducing the notion of the fraction of extractable work when only subsystems are accessible, we identify this fraction to be independent of system-size if the battery is prepared in the down-polarized product state. This independence breaks down when the battery is oriented along the x- and y-directions of the Bloch sphere.</description>

      <title>Controlling Nonadiabatic Transitions Through Engineered Ultrafast Laser Fields at Conical Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate coherent control of nonadiabatic dynamics at a conical intersection (CI) using engineered ultrafast laser pulses. Within a model vibronic system, we tailor pulse chirp and temporal profile and compute the resulting wave-packet population and coherence dynamics using projections along the reaction coordinate. This approach allows us to resolve the detailed evolution of wave-packets as they traverse the degeneracy region with strong nonadiabatic coupling. By systematically varying pulse parameters, we demonstrate that both chirp and pulse duration modulate vibrational coherence and alter branching between competing pathways, leading to controlled changes in quantum yield. Our results elucidate the dynamical mechanisms underlying pulse-shaped control near conical intersections and establish a general framework for manipulating ultrafast nonadiabatic processes.</description>

      <title>Gauge Symmetry in Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories requires careful handling of gauge redundancy. We address this challenge by presenting universal principles for treating gauge symmetry that apply to any quantum simulation approach, clarifying that physical states need not be represented solely by gauge singlets. Both singlet and non-singlet representations are valid, with distinct practical trade-offs, which we elucidate using analogies to BRST quantization. We demonstrate these principles within a complete quantum simulation framework based on the orbifold lattice, which enables explicit and efficient circuit constructions relevant to real-world QCD. For singlet-based approaches, we introduce a Haar-averaging projection implemented via linear combinations of unitaries, and analyze its cost and truncation errors. Beyond the singlet-approach, we show how non-singlet approaches can yield gauge-invariant observables through wave packets and string excitations. This non-singlet approach is proven to be both universal and efficient. Working in temporal gauge, we provide explicit mappings of lattice Yang-Mills dynamics to Pauli-string Hamiltonians suitable for Trotterization. Classical simulations of small systems validate convergence criteria and quantify truncation and Trotter errors, showing concrete resource estimates and scalable circuit recipes for SU($N$) gauge theories. Our framework provides both conceptual clarity and practical tools toward quantum advantage in simulating non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Random matrix prediction of average entanglement entropy in non-Abelian symmetry sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the average bipartite entanglement entropy of Haar-random pure states in quantum many-body systems with global $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry, constrained to fixed total spin $J$ and magnetization $J_z = 0$. Focusing on spin-$\tfrac12$ lattices and subsystem fractions $f &lt; \frac{1}{2}$, we derive a asymptotic expression for the average entanglement entropy up to constant order in the system volume $V$. In addition to the expected leading volume law term, we prove the existence of a $\frac{1}{2}\log V$ finite-size correction resulting from the scaling of the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and compute explicitly the $O(1)$ contribution reflecting angular-momentum coupling within magnetization blocks. Our analysis uses features of random matrix ensembles and provides a fully analytical treatment for arbitrary spin densities, thereby extending Page type results to non-Abelian sectors and clarifying how $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry shapes average entanglement.</description>

      <title>Revisiting finite Abelian hidden subgroup problem and its distributed exact quantum algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the finite Abelian hidden subgroup problem (AHSP) from a mathematical perspective and make the following contributions. First, by employing amplitude amplification, we present an exact quantum algorithm for the finite AHSP, our algorithm is more concise than the previous exact algorithm and applies to any finite Abelian group. Second, utilizing the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we propose a distributed exact quantum algorithm for finite AHSP, which requires fewer qudits, lower quantum query complexity, and no quantum communication. We further show that our distributed approach can be extended to certain classes of non-Abelian groups. Finally, we develop a parallel exact classical algorithm for finite AHSP with reduced query complexity; even without parallel execution, the total number of queries across all nodes does not exceed that of the original centralized algorithm under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Comment on "There is No Quantum World" by Jeffrey Bub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent preprint [1] Jeffrey Bub presents a discussion of neo-Bohrian interpretations of quantum mechanics, and also of von Neumann's work on infinite tensor products [2]. He rightfully writes that this work provides a theoretical framework that deflates the measurement problem and justifies Bohr's insistence on the primacy of classical concepts. But then he rejects these ideas, on the basis that the infinity limit is "never reached for any real system composed of a finite number of elementary systems". In this note we present opposite views on two major points: first, admitting mathematical infinities in a physical theory is not a problem, if properly done; second, the critics of [3,4,5] comes with a major misunderstanding of these papers: they don't ask about "the significance of the transition from classical to quantum mechanics", but they start from a physical ontology where classical and quantum physics need each other from the beginning. This is because they postulate that a microscopic physical object (or degree of freedom) always appears as a quantum system, within a classical context. Here we argue why this (neo-Bohrian) position makes sense.</description>

      <title>Fast chiral resolution with optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we formulate the problem of achieving in minimum-time perfect chiral resolution with bounded control fields, as an optimal control problem on two non-interacting spins-$1/2$. We assume the same control bound for the two Raman fields (pump and Stokes) and a different bound for the field connecting directly the two lower-energy states. Using control theory, we show that the optimal fields can only take the boundary values or be zero, the latter corresponding to singular control. Subsequently, using numerical optimal control and intuitive arguments, we identify some three-stage symmetric optimal pulse-sequences, for relatively larger values of the ratio between the two control bounds, and analytically calculate the corresponding pulse timings as functions of this ratio. For smaller values of the bounds ratio, numerical optimal control indicates that the optimal pulse-sequence loses its symmetry and the number of stages increases in general. In all cases, the analytical or numerical optimal protocol achieves a faster perfect chiral resolution than other pulsed protocols, mainly because of the simultaneous action of the control fields. The present work is expected to be useful in the wide spectrum of applications across the natural sciences where enantiomer separation is a crucial task.</description>

      <title>Graph restricted tensors: building blocks for holographic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze few-body quantum states with particular correlation properties imposed by the requirement of maximal bipartite entanglement for selected partitions of the system into two complementary parts. A novel framework to treat this problem by encoding these constraints in a graph is advocated; the resulting objects are called ``graph-restricted tensors''. This framework encompasses several examples previously treated in the literature, such as 1-uniform multipartite states, quantum states related to dual unitary operators and absolutely maximally entangled states (AME) corresponding to 2-unitary matrices. Original examples of presented graph-restricted tensors are motivated by tensor network models for the holographic principle. In concrete cases we find exact analytic solutions, demonstrating thereby that there exists a vast landscape of non-stabilizer tensors useful for the lattice models of holography.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Preserving Variational Quantum Simulation of the Heisenberg Spin Chain on Noisy Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for simulating interacting quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the practical success of variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) critically depends on the structure of the chosen variational ansatz. In this work, we investigate the ground-state properties of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain using both generic hardware-efficient ansatz and physics-informed, symmetry-preserving variational circuits. We benchmark variational results against exact diagonalization and noiseless simulations, and subsequently validate the approach on real IQM Garnet quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that incorporating physical symmetries into the circuit design leads to significantly improved energy estimates, enhanced robustness against hardware noise, and clearer convergence behavior when compared to hardware-efficient ansatz under identical resource constraints. These findings highlight the importance of problem specific ansatz construction for reliable quantum simulations in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Entropy of Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the costs and benefits of embedding the states of one quantum system within those of another. Such embeddings are ubiquitous, e.g., in error correcting codes and in symmetry-constrained systems. In particular we investigate the impact of embeddings in terms of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness (also known as magic) quantified via the stabilizer entropy (SE). We analytically and numerically study the stabilizer entropy gap or magic gap: the average gap between the SE of a quantum state realized within a subspace of a larger system and the SE of the quantum state considered on its own. We find that while the stabilizer entropy gap is typically positive, requiring the injection of magic, both zero and negative magic gaps are achievable. This suggests that certain choices of embedding subspace provide strong resource advantages over others. We provide formulas for the average nonstabilizerness of a subspace given its corresponding projector and sufficient conditions for realizing zero or negative gaps: in particular, certain classes of stabilizer codes provide paradigmatic examples of the latter. Through numerical optimization, we find subspaces which achieve both minimal and maximal average SE for a variety of dimensions, and compute the magic gap for specific error-correcting codes and symmetry-induced subspaces. Our results suggest that a judicious choice of embedding can lead to greater efficiency in both classical and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Applying Grover-mixer Quantum Alternating Ansatz Algorithm to Higher-order Quadratic Unconstrained Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is among leading candidates for achieving quantum advantage on near-term processors. While typically implemented with a transverse-field mixer (XM-QAOA), the Grover-mixer variant (GM-QAOA) offers a compelling alternative due to its global search capabilities. This work investigates the application of GM-QAOA to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, also known as Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO), which constitute a generalized class of combinatorial optimization tasks characterized by intrinsically multi-variable interactions. We present a comprehensive numerical study demonstrating that GM-QAOA, unlike XM-QAOA, exhibits monotonic performance improvement with circuit depth and achieves superior results for HUBO problems. An important component of our approach is an analytical framework for modeling GM-QAOA dynamics, which enables a classical approximation of the optimal parameters and helps reduce the optimization overhead. Our resource-efficient parameterized GM-QAOA nearly matches the performance of the fully optimized algorithm while being far less demanding, establishing it as a highly effective approach for complex optimization tasks. These findings highlight GM-QAOA's potential and provide a practical pathway for its implementation on current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>SOFT: a high-performance simulator for universal fault-tolerant quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit simulation tools are critical for developing and assessing quantum-error-correcting and fault-tolerant strategies. In this work, we present SOFT, a high-performance SimulatOr for universal Fault-Tolerant quantum circuits. Integrating the generalized stabilizer formalism and highly optimized GPU parallelization, SOFT enables the simulation of noisy quantum circuits containing non-Clifford gates at a scale not accessible with existing tools. To provide a concrete demonstration, we simulate the state-of-the-art magic state cultivation (MSC) protocol at code distance $d=5$, involving 42 qubits, 72 $T$ / $T^\dagger$ gates, and mid-circuit measurements. Using only modest GPU resources, SOFT performs over 200 billion shots and achieves the first ground-truth simulation of the cultivation protocol at a non-trivial scale. This endeavor not only certifies the MSC's effectiveness for generating high-fidelity logical $T$-states, but also reveals a large discrepancy between the actual logical error rate and the previously reported values. Our work demonstrates the importance of reliable simulation tools for fault-tolerant architecture design, advancing the field from simulating quantum memory to simulating a universal quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Clifford entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Clifford entropy, a measure of how close an arbitrary unitary is to a Clifford unitary, which generalizes the stabilizer entropy for states. We show that this quantity vanishes if and only if a unitary is Clifford, is invariant under composition with Clifford unitaries, and is subadditive under tensor products. Rewriting the Clifford entropy in terms of the stabilizer entropy of the corresponding Choi state allows us to derive an upper bound: that this bound is not tight follows from considering the properties of symmetric informationally complete sets. Nevertheless we are able to numerically estimate the maximum in low dimensions, comparing it to the average over all unitaries, which we derive analytically. Finally, harnessing a concentration of measure result, we show that as the dimension grows large, with probability approaching unity, the ratio between the Clifford entropy of a Haar random unitary and that of a fixed magic gate gives a lower bound on the depth of a doped Clifford circuit which realizes the former in terms of the latter. In fact, numerical evidence suggests that this result holds reliably even in low dimensions. We conclude with several directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis and Simulations of Memory-based and All-photonic Quantum Repeaters and Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing and deploying advanced Quantum Repeater (QR) technologies will be necessary to scale quantum networks to longer distances. Depending on the error mitigation mechanisms adopted to suppress loss and errors, QRs are typically classified into memory-based or all-photonic QRs; and each type of QR may be best suited for a specific type of underlying quantum technology, a particular scale of quantum networks, or a specific regime of operational parameters. We perform theoretical analysis and simulations of quantum repeaters and networks to investigate the relative performance and resource requirements of different quantum network paradigms. Our results will help guide the optimization of quantum hardware and components and shed light on the role of a robust control plane. We present our research findings on theoretical analysis and simulations of memory-based first-generation trapped-ion quantum repeaters and networks, and all-photonic entanglement-based quantum repeaters and networks. We study the relative performance in terms of entanglement generation rate and fidelity, as well as the resource requirements of these two different quantum network paradigms.</description>

      <title>Efficient flip-chip and on-chip-based modulation of flux-tunable superconducting resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the efficient modulation of flux-tunable superconducting resonators (FTRs) using flip-chip or on-chip-based input coils. The FTRs we use are aluminum-based quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators terminated with 100um or 200um-wide square loop dc superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing 1um-sized Josephson junctions. We employ SQUIDs with a geometric loop inductance of up to 0.7nH to increase the flux transfer efficiency. The geometric inductance of the SQUID results in a non-zero screening parameter $\beta_L$, whose branch switching effect is mitigated by using asymmetric junctions. We achieve flux modulation of the FTRs by more than one GHz and flux responsivities of up to tens of GHz/$\Phi_0$ with uA-scale on-chip currents. We compare flip-chip with on-chip input-coil-based flux modulation, where the former is realized through galvanically connected and closely spaced chips, while the latter is achieved through superconducting air-bridge connections. We achieve a flux-transfer efficiency from the input coil to the SQUID loop of up to 20%. Our work paves the way for efficient low current flux modulation of FTRs and sensitive measurement of flux signals.</description>

      <title>Emergence of nonclassical radiation in strongly laser-driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonclassical light sources are central to emerging quantum technologies, yet current platforms offer limited tunability and typically operate at low photon numbers. In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and generated fields, a unified theoretical framework capable of identifying the origin and controllability of these effects has been missing. Here we introduce a fully quantum, analytically tractable theory of intense light-matter interaction that rigorously captures the emergence of nonclassicality in HHG. Our approach employs a parametric factorization of the coupled electron-field system into a driven electronic state and a dynamically perturbed quantum optical field, derived directly from the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation without requiring conditioning, homodyne detection, or mode-selection techniques. We show how quantum correlations, squeezing, and Wigner-function negativity arise intrinsically from the interaction dynamics, and we identify the precise conditions under which specific nonclassical features are amplified or suppressed. The theory enables predictive design of bright, high-photon-number quantum states at tunable frequencies, and we demonstrate its utility by outlining realistic conditions for generating bright nonclassical ultraviolet light. Our results establish a comprehensive foundation for strong-field quantum optics and open new avenues toward tabletop quantum light sources for sensing, communication, and photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology via Adiabatic Control of Topological Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criticality-based quantum sensing exploits hypersensitive response to system parameters near phase transition points. This work uncovers two metrological advantages offered by topological phase transitions when the probe is prepared as topological edge states. Firstly, the order of topological band touching is found to determine how the metrology sensitivity scales with the system size. Engineering a topological phase transition with higher-order band touching is hence advocated, with the associated quantum Fisher information scaling as $ \mathcal{F}_Q \sim L^{2p}$, with $L$ the lattice size in one dimension, and $p$ the order of band touching. Secondly, with a topological lattice accommodating degenerate edge modes (such as multiple zero modes), preparing an $N$-particle entangled state at the edge and then adiabatically tuning the system to the phase transition point grows quantum entanglement to macroscopic sizes, yielding $\mathcal{F}_Q \sim N^2 L^{2p}$. This work hence paves a possible topological phase transition-based route to harness entanglement, large lattice size, and high-order band touching for quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>LogosQ: A High-Performance and Type-Safe Quantum Computing Library in Rust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing robust and high performance quantum software is challenging due to the dynamic nature of existing Python-based frameworks, which often suffer from runtime errors and scalability bottlenecks. In this work, we present LogosQ, a high performance backend agnostic quantum computing library implemented in Rust that enforces correctness through compile time type safety. Unlike existing tools, LogosQ leverages Rust static analysis to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors, particularly in parameter-shift rule gradient computations for variational algorithms. We introduce novel optimization techniques, including direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallel processing, and an FFT optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, which collectively deliver speedups of up to 900 times for state preparation (QFT) and 2 to 5 times for variational workloads over Python frameworks (PennyLane, Qiskit), 6 to 22 times over Julia implementations (Yao), and competitive performance with Q sharp. Beyond performance, we validate numerical stability through variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments on molecular hydrogen and XYZ Heisenberg models, achieving chemical accuracy even in edge cases where other libraries fail. By combining the safety of systems programming with advanced circuit optimization, LogosQ establishes a new standard for reliable and efficient quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transitions in Coherent Ising Machines: XY Model for Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in coherent Ising machines (CIMs) are studied via a spectral mapping between the one-dimensional XY spin model and a network of degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs). This exact correspondence reveals that the DOPO network faithfully reproduces the quantum critical behavior of the XY model across its anisotropic, isotropic, and transverse-field Ising regimes. The ground-state energy density and its derivatives are analyzed to reveal second-order QPTs characterized by singularities in magnetic susceptibility at critical points. These results show that CIMs do not only serve as powerful platforms for solving combinatorial optimization problems but also provide a versatile optical simulator for studying universal quantum critical phenomena, bridging quantum-spin models and photonic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Towards a Faithful Quantumness Certification Functional for One-Dimensional Continuous-Variable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the phase space-based Sudarshan-Glauber distribution, $P_{\rho}$, has negative values the quantum state, $\rho$, it describes is nonclassical. Due to $P$'s singular behavior this simple criterion is impractical to use. Recent work [Bohmann and Agudelo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 133601 (2020)] presented a general, sensitive, and noise-tolerant certification functional, $\xi_{P}$, for the detection of non-classical behavior of quantum states $P_{\rho}$. There, it was shown that when this functional takes on negative values somewhere in phase space, $\xi_{P}(x,p) &lt; 0$, this is \emph{sufficient} to certify the nonclassicality of a state. Here we give examples where this certification fails. We investigate states which are known to be nonclassical but the certification functions is positive $\xi(x,p) \geq 0$ everywhere in phase space. We generalize $\xi$ giving it an appealing form which allows for improved certification. This way we generate the best family of certification functions available so far. Yet, they also fail for very weakly nonclassical states, in other words, the question how to faithfully certify quantumness remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Generation of Squeezed Fock States by Particle-Number Measurements on Multimode Gaussian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of squeezed Fock states (SFSs) via particle-number measurements in the modes of multimode Gaussian states. We identify a universal class of $N$-mode Gaussian states for which measuring $N-1$ modes results in the generation of SFSs. The key feature of these states is that the generated SFSs depend only on the total number of detected particles and are independent of their distribution among the detectors. Based on the general form of the wave functions of multimode Gaussian states, we propose a universal scheme for SFS generation. For this scheme, we evaluate the probability of SFS generation and analyze the robustness of the process against imperfections in particle-number-resolving detectors. In addition, we compare the universal scheme with a nonuniversal scheme, in which the generation of SFSs depends on a specific distribution of particle numbers across the detectors. We demonstrate that the universal scheme provides a higher probability of SFS generation, at the cost of increased experimental resources.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Rashomon Effect as a Failure of Gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Szangolies has argued (in the setting of extended Wigner's-friend scenarios) that quantum theory permits ``Rashomon'' situations: multiple internally coherent accounts of events that cannot be combined into a single, consistent global narrative. This note explains why the Rashomon phenomenon can be understood as a \emph{failure of gluing}: local descriptions over different contexts exist, but they do not admit a single global ``all-perspectives-at-once'' description. This is the same mathematical obstruction that underlies modern sheaf-theoretic treatments of contextuality. I then indicate why the same perspective is useful in parts of the social sciences (quantum-like modelling of cognition, judgment, and decision-making), where ``context effects'' can likewise be interpreted as the absence of a single joint probability space.</description>

      <title>Practical quantum teleportation with finite-energy codebooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication exploits non-classical correlations to achieve efficient and unconditionally secure exchange of information. In particular, the quantum teleportation protocol allows for a deterministic and secure transfer of unknown quantum states by using pre-shared quantum entanglement and classical feedforward communication. Quantum teleportation in the microwave regime provides an important tool for high-fidelity remote quantum operations, enabling distributed quantum computing with superconducting circuits and potentially facilitating short-range, open-air microwave quantum communication. In this context, we consider practical application scenarios for the microwave analog quantum teleportation protocol based on continuous-variable states. We theoretically analyze the effect of feedforward losses and noise on teleportation fidelities of coherent states and show that these imperfections can be fully corrected by an appropriate feedforward gain. Furthermore, we consider quantum teleportation with finite-size codebooks and derive modified no-cloning thresholds as a function of the codebook configuration. Finally, we analyze the security of quantum teleportation under public channel attacks and demonstrate that the corresponding secure fidelity thresholds may drastically differ from the conventional no-cloning values. Our results contribute to the general development of quantum communication protocols and, in particular, illustrate the feasibility of using quantum teleportation in realistic microwave networks for robust and unconditionally secure communication.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Quantum Annealing vs Trit Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising strategy for solving complex optimization problems by encoding the solution into the ground state of a problem Hamiltonian. While most implementations rely on spin-$1/2$ systems, we explore the performance of quantum annealing on a spin-$1$ system where the problem Hamiltonian includes a single ion anisotropy term of the form $D\sum (S^z)^2$. Our results reveal that for a suitable range of the anisotropy strength $D$, the spin-$1$ annealer reaches the ground state with higher fidelity. We attribute this performance to the presence of the intermediate spin level and the tunable anisotropy, which together enable the algorithm to traverse the energy landscape through smaller, incremental steps instead of a single large spin flip. This mechanism effectively lowers barriers in the configuration space and stabilizes the evolution. These findings suggest that higher spin annealers offer intrinsic advantages for robust and flexible quantum optimization, especially for problems naturally formulated with ternary decision variables.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Free $\Delta$-Type Coherent Population Trapping for Microwave Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated experimentally and theoretically a cavity-free microwave field that couples the two ground states of a {\Lambda}-type atomic system, thereby forming a closed {\Delta} configuration. In this regime, the absence of cavity-imposed phase matching leads to a strong sensitivity of the ground-state coherence to the microwave field parameters. We observe that the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance exhibits a pronounced dependence on the microwave power and detuning, resulting in measurable changes in resonance contrast, linewidth, and center frequency. To explain these effects, we develop a numerical density-matrix model in which the ground-state coherence explicitly incorporates the microwave coupling strength, capturing the essential physics of this no-phase-matching {\Delta} system. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment establishes a simple and robust framework for microwave control of cavity-free {\Delta}-type atomic systems, with direct implications for compact atomic clocks and quantum-enhanced quantum sensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals interaction at short and long distances: a pedagogical path from stationary to time-dependent perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The van der Waals interaction between neutral atoms is typically studied using stationary perturbation theory for the short-distance (London) limit, while long-distance (Casimir-Polder) results are usually derived via semiclassical, time-dependent approaches. In this pedagogical article, we demonstrate that reformulating stationary perturbation theory calculations in terms of time-ordered correlation functions significantly simplifies the mathematical treatment. This reformulation is particularly advantageous for higher-order calculations required in the long-distance regime, where retardation effects become important. Our approach provides a unified framework that connects both limiting cases while offering a clear conceptual picture suitable for advanced quantum mechanics courses.</description>

      <title>Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell-inequality Violability with the Full Poincar\'e-Bloch Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearly polarized projections are the tacit means for performing Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality tests using polarization-entangled photon pairs. The inequality is valid for all states on the Poincar\'e-Bloch sphere, but few laboratory studies have investigated violations with the full sphere. In this article, we explore the experimental verifications of the predicted violations of the CHSH inequality with Bell and non-Bell states with same and different linear and elliptically polarized basis states for each photon. We find that Bell states violate CHSH when using the same basis for both photons, regardless of their ellipticity, whereas they show no violations for photon projections in different bases. We found non-Bell maximally-entangled states for which the converse is true.</description>

      <title>Averaging of quantum channels via channel-state duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twirling, uniform averaging over symmetry actions, is a standard tool for reducing the description of quantum states and channels to symmetry-invariant data. We develop a framework for averaging quantum channels based on channel-state duality that converts pre- and post-processing averages into a group twirl acting directly on the Choi operator. For arbitrary unitary representations on the input and output spaces, the twirled channel is obtained as an explicit projection onto the commutant of the induced representation on $\mathcal H_{\rm out}\otimes \mathcal H_{\rm in}$. In the collective setting, where the commutant is the walled Brauer algebra, we introduce a partial-transpose reduction that maps channel twirling to an ordinary Schur-Weyl twirl of the partially transposed Choi operator, enabling formulas in terms of permutation operators. We further extend the construction beyond compact symmetries to reductive non-unitary groups via Cartan decomposition, yielding a weighted sum of invariant-sector projections with weights determined by the Abelian component. Finally, we provide two finite realizations of channel averaging. The first one is a ``dual'' averaging protocol as a convex mixture of unitary-$1$-design channels on invariant sectors. The second one is a notion of channel $t$-designs induced by weighted group $t$-designs for $t=t_{\rm in}+t_{\rm out}$.</description>

      <title>Paradox-free classical non-causality and unambiguous non-locality without entanglement are equivalent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed timelike curves (CTCs) challenge our conception of causality by allowing information to loop back into its own past. Any consistent description of such scenarios must avoid time-travel paradoxes while respecting the no-new-physics principle, which requires that the set of operations available within any local spacetime region remain unchanged, irrespective of whether CTCs exist elsewhere. Within an information-theoretic framework, this leads to process functions: deterministic classical communication structures that remain logically consistent under arbitrary local operations, yet can exhibit correlations incompatible with any definite causal order - a phenomenon known as non-causality. In this work, we provide the first complete recursive characterization of process functions and of (non-)causal process functions. We use it to establish a correspondence between process functions and unambiguous complete product bases, i.e., product bases in which every local state belongs to a unique local basis. This equivalence implies that non-causality of process functions is exactly mirrored by quantum nonlocality without entanglement (QNLWE) - the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing separable states using local operations and causal classical communication - for such bases. Our results generalize previous special cases to arbitrary local dimensions and any number of parties, enable systematic constructions of non-causal process functions and unambiguous QNLWE bases, and reveal an unexpected connection between certain non-signaling inequalities and causal inequalities.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-limited metrology from the quantum-quench dynamics of an anisotropic ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of quantum magnonics seeks to understand and harness the quantum properties of magnons -- quantized collective spin excitations in magnets. Squeezed magnon states arise naturally as the equilibrium ground states of anisotropic ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, representing an important class of nonclassical magnon states. In this work, we show how a qubit-conditioned quantum quench of an anisotropic ferromagnet can be used for Heisenberg-limited parameter estimation based on measurements of the qubit only. In the presence of ground-state squeezing, the protocol yields information about the eigenmode frequency of the coupled magnon-qubit system, whereas no information is gained in the absence of such squeezing. The protocol therefore leverages genuine quantum correlations in the form of magnonic squeezing while simultaneously relying on the equilibrium character of this squeezing -- a feature distinctive to magnetic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents a concise overview of the contemporary research directions in quantum computer cybersecurity. The aim of this document is not to be a survey, but rather a succinct summary of the major research directions in quantum computer cybersecurity at the end of the first half of the current decade. The document has been inspired by the presentations and discussions held at the 3$^{rd}$ Quantum Computer Cybersecurity Symposium, but goes beyond the contents of the symposium and aims to summarize at the high level the last five years of quantum computer cybersecurity work in academia. It is hoped that the document can provide researchers as well as government and industry leaders an overview of the current landscape of security threats and defenses against emergent quantum computing technologies. The document also includes a discussion of the current trends in cybersecurity research on quantum computers, and the perceived research gaps that should be filled with future funding and through academic and industry~research.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Invariant Phase Mapping to Intensity Lobes of Structured Light via Closed-Loop Atomic Dark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical model showing how the gauge-invariant loop phase in a three-level closed-loop atomic system imprints as bright-dark lobes in Laguerre Gaussian probe beam intensity patterns. In the weak probe limit, the output intensity in such systems include Beer-Lambert absorption, a scattering term and loop phase dependent interference term with optical depth controlling visibility. These systems enable mapping of arbitrary phases via interference rotation and offer a platform to measure Berry phase. Berry phase emerge as a geometric holonomy acquired by the dark states during adiabatic traversal of LG phase defined in a toroidal parameter space. Manifesting as fringe shifts which are absent in open systems, experimental realization using cold atoms or solid state platforms appears feasible, positioning structured light in closed-loop systems as ideal testbeds for geometric phases in quantum optics.</description>

      <title>The operational no-signalling constraints and their implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quantum correlations within relativistic spacetimes, and the consequences of relativistic causality on information processing using such correlations, has gained much attention in recent years. In this paper, we establish a unified framework in the form of operational no-signalling constraints to study both nonlocal and temporal correlations within general relativistic spacetimes. We explore several intriguing consequences arising from our framework. Firstly, we show that the violation of the operational no-signalling constraints in Minkowski spacetime implies either a logical paradox or an operational infringement of Poincar\'{e} symmetry. We thereby examine and subvert recent claims in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 110401 (2022)] on the possibility of witnessing operationally detectable causal loops in Minkowski spacetime. Secondly, we explore the possibility of jamming of nonlocal correlations, controverting a recent claim in [Nat. Comm. 16, 269 (2025)] that a physical mechanism for jamming would necessarily lead to superluminal signalling. Finally, we show that in black hole spacetimes certain nonlocal correlations under and across the event horizon can be jammed by any agent without spoiling the operational no-signalling constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify quantum geometric bounds for observables in non-Hermitian systems. We find unique bounds on non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensors, generalized two-point response correlators, conductivity tensors, and optical weights. We showcase these findings in topological systems with non-Hermitian Chern numbers. We demonstrate that the non-Hermitian geometric constraints on response functions naturally arise in open quantum systems governed by out-of-equilibrium Lindbladian dynamics. Our findings are relevant to experimental observables and responses under the realistic setups that fall beyond the idealized closed-system descriptions.</description>

      <title>Revealing Electron-Ytterbium Interactions through Rydberg Molecular Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Divalent atoms have emerged as powerful alternatives to alkalis in ultracold atom platforms, offering unique advantages arising from their two-electron structure. Among these species, ytterbium (Yb) is especially promising, yet its anionic properties and its Rydberg spectrum remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we perform a first and comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules (ULRMs) of $^{174}$Yb in $6sns\,^1S_0$ Rydberg states across nearly two decades in principal quantum number $n$ and three orders of magnitude in molecular binding energy. Using the Coulomb Green's function formalism, we compute Born-Oppenheimer molecular potentials describing the Rydberg atom in the presence of a ground-state perturber and achieve quantitative agreement with high-resolution molecular spectra. This enables the extraction of low-energy electron-Yb scattering phase shifts, including the zero-energy $s$-wave scattering length and the positions of two spin-orbit split $p$-wave shape resonances. Our results provide strong evidence that the Yb$^{-}$ anion exists only as a metastable resonance. We additionally show the sensitivity of ULRM spectra to the atomic quantum defects, using this to refine the value for the $6s23f\, ^1F_3$ quantum defect. Together, these findings establish Yb ULRMs as a powerful probe of electron-Yb interactions and lay essential groundwork for future Rydberg experiments with divalent atoms.</description>

      <title>Self-referenced nonlinear interferometry for chromatic dispersion sensing across multiple length scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromatic dispersion critically impacts the performance of numerous applications ranging from telecommunication links to ultrafast optics and nonlinear devices, yet fast and precise measurements are challenging, especially for short length-dispersion products. We present a fully fiber-integrated nonlinear Sagnac interferometer that exploits cascaded second-order processes to generate frequency-anticorrelated idler light and achieve odd-order dispersion cancellation without active stabilization. The measurement is intrinsically self-referenced, as the dispersion-induced phase is extracted from the interference between counter-propagating nonlinear processes within the same Sagnac loop, eliminating the need for an external reference arm or prior calibration. Operating entirely at telecom wavelengths and read out on a standard optical spectrum analyzer, the device produces instantaneous, high-visibility fringes and calibration-free spectra using dual-port normalization. We demonstrate chromatic dispersion measurements on fiber samples ranging from 25 cm to 4 km, spanning short fiber segments to long-haul links. This architecture combines self-stability, broadband compatibility, and rapid acquisition, offering a practical metrology tool for both research and industry.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Optical Trapping of a Metal Hydride Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT) of a metal hydride molecule, CaH. We are able to scatter $\sim$$10^{4}$ photons with vibrational loss covered up to vibrational quantum number $\nu=2$. This allows us to laser slow the molecular beam near zero velocity with a "white-light" technique and subsequently load it into a radio-frequency MOT. The MOT contains 230(40) molecules, limited by beam source characteristics and predissociative loss of CaH. The temperature of the MOT is below one millikelvin. The predissociative loss mechanism could, in turn, facilitate controlled dissociation of the molecule, offering a possible route to optical trapping of hydrogen atoms for precision spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Specification and Reasoning for Quantum Data and Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum information and computation research, symbolic methods have been widely used for human specification and reasoning about quantum states and operations. At the same time, they are essential for ensuring the scalability and efficiency of automated reasoning and verification tools for quantum algorithms and programs. However, a formal theory for symbolic specification and reasoning about quantum data and operations is still lacking, which significantly limits the practical applicability of automated verification techniques in quantum computing.
  In this paper, we present a general logical framework, called Symbolic Operator Logic $\mathbf{SOL}$, which enables symbolic specification and reasoning about quantum data and operations. Within this framework, a classical first-order logical language is embedded into a language of formal operators used to specify quantum data and operations, including their recursive definitions. This embedding allows reasoning about their properties modulo a chosen theory of the underlying classical data (e.g., Boolean algebra or group theory), thereby leveraging existing automated verification tools developed for classical computing. It should be emphasised that this embedding of classical first-order logic into $\mathbf{SOL}$ is precisely what makes the symbolic method possible.
  We envision that this framework can provide a conceptual foundation for the formal verification and automated theorem proving of quantum computation and information in proof assistants such as Lean, Coq, and related systems.</description>

      <title>Determinism and Indeterminism as Model Artefacts: Toward a Model-Invariant Ontology of Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that the traditional opposition between determinism and indeterminism in physics is representational rather than ontological. Deterministic-stochastic dualities are available in principle, and arise in a non-contrived way in many scientifically important models. When dynamical systems admit mathematically equivalent deterministic and stochastic formulations, their observable predictions depend only on the induced structure of correlations between preparations and measurement outcomes. I use this model-equivalence to motivate a model-invariance criterion for ontological commitment, according to which only structural features that remain stable across empirically equivalent representations, and whose physical effects are invariant under such reformulations, are candidates for realism. This yields a fallibilist form of structural realism grounded in modal robustness rather than in the specifics of any given mathematical representation. Features such as conservation laws, symmetries, and causal or metric structure satisfy this criterion and can be encoded in observable relations in mathematically intelligible ways. By contrast, the localisation of modal selection -- whether in initial conditions, stochastic outcomes, or informational collapse mechanisms -- is not invariant under empirically equivalent reformulations and is therefore best understood as a gauge choice rather than an ontological feature. The resulting framework explains how certain long-standing problems in the foundations of physics, including the measurement problem and the perceived conflict between physical determinism and free agency, arise from the reification of representational artefacts. By distinguishing model-invariant structure from modelling conventions, I offer a realist ontology for modern physics that combines empirical openness with resistance to metaphysical overreach.</description>

      <title>Fast collisional $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate for fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisional gates in optical superlattices have recently achieved record fidelities, but their operation times are typically limited by tunneling. Here we propose and analyze an alternative route to a fast $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate for two fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice based on optimized, time-dependent control of the short and long lattice depths. The gate is implemented by transiently releasing the atoms into a quasi-harmonic confinement centered between the two sites. With an appropriately chosen contact interaction strength, a controlled collision accumulates the exchange phase required for $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ and generates entanglement. We employ a continuum, time-dependent Schr\"odinger-equation simulation that goes beyond a two-site Fermi--Hubbard description and benchmark it against experimentally implemented tunneling-based protocols, reproducing the observed single-particle tunneling and spin-exchange dynamics. For experimentally accessible lattice depths, we find that the proposed gate operates in $\sim 21\,\mu\mathrm{s}$, more than an order of magnitude faster than tunneling-based implementations, while achieving fidelities $\gtrsim 99\%$. We further analyze sensitivity to lattice-depth variations and show that a composite sequence improves robustness. Our results establish fast, collision-mediated entangling gates in superlattices as a promising building block for scalable neutral-atom quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Affine Symmetry and the Group-Theoretic Basis of the Unruh Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A massless scalar field in two spacetime dimensions splits into two independent sectors of left and right-moving modes on the light cone. At the quantum level, these two sectors carry a representation of the group of affine transformations of the real line, with translations corresponding to transformations generated by light-cone momenta and dilations given by light-cone Rindler momenta formed by a linear combination of generators of boosts and dilations. One-particle states for inertial observers are eigenvectors of translation generators belonging to irreducible representations of the affine group. Rindler one-particle states are related to eigenfunctions of the generator of dilations. We show that simple manipulations connecting these two representations involving the Mellin transform can be used to derive the thermal spectrum of Rindler particles observed by an accelerated observer. Beyond providing a representation-theoretic basis for vacuum thermal effects, our results suggest that analogous phenomena may arise in any quantum system admitting realizations of translation and dilation eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Bell nonlocality and entanglement in $\chi_{cJ}$ decays into baryon pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of Bell nonlocality and entanglement in $\chi_{cJ}$ decays into baryon pair ($B\bar{B}$) ($J=0,1,2$). From the baryon-antibaryon spin density matrix, we construct measurable Bell observables and concurrence, revealing a striking hierarchy of quantum correlations: $\chi_{c0}$ decays exhibit maximal violation and entanglement; $\chi_{c1}$ decays violate Bell inequalities for $\theta_1 \in (0, \pi)$ with angle-modulated strength; we find that $B\bar B$ in $\chi_{c2}$ decays is in separable state, and no indication is found for the Bell inequality violation.

      <title>Energy transport in the Schr\"odinger plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce "the Schr\"odinger plate." This is an infinite two-dimensional linear micro-polar elastic medium, with out-of-plane degrees of freedom, lying on a linear elastic foundation of a special kind. Any free motion of the plate can be corresponded to a solution of the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation for a single particle in the external potential field $V$. The specific dependence of the potential $V$ on the position is taken into account in the properties of the plate elastic foundation. The governing equations of the plate are derived as equations of the two-dimensional constraint Cosserat continuum using the direct approach. The plate dynamics can be described by the classical Germain-Lagrange equation for a plate, but the strain energy is different from the one used in the classical Kirchhoff-Love plate theory. Namely, the Schr\"odinger plate cannot be imagined as a thin elastic body composed of an isotropic linear material. The main property of the Schr\"odinger plate is as follows: the mechanical energy propagates in the plate exactly in the same way as the probability density propagates according to the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Effective Kinetic Monte Carlo for a Quantum Epidemic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by previous works on epidemic-like processes in open quantum systems, we derive an elementary quantum epidemic model that is simple enough to be studied via Quantum Jump Monte Carlo simulations at reasonably large system sizes. We show how some weak symmetries of the Lindblad equation allow us to map the dynamics onto a classical Kinetic Monte Carlo; this simplified, effective dynamics can be described via local stochastic jumps coupled with a local deterministic component. Simulations are then used to reconstruct a phase diagram which displays stationary features completely equivalent to those of completely classical epidemic processes, but richer dynamics with multiple, recurrent waves of infection.</description>

      <title>Generalised Entanglement Entropies from Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) with its right-, left-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which itself are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under (appropriate set of) diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behavior under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other representative settings, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.</description>

      <title>Efficient population transfer in a quantum dot exciton under phonon-induced decoherence via shortcuts to adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing. We use the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below $ 20 \ \text{K} $ and pulse duration up to $ 10 \ \text{ps} $, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.</description>

      <title>Localization-landscape generalized Mott-Berezinski\u{i} formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a conceptual reformulation of the Mott-Berezinski\u{i} (MB) theory of low-frequency AC conductivity in disordered systems based on localization landscape theory. Instead of assuming uniform localization and fixed hopping distances, transport is described through an effective potential whose geometry encodes the spatial organization and energy-dependent localization of quantum states. Using the associated Agmon metric, we define a generalized Mott scale that replaces the classical hopping length with a geometric criterion set by the disorder landscape. This framework naturally incorporates strong spatial inhomogeneity and yields the AC conductivity directly from the effective potential. The standard MB result is recovered as a limiting case. Our approach extends the conceptual foundation of MB theory to arbitrary disordered media and energies approaching the mobility edge, providing a unified description of AC transport in complex quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically-Induced Transparency Bridges Disconnected Light-Harvesting Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy-transfer efficiency of the natural photosynthesis system seems to be perfectly optimized during the evolution for millions of years. However, how to enhance the efficiency in the artificial light-harvesting systems is still unclear. In this paper, we investigate the energy-transfer process in the photosystem I (PSI). When there is no effective coupling between the outer antenna (OA) and the reaction center (RC), the two light-harvesting networks are disconnected and thus the energy transfer is inefficient. In order to repair these disconnected networks, we introduce a bridge with three sites between them. We find that by modulating the level structure of the 3-site bridge to be resonant, the energy transfer via the dark state will be enhanced and even outperform the original PSI. Our discoveries may shed light on the designing mechanism of artificial light-harvesting systems.</description>

      <title>Novel qubits in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable.</description>

      <title>Universal Entanglement Growth along Imaginary Time in Quantum Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing universal entanglement features in higher-dimensional quantum matter is a central goal of quantum information science and condensed matter physics. While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2405.04947, it was shown that the GNS spectral gap of a Gaussian quantum Markovian generator is strictly positive if and only if there exists a maximal number of linearly independent noise operators, under the assumption that the generated semigroup admits a unique faithful normal invariant state. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the KMS spectral gap, which also depends only on the noise operators of the generator. We further show that the existence of the GNS spectral gap implies the existence of the KMS spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Topological Pumping in Photonic Waveguides Based on Global Adiabatic Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic topological pumping promises robust transport of energy and information, but its speed is fundamentally limited by the instantaneous adiabatic condition, which demands prohibitively slow parameter variations. Here we develop a paradigm shift from instantaneous to global adiabaticity. We derive a global adiabatic criterion (GAC), which sets an absolute fidelity bound by controlling the root-mean-square value of nonadiabaticity factor. We further introduce a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion, which minimizes spatial inhomogeneity and allows us to safely increase the mean nonadiabaticity. Experimentally, we implement this principle in femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays via scalable power-law coupling modulation. Our accelerated topological pumping achieves &gt;0.95 fidelity over a fivefold reduced device length compared to the conventional scheme, exhibits the predicted linear scaling with the system size, and maintains robust performance across a &gt;400 nm bandwidth. This principle of GAC provides a universal design rule for fast, compact, and robust adiabatic devices across quantum and classical topological platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germanium hole spin qubits based on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well have attracted much research attention due to the strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the strain dependence of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing and thus the $g$-tensor anisotropy offer unique opportunities for acoustic driving and spin-phonon coupling. In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components. Our work lays the foundations for acoustic-driven spin control and spin-phonon coupling using Ge hole spin qubits.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism: Emergence of Alterferrimagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a proliferation in investigations on Altermagnetism due to its exciting prospects both from an applications perspective and theoretical standpoint. Traditionally, altermagnets are distinguished from collinear antiferromagnets using the central concept of halving subgroups within the spin space group formalism. In this work, we propose the Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism (FLAM) deriving the exact conditions required for the existence of altermagnetic phase in a magnetic material on the basis of site-symmetry groups and halving subgroups for a given crystallographic space group. The spin group formalism further clubs ferrimagnetism with ferromagnetism since the same-spin and opposite-spin sublattices lose their meaning in the presence of multiple magnetic species. As a consequence of FLAM, we further propose a class of fully compensated ferrimagnets, termed as Alterferrimagnets (AFiMs), which can show alternating momentum-dependent spin-polarized non-relativistic electronic bands within the first Brillouin zone. We show that alterferrimagnetism is a generalization of traditional collinear altermagnetism where multiple magnetic species are allowed to coexist forming fully compensated magnetic-sublattices, each with individual up-spin and down-spin sublattices.</description>

      <title>MultiAtomLiouvilleEquationGenerator: A Mathematica package for Liouville superoperators and master equations of multilevel atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MulAtoLEG (Multi-Atom Liouville Equation Generator) is an open-source Mathematica package for generating Liouville superoperators and Liouville equations, specialized for multilevel atomic systems comprising an arbitrary number of atoms. This scheme is based on an extension to multilevel atomic systems, originally developed by Lehmberg [R. H. Lehmberg, Phys. Rev. A 2, 883 (1970)] as an adjoint master equation for ensembles of two-level emitters and later reformulated by Genes [M. Reitz, C. Sommer and C. Genes, PRX Quantum 3, 010201 (2022)] as a master equation. The package facilitates the generation of equations for complex transition configurations in alkali atoms. Although primarily designed for atomic systems, it can also generate the master and adjoint master equations for general Hamiltonians and Lindbladians. In addition, it includes functionalities to construct the differential equations in the dressed-state basis, where, in many cases, the non-unitary evolution operator can be determined explicitly. To maximize computational efficiency, the package leverages Mathematica's vectorization and sparse linear algebra capabilities. Since MulAtoLEG produces exact equations without approximations, the feasible system size is naturally limited by the available computational resources.</description>

      <title>Ordering-Independent Wheeler-DeWitt Equation for Flat Minisuperspace Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider minisuperspace models with quadratic kinetic terms, assuming a flat target space and a closed Universe. We show that, upon canonical quantization of the Hamiltonian, only a restricted subset of operator orderings is consistent with the path-integral viewpoint. Remarkably, all consistent orderings are physically equivalent to all orders in $\hbar$. Specifically, each choice of path-integral measure in the definition of the wavefunction path integral uniquely determines an operator ordering and hence a corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The consistent orderings are in one-to-one correspondence with the Jacobians associated with all field redefinitions of a set of canonical degrees of freedom. For each admissible operator ordering--or equivalently, each path-integral measure--we identify a definite, positive Hilbert-space inner product. All such prescriptions define the same quantum theory, in the sense that they lead to identical physical observables. We illustrate our formalism by applying it to de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and to the Starobinsky model.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Interfaces Between Symmetry-Enriched Critical Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.</description>

      <title>Evolution towards quasi-equilibrium in nematic liquid crystals studied through decoherence of multi-spin multiple-quantum coherences</title>

      <description>arXiv:1505.01558v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New evidence is presented in favor of irreversible decoherence as the mechanism which leads an initial out-of-equilibrium state to quasi-equilibrium in nematic liquid crystals. The NMR experiment combines the Jeener-Broekaert sequence with reversal of the dipolar evolution and decoding of multiple-quantum coherences to allow visualizing the evolution of the multi-spin coherence spectra during the formation of the quasi-equilibrium states. We vary the reversion strategies and the preparation of initial states and observe that the spectra amplitude attenuate with the reversion time, and notably, that the decay is frequency selective. We interpret this effect as evidence of "eigen-selection", a signature of the occurrence of irreversible adiabatic decoherence, which indicates that the spin system in liquid crystal NMR experiments conforms an actual open quantum system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermi's golden rule (FGR) serves as the basis for many expressions of spectroscopic observables and quantum transition rates. The utility of FGR has been demonstrated through decades of experimental confirmation. However, there still remain important cases where the evaluation of a FGR rate is ambiguous or ill-defined. Examples are cases where the rate has divergent terms due to the sparsity in the density of final states or time dependent fluctuations of system Hamiltonians. Strictly speaking, assumptions of FGR are no longer valid for such cases. However, it is still possible to define modified FGR rate expressions that are useful as effective rates. The resulting modified FGR rate expressions resolve a long standing ambiguity often encountered in using FGR and offer more reliable ways to model general rate processes. Simple model calculations illustrate the utility and implications of new rate expressions.</description>

      <title>Connecting classical finite exchangeability to quantum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exchangeability is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It allows to model situations where the order of observations does not matter. The classical de Finetti's theorem provides a representation of infinitely exchangeable sequences of random variables as mixtures of independent and identically distributed variables. The quantum de Finetti theorem extends this result to symmetric quantum states on tensor product Hilbert spaces. It is well known that both theorems do not hold for finitely exchangeable sequences. The aim of this work is to investigate two lesser-known representation theorems, which were developed in classical probability theory to extend de Finetti's theorem to finitely exchangeable sequences by using quasi-probabilities and quasi-expectations. With the aid of these theorems, we illustrate how a de Finetti-like representation theorem for finitely exchangeable sequences can be formulated through a mathematical representation which is formally equivalent to quantum theory (with boson-symmetric density matrices). We then show a promising application of this connection to the challenge of defining entanglement for indistinguishable bosons.</description>

      <title>Error and Disturbance as Irreversibility with Applications: Unified Definition, Wigner--Araki--Yanase Theorem and Out-of-Time-Order Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defining an error of measurement has long been a foundational problem in science: even in classical experiments, data are statistical and admit no single universally optimal definition of error. In quantum mechanics, the challenge deepens: observed entities often lack preexisting definite values, and the act of measurement unavoidably disturbs the system of interest. Consequently, both error and disturbance must be quantified, and various definitions have been proposed to date. However, a unified perspective for understanding the differences and similarities among these diverse definitions of error and disturbance, and an operational framework for distinguishing between them, remain elusive. In this Letter, we propose a novel framework for defining error and disturbance using irreversibility. Our framework converts the error and disturbance of a quantum measurement of a system under consideration into the irreversibility of an ancillary qubit system, using a quantum comb composed of loss and recovery processes. The mechanism enables us to make the operational distinction that error uses the classical outputs, while disturbance uses the quantum outputs of the measurement in the recovery process. Furthermore, our framework yields several key consequences: (i) it encompasses existing definitions, (ii) it establishes a universal constraint on error and disturbance defined by any measure of an arbitrary quantum process under a conservation law, and (iii) it reveals an operational connection between irreversibility and the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a metric of quantum chaos. It also provides a constraint on the OTOC under a conservation law and a method for its experimental evaluation, which is demonstrated on a quantum processor.</description>

      <title>The i.i.d. State Convertibility in the Resource Theory of Asymmetry for Finite Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify exact and approximate conversion rates between i.i.d. pure states under covariant operations in the resource theory of asymmetry for symmetries described by finite groups. We establish the formula for the exact conversion rate by completely specifying the relevant set of resource measures. The exact conversion is generally asymptotically irreversible due to the existence of multiple independent resource measures, and we find the necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic reversibility. On the other hand, we show that the approximate conversion rates diverge or vanish, which implies that the asymmetry can be infinitely amplified if we allow a vanishingly small error. We reveal the underlying mechanism of such a counterintuitive phenomenon by utilizing the properties of maximally asymmetric states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulators based on trapped ions enable the study of spin systems and models with rich dynamical phenomena. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model for fermions in one dimension is a canonical example that can support a topological insulator phase when couplings between sites are dimerized, featuring long-lived edge states. Here, we experimentally implement a spin-based variant of the SSH model using one-dimensional trapped-ion chains with tunable interaction range, realized in crystals containing up to 22 interacting spins. Using an array of individually focused laser beams, we apply site-specific, time-dependent Floquet fields to induce controlled bond dimerization. Under conditions that preserve inversion symmetry, we observe edge-state dynamics consistent with SSH-like behavior. We study the propagation and localization of spin excitations, as well as the evolution of highly excited configurations across different interaction regimes. These results demonstrate how precision Floquet engineering enables the exploration of complex spin models and dynamics, laying the groundwork for future preparation and characterization of topological and exotic phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of preparing perfect Bell pairs with a practical scheme is of great relevance for quantum communication as well as distributed quantum computing. We propose a scheme which probabilistically, but unambiguously produces the $\left|\Phi_{+}\right&gt;$ Bell pair from four copies of qubit pairs initially in the same arbitrary pure quantum state. The same scheme, extended to eight qubit pairs initially in the same, moderately mixed quantum state, unambiguously produces the $\left|\Phi_{+}\right&gt;$ Bell pair with quadratically suppressed noise. The core step of the proposed scheme consists of a pair of local two-qubit operations applied at each of the two distant locations, followed by a partial projective measurement and postselection at each party, with results communicated classically. While the scheme resembles standard entanglement distillation protocols, it achieves success within just three iterations, making it attractive for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A simple fourth order propagator based on the Magnus expansion in the Liouville space: Application to a $\Lambda$-system and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Hybrid Algorithm for Solving the Learning-With-Errors Problem on NISQ Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem is a fundamental computational challenge with implications for post-quantum cryptography and computational learning theory. Here we propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm with Ising model to address LWE, transforming it into the Shortest Vector Problem and using variable qubits to encode lattice vectors into an Ising Hamiltonian. By identifying low-energy Hamiltonian levels, the solution is extracted, making the method suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. The required number of qubits is less than $m(m+1)$, where $m$ is the number of samples. Our heuristic algorithm's time complexity depends on the specific quantum eigensolver used to find low-energy levels, and the performance when using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm is investigated. We validate the algorithm by solving a $2$-dimensional LWE problem on a $5$-qubit quantum device, demonstrating its potential for solving meaningful LWE instances on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13163v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. Numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.</description>

Abstract: High precision measurements are essential to solve major scientific and technological challenges, from gravitational wave detection to healthcare diagnostics. Quantum sensing delivers greater precision, but an in-depth optimisation of measurement procedures has been overlooked. Here we present a systematic strategy for parameter estimation in the low-data limit that integrates experimental control parameters and natural symmetries. The method is guided by a Bayesian quantifier of precision gain, enabling adaptive optimisation tailored to the experiment. We provide general expressions for optimal estimators for any parameter. The strategy's power is demonstrated in a quantum technology experiment, in which ultracold caesium atoms are confined in a micromachined hole in an optical fibre. We find a five-fold reduction in the fractional variance of the estimated parameter, compared to the standard measurement procedure. Equivalently, our strategy achieves a target precision with a third of the data points previously required. Such enhanced device performance and accelerated data collection will be essential for applications in quantum computing, communication, metrology, and the wider quantum technology sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical shadow estimation (CSE) is a powerful tool for learning the properties of quantum states and quantum processes. Here we consider the CSE task for quantum unitary channels. By querying an unknown unitary channel $\mathcal{U}$ multiple times in quantum experiments, the goal is to learn a classical description from which one can accurately predict many different linear properties of the channel, i.e., the expectation values of arbitrary observables measured on the output of $\mathcal{U}$ upon arbitrary input states. Based on collective measurements on multiple systems, we propose a query efficient protocol for this task, whose query complexity has a quadratic advantage over the previous best approach for this problem, and almost saturates the information-theoretic lower bound. To further enhance practicality, we also present a variant protocol using only single-copy measurements, which still offers much better query performance than previous protocols that do not use quantum memory, and can serve as a key subroutine for learning an arbitrary unknown Hamiltonian from dynamics. In addition to linear properties of unitary channels, our protocol can also be applied to simultaneously predict many non-linear properties, such as out-of-time-ordered correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take initial steps towards a general framework for constructing logical gates in general quantum CSS codes. Viewing CSS codes as cochain complexes, we observe that cohomology invariants naturally give rise to diagonal logical gates. We show that such invariants exist if the quantum code has a structure that relaxes certain properties of a differential graded algebra. We show how to equip quantum codes with such a structure by defining cup products on CSS codes. The logical gates obtained from this approach can be implemented by a constant-depth unitary circuit. In particular, we construct a $\Lambda$-fold cup product that can produce a logical operator in the $\Lambda$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy on $\Lambda$ copies of the same quantum code, which we call the copy-cup gate. For any desired $\Lambda$, we can construct several families of quantum codes that support gates in the $\Lambda$-th level with various asymptotic code parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15515v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the interplay of disorder and time-homogeneous collisional noise in shaping the transport dynamics of an anisotropic XXZ spin chain. Using stochastic collision models to simulate interaction with the environment, we explore the localization-delocalization transitions across regimes with single and multiple excitations. We find that space-homogeneous and low-rate collisions can shape regions where localization sets in the form of subsequent plateaus. The localization process has universal features for the plateaus duration and the delocalization time. Interactions among the excitations favor this process even for tiniest disorder levels.
  Our findings can be applied to design stroboscopic protocols where sequences of transport and localization can be tailored. We establish relevant connections to noise-engineering of quantum devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulators platforms, and to realistic biological systems where noise and disorder coexist.</description>

      <title>Memory preservation and cooperative shielding in complex quantum networks</title>

Abstract: Complex quantum networks are powerful tools in the modeling of transport phenomena, particularly for biological systems, and enable the study of emergent phenomena in many-body quantum systems. High connectivity and long-range interactions induce strong constraints on the system dynamics. Here, we study the transport properties of a quantum network described by the paradigmatic XXZ Hamiltonian, with non-trivial graph connectivity and topology, and long-range interactions. We show how long-range interactions induce memory preserving effects and strongly affect the spreading of the excitations due to cooperative shielding. We describe the memory-preserving effect in all-to-all connected regular networks with distance-independent couplings. Indeed, the memory of the number of initially injected excitations is preserved over long times, encoded in the number of frequencies present in the dynamics. Interestingly, we find that memory-preserving effects occur also in less regular graphs, such as quantum networks with either power-law node connectivity or complex, small-world type, architectures. We discuss the implications of these properties in biology-related problems, such as an application to Weber's law in neuroscience, and their implementation in specific quantum technologies via biomimicry. We also show how the presence of long-range interaction strongly affects the dynamics of the excitations in small-world networks and power law all-to-all coupled networks. Indeed, because of cooperative shielding blue, as the connectivity or the range of interaction increases, the initial excitation spreads more slowly among the network and becomes strongly dependent on the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>TEPID-ADAPT: Adaptive variational method for simultaneous preparation of low-temperature Gibbs and low-lying eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing Gibbs states, which describe systems in equilibrium at finite temperature, is of great importance, particularly at low temperatures. In this work, we propose a new method -- TEPID-ADAPT -- that prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a given Hamiltonian at low temperatures using a variational method that is partially adaptive and uses a purification with a minimal number of ancillary qubits. We also present an alternative implementation without ancillary qubits. A key technical innovation here is to use a mixed-state ansatz where the entropy can be efficiently calculated, with no computational overhead. Our algorithm uses a truncated, parametrized eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian. Beyond preparing Gibbs states, this approach also straightforwardly gives us access to the truncated low-energy eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian, making it also a method that prepares excited states simultaneously. As a result of this, we are also able to prepare thermal states at any lower temperature of the same Hamiltonian without further optimization.</description>

      <title>Quantum conditional mutual information as a probe of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Learning to erase quantum states: thermodynamic implications of quantum learning theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling provably-efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Efficient Extraction of Entangled Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Quantum Internet, multipartite entanglement enables a rich and dynamic overlay topology, referred to as artificial topology, upon the physical one, that can be exploited for communication purposes. In fact, the ability to extract $n$-qubits GHZ states and EPR pairs from the original multipartite entangled state constitutes the resource primitives for end-to-end and on-demand quantum communications. Thus, in this paper, we theoretically determine upper and lower bounds for the number of extractable $n$-qubits GHZ states and EPR pairs involving nodes remote in the artificial topology, as well as the achievable size $n$ of remote GHZ states. The theoretical analysis is then complemented by the proposal of a novel algorithm, which provides in polynomial-time a heuristic solution to the above problem. This is remarkable, since the theoretical problem is NP-complete. The performance analysis demonstrates the proposed algorithm is able to effectively manipulate the original and arbitrary graph state for extracting entanglement resources across remote nodes.</description>

      <title>Computing n-time correlation functions without ancilla qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $n$-time correlation function is pivotal for establishing connections between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of a quantum system. Conventional methods for computing $n$-time correlation functions on quantum computers, such as the Hadamard test, generally require an ancilla qubit that controls the entire system -- an approach that poses challenges for digital quantum devices with limited qubit connectivity, as well as for analog quantum platforms lacking controlled operations. Here, we introduce a method to compute $n$-time correlation functions using only unitary evolutions on the system of interest, thereby eliminating the need for ancillas and the control operations. This approach substantially relaxes hardware connectivity requirements for digital processors and enables more practical measurements of $n$-time correlation functions on analog platforms. We demonstrate our protocol on IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure the single-particle spectrum of the Schwinger model and the out-of-time-order correlator in the transverse-field Ising model. In the demonstration, we further introduce an error mitigation procedure based on signal processing that integrates signal filtering and correlation analysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the noisy hardware. Our work highlights a route to exploring complex quantum many-body correlation functions in practice, even in the presence of realistic hardware limitations and noise.</description>

      <title>Mixed state deep thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement, captured by the Schmidt number, underpins advantages in quantum information tasks, yet a unified resource-theoretic description across different Buscemi-type operational objects has been missing. Here we develop a convex framework that treats bipartite states, distributed measurements, and teleportation instruments generated from shared entanglement on equal footing. For a fixed Schmidt-number threshold k, we introduce robustness-based monotones for each class of objects and prove a quantitative collapse: the Schmidt-number robustness of a bipartite state coincides with the maximal robustness achievable by any distributed measurement or teleportation instrument derived from that state. Consequently, within Buscemi-type operational frameworks, these objects do not carry independent high-dimensional resources but are governed by a single robustness-based monotone. We further provide a direct operational interpretation by relating this unique quantifier to the optimal advantage in entanglement-assisted state discrimination games. Our results complete a unified resource-theoretic characterization of high-dimensional entanglement across states, measurements, and quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Telecom wavelength quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a promising solution for generating deterministic single photons compatible with existing fiber optic infrastructure. Emission in the low loss C band minimizes transmission losses, making them ideal for long distance quantum communication. In this work, we present a demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in an InP based n++-i-n+ heterostructure fabricated using MOVPE. The gated architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic states. Electrical tuning of the fine structure splitting is further demonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths. The single photon character is confirmed via second order correlation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance with other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step toward scalable, fiber compatible quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Tight Success Probabilities for Quantum Period Finding and Phase Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Period finding and phase estimation are fundamental in quantum computing. Prior work has established lower bounds on their success probabilities. Such quantum algorithms measure a state $|\hat\ell\rangle$ in an $n$-qubit computational basis, $\hat\ell \in [0, 2^n - 1]$, and then post-process this measurement to produce the final output, in the case of period finding, a divisor of the period $r$. We consider a general post-processing algorithm which succeeds whenever the measured $\hat\ell$ is within some tolerance $M$ of a positive integer multiple of $2^n / r$. We give new (tight) lower and upper bounds on the success probability that converge to 1. The parameter $n$ captures the complexity of the quantum circuit. The parameter $M$ can be tuned by varying the post-processing algorithm (e.g., additional brute-force search, lattice methods). Our tight analysis allows for the careful exploitation of the tradeoffs between the complexity of the quantum circuit and the effort spent in classical processing when optimizing the probability of success. We note that the most recent prior work in most recent work does not give tight bounds for general $M$.</description>

Abstract: Sensing of parameters is an important aspect in all disciplines, with applications ranging from fundamental science to medicine. Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modeled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</description>

Abstract: Quantum capacity quantifies the amount of quantum information that can be transmitted by a quantum channel with an arbitrary small probability of error. Mathematically, the quantum capacity is given by an asymptotic formula involving the one-shot quantum capacity of the associated channel, which, due to purely quantum effects such as superadditivity of one-shot quantum capacity, is rarely computable. The one-shot quantum capacity is mathematically characterized in terms of optimizing an entropic quantity referred to as coherent information over all possible input states of a channel, the computation of which also tends to be intractable due to the difficulty of optimizing the coherent information. In this work, we develop perturbative methods for analyzing the behavior of coherent information of a quantum channel with respect to small perturbations of the input state. By doing so, we are able to derive three general criteria for determining whether an input state yields suboptimal coherent information. We then show how our criteria yield sufficient conditions for superadditivity of one-shot quantum capacity, and also for detecting a positive gap between one-shot private capacity and one-shot quantum capacity. The utility of our criteria is illustrated through examples, which yield new results regarding the one-shot quantum capacity of qubit depolarizing channels, Pauli channels and dephrasure channels.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic entanglement between localized domain walls inside a cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scheme for generating stable and tunable entanglement between two localized Bloch domain walls in nanomagnetic strips kept inside a chiral optical cavity. The entanglement is mediated by the effective optomechanical interaction between the cavity photons and the two macroscopic, collective modes of the pinned domain walls. By controlling the pinning potential and optical driving frequency, the robust, steady-state entanglement between the two macroscopic domain walls can survive beyond the typical milli-Kelvin temperature range.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg spin networks for realizing quantum battery with the aid of Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction</title>

Abstract: This work investigates the energy storage properties of quantum spin chains in the context of quantum batteries by introducing Heisenberg spin network models organized into different configurations, open, closed, supercube geometries, and c regular graphs. The charging dynamics of these systems are examined using Hamiltonians that include contributions from the battery, spin spin interactions, and a transverse magnetic field. Incorporating the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction into the charging Hamiltonian is found to enhance the ergotropy in the XXZ model, particularly for the supercube configuration, thereby improving quantum battery performance. To explore the role of structural variations, we extend our study to c regular graphs with system sizes ranging from 3 to 12 qubits, including highly symmetric geometries such as the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron. These analyzes reveal that such symmetric structures retain ideal sinusoidal charging discharging behavior when DMI is tuned appropriately, establishing symmetry and coordination as key principles for scalable quantum battery architectures.</description>

      <title>Distribution of non-Gaussian states in a deployed telecommunication fiber channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical non-Gaussian states hold great promise as a pivotal resource for advanced optical quantum information processing and fault-tolerant long-distance quantum communication. Establishing their faithful transmission in a real-world communication channel, therefore, marks an important milestone. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of such non-Gaussian states in a functioning telecommunication channel that connects separate buildings within the DTU campus premises. We send photon-subtracted squeezed states, exhibiting pronounced Wigner negativity, through 300 m of deployed optical fibers to a distant building. Using quantum homodyne tomography, we fully characterize the states upon arrival. Our results show the survival of the Wigner function negativity after transmission when correcting for detection losses, indicating that the established link can potentially facilitate the violation of Bell's inequality and enable quantum steering. This achievement not only validates the practical feasibility of distributing non-Gaussian states in real-world settings, but also provides an exciting impetus towards realizing fully coherent quantum networks for high-dimensional, continuous-variable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Structure-Fair Quantum Circuit Complexity: An Auditable Information-Theoretic Lower Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structure, such as symmetry or encoding, in a fair manner constitutes a core challenge in the benchmarking of quantum technologies. This paper introduces the Reference-Contingent Complexity (RCC), an information-theoretic measure calibrated by the available quantum operations. The core idea is to leverage the quantum relative entropy to quantify the deviation of a quantum state from its "structured vacuum"-namely, the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace-thereby only pricing the process of creating non-trivial information. Our central result is a key theorem that rigorously proves the RCC serves as a lower bound for the complexity of any universal quantum circuit. This lower bound is comprised of a linear dominant term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction term that accounts for non-uniformity in the spectral distribution. Crucially, we establish a set of operational protocols, grounded in tasks like quantum hypothesis testing, which make this theoretical lower bound experimentally "auditable." This work provides a "ruler" for quantum technology that is structure-fair and enables cross-platform comparison, thereby establishing a strictly verifiable constraint between the computational cost of the process and the structured information of the final state.</description>

      <title>Measurement-only circuit of perturbed toric code on triangular lattice: Topological entanglement, 1-form symmetry and logical qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-only (quantum) circuit (MoC) gives possibility to realize the states with rich entanglements, topological orders and quantum memories. This work studies the MoC, in which the projective-measurement operators consist of stabilizers of the toric code and competitive local Pauli operators. The former correspond to terms of the toric code on a triangular lattice and the later to external magnetic and electric fields. We employ efficient numerical stabilizer algorithm to trace evolving states undergoing phase transitions. We elucidate the phase diagram of the MoC system with the observables such as, topological entanglement entropy (TEE), disorder parameters of 1-form symmetries and emergent logical operators. We clarify the locations of the phase transitions through the observation of the above quantities and obtain precise critical exponents to examine if the observables exhibit the critical behavior simultaneously under the MoC and transitions belong to the same universality class. In contrast to the TC Hamiltonian system and toric code MoC on a square lattice, the system on the triangular lattice is not self-dual nor bipartite, and then, coincidence by symmetries, such as critical behaviors across the TC and Higgs/confined phase, does not takes place. Then, the toric code MoC on the triangular lattice provides us a suitable playground to clarify the mutual relationship between the TEE, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the 1-form symmetries, and emergence of logical operators. Obtained results indicate that toric code MoC on the triangular lattice exhibits a few distinct phase transitions with different location and critical exponents, and some of them are closely related with the two-dimensional percolation transition.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement-based quantum links are the backbone of future quantum internet networks, enabling secure communication between distant cities. Realizing such networks requires addressing multiple practical challenges in long-distance quantum key distribution : time synchronisation, interferometer stabilisation and automation. Here, we report several advances. First, we maintained an operational QKD link continuously for 325hours over 50km between two remotes locations, demonstrating the feasibility of long-duration key generation. We further extended secure key distribution up to a 100km operational link connecting the University of Nice to a ground-based optical station, a setup compatible with future quantum satellite connections. Finally, by employing wavelength demultiplexing to separate photons of entangled pairs, we performed QKD across multiple ITU channels, achieving secure key exchange via the BBM92 protocol and time-energy observables.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation with Resolution Refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time that scales with the inverse of the energy gap times the square root of the system size. We show that this very favorable scaling arises from the fact that resolution refinement does not make large changes to the structure or energies of the low-energy eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Programmable generation of arbitrary continuous-variable anharmonicities and nonlinear couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harmonic oscillators are promising continuous-variable (CV) quantum resources because their infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces allow for resource-efficient quantum computing and simulation. To reach their full potential, CV platforms need to be able to efficiently implement non-Gaussian operations. However, schemes for generating arbitrary non-Gaussian operations are restricted to single modes, i.e., the implementation of anharmonic potentials. Here, we introduce a method for implementing arbitrary non-Gaussian operations applicable to both single- and multi-mode systems, allowing the generation of both anharmonicities and nonlinear multi-mode couplings. Our method synthesizes a target Hamiltonian by decomposing it into a Fourier series whose terms are implemented via bosonic quantum signal processing, which uses a discrete-variable (DV) system to induce a nonlinearity in the CV system. Our hybrid CV-DV protocol allows for the direct simulation of a broad range of CV phenomena (such as those in lattice gauge theory, chemical dynamics, and quantum chaos) and provides a richer toolbox for CV circuit compilation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Device Constraints: A System-Level Theoretical Framework for High-Performance Single-Photon Detection at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01328v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon detection, a fundamental quantum technology, is traditionally treated as a fixed device-level operation governed by intrinsic properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). High-performance detection has therefore largely relied on superconducting technologies whose requirement for cryogenic operation imposes substantial infrastructure constraints, limiting scalable deployments. Here, the enhanced single-photon detection (ESPD) framework is presented as a system-level theoretical paradigm that shifts photon detection from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing task, by reformulating it as an iteratively enhanced process integrating state-preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy analysis. ESPD enables systematic performance enhancement through architectural design rather than material modification, thereby circumventing superconducting components, allowing high-performance detection using exclusively room-temperature hardware. Numerical simulations grounded in physically motivated parameters indicate that the ESPD framework can upgrade a conventional room-temperature SPD to effective DE exceeding 93\% and DCR below $10^{-9}$, which are comparable to state-of-the-art superconducting SPDs and can significantly relax the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate in quantum communications. While physical realization would require further component integration, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework for enhancing detection performance through architectural quantum-information principles, providing a general blueprint for transcending device-level constraints and guiding the development of next-generation room-temperature quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks is a novel multilayer neuromorphic network that can exhibit higher accuracy than a neural network. It can learn and predict more accurately than neural networks with a smaller number of parameters, and many research groups worldwide have adopted it. As a result, many types of applications have been proposed. This network can be used as a generator solely or with a Generative Adversarial Network; however, KAN has a slower speed of learning than neural networks for the number of parameters. Hence,it has not been researched as a generator. Therefore, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network called Generative Adversarial Variational Quantum KAN that uses Variational Quantum KAN as a generator. This method enables efficient learning with significantly fewer parameters by leveraging the computational advantages of quantum circuits and their output distributions. We performed the training and generation task on MNIST and CIFAR10, and revealed that our method can achieve higher accuracy than neural networks and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network with less data.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Random Access Memory: A Data-Independent Unitary Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a construction for Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) that achieves a single, data-independent unitary operator. Unlike routing-based approaches or circuit methods that yield data-dependent unitaries, our Universal QRAM encodes data in memory qubits that act as quantum control signals within a block-diagonal permutation structure. The key insight is that memory qubits serve as control signals, enabling coherent lookup when addresses are in superposition. For N addresses with K-bit data words, the construction requires $\log_2 N + K + NK$ qubits and decomposes into exactly $NK$ multi-controlled gates. We verify the construction for $N \in \{2, 4, 8, 16\}$ and $K \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, confirming that the resulting unitary is a pure permutation matrix with zero error across all data configurations. This approach simplifies QRAM implementation by separating fixed circuit structure from variable data encoding.</description>

      <title>The energy-speed relationship of quantum particles challenges Bohmian mechanics?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Sharoglazova et al. claimed to have proven a violation of the basic tenet of Bohmian mechanics, namely the phase-speed relation $\vec{v}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\vec{\nabla}S(\vec{r},t)$. Here, $S(\vec{r},t)$ is the (real) phase of the wave function $\psi(\vec{r},t)=\rho^{\frac{1}{2}}(\vec{r},t)e^{iS(\vec{r},t)}$. In a nutshell, they have measured the speed of a claimed evanescent wave, which is real and therefore must have $\vec{\nabla}S=\vec{0}$. However, Fig. 2 clearly shows a density motion from one waveguide to the other, implying a nonzero density current, $\vec{j}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\Im(\psi^*\vec{\nabla}\psi)$. If we combine this evidence with the mathematical identity $\vec{\nabla}S=\frac{m}{\rho}\vec{j}$, we should instead conclude that $\vec{\nabla}S\neq\vec{0}$. So, where does this apparent inconsistency come from?</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum decoherence refers to the phenomenon when the interaction of a quantum system with its environment results in the degradation of quantum coherence. Decoherence is considered to be the most popular mechanism responsible for the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics. The issue of formulating a measure of decoherence is addressed here. The approach taken here is that decoherence results from the entanglement of a quantum system with certain environment degrees of freedom, and quantifying this entanglement should yield the most natural measure of decoherence. A simple measure of decoherence is presented based on this notion, and it is examined for various example systems. The measure proves to be effective and is relatively straightforward to compute. In addition, a method has been proposed to measure decoherence in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.</description>

Abstract: We study finite two-dimensional disordered systems with periodic confinement. At low energies, eigenstates exhibit strong Anderson localization, while at higher energies a subset of states forms variational scars with anisotropic intensity patterns that violate random wave expectations. Scaling theory predicts that all states localize in two dimensions, yet energy-dependent localization lengths and finite system size allow these regimes to coexist. We demonstrate that this coexistence produces distinct, robust signatures in both spatial intensity patterns and spectral statistics that are directly observable in mesoscopic electronic, photonic, and cold atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article traces the development of fluctuation theory and its deep connection to irreversibility, from equilibrium to near-equilibrium, and finally to far-from-equilibrium systems. Classical fluctuation theorems, which capture the statistical behaviour of thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium, are now well established. Their quantum counterparts, however, remain an active area of research. In this review, we highlight recent advances by linking quantum fluctuation theorems with linear response theory, offering new insights into the nature of quantum fluctuations and irreversibility in the near-equilibrium regime. Particular emphasis is placed on dissipated work in quantum systems as a pathway to observing non-classical effects in quantum thermodynamics. Understanding quantum fluctuations is not only essential for clarifying the foundations of irreversibility but also crucial for the development of novel quantum technologies, including quantum computers, sensors, and metrological devices.</description>

Abstract: Contraction analysis establishes exponential incremental convergence of a nonlinear system by solving a linear matrix inequality for a contraction metric, and has become a standard resource for solving problems in nonlinear control and estimation. This paper shows that, for a general nonlinear time-varying system, a contraction metric can be systematically derived by rewriting the system dynamics as a complex natural gradient dynamics. In this form, the variational dynamics can be modally decomposed with geodesic coordinates, and exact exponential convergence rates can be computed. The results are extended to systems with nonlinear inequality constraints. All derivations are tensor-based, and the computed eigenvalues themselves are coordinate-invariant, i.e., the contraction rates are independent of the chosen coordinate system.
  Simple examples including a gravity pendulum, gradient descent with non-convex cost, Schuler dynamics, and a two-link manipulator, illustrate that the computation of the decomposed convergence rates is straightforward. The role of inequality constraints is illustrated for a controller confined to an operational envelope.</description>

      <title>Sequential learning on a Tensor Network Born machine with Trainable Token Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models aim to learn the probability distributions underlying data, enabling the generation of new, realistic samples. Quantum inspired generative models, such as Born machines based on the matrix product state framework, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in unsupervised learning tasks. This study advances the Born machine paradigm by introducing trainable token embeddings through positive operator valued measurements, replacing the traditional approach of static tensor indices. Key technical innovations include encoding tokens as quantum measurement operators with trainable parameters and leveraging QR decomposition to adjust the physical dimensions of the MPS. This approach maximizes the utilization of operator space and enhances the model's expressiveness. Empirical results on RNA data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces negative log likelihood compared to one hot embeddings, with higher physical dimensions further enhancing single site probabilities and multi site correlations. The model also outperforms GPT2 in single site estimation and achieves competitive correlation modeling, showcasing the potential of trainable POVM embeddings for complex data correlations in quantum inspired sequence modeling.</description>

      <title>Tensor network approximation of Koopman operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a tensor network framework for approximating the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic systems. Our approach is based on a spectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a diagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_\tau$ that acts on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal H_\tau$ with coalgebra structure and Banach algebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this structure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_\tau}$ (which can be thought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on the Fock space $F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by $\mathcal H_\tau$ that acts multiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a representation of classical observables ($L^\infty$ functions of the state) by quantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a representation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining these constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of observables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built on a tensor product subspace $\mathcal H_\tau^{\otimes n} \subset F(\mathcal H_\tau)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \in \mathbb N$. A key feature of this quantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor product space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$ eigenfunctions of $W_\tau$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity preserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method and numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic torus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff flow as an example with topological weak mixing.</description>

      <title>Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06796v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</description>

      <title>Exciton pairs coupled via the long-living phonons and their superfluorescent markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system of several Wannier-Mott excitons interacting with phonons in a bulk material is considered. We show that strong exciton-phonon coupling causes the formation of a coherent two-exciton state -- the exciton pair. Unlike the biexcitons, where the photons play the role of force carrier, the exciton pair is formed via entanglement with the long-living phonon mode: (i) The essentially multi-particle theory requires excitons (cobosons composed of an electron and a hole) to satisfy the mixed Bose-Fermi statistics; (ii) This allows us to formulate a system of non-linear dynamic equations, using the multiconfiguration Hartree method applied to the Frohlich Hamiltonian. The system of equations possesses a stationary solution, which, for the case of a single exciton, describes the excitonic polaron and corresponds to the exciton pair in the two-exciton case. We also compare the fluorescent spectra of exciton polarons and exciton pairs estimated from our theory with those observed in experiments on room-temperature superfluorescence (collective emission of fluorescent light) in hybrid perovskites to give an additional insight into the superfluorescence phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Generalized $\eta$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena. This work provides a new and rigorous theoretical framework for studying novel physical phenomena (e.g., the skin effect) in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in arbitrary spatial dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Stable homotopy theory of invertible gapped quantum spin systems I: Kitaev's $\Omega$-spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical realization of a conjecture by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--L\"{u}ck assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</description>

Abstract: This document explores the potential of quantum computing in Thermal Science. Conceived as a living document, it will be continuously updated with experimental findings and insights for the research community in Thermal Science. By experiments, we refer both to the search for the most effective algorithms and to the performance of real quantum hardware. Those are fields that are evolving rapidly, driving a technological race to define the best architectures. The development of novel algorithms for engineering problems aims at harnessing the unique strengths of quantum computing. Expectations are high, as users seek concrete evidence of quantum supremacy - a true game changer for engineering applications. Among all heat transfer mechanisms (conduction, convection, radiation), we start with conduction as a paradigmatic test case in the field being characterized by a rich mathematical foundation for our investigations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic compatibility, holographic property and wave-function representation of generalized weakly nonlocal self-gravitating non-relativistic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A thermodynamic analysis of weakly nonlocal non-relativistic fluids is presented under the assumption that an additional scalar field also contributes to the dynamics. The most general evolution of this field and the constitutive relations for the pressure tensor and energy current density are determined by the Liu procedure. Classical holography of perfect (\ie non-dissipative) fluids is generally proven, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. A consequence of holographic property is vorticity conservation, which opens the way toward wave-function representation of hydrodynamic equations to obtain the Schr\"odinger equation. Another special case of the derived fluid model is Newtonian gravity, when the internal variable is the gravitational potential itself. Coupled phenomena, such as the Schr\"odinger--Newton system, are also discussed. The presented thermodynamic framework can shed light on some connections between formulations of classical and quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07510v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, can be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, together with anomalies in ensemble averages, which may then be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a gauge-theoretical framework to investigate the quanta of surface plasmons. Our formulation, based on quantum electrodynamics, highlights the importance of residual gauge symmetry. We emphasize that residual gauge symmetry, which imposes constraint equations on physical states, is fundamentally linked to Joule heating. This framework is applied to metals, semiconductors, and quantum Hall states, suggesting the presence of a latent transverse electric mode and that the quanta have the ability to maintain light-matter entanglement.</description>

      <title>Unified Effective Field Theory for Nonlinear and Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield good agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Separation Logic (QSL) has been proposed as an effective tool to improve the scalability of deductive reasoning for quantum programs. In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</description>

      <title>The Entropic Skin: Spatial Entanglement from the QCD Confinement Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations into High-Energy QCD have identified entanglement entropy as a crucial observable, linking parton distributions to the structure of the quantum vacuum. While momentum-space entanglement has been extensively studied in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), the spatial realization of this entanglement in confined systems remains an open question. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the confining boundary of the MIT Bag Model acts as an ``Entropic Skin,'' generating maximal Spin-Position entanglement. We calculate the local reduced density matrix for the confined quark and show that the linear boundary condition, $i \gamma^\mu n_\mu \psi = \psi$, acts as an entangling gate. The surface entropy density reaches a geometric invariant of $\approx 0.918$ bits ($92\%$ of the qubit limit), independent of the bag radius. We discuss the implications of this result for Chiral Symmetry breaking and propose that this boundary entropy is the precursor to the pion cloud in effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Correlation and Synchronisation-Enhanced Energy Transfer in Driven-Dissipative Light-Harvesting Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum synchronisation has recently been proposed as a mechanism for electronic excitation energy transfer in light-harvesting complexes, yet its robustness in driven-dissipative settings remains under active investigation. Here, we revisit this mechanism in cryptophyte photosynthetic antennae using an exciton--vibrational dimer model. By comparing the full open quantum dynamics with semi-classical rate equations for electronic density-matrix elements and vibrational observables, we demonstrate that quantum correlations between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, beyond the semi-classical factorised limit, underpin the emergence of quantum synchronisation. Furthermore, we introduce an environment-assisted transfer mechanism arising as a nonlinear, non-Condon correction to the dipole--dipole interaction. This mechanism enables long-lived quantum coherence and continuous, synchronisation-enhanced energy transfer in a driven-dissipative regime, thereby suggesting new avenues for investigating photosynthetic energy-transfer dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Here, we elaborate on and develop the geometrical approach introduced in K. Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions. We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. it remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light. We develop the formalism for coupled-planes materials including the possibility of quantum spin Hall effect and address a relation between the Ramanujan infinite alternating series and an interface in real space with a topological number one-half.</description>
