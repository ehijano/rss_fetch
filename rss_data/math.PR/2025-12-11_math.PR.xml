      <title>Negative Moments of Steinhaus Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp upper bound on negative moments of sums of independent Steinhaus random variables (that is uniform on circles in the plane). Together with the series of earlier works: K\"onig-Kwapie\'n (2001), \mbox{Baernstein~II}--Culverhouse (2002), and K\"onig (2014), this closes the investigation of sharp $L_p-L_2$ Khinchin-type inequalities for the Steinhaus sums. Incidentally, we fix a mistake in an earlier paper, as well as provide an application to sharp bounds on R\'enyi entropy.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics for non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the two-dimensional analogue of the asymptotics for Toeplitz determinants with Fisher-Hartwig singularities, for general real symbols. This formula has applications to random normal matrices with complex spectra: (i) the characteristic polynomial converges to a Gaussian multiplicative chaos random measure on the limiting droplet, in the subcritical phase; (ii) the electric potential converges pointwise to a logarithmically correlated field; (iii) the measure of its level sets (i.e. thick points) is identified; (iv) the associated free energy undergoes a freezing transition.
  This establishes emergence of the Liouville quantum gravity measure from free fermions in 2d, and universality with respect to the external potential.</description>

      <title>Topological Obstructions to Shared Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite collection of probability measures defined on subsets of a measurable space, how can we determine if they are compatible, in the sense that they can be realized as conditional distributions of a single probability measure on the full space? This formulation of the consistency problem for conditional probabilities is significant in Bayesian epistemology and probabilistic reasoning, as it describes the conditions under which a collection of agents can reach agreement by sharing information. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition under which joint compatibility is equivalent to pairwise compatibility. This condition is stated in terms of the cohomology of a simplicial complex constructed from the given probability measures, exposing a novel application of algebraic topology to Bayesian reasoning.</description>

      <title>On the Green's functions and Martin boundary structure of a planar diffusion in a discontinuous layered medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional diffusion process in a two-layered plane, governed by distinct covariance matrices in the upper and lower half-planes and by two drift vectors pointed away from the $x$-axis. We first analyze the case where the generator of the process is in divergence form, that is, when the flux is continuous across the interface. Then we extend the study to a broader class of processes whose behavior at the interface forms an oblique two-dimensional analogue of the skew Brownian motion.
  We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of this transient process. Our main results are as follows: (i) we derive explicit Laplace transforms of the Green's functions; (ii) we compute exact asymptotics of the Green's functions along all possible trajectories in the plane; (iii) We determine all positive harmonic functions, identifying the full and minimal Martin boundaries, which turn out to be distinct. The nonminimality of the Martin boundary is a noteworthy phenomenon for diffusions with regular coefficients.
  To obtain an analytical description of the process, we fully develop a three-variable version of the so-called kernel method by deriving and exploiting a functional equation involving unknown Laplace transforms of Green's functions and two known kernels $\gamma_+(x,y)$ and $\gamma_{-}(x,z)$. The introduction of independent auxiliary variables $y$ and $z$, associated with each half-plane, is a key idea.</description>

      <title>Coexistence for Competing Branching Random Walks with Identical Asymptotic Shape on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two independent branching random walks that start next to each other on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice and that carry two different colors. Vertices of the lattice are colored according to the color of the walker cloud that first visits the vertex, leading to the question of possible coexistence in the sense that both colors appear on infinitely many vertices. Under mild conditions, we prove the coexistence for two independently distributed branching random walks obeying the same first- and second-order behavior for their extremal particles. To complement this result, we also exhibit examples for the almost-sure absence of coexistence, for $d=1$, in cases where the asymptotic shapes of the walker clouds are calibrated to coincide, thereby answering a question by Deijfen and Vilkas (ECP 28(15):1-11, 2023). As a main tool we employ second-order and large-deviation approximations for the position of the extremal particles in one-dimensional branching random walks.</description>

      <title>The Uniform Random Walk on graphs, loop processes and graphings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the Uniform Random Walk (URW) on a connected, locally finite graph as the weak limit of the uniform walk of length $n$ starting at a fixed vertex. When the limit exists, it is necessarily Markovian and is independent of the starting point. For a finite graph, URW equals the Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW).
  We investigate the existence and phase transitions of URW for loop perturbed regular graphs and their limits. It turns out that for a sequence of finite graphs, it is the global spectral theory of the limiting graphing that governs the behavior of the finite MERWs.
  In the delocalized phase, we use a "membrane argument", showing that the principal eigenfunction of an expander graphing is stable under a small diagonal perturbation. This gives us: 1) The existence of URW on leaves; 2) The URW is a unique entropy maximizer; 3) The MERW of a finite graph sequence Benjamini-Schramm converges to the URW of the limiting graphing.
  In the localized phase, the environment seen by the particle takes the role of a finite stationary measure. We show that for canopy trees, the URW exists, is transient and maximizes entropy. We also show that for large finite graphs where most vertices have a fixed degree, localization of MERW is governed by the adjacency norm.</description>

      <title>Strong confluence of geodesics in Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity ($\gamma$-LQG) constitutes a family of planar random geometries whose geodesics exhibit intricate fractal behaviour. As is observed in various planar models of random geometry as part of the phenomenon of geodesic confluence, geodesics in $\gamma$-LQG tend to merge with each other. In particular, in Gwynne-Miller '19, it was established that in $\gamma$-LQG, geodesics targeted to a fixed point do coalesce in the sense that any two such geodesics almost surely merge before reaching their common target. However, in view of the randomness inherent to the geometry, it is a priori possible that while geodesics targeted to a fixed point do coalesce, there exists a sequence of geodesics $P_n$ converging to an exceptional geodesic $P$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$ such that $P_n$ does not overlap with $P$ for any $n$. In this paper, we prove that this is not possible, thereby establishing a strong confluence statement for $\gamma$-LQG for all $\gamma\in (0,2)$. This extends the results obtained in Miller-Qian '20 for $\gamma=\sqrt{8/3}$ to all subcritical values of $\gamma$. We discuss applications to the study of geodesic stars and geodesic networks and include a list of open questions.</description>

      <title>On asymptotic behavior of solutions to random fractional Riesz-Bessel equations with cyclic long memory initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates fractional Riesz-Bessel equations with random initial conditions. The spectra of these random initial conditions exhibit singularities both at zero frequency and at non-zero frequencies, which correspond to the cases of classical long-range dependence and cyclic long-range dependence, respectively. Using spectral methods and asymptotic theory, it is shown that the rescaled solutions of the equations converge to spatio-temporal Gaussian random fields. The limit fields are stationary in space and non-stationary in time. The covariance and spectral structures of the resulting asymptotic random fields are provided. The paper further establishes multiscaling limit theorems for the case of regularly varying asymptotics. A numerical example illustrating the theoretical results is also presented.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of lowlying Dirichlet eigenvalues of Witten Laplacians on domains in pinned path groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact Lie group and $P_{e,a}(G)=C([0,1]\to G~|~\gamma(0)=e, \gamma(1)=a)$ be the pinned path space with a pinned Brownian motion measure $\nu_{\lambda,a}$ defined by the heat kernel $p(\lambda^{-1}t,x,y)$, where $\lambda$ is a positive parameter. We consider a Witten Laplacian $-L_{\lambda,\mathcal{D}}$ with the Dirichlet boundary condition on a certain domain $\mathcal{D}\subset P_{e,a}(G)$ which includes finitely many geodesics $\{l_1,\ldots,l_N\}$ between $e$ and $a$. $\nu_{\lambda,a}$ has the formal path integral expression $\nu_{\lambda,a}(d\gamma)=Z_{\lambda}^{-1}\exp \left(-\lambda E(\gamma)\right)d\gamma$, where $E(\gamma)=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^1|\dot{\gamma}(t)|^2dt$ and $E$ is a Morse function when $a$ is not a point of the set of cut-locus of $e$. Hence, by the analogy of finite dimensional cases, one may expect that the lowlying spectrum of $-\lambda^{-1}L_{\lambda,\mathcal{D}}$ can be approximated by the spectral sets of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operators which approximate $-\lambda^{-1}L_{\lambda,\mathcal{D}}$ at each critical points $\{l_i\}$ when $\lambda\to\infty$. However, differently from finite dimensional cases, the spectral sets of the approximate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operators contain essential spectrum. It may be difficult to analyze the behavior of the spectrum of $-\lambda^{-1}L_{\lambda,\mathcal{D}}$ near the set of the essential spectrum. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the lowlying discrete spectrum of $-\lambda^{-1}L_{\lambda,\mathcal{D}}$ in the complement of the neighborhood of the set of essential spectrum of the approximate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operators at $\{l_i\}$.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Truncated Signatures of Gaussian Rough Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive concentration theory for truncated signatures of Gaussian rough paths. The signature of a path, defined as the collection of all iterated integrals, provides a complete description of its geometric structure and has emerged as a powerful tool in machine learning and stochastic analysis. Despite growing applications in finance, healthcare, and engineering, the non-asymptotic concentration properties of signature features remain largely unexplored.
  We prove that level-$k$ signature coordinates exhibit optimal $\exp(-c t^{2/k})$ tail decay and establish dimension-free concentration inequalities for the full truncated signature vector. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off: higher truncation levels capture more complex path properties but exhibit heavier tails. For Brownian motion and fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H &gt; 1/4$, we derive explicit variance formulas and sharp constants.
  The technical contributions combine rough path theory with Gaussian analysis, leveraging Wiener chaos decomposition, hypercontractivity, and the algebraic structure of tensor algebras. We further establish concentration for log-signatures, lead-lag transformations, and provide sample complexity bounds for statistical learning with signature features.
  This work bridges advanced probability theory with practical applications, offering both theoretical guarantees and computational methods for signature-based approaches in sequential data analysis.</description>

      <title>On Inhomogeneous Affine Volterra Processes: Stationarity and Applications to the Volterra Heston Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: True Volterra equations are inherently non stationary and therefore do not admit $\textit{genuine stationary regimes}$ over finite horizons. This motivates the study of the finite-time behavior of the solutions to scaled inhomogeneous affine Stochastic Volterra equations through the lens of a weaker notion of stationarity referred to as $\textit{fake stationary regime}$ in the sense that all marginal distributions share the same expectation and variance. As a first application, we introduce the $\textit{Fake stationary Volterra Heston model}$ and derive a closed-form expression for its characteristic function. Having established this finite-time proxy for stationarity, we then investigate the asymptotic (long-time) behavior to assess whether genuine stationary regimes emerge in the limit. Using an extension of the exponential-affine transformation formula for those processes, we establish in the long run the existence of limiting distributions, which (unlike in the case of classical affine diffusion processes) may depend on the initial state of the process, unless the Volterra kernel coincides with the $\alpha-$ fractional integration kernel, for which the dependence on the initial state vanishes. We then proceed to the construction of stationary processes associated with these limiting distributions. However, the dynamics in this long-term regime are analytically intractable, and the process itself is not guaranteed to be stationary in the classical sense over finite horizons. This highlights the relevance of finite-time analysis through the lens of the aforementioned $\textit{fake stationarity}$, which offers a tractable approximation to stationary behavior in genuinely non-stationary Volterra systems.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by critical planar percolation, we investigate a ``backbone'' event of planar Brownian motion, i.e.~the existence of two disjoint subpaths on the Brownian trajectory connecting the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the starting point to a macroscopic distance. We show that the probability of~this event is $(\log|\log\varepsilon|)^{-1}$ up to a multiplicative constant.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Branching Random Walks: Incorporating Genealogy and Density Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework using inhomogeneous Branching Random Walks (BRWs) to model growth processes, specifically introducing genealogy-dependence in branching rates and displacement distributions to model phenomena like bacterial colony growth. Current stochastic models often either assume independent and identical behavior of individual agents or incorporate only spatiotemporal inhomogeneity, ignoring the effect of genealogy-based inhomogeneity on the long-time behavior of these processes. Such long-time asymptotics are of independent mathematical interest and are crucial in understanding the effect of patterns. We propose several inhomogeneous BRW models in 2D space where displacement distributions and branching rates vary with time, space, and genealogy. A combined model then uses a weighted average of positions given by these separate models to study the shape of the growth patterns. Using computer simulations, we tune parameters from these models, which are based on genealogical and spatiotemporal factors, observe the resulting structures, and compare them with images of real bacterial colonies.</description>

Abstract: We introduce infinitesimal weak containment for measure-preserving actions of a countable group $\Gamma$: an action $(X,\mu)$ is infinitesimally contained in $(Y,\nu)$ if the statistics of the action of $\Gamma$ on small measure subsets of $X$ can be approximated inside $Y$. We show that the Bernoulli shift $[0,1]^\Gamma$ is infinitesimally contained in the left-regular action of $\Gamma$. For exact groups, this implies that sparse factor-of-iid subsets of $\Gamma$ are approximately hyperfinite. We use it to quantify a theorem of Chifan--Ioana on measured subrelations of the Bernoulli shift of an exact group. For the proof of infinitesimal containment we define \emph{entropy support maps}, which take a small subset $U$ of $\{0,1\}^I$ and assign weights to coordinates above every point of $U$, according to how ''important'' they are for the structure of the set.</description>

      <title>A tree bijection for the moduli space of genus-0 hyperbolic surfaces with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weil-Petersson volume of genus-g hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundaries is known since work of Mirzakhani to be polynomial in the boundary lengths. We provide a bijective proof of this fact in the genus-0 case in the presence of a distinguished cusp. It is based on a generalization of a recent tree bijection, by the first author and Curien, to the setting with geodesic boundaries, requiring an extension of the Bowditch-Epstein-Penner spine construction. As an application of our tree bijection we establish an explicit formula for the distance-dependent three-point function, which records an exact metric statistic measuring the difference of two geodesic distances among a triple of distinguished cusps in a Weil-Petersson random surface. We conclude with a discussion of the relevance of this function to the topological recursion of Weil-Petersson volumes and metric properties of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with many boundaries or cusps.</description>

      <title>Analysis of splitting schemes for stochastic evolution equations with non-Lipschitz nonlinearities driven by fractional noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel time-splitting scheme for a class of semilinear stochastic evolution equations driven by cylindrical fractional noise. The nonlinearity is decomposed as the sum of a one-sided, non-globally, Lipschitz continuous function, and of a globally Lipschitz continuous function. The proposed scheme is based on a splitting strategy, where the first nonlinearity is treated using the exact flow of an associated differential equation, and the second one is treated by an explicit Euler approximation. We prove mean-square, strong error estimates for the proposed scheme and show that the order of convergence is $H-1/4$, where $H\in(1/4,1)$ is the Hurst index. For the proof, we establish new regularity results for real-valued and infinite dimensional fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process depending on the value of the Hurst parameter $H$. Numerical experiments illustrate the main result of this manuscript.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of the singularity at infinity of the hitting measure of random walks has a long history, originating from the work of Furstenberg in the 1960s. In 2011, Kaimanovich and Le Prince conjectured that the hitting measure of any finitely supported random walk on a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of $\mathrm{SL}_N(\mathbb R)$ is singular at infinity with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Using algebraic and geometric convergence and hyperbolic Dehn filling, we prove the singularity conjecture for certain measures on ``most'' cocompact Fuchsian and Kleinian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the Moran model with strong or moderately strong selection we prove that the fluctuations around the deterministic limit of the line counting process of the ancestral selection graph converge to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. To this purpose we provide an extension of a functional limit theorem by Ethier and Kurtz 1986. This result and a small adaptation of our arguments can also be used to obtain the scaling limit for the fluctuations of certain logistic branching processes.</description>

      <title>Disordered Gibbs measures and Gaussian conditioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the law of a random field $f_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$ evaluated at a random sample from the Gibbs measure associated to a Gaussian field $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})$. In the high-temperature regime, we show that bounds on the probability that $f_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})\in A$ for $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ randomly sampled from the Gibbs measure can be deduced from similar bounds for deterministic $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ under the conditional Gaussian law given that $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N=E$ for $E$ close to the derivative $F'(\beta)$ of the free energy (which is the typical value of $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N$ under the Gibbs measure). In the more challenging low-temperature regime we restrict to $k$-RSB spherical spin glasses, proving a similar result, now with a more elaborate conditioning. Namely, with $q_i$ denoting the locations of the non-zero atoms of the Parisi measure, in addition to specifying that $H_N(\boldsymbol{\sigma})/N=E$, here one needs to also condition on the energy and its gradient at points $\mathbf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_k$ such that $\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{x}_j\rangle/N=q_{i\wedge j}$ and $\langle \mathbf{x}_i,\boldsymbol{\sigma}\rangle/N\approx q_{i}$. Like in the high-temperature phase, the energy and gradient values on which one conditions are also specified by the model's Parisi measure. We apply our general results to two important problems from statistical physics. That is, computing the Franz-Parisi potential at any temperature and, reducing certain asymptotics of Langevin dynamics with initial conditions distributed according to the Gibbs measure, to the more manageable problem of studying dynamics with non-random initial conditions and conditional disorder.</description>

      <title>Refining Concentration for Gaussian Quadratic Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We slightly modify the proof of Hanson-Wright inequality (HWI) for concentration of Gaussian quadratic chaos where we tighten the bound by increasing the absolute constant in its formulation from the largest known value of 0.125 to at least 0.145 in the symmetric case. We also present a sharper version of an inequality due to Laurent and Massart (LMI) through which we increase the absolute constant in HWI from the largest available value of approximately $0.134$ due to LMI itself to at least $0.152$ in the positive-semidefinite case. A new sequence of concentration bounds indexed by $m=1,2,3,\cdots, \infty$ is developed that involves Schatten norms of the underlying matrix. The case $m=1$ recovers HWI. These bounds undergo a phase transition in the sense that if the tail parameter is smaller than a critical threshold $\tau_c$, then $m=1$ is the tightest and if it is larger than $\tau_c$, then $m=\infty$ is the tightest. This leads to a novel bound called the~$m_\infty$-bound. A separate concentration bound named twin to HWI is also developed that is tighter than HWI for both sufficiently small and large tail parameter. Finally, we explore concentration bounds when the underlying matrix is positive-semidefinite and only the dimension~$n$ and its largest eigenvalue are known. Five candidates are examined, namely, the $m_\infty$-bound, relaxed versions of HWI and LMI, the $\chi^2$-bound and the large deviations bound. The sharpest among these is always either the $m_\infty$-bound or the $\chi^2$-bound. The case of even dimension is given special attention. If $n=2,4,6$, the $\chi^2$-bound is tighter than the $m_\infty$-bound. If $n$ is an even integer greater than or equal to 8, the $m_\infty$-bound is sharper than the $\chi^2$-bound if and only if the ratio of the tail parameter over the largest eigenvalue lies inside a finite open interval which expands indefinitely as $n$ grows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By exploiting the well-known observation that size-biasing or zero-biasing an infinitely divisible random variable may be achieved by adding an independent increment, combined with tools from Stein's method for compound Poisson and Gaussian approximations, we establish three sets of approximation results: (a) bounds on the proximity of Poisson mixtures with infinitely divisible mixing distributions, (b) central limit theorems with explicit error bounds for sums of associated or negatively associated random variables which do not require boundedness of the underlying distributions, and (c) a Gaussian approximation theorem under a vanishing third moment condition. These exploit biasing by an independent increment directly, via an intermediate compound Poisson approximation, and through a convex ordering argument, respectively. Applications include a Dickman-type limit theorem, simple random sampling and urn models with overflow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first survey some open questions concerning stochastic interacting particle systems with open boundaries. Then an asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries that generalizes the lattice gas model of Katz, Lebowitz, and Spohn (KLS) is introduced and invariance of the one-dimensional Ising measure is proved. The stationary current is computed in explicit form and is shown to exhibit current reversal at some density. Based on the extremal-current principle for one-dimensional driven diffusive systems with one conservation law, the phase diagram for boundary-induced phase transitions is conjectured for this case. There are two extremal-current phases, unlike in the conventional open asymmetric simple exclusion process, which exhibits only one extremal-current phase or the previously considered conventional open KLS model with one or three extremal-current phases.</description>

      <title>Adjoint path-kernel method for backpropagation and data assimilation in unstable diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the adjoint path-kernel method for computing parameter-gradients (linear responses) of SDEs. Its cost is almost independent of the number of parameters, and it works for non-hyperbolic systems with parameter-controlled multiplicative noise. With this new formula, we extend the conventional backpropagation method to settings with gradient explosion, and demonstrate it on the 40-dimensional Lorenz 96 system.
  Moreover, we consider a difficult version of the 4D-Var data assimilation problem where (1) the deterministic part of the model is chaotic, (2) the loss is a single long-time functional accounting for discrepancies in both the observations and the dynamics, (3) some parameters in the dynamics are unknown, and (4) some coordinates of the states cannot be observed, and cannot be reasonably inferred from other coordinates within a short time. We model the correction term at each time-step separately as a parameterized function of the random state. With our new tool, we can run stochastic gradient descent to find the path and parameters that best match the low-dimensional observation data. We demonstrate this on the 10D Lorenz-96 system with 8D observations.</description>

      <title>Sharp Fuss-Catalan thresholds in graph bootstrap percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study graph bootstrap percolation on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph ${\mathcal G}_{n,p}$. For all $r \ge 5$, we locate the sharp $K_r$-percolation threshold $p_c \sim (\gamma n)^{-1/\lambda}$, solving a problem of Balogh, Bollob\'as and Morris. The case $r=3$ is the classical graph connectivity threshold, and the threshold for $r=4$ was found using strong connections with the well-studied $2$-neighbor dynamics from statistical physics. When $r \ge 5$, such connections break down, and the process exhibits much richer behavior. The constants $\lambda=\lambda(r)$ and $\gamma=\gamma(r)$ in $p_c$ are determined by a class of $\left({r\choose2}-1\right)$-ary tree-like graphs, which we call $K_r$-tree witness graphs. These graphs are associated with the most efficient ways of adding a new edge in the $K_r$-dynamics, and they can be counted using the Fuss-Catalan numbers. Also, in the subcritical setting, we determine the asymptotic number of edges added to ${\mathcal G}_{n,p}$, showing that the edge density increases only by a constant factor, whose value we identify.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of the job-size distribution for an M/G/1 queue with Poisson sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10116v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a non-parametric estimator for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the job-size distribution for a queue with compound Poisson input. The workload process is observed according to an independent Poisson sampling process. The nonparametric estimator is constructed by first estimating the characteristic function (CF) and then applying an inversion formula. The convergence rate of the CF estimator at $s$ is shown to be of the order of $s^2/n$, where $n$ is the sample size. This convergence rate is leveraged to explore the bias-variance tradeoff of the inversion estimator. It is demonstrated that within a certain class of continuous distributions, the risk, in terms of MSE, is uniformly bounded by $C n^{-\frac{\eta}{1+\eta}}$, where $C$ is a positive constant and the parameter $\eta&gt;0$ depends on the smoothness of the underlying class of distributions. A heuristic method is further developed to address the case of an unknown rate of the compound Poisson input process.</description>

      <title>Proximality, stability, and central limit theorem for random maps on an interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems consisting of non-invertible continuous maps on an interval are studied. It is proved that if they satisfy the recently introduced so-called $\mu$-injectivity and some mild assumptions, then proximality, asymptotic stability and a central limit theorem hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in stochastic processes satisfying a nonlinear recurrence relation of the form $$X_{n + k} = \Phi_0 (X_n, ..., X_{n + k - 1}) + \Theta_n$$ where $\Theta$ is a noise term. We establish the existence of an invariant measure for this process under given sufficient conditions on $\Phi_0.$</description>

      <title>Interpolation and random interpolation in de Branges-Rovnyak spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to characterize universal and multiplier interpolating sequences for de Branges-Rovnyak spaces H (b) where the defining function b is a general non-extreme rational function. Our results carry over to recently introduced higher order local Dirichlet spaces and thus generalize previously known results in classical local Dirichlet spaces. In this setting, we also investigate random interpolating sequences with prescribed radii, providing a 0 -1 law.  This condition is automatic when b is rational non inner so that we can assume H (b) = M(a). By standard results in functional analysis, the corresponding norms are equivalent. In [18], the authors demonstrated that the decomposition (1) is orthogonal in the metric of M(a).</description>

      <title>Revenue Maximization Under Sequential Price Competition Via The Estimation Of s-Concave Demand Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16737v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Higher-order asymptotic expansion with error estimate for the multidimensional Laplace-type integral under perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of the multidimensional Laplace-type integral with a perturbed phase function. Under suitable assumptions, we derive a higher-order asymptotic expansion with an error estimate, generalizing some previous results including Laplace's method. The key points of the proof are a precise asymptotic analysis based on a lot of detailed Taylor expansions, and a careful consideration of the effects of the perturbations on the Hessian matrix of the phase function.</description>

      <title>Gibbs polystability of Fano manifolds, stability thresholds and symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the probabilistic approach for constructing Kahler-Einstein metrics on log Fano manifolds - involving random point processes - to the case of non-discrete automorphism groups, by explicitly breaking the symmetry. This yields a new algebraic notion of Gibbs polystability, conjecturally equivalent to K-polystability. The definition involves a limit of log canonical thresholds on the GIT semistable locus of the N-fold products of the Fano manifold that we conjecture coincides with an analytic reduced stability threshold encoding the coercivity of the K-energy functional modulo automorphisms. These conjectures follow from an overarching conjectural Large Deviation Principle for the limit when N tends to infinity. We prove several of our conjectures for log Fano curves. By imposing a moment constraint, we derive a strengthened form of the sharp logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the two-sphere, that implies the sharp form of Aubin's refinement of the Moser-Trudinger inequality. In companion papers we will present applications to Onsager's point vortex model on the two-sphere and the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of the 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations: Convergence under Transport Noise and No-slip Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the numerical approximation of the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with transport noise and no-slip boundary conditions on a convex polygonal domain. The analysis is challenged by the solution's low spatial regularity and the non-Lipschitz nonlinearity. We derive a convergence rate in the mean-square sense for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, for the full discretization, we prove convergence in probability and establish an explicit rate with respect to the time step.</description>

      <title>VaR at Its Extremes: Impossibilities and Conditions for One-Sided Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extremal aggregation behavior of Value-at-Risk (VaR) -- that is, its additivity properties across all probability levels -- for sums of one-sided random variables. For risks supported on \([0,\infty)\), we show that VaR sub-additivity is impossible except in the degenerate case of exact additivity, which holds only under co-monotonicity. To characterize when VaR is instead fully super-additive, we introduce two structural conditions: negative simplex dependence (NSD) for the joint distribution and simplex dominance (SD) for a margin-dependent functional. Together, these conditions provide a unified and easily verifiable framework that accommodates non-identical margins, heavy-tailed laws, and a wide spectrum of negative dependence structures. All results extend to random variables with arbitrary finite lower or upper endpoints, yielding sharp constraints on when strict sub- or super-additivity can occur.</description>
