      <title>Searching for neutrino polarizability at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an initial study of DUNE's sensitivity to enhanced neutrino polarizability within models of light scalar mediators. We identify two possible signatures of polarizability due to neutrino scattering on electrons and due to coherent scattering on argon nuclei. These result in either one or two separated electromagnetic showers, respectively, with no associated hadronic activity. For each signature we compute the signal rates and the relevant backgrounds, obtaining the projected reach of the DUNE near detector. We then compare this with the current astrophysical and terrestrial bounds on light scalar models coupling to neutrinos and/or photons.</description>

      <title>A Journey of Seeking Pressures and Forces in the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested by M. Polyakov et al. that the QCD momentum current density (MCD) $T^{ij}$ in the nucleon, characterized by the form factor $C/D$ of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, can be interpreted as the pressure and shear force distributions inside the nucleon because its interior seems to approximate a continuous mechanical medium. By examining the physics content of MCDs in various classical and quantum systems, we find that momentum current flow originates from both kinetic motion of particles and forces between them, and furthermore, the forces alone cannot determine the interaction MCDs unambiguously, same as the interaction energy potentials and consistent with Noether's theorem. Only in special cases where there are short-range forces between different elements of a system, or short-range interactions with external boundaries that result in discontinuities of MCDs, can the relevant components be interpreted as surface forces, i.e., mechanical pressures and shear forces. For the nucleon in QCD, the range of quark and gluon interactions is comparable to its size and far from short, and we fail to identify any interaction component of the MCD as pressure/shear forces between different parts of the nucleon, nor the total through the form factor $C/D$ which merely depicts the total momentum flux seen through gravity. Following our previous study of the forces through divergences of kinetic MCDs, we affirm that the gluon scalar field in the QCD trace anomaly provides a confining force potential on the quarks, with a strength consistent with that between heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Role of $K^*_0(700)$ exchange in the $p \bar{p} \to \Lambda \bar{\Lambda}$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regarding the reaction $p \bar{p} \to \Lambda \bar{\Lambda}$, we provide a dynamical explanation focusing on its total and differential cross section based on the effective Lagrangian approach. Incorporating the $t$-channel exchange of the $K^*_0(700)$ meson and $s$-channel contribution from the vector excited state, we can reproduce the current experimental data fairly well in a wide energy region. Compared to the conventional $K$ and $K^*$ mesons exchange, the $K^*_0(700)$ meson exchange plays a more essential role in simultaneously capturing the observed features of the total and differential cross sections. This work gives a perspective to inspect the role of $K^*_0(700)$ and serves as a test to search for the resonances in the reaction $p \bar{p} \to \Lambda \bar{\Lambda}$ at threshold.</description>

      <title>NNLO electron structure functions (PDFs) from SCET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the electron structure functions, aka parton distribution functions (PDFs), to NNLO in QED. The calculation is based on the definition of the PDFs in terms of operator matrix elements in soft collinear effective theory (SCET) and directly performed in momentum space. The electron PDFs describe the universal effects of collinear initial state radiation (ISR) off the electron (or positron) in DIS or $e^+ e^-$ collision events. The parton collinear to the electron that enters the hard scattering process governed by the energy scale $Q$ can be a photon or a (anti)fermion with mass $m_f \sim m_e \ll Q$. Our SCET momentum-space calculation confirms earlier results obtained from a QED computation in Mellin space and extends them by taking more than one massive fermion flavor into account. The well-known factorization of sufficiently inclusive cross sections into PDFs with massive fermions and hard partonic cross sections with massless fermions at leading order in $m_e/Q$ is discussed from the SCET perspective. Analogies to the nonperturbative PDFs and collinear factorization in QCD are pointed out. Based on this factorization DGLAP-type resummation of large logarithms of the ratio $m_e/Q$ is straightforward.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of global U(1) symmetry in an interacting Bose gas under rigid rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of rigid rotation on the spontaneous breaking of U(1) symmetry in a Bose gas, which is described by a self-interacting complex scalar field Lagrangian. Rigid rotation is introduced through a specific metric that explicitly depends on the angular velocity $\Omega$. We begin by determining the free propagator for this model at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. Using this propagator, we calculate the thermodynamic potential in terms of an energy dispersion relation $\epsilon_{k}$. It is found that in both the U(1) symmetric phase and the symmetry-broken phase, two energy branches emerge. In the symmetry-broken phase, they are identified with a massive phonon and a massless roton mode. Notably, rotation does not alter $\epsilon_{k}$ at low momentum. Setting $\mu=0$, we use the total thermodynamic potential, which includes classical, thermal, vacuum, and nonperturbative ring contributions, to explore how the condensate depends on $T$ and $\Omega$. We first focus on the classical and thermal parts of the thermodynamic potential and find that the critical temperature of the U(1) phase transition scales as $\Omega^{1/3}$. By identifying the (pseudo-)Goldstone and non-Goldstone modes of this model with $\pi$ and $\sigma$ mesons, we calculate the $T$ and $\Omega$ dependence of masses $m_{\pi}$ and $m_{\sigma}$. We demonstrate that the Goldstone theorem holds only when the one-loop (thermal) corrections to $m_{\sigma}$ and $m_{\pi}$ are taken into account. We further explore the $T$ and $\Omega$ dependence of the condensate, determine the $\sigma$ dissociation temperatures for fixed $\Omega$, and compare them with the critical temperature of the phase transition. Additionally, we emphasize the role played by the nonperturbative ring potential, especially in altering the order of the phase transition with and without rotation.</description>

      <title>Pinpointing Physical Solutions in Y(4230) Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To resolve ambiguities from multiple solutions in experimental measurements, we construct a $\chi^2$ function incorporating constraints such as isospin conservation and amplitude relations. By minimizing the global $\chi^2$, we identify physical solutions for seven hidden-charm decay channels of $Y(4230)$, revealing a small strange quark component. Crucially, the physical solution for $Y(4230) \to \pi^{+}\pi^{-} J/\psi$ corresponds to the smallest among four experimental solutions, potentially significantly modifying inputs for theoretical calculations. Additionally, we predict $\Gamma_{ee}{\mathcal B}(Y(4230) \to \pi^+\pi^- \psi')$ based on our results, acknowledging substantial uncertainties in current measurements.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Photon Bose-Einstein Condensation from Down-Scattering in Cold Electron Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the emergence of photon Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) resulting from the interaction of high-energy photons with a cold electron gas, modeled via a modified Kompaneets equation. Beginning with an initial black-body photon spectrum, we perform numerical simulations to track the evolution of the photon distribution under the influence of inverse Compton scattering, wherein photons dissipate energy through collisions with cold electrons. Our results demonstrate a pronounced enhancement of photon number density at the low-energy tail, indicative of a BEC-like phase transition. This phenomenon is further corroborated by an analysis of the entropy evolution during the cooling process, revealing that the condensate configuration corresponds to the entropy maximum, in accordance with thermodynamic principles. These findings establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for photon BEC formation in cold electron environments and underscore the significance of entropy maximization as a driving mechanism for condensation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the hidden-charm pentaquark candidates in the $J/\psi \Lambda$ mass spectrum via the QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we distinguish the isospin for the first time and study the diquark-diquark-antiquark type $udsc\bar{c}$ pentaquark states with zero isospin via the QCD sum rules systematically. We distinguish contributions of the pentaquark states with negative parity from positive parity unambiguously and obtain clean QCD sum rules for the pentaquark states with negative parity. Then we adopt the modified energy scale formula to choose the optimal energy scales of the QCD spectral densities, and obtain the mass spectrum of the $udsc\bar{c}$ pentaquark states with the quantum numbers $I=0$ and $J^{P}={\frac{1}{2}}^-$, ${\frac{3}{2}}^-$, ${\frac{5}{2}}^-$, which could interpret the $P_{cs}(4338)$ and $P_{cs}(4459)$ in the $J/\psi \Lambda$ mass spectrum naturally.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity of neutrinoless double beta decays via combined multi-transition analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments, with projected half-life sensitivities approaching $10^{28}$ years, aim to fully probe the parameter space associated with the inverted neutrino mass ordering. However, this discovery potential remains uncertain, as it depends sensitively on the nuclear matrix element, which exhibits significant model dependence. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to enhance experimental sensitivity by performing a combined analysis of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay to both the ground state and the first excited $0^+$ state of the daughter nucleus. This approach is particularly promising for large liquid xenon detectors, such as the proposed PandaX-xT and XLZD experiments, which are capable of identifying decays of $^{136}$Xe to excited states with high efficiency. Our analysis demonstrates that such a combined multi-transition analysis can improve the sensitivity to $|m_{\beta\beta}|$ by more than a factor of two for a nominal xenon detector setup, and by up to an order of magnitude in an ideal scenario, potentially accelerating access to the entire inverted ordering regime. These findings underscore the importance of probing multiple decay channels simultaneously in future $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay searches to maximize discovery potential.</description>

      <title>Probing Leptophobic Dark Sectors via Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a minimally extended version of the Standard Model where baryon number is gauged with a $U(1)_B$ symmetry. This model can be made anomaly-free by adding a set of additional fermions. The lightest component of these fermions behaves as a viable dark matter candidate. We show that the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$ symmetry can produce gravitational waves via bubble dynamics resulting from a first-order phase transition, which can be detected in future gravitational wave experiments like LISA and ET. Such gravitational wave signatures can be used as a probe to constrain the model in future observations and complement dark matter and collider searches. We perform a random numerical scan of the parameter space and derive the viable region consistent with current bounds from dark matter experiments such as LUX-ZEPLIN and XENONnT and sensitive to future gravitational wave experiments. We find that dark matter with mass of order $\mathcal{O}(1 - 10)$ TeV is the most interesting to test in future gravitational wave as well as laboratory experiments. In the viable parameter space, the mass of the $Z'$ gauge boson associated with the $U(1)_B$ lies in the few-tens of TeV region, and the mass of the scalar associated with the symmetry breaking lies around a few hundred GeV to TeV scale. Hence, the dark matter and mediator mass scales typically fall beyond the reach of present direct detection experiments and are marginally accessible at current collider energies.</description>

      <title>The quest for topped hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent discovery of an pseudoscalar enhancement structure near the $t\bar{t}$ threshold reported by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations, this work investigates the mass spectra of single topped hadrons-including both topped mesons and topped baryons-based on a relativistic potential model. Our results show that, using the same parameters obtained from the fit to mesons and baryons, the calculated mass of pseudoscalar topponium is in excellent agreement with the observed enhancement structure, demonstrating the consistency and unifying power of the model. Accordingly, we provide predictions for the mass spectra of ground and low-lying orbitally excited single topped mesons and baryons, which may serve as a reference for future experimental searches for these possible new hadronic matter.</description>

      <title>Charmonium spectrum and its decay properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have calculated the mass spectrum, radiative decays, and strong decays of charmonium (cc) by using the non-relativistic quark potential(NRQP) model. The wave functions are calculated by solving the radial Schrodinger equation numerically, which are further used to compute the radiative decay widths of (cc) states. The 3P0 model is used to calculate the strong decay widths by using the simple harmonic (SHO) wave functions. The SHO parameter \b{eta} values for different cc states are calculated by fitting it to the numerical wave functions. We also compare our results with experimental data and other theoretically predicted results. We assign to the charmonium states X(3940), X(3872), X(3862), X(4350) likely quantum numbers of {\eta}c(3S), \c{hi}1(2P), \c{hi}0(2P) and \c{hi}2(3P) states.</description>

      <title>Rephasing invariant formulae for general parameterizations of flavor mixing matrix and exact sum rules with unitarity triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present rephasing invariant formulae $\delta^{(\alpha i)} = \arg [ { V_{\alpha 1} V_{\alpha 2} V_{\alpha 3} V_{1i} V_{2i} V_{3i} / V_{\alpha i }^{3} \det V } ] $ for CP phases $\delta^{(\alpha i)}$ associated with nine Euler-angle-like parameterizations of a flavor mixing matrix. Here, $\alpha$ and $i$ denote the row and column carrying the trivial phases in a given parameterization. Furthermore, we show that the phases $\delta^{(\alpha i)}$ and the nine angles $\Phi_{\alpha i}$ of unitarity triangles satisfy compact sum rules $ \delta^{(\alpha, i+2)} - \delta^{(\alpha, i+1)} = \Phi_{\alpha-2, i} - \Phi_{\alpha-1, i}$ and $ \delta^{(\alpha-2, i)} - \delta^{(\alpha-1, i)} = \Phi_{\alpha, i+2} - \Phi_{\alpha, i+1}$ where all indices are taken cyclically modulo three. These twelve relations are natural generalizations of the previous result $\delta_{\mathrm{PDG}}+\delta_{\mathrm{KM}}=\pi-\alpha+\gamma.$</description>

      <title>Probing charmonia resonances in proton-lead collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After achieving a successful description of charmonia production in proton-proton (pp) collisions within Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) and modified NRQCD (MNRQCD) frameworks, we now extend our study to proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this context, theoretical predictions for the production cross-section, the nuclear modification factor $R_{pPb}$ and forward -to-backward production ratio $R_{FB}$ of $J/\psi$ have been made as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity at the LHC. MNRQCD provides a reasonable agreement with the available LHC data for $J/\psi$ production.Furthermore, using the heavy quark symmetry relation, we have estimated the production cross sections and expected number of events of $\eta_{c}$ and $h_{c}$ production in both NRQCD and MNRQCD. Notably, the predictions exhibit substantial differences in the integrated cross-sections as well as in the $p_T$ distributions for these states at the LHC, highlighting the importance of further experimental and theoretical studies of these resonances to advance our understanding of quarkonium production.</description>

      <title>Vectorlike $\tau$ production through leptoquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous phenomenological studies and collider searches have probed for the existence of new physics by looking for signatures of leptoquarks (LQs) or vectorlike leptons (VLLs). We consider a new possibility that can arise in theories with enhanced gauge symmetries: both particles are simultaneously present, and LQ-mediated processes enhance the VLL production at the LHC. We study the effect of non-standard interactions of LQs that contribute to novel production and decay signatures. We obtain the HL-LHC prospects of this framework in the mono-and di-lepton final states, and discuss other potentially relevant channels.</description>

      <title>The $\Lambda_{b} \to \Lambda$ transition form factors in perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda$ transition form factors in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach, incorporating higher-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs). The resulted form factors show that higher-twist LCDAs are dominant numerically. By combining our PQCD predictions at low-$q^2$ with lattice QCD results at high-$q^2$, $z$-series expansion fits are performed to parametrize the form factors over the full kinematic range. We also provide the prediction for physical observables in the rare decay $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \mu^+ \mu^-$, including the differential branching fraction, dilepton longitudinal polarization fraction, and forward-backward asymmetries (lepton-side, hadron-side, and combined lepton-hadron). Our obtained form factors are consistent with those in other theoretical methods within the uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Forward neutrino production and event rates at the Future Circular Collider for hadron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proposed future ultra high energy collider such as the Future Circular Collider produces intense and collimated neutrinos from weak decays of hadrons. We have estimated the production yields of such neutrinos from proton-proton collisions whose center-of-mass energy is 100~TeV and integrated luminosity of 1~ab$^{-1}$. Using a hypothetical detector positioned either 0.5~km or 2~km downstream of the proton-proton interaction point along the beamline, we have discussed the expected charged current neutrino scattering event rates and their possible extension up to the neutrino energy of about 50~TeV. We have also addressed a feasibility to observe so-far-unmeasured direct $W^{\pm}$ boson production from the interactions of neutrinos with nucleus.</description>

      <title>The Hubble's Law in Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolution of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter related to the expansion of matter born in heavy ion collisions is obtained for nucleons and pions. Calculations are done within PHSD transport model. Au+Au collisions with $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.8$ GeV at $b~=~2.5,\ 5.0,\ 7.5$ and $10.0$ fm are considered. A new method for determination the "microscopic" Hubble parameter from simulated data is used. The ballistic motion is obtained for the longitudinal direction after separation out of the nuclei. At earlier times the evolution of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter in this direction is more complicated. For transverse directions, an exponential low-time asymptotics of the Hubble parameter is observed. The obtained values of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter are $\sim 40$ orders of magnitude higher, than the cosmological Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>An Undergraduate Approach to the Quantum Hadrodynamics and the Physics of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this tutorial, I discuss how to model a neutron star from the Quantum Hadrodynamics microscopic approach. After a brief discussion about hydrostatic equilibrium, I discuss the role of each meson of the model and how to calculate the corresponding equation of state and the expected values. Each meson is introduced individually. Its effects are analyzed from both an analytical and a numerical point of view. To explicitly show the effects of a given meson, the coupling constant is varied in an arbitrary range before being fixed to reproduce well-known constraints. This work is intended for late undergraduate students as well as early graduate students. The equation of states is obtained from the statistical mechanics formalism, which is more familiar to students at this stage of their research career, instead of the traditional quantum field theory formalism.</description>

      <title>Disformal interactions in the Dark Sector: From driving Early Dark Energy to confronting cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model faces significant challenges, including an incomplete understanding of the dark sector and persistent tensions in the Hubble constant and the clustering amplitude. To address these issues, we propose a general disformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a field-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions including conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals that a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early Dark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble friction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological constant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and eventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark energy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on finely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a consequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter, offering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions. This framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature spectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for the observed low-$\ell$ anomaly. By deriving these effects from a fundamental action, our work provides a unified, testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM that can be constrained by next-generation cosmological surveys and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Baryon Electric Charge Correlation as QCD Magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of strong magnetic fields in peripheral heavy-ion collisions is crucial for observing effects such as the chiral magnetic effect but has proven exceptionally difficult. To address this, we propose the baryon electric charge correlation $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and the chemical potential ratio $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ as sensitive probes of magnetic fields, based on (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations at the physical pion mass. Along the transition line, $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ in Pb-Pb collisions increase by factors of 2.1 and 2.4 at $eB \simeq 8M_\pi^2$, respectively. To bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, we implement systematic kinematic cuts that emulate detector acceptances of the STAR and ALICE experiments within the hadron resonance gas model. This allows us to construct experimentally relevant proxy observables. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ is also sensitive to the collision system, showing a $1.5$-fold increase from Zr-Zr to Ru-Ru isobar collisions. Our findings offer new insights into thermo-magnetic effects and provide experimentally relevant guidance for the detection of magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation is one of the most important paradigms in modern cosmology. In its simplest form, inflation is driven by a single inflaton field. However, multi-field inflation has become increasingly attractive because it can solve many theoretical and observational challenges. In this paper, we propose a particular model involving two axion-like fields with simply monodromy-dominated potentials. We demonstrate that this model is consistent with current cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Effects of Geometric configuration in relativistic isobaric collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a study on the effects of nuclear deformation ($\beta_2$,$\beta_3$) and surface diffuseness ($a$) on the charged hadron multiplicity ($N_{\mathrm{ch}}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$), obtained in symmetric isobaric collisions of ${}^{96}_{44}\mathrm{Ru} + {}^{96}_{44}\mathrm{Ru}$ and ${}^{96}_{40}\mathrm{Zr} + {}^{96}_{40}\mathrm{Zr}$. The two extreme configurations (tip-tip and body-body) were used to determine the correlation between the final state observables and initial geometry using the HYDJET++ model. The octupole deformation parameter ($\beta_3$) enhances $N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ in central tip-tip Zr+Zr collisions and suppresses it in peripheral ones. In mid-central to peripheral body-body Zr+Zr collisions, $\beta_3$ leads to a reduction in charged hadron production. Surface-diffuseness ($a$), along with quadrapole deformation ($\beta_2$), also shows a significant impact on multiplicity and elliptic flow. The octupole deformation enhances elliptic flow in Zr's body-body collisions. Results are compared with the STAR blind-analysis data where available.</description>

      <title>Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without introducing theoretical pathologies. In Horndeski theories, however, breaking the shift symmetry allows this transition. We present an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a higher-order derivative term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts while avoiding ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress has shown that the geomagnetic field exerts a more significant impact than expected on the behavior of charged secondary particles in inclined air showers. In this study, we for the first time combine it with atmospheric effects to construct a bi-effect model, aiming to investigate the lateral distribution of particles on the ground plane. Despite the complex physical interactions during the development of air showers, a simple formula can describe the overall deflection of $\mu^{\pm}$ and accurately fit the deflection in simulated air showers, thereby validating the hypotheses about these effects in this study. Furthermore, we have obtained the relationship between model parameters and primary particle information for different experimental sites. This new model is highly successful and is promising to provide new insights for improving detector layout design and air shower reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Assessing Convergence Patterns Across Modern Nucleon-Nucleon Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BUQEYE model for correlated effective field theory (EFT) truncation errors assumes a regular pattern of dimensionless coefficients extracted from order-by-order observable calculations. This enables results from lower orders to inform statistical predictions for error estimates of omitted higher orders. We test the model for multiple chiral EFT ($\chi$EFT) nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials using a suite of six common NN scattering observables represented as functions of relative momentum and scattering angle. First, we flag irregularity in the convergence patterns of potentials with so-called "soft" regulator scales, namely that the sizes of the coefficients in the observables' expansions are mismatched between the even and odd orders. Second, we test the BUQEYE model's assumption of Gaussian process (GP) stationarity against the data and find that the GP's correlation structure as encoded in its length scale is nonstationary: The GP length scale in the angular dimension $\ell_{\theta}$ is approximately inversely proportional to the relative momentum of the scattering process. After we remediate this issue by allowing $\ell_{\theta}$ to vary with momentum, diagnostics show significant improvement, validating the application of the BUQEYE model after this modification. Third, we find that good performance of the BUQEYE model relies on properly choosing the $\chi$EFT breakdown scale $\Lambda_{b}$. With $m_{\text{eff}}$ held fixed at the physical pion mass we find $\Lambda_{b}=600$--$750$ MeV for various N$^{3}$LO interactions. Statistically consistent distributions for $\Lambda_{b}$ across orders are only found for the SMS potential at a regulator scale of 450 or 500 MeV. All our results can be reproduced using a publicly available Jupyter notebook, which can be straightforwardly modified to analyze other $\chi$EFT NN potentials.</description>

      <title>Calculating the power spectrum in stochastic inflation by Monte Carlo simulation and least squares curve fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic-$\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is widely used to study inflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the background dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of primordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$ from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$, the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation models, which show the usefulness of our method.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Axion-Like Particles on Late Stellar Evolution From Intermediate-Mass Stars to core-collapse Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Stars with masses ranging from 3 to 11 M_\odot exhibit multiple evolutionary paths. Less massive stars in this range conclude their evolution as carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. However, those that achieve carbon ignition before the pressure by degenerate electron halts the core contraction may either form massive CONe/ONe white dwarfs, or undergo an electron-capture supernova, or photo-disintegrate neon and proceed with further thermonuclear burning, ultimately leading to the formation of a gravitationally unstable iron core. Aims. An evaluation of the impact of the energy loss caused by the production of axion-like-particles (ALPs) on evolution and final destiny of these stars is the main objective of this paper. Methods. We compute various sets of stellar models, all with solar initial composition, varying the strengths of the ALP coupling with photons and electrons. Results. As a consequence of an ALP thermal production, the critical masses for off-center C and Ne ignitions are both shifted upward. When the current bounds for the ALP coupling strengths are assumed, the maximum mass for CO WD progenitors is about 1.1 M_\odot heavier than that obtained without the ALP energy loss, while the minimum mass for a core collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitor is 0.7 M_\odot higher. Conclusions. Current constraints from observed Type II-P supernova light curves and pre-explosive luminosity do not exclude an ALP production within the current bounds. However, the maximum age of CCSN progenitors, as deduced from the star formation rate of the parent stellar population, would require a smaller minimum mass. This discrepancy can be explained by assuming a moderate extra mixing (as due to core overshooting or rotational induced mixing) above the fully convective core that develops during the main sequence.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurements of the Electroweak Mixing Angle in the Region of the Z pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the current status and techniques used in precision measurements of the effective leptonic weak mixing angle $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ (a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model (SM)) in the region of the Z pole with emphasis on hadron colliders. We also build on these techniques to extract the most precise single measurement to date of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from a new analysis of the published forward-backward asymmetry ($A_{\rm FB}$) in Drell-Yan dielpton production in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV measured by the CMS collaboration at the large hadron collider. The uncertainty in $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ published by CMS is dominated by uncertainties in Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), which are reduced by PDF profiling using the dilepton mass dependence of $A_{\rm FB}$. Our new extraction of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from the CMS values of $A_{\rm FB}$ includes profiling with additional new CMS measurements of the $W$-boson decay lepton asymmetry, and W/Z cross section ratio at 13 TeV. We obtain the most precise single measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ to date of 0.23153$\pm$0.00023, which is in excellent agreement with the SM prediction of 0.23161$\pm$0.00004. We also discuss outlook for future measurements at the LHC including more precise measurements of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$, a measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ for b-quarks in the initial state, and a measurement of the running of $\sin^2\theta^{\overline{\rm MS}}(\mu)$ up to 3 TeV.</description>

      <title>Timing Mass of the Local Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classic model of the Local Group (LG) is that of two dominant constituents, the Milky Way and M31, first separating and then detaching from the Hubble flow, leading to a nearly radial approaching orbit. This simple model has been confronted by new measurements of the 3D M31 kinematics, by cosmological simulations, and by theoretical understanding of the impact of massive substructures such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. This article explores the consequences of new observations and theory on the determination of the mass and dynamics of the LG. The M31 tangential velocity measurement and contribution from the cosmological constant both increase the implied timing mass of the LG to be $\sim 5 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. Timing mass estimates for the LG tend to be larger than the sum of the Milky Way and M31 halo masses, and larger than independent LG mass estimators. Precision future kinematics have the potential to explore the origin of this difference, shed light on dark matter in the LG, the origin of its angular momentum, and possibly even local values of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Searching non-standard interactions with atmospheric neutrinos at ESSnuSB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutrinos provide a unique avenue to study neutrino interactions in matter. In this work, the prospects of constraining non-standard neutrino interactions with atmospheric neutrino oscillations are investigated for the proposed ESSnuSB far detector. By analyzing atmospheric neutrino samples equivalent to 5.4 Mt$\cdot$year exposure, it is found that ESSnuSB could be able to set the upper bounds $|\epsilon_{e\mu}^m| &lt; 0.053, |\epsilon_{e\tau}^m| &lt; 0.057, |\epsilon_{\mu\tau}^m| &lt; 0.021, \epsilon_{ee}^m - \epsilon_{\mu\mu}^m &lt; 0.075$ and $|\epsilon_{\tau\tau}^m - \epsilon_{\mu\mu}^m| &lt; 0.031$ at $90\%$ CL, when the results are minimized for $\phi_{e\mu}^m, \phi_{e\tau}^m$ and $\phi_{\mu\tau}^m$ and normal ordering is assumed for neutrino masses. It is also shown that the presence of non-standard interactions could affect the sensitivities to neutrino mass ordering and $\theta_{23}^{}$ octant in comparison to the standard interaction scheme. The results of this work highlight the complementarity between atmospheric and accelerator neutrino programs in ESSnuSB.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation for General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics in Dynamic Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel spectral solver for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics on dynamical spacetimes. By combining a high order discontinuous spectral method on mapped Chebyshev Fourier grids, our scheme attains exponential convergence. Implemented within a unified BSSN Valencia framework, the code evolves both Einstein and MHD fields self consistently, enabling fully coupled simulations of black hole accretion jet systems. We demonstrate spectral accuracy and entropy stability through convergence tests, and validate physical fidelity via equatorial embedding diagrams of horizon crossing GRMHD variables in Kerr Schild coordinates. Three dimensional scatter visualizations further highlight the solver's capability to capture complex magnetized plasma structures around rotating black holes. This approach paves the way for high order, low dissipation GRMHD simulations on exascale architectures, opening new avenues for precise modeling of strong field astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Two-flavored heavy mesons' nuclear bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the $B_c$- and $B_s$-nucleus bound state energies and coordinate space radial wave functions by solving the Klein-Gordon equation in momentum space. The attractive strong potentials for the $B_c$ and $B_s$ mesons in nuclei are calculated from the respective mass shifts of these mesons in nuclear matter using a local density approximation. This negative mass shift may be regarded as a signature of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in medium in an empirical sense, because the origin of the negative mass shift in the present study is not directly related to the chiral symmetry mechanism.</description>

      <title>Oblique parameters of BSM models with three CP-even neutral scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.01006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We express the oblique parameters $S$, $T$, $U$, $V$, $W$, and $X$ in terms of the corresponding mixing matrices in the framework of three BSM models with three CP-even neutral scalars. We consider three types of the extension of the scalar sector of the SM with non-standard (i) two real singlet scalars, (ii) one complex doublet and one real singlet scalar, and (iii) two complex doublets. We present the expressions such that one can use these when all the neutral CP-even scalars have VEV, or one of them does not have any VEV. The principal benifit of presenting the oblique parameters in this way is, the sole knowledge of the mixing matrices in the corresponding scalar sector is enough to extract the expression of the oblique parameter of that particular BSM model. This paper also presents some plots, for reference, showing the allowed region of the masses of the three CP-even neutral scalars and the three mixing angles of the three above-mentioned models.</description>

      <title>QCD with an Infrared Fixed Point and a Dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following previous work we further explore the possibility that the chirally broken phase of gauge theories admits an infrared fixed point interpretation. The slope of the $\beta$ function, $\beta'_*$, is found to vanish at the infrared fixed point which has several attractive features such as logarithmic running. We provide a more in-depth analysis of our previous result that the mass anomalous assumes $\gamma_* = 1$ at the fixed point. The results are found to be consistent with ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories. In a second part the specific properties of a dilaton, the (pseudo) Goldstone, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking are investigated. Dilaton soft theorems indicate that a soft dilaton mass can only originate from an operator of scaling dimension two. In the gauge theory this role is taken on by the $\bar qq$-operator. The QCD dilaton candidate, the $\sigma = f_0(500)$ meson is investigated. Singlet-octet mixing is found to be important. We briefly discuss the dilaton as a candidate for the Higgs boson, which relies on the ratio of dilaton to pion decay constant being close to unity. In QCD this is approximately satisfied but it is remains unclear if this is accidental or whether there is unknown reason behind it.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first sensitivity estimates to GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter, predicting Hyper-K can reach spin dependent cross sections as low as $\sigma_{p\chi}^{\mathrm{SD}}=2\times 10^{-35}\mathrm{cm}^2$ for DM masses below 2 GeV. This surpasses current solar limits and direct detection results. We additionally provide estimates for Super-K ORCA, and the IceCube-Upgrade, showing that these experiments could provide complimentary bounds to direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraints to the inert doublet model of dark matter with very high-energy gamma-rays observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the constraints on the Inert Doublet Model (IDM), a minimal extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics featuring a scalar dark matter candidate, using data from recent and future gamma-ray observatories. The relevance of the model for indirect searches of dark matter stems from two key features: first, in the high-mass regime, IDM can achieve the correct dark matter relic abundance for masses between approximately 500 GeV and 25 TeV, aligning perfectly with the energy sensitivity of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Second, this regime is dominated by co-annihilation processes, which elevate the thermal-relic velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section to the range of 0.5 $-$ 1.0$\times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, thereby enhancing the potential gamma-ray signal from dark matter annihilation. Analyzing recent H.E.S.S. observations of the Galactic Center region, we find that dark matter particle masses within the 1 to 8 TeV range are excluded by current data. Furthermore, we project that the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will comprehensively probe the remaining viable parameter space of the IDM. Our findings are further examined in the context of the most recent theoretical constraints, collider searches, and direct detection results from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Simulation of Asymmetry Generation in Fermion-Bubble Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the out-of-equilibrium dynamics during an early-universe first-order phase transition, we perform real-time simulations of fermion-bubble scattering in $1+1$ dimensions. This nonequilibrium process can generate a charge-conjugation $\mathsf{C}$ asymmetry outside the bubble wall, induced by the complex fermion mass profile. The resulting $\mathsf{C}$ asymmetry is the 1+1-dimensional analog of the $\mathsf{CP}$ asymmetry in 3+1 dimensions, a key ingredient in baryon asymmetry generation at the electroweak scale. Using tensor network methods, we track the real-time evolution of the $\mathsf{C}$ asymmetry in the charge density as the fermion interacts with the bubble wall, a regime inaccessible to analytic calculations. We further introduce two observables to quantify the asymmetry in the asymptotic region where reflected particles are well separated from the scattering point: one based on the net charge outside the bubble wall, and the other on the spatial displacement between the reflected particle and antiparticle wavepackets. Our study represents a first step toward nonperturbative, real-time computations of $\mathsf{CP}$ asymmetry in 3+1 dimensions for electroweak baryogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by two news states $h_1(1911)$ and $X(2300)$ observed by BESIII, we have investigated the mass spectrum and the strong decay properties of the strangeonium mesons within the modified Godfrey-Isgur model by considering the screening effects. We have determined the free parameters using the masses and widths of the well established $s\bar{s}$ states $\phi(1020)$, $\phi(1680)$, $h_1(1415)$, $f_2^\prime(1525)$, and $\phi_3(1850)$. According to our results, $h_1(1911)$ and $X(2300)$ could be well explained as states $h_1(2^1P_1)$ and $h_1(3^1P_1)$ $s\bar{s}$ states, respectively. Meanwhile, the possible assignments of $X(2000)$, $\eta_2(1870)$, and $\phi(2170)$ as $3^3S_1$, $1^1D_2$, and $2^3D_1$ are also discussed. Furthermore, the masses and widths of the $2S$, $3S$, $1P$, $2P$, $3P$, $1D$, and $2D$ $s\bar{s}$ states are also given and compared with various theoretical predictions, which is helpful for the observations and confirmations of these states in future.</description>

      <title>RG-stable parameter relations of a scalar field theory in absence of a symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11011v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of tree-level relations among the parameters of a quantum field theory with respect to renormalization group (RG) running is typically explained by the existence of a symmetry. We examine a toy model of a quantum field theory of two real scalars in which a tree-level relation among the squared-mass parameters of the scalar potential appears to be RG-stable without the presence of an appropriate underlying symmetry. The stability of this relation with respect to renormalization group running can be explained by complexifying the original scalar field theory. It is then possible to exhibit a symmetry that guarantees the relations of relevant beta functions of squared-mass parameters of the complexified theory. Among these relations, we can identify equations that are algebraically identical to the corresponding equations that guarantee the stability of the relations among the squared-mass parameters of the original real scalar field theory where the symmetry of the complexified theory is no longer present.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Experimental Constraints on $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ Multi-Component Dark Matter Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A complete assessment of any dark matter model requires confronting its low-energy phenomenology with its high-scale theoretical viability. We undertake such a dual analysis for a class of two-component scalar dark matter models stabilized by $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ symmetries, specifically the $\mathbb{Z}_4$, $\mathbb{Z}_6(23)$, and $\mathbb{Z}_6(13)$ frameworks. Each model is tested against the latest observational data, including the Planck relic abundance and stringent direct detection limits from the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment. Simultaneously, we evaluate their theoretical integrity up to the GUT and Planck scales by enforcing vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity with one-loop Renormalization Group Equations. This combined approach reveals a rich and varied landscape of possibilities. We demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ model offers a broadly viable parameter space sustained by efficient semi-annihilation. In stark contrast, the $\mathbb{Z}_6(13)$ scenario is shown to be highly fine-tuned, with solutions confined to the Higgs resonance. Our most significant finding concerns the $\mathbb{Z}_6(23)$ model: we show that an apparent conflict between experimental data and high-scale consistency is resolved when the model is viewed as an effective field theory, yielding a concrete prediction for new physics at or below the $10^6$ GeV scale. This work provides a definitive guide to the viability of these $\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$ scenarios and serves as a compelling demonstration of how high-energy consistency checks can yield crucial insights into the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Super heavy dark matter origin of the PeV neutrino event: KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observation of the ultrahigh-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A by the KM3NeT experiment offers a compelling avenue to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this paper, we explore a simplest possibility that this event originates from the decay of a super-heavy dark matter (SHDM). We consider a minimal scenario where the SHDM decays to neutrino and SM Higgs. We derive constraints on the DM lifetime as a function of DM mass, ensuring consistency with IceCube, Auger upper limits, and the observed KM3-230213A event, along with the gamma-ray constraints. We find that KM3-230213A gives stringent constraint on the DM mass ranging from $1.5\times10^8$ GeV to $5.2\times10^9$ GeV with lifetime in the range: $1.42\times10^{30}$ s to $5.4\times10^{29}$ s. Remarkably, in our SHDM scenario, the apparent tension between the KM3NeT observation and the nonobservation of this event by IceCube and Auger can be reduced to below $1.2\sigma$. Our results are applicable to any neutrinophilic SHDM models while evading gamma-ray constraints.</description>

Abstract: We study the semileptonic decays of $\Xi^{(')}_{b}\rightarrow\Xi^{(')}_{c}{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ in all lepton channels. To do this, we first obtain the form factors defining these decay modes within the framework of QCD sum rules. Then, using the transferred momentum squared-dependent form factors, we compute the decay widths and branching fractions for all lepton channels and compare the results of our calculations with those obtained from other theoretical methods. We also estimate the branching ratios and the ratio of branching fractions at different leptonic channels to provide useful information for future experiments may be planned at different Colliders. Such comparison will provide valuable information about the consistency/inconsistency of the SM theory predictions with experimental data in weak semileptonic single heavy baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Properties of solutions by the Schwinger-Dyson equation at finite temperature and density : A four-fermion interaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the properties of the solutions obtained by the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE).
  As a simple example, we consider a two-dimensional model including four-fermion interaction. It is shown that when this model is solved by an iterative method using the SDE at finite density, multiple solutions depending on the initial input values are obtained.
  We investigate the reasons for this situation by examining the convergence of the solutions obtained by iterative method. We also consider the solution of the SDE using alternative methods. Furthermore, we compare these results with analytical solutions at zero temperature and discuss the relation with the behavior of the effective potential. We extend these considerations to finite temperatures.
  Based on these analyses, we consider ways to avoid spurious solutions that appear in the iterative method.</description>

      <title>Two-loop Feynman integrals for leading colour $t\bar{t}W$ production at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute a complete set of the two-loop Feynman integrals that are required for the next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to on-shell top-pair production in association with a $W$ boson at hadron colliders in the leading colour approximation. These Feynman integrals also contribute to Higgs or $Z$-boson production in association with a top pair. We employ the method of differential equations (DEs), facilitated by the use of finite field methods to handle the algebraic complexity stemming from the seven-scale kinematics. The presence of the top quark in the virtual propagators, in addition to the mass of the external $W$ boson, gives rise to nested square roots and three elliptic curves. We obtain DEs that depend at most quadratically on the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$ for sectors where these analytic structures appear, and are $\epsilon$-factorised otherwise. We express the DEs in terms of a minimal set of differential one-forms, separating the logarithmic ones. We solve the DEs numerically in the physical kinematic region, with the method of generalised power series expansions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that geometric scaling conjectured and observed at the ISR more than 50 years ago, still holds at the LHC. We discuss regularities of the dip-bump structures of the differential elastic cross sections, emphasizing the fact that the ratio of bump to dip positions is constant from the ISR to the LHC. Applying crossing and analyticity we identify imaginary and real parts of the scattering amplitude and compute the $\rho$ parameter and the ratio of bump to dip values of the differential $pp$ cross sections. We also discuss the energy dependence of the total elastic cross section and the violation of geometrical scaling outside the dip-bump region at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Calculations of Di-Hadron Production via Two-Photon Processes in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00996v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon processes in relativistic heavy-ion collisions have emerged as a critical probe of quantum electrodynamics in ultra-intense electromagnetic fields, with recent focus extending beyond dileptons to hadronic final states. At present, quantitative studies of di-hadron production via two-photon interactions remain scarce. In this work, we employ the Equivalent Photon Approximation and the two-photon fusion measurements from \(e^{+}e^{-}\) collisions to obtain differential cross-section predictions for \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), \(K^{+}K^{-}\), and \(p\bar{p}\) pairs produced in ultra-peripheral \(\mathrm{Au{+}Au}\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200\,\text{GeV}\) within the STAR acceptance, as well as in \(\mathrm{Pb{+}Pb}\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.36\,\text{TeV}\) within typical LHC acceptance. The calculations deliver the unified baseline for light-meson and baryon pairs in this environment, supplying benchmarks for upcoming STAR and LHC measurements and guiding future systematic investigations of hadronic two-photon processes at RHIC and LHC facilities.</description>

      <title>Unbinned inclusive cross-section measurements with machine-learned systematic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel methodology for addressing systematic uncertainties in unbinned inclusive cross-section measurements and related collider-based inference problems. Our approach incorporates known analytic dependencies on parameters of interest, including signal strengths and nuisance parameters. When these dependencies are unknown, as is frequently the case for systematic uncertainties, dedicated neural network parametrizations provide an approximation that is trained on simulated data. The resulting machine-learned surrogate captures the complete parameter dependence of the likelihood ratio, providing a near-optimal test statistic. As a case study, we perform a first-principles inclusive cross-section measurement of $\textrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau$ in the single-lepton channel, utilizing simulated data from the FAIR Universe Higgs Uncertainty Challenge. Results in Asimov data, from large-scale toy studies, and using the Fisher information demonstrate significant improvements over traditional binned methods. Our computer code ``Guaranteed Optimal Log-Likelihood-based Unbinned Method'' (GOLLUM) for machine-learning and inference is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Hadroproduction data support tetraquark hypothesis for $\chi_{c1} (3872)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the recently proposed tetraquark hypothesis for the nature of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ results in a formalism for inclusive production rates that has no unknown parameters. We employ this formalism to compute hadroproduction rates of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ at the Large Hadron Collider, which agree with measured prompt and nonprompt cross sections. Thus we find that the tetraquark hypothesis for $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is well supported by hadroproduction data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various approximate symmetries exist in nature. For example, the flavor $SU(4)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange/charm$ quarks is severely broken, the flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange$ quarks is moderately broken, and the isospin $SU(2)$ symmetry involving the $up/down$ quarks is slightly broken. These broken symmetries are primarily governed by the strong interaction, making them an ideal platform for investigating the general behavior of approximate symmetries. To explore the application of the flavor $SU(4)$ group to ground-state baryons, we systematically calculate the transition matrices associated with various flavor $SU(4)$ representations as well as the matrices that describe their connections. These matrices are then employed to analyze the mass spectrum of ground-state baryons. Our results indicate that these states can be described as mixtures of various flavor representations, such as $\Sigma_c/\Xi_c^\prime/\Omega_c \sim \mathbf{20_M} \oplus \mathbf{20_S}\oplus \mathbf{\bar{4}_A}~[SU(4)]$, $\Xi_c/\Xi_c^\prime \sim \mathbf{\bar 3_A} \oplus \mathbf{6_S}~[SU(3)]$, $\Lambda^0/\Sigma^0 \sim \mathbf{1_A} \oplus \mathbf{3_S}~[SU(2)]$, where the subscripts $\mathbf{S}$, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{M}$ denote the symmetric, antisymmetric, and mixed flavor wave functions, respectively. Our results also indicate that the flavor symmetries, as they break, necessitate the mixing of these flavor representations according to specific rules. For example, the approximate $SU(3)$ flavor decuplet, with one of its flavor components slightly differing from the other two, deviates from the exact $SU(3)$ flavor decuplet, and this deviation is characterized by the exact $SU(3)$ flavor octet.</description>

      <title>Off forward non-SCHC contributions to exclusive vector quarkonium production from the "spin dependent BFKL Pomeron"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel contribution to off-forward, exclusive vector quarkonium production, $\gamma^{(*)}+p \to V+p$, at high energy is derived which corresponds to a $t$-channel exchange of a BFKL hard Pomeron, with a helicity flip of the proton. This ``spin-dependent BFKL Pomeron" is required in a consistent expansion in powers of the momentum transfer $ t \approx -\Delta_\perp^2$ beyond first order. The spin-dependent Pomeron violates $s$-channel helicity conservation (SCHC) at ${\cal O}(\Delta_\perp^2)$, and beyond. Expanding to leading twist only, it corresponds to GPD $E_g(x,t)$ for vanishing skewness. We derive explicit expressions for the eikonal BFKL amplitudes, to all orders in dipole size times momentum transfer, for all helicity configurations of the particles in the initial and final states. We also provide numerical estimates of the helicity flip two gluon exchange amplitude at moderate $x$ from a light-cone quark model of the proton. The spin dependent BFKL Pomeron could, in principle, be discovered via double spin asymmetries in $e+p \to e+p+J/\psi$ with transversely polarized proton and longitudinally polarized electron in the initial state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass and full width of the heavy scalar molecule $\mathcal{M}$ composed of the mesons $B_{c}^{+}$ and $B_{c}^{-}$ are calculated in the QCD sum rule framework. To find its mass and current coupling, we apply the two-point sum rule method. The width of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M} =B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$ is evaluated by taking into account its dissociation to $\eta_c\eta_{b}, J/\psi \Upsilon$, and $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-} $ mesons. Decays into $D$ and $B$ meson pairs with appropriate charges and quantum numbers triggered by $\overline{b}b$ and $\overline{c}c$ annihilations to light quark-antiquarks are also included in the analyses. Because the partial widths of $\mathcal{M}$ molecule's decay channels depend on the strong couplings at $\mathcal{M}$-meson-meson vertices, we estimate them by invoking tools of the three-point sum rule method. Our predictions $m=(12725 \pm 85)~\mathrm{ MeV}$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{\ M}]=(155 \pm 23)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ for the parameters of the molecule $\mathcal{\ M}$ provide useful information for experimental studies of numerous heavy resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of weak transition form factors and decay observables of the $B_s$ meson in transitions to pseudoscalar ($P$) and vector ($V$) mesons. The $B_s \to P(V)$ form factors are calculated using the self-consistent covariant light-front quark model, with a model-independent $z$-series expansion calibrated to lattice QCD and phenomenological inputs for quark masses and $\beta$ parameters. This enables reliable $q^2$-resolved predictions across the full kinematic range. Based on these form factors, we predict branching ratios and angular observables, including forward-backward asymmetries, polarization fractions, and leptonic convexity parameters for semileptonic decays. Nonleptonic two-body decay rates for $B_s \to PP$ and $B_s \to PV$ modes are also computed within the standard factorization framework using the same dynamical input. Comparisons with results from lattice QCD, light-cone sum rules, and other approaches are presented, highlighting both theoretical consistency and persistent tensions with experiment.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of the $\Omega^-$ baryon from gravitational form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the mechanical properties of the $\Omega^-$ baryon by analyzing its gravitational form factors (GFFs) within the framework of QCD sum rules. These form factors encode rich information about the internal structure of hadrons and offer deep insights into the dynamics that govern their stability. The spin-3/2 nature of the $\Omega^-$ baryon manifests in its gravitational form factors as intricate multipole structures, which encapsulate higher-order deformations and demonstrate the influence of intrinsic spin on internal dynamics. We extract the GFFs of the $\Omega^-$ baryon and apply their specific multipole combinations, gravitational multipole form factors (GMFFs), to quantify key mechanical observables-including energy density, angular momentum, pressure and shear force distributions, mass and mechanical radii, and D-terms-associated with different multipole orders. Notably, this work provides the first determination of several of these observables, such as the mechanical radii and the quadrupole contributions to the pressure and shear force distributions. Our analysis shows that the quadrupole contributions to the mechanical properties are generally subdominant compared to those from the monopole component. We further investigate the mechanical stability of the $\Omega^-$ through a multipole analysis of its internal force distributions. These results enhance our understanding of the mechanical structure of spin-3/2 hadrons and provide useful benchmarks for future theoretical and lattice QCD studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a neural network-based quasi-particle model to separate the contributions of chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic gluons. Using dual residual networks, we extract temperature-dependent masses from SU(3) lattice thermodynamic data of pressure and trace anomaly. After incorporating physics regularizations, the trained models reproduce lattice results with high accuracy over $T/T_c \in [1,10]$, capturing both the crossover behavior near $T_c$ and linear scaling at high temperatures. The extracted masses exhibit a physically reasonable behavior: they decrease sharply around $T_c$ and increase linearly thereafter. We find significant differences between thermal and screening masses near $T_c$, reflecting non-perturbative dynamics, while they converge at $T \gtrsim 2T_c$.</description>

      <title>Standard Model Mass Spectrum and Interactions In The Holomorphic Unified Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified, ultraviolet-finite framework for the full Standard Model particle mass spectrum based on the Holomorphic Unified Field Theory augmented by nonlocal entire-function regulators. Starting from a single holomorphic action on the complexified spacetime manifold $M^4_{\mathbb{C}}$, with a Hermitian metric unifying gravity, gauge and matter sectors, we embed exponential regulator insertions to render all loop integrals finite without breaking gauge or diffeomorphism invariance. After spontaneous breaking of the electroweak and grand-unified symmetries, analytic expressions for the charged-lepton, quark and neutrino mass matrices are derived in terms of holomorphic Yukawa textures and regulator form factors. A minimal Froggatt--Nielsen flavon sector fixes all $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients in terms of two continuous inputs. Regulator-suppressed one- and two-loop renormalization group evolution then yields predictions for all fermion masses, CKM and PMNS mixing angles, $W$ and $Z$ boson masses, and the Higgs boson mass and self-couplings. Finally, we show that gauge-coupling unification, three chiral families, hypercharge quantization and the shape of the Higgs potential are genuine predictions of the holomorphic nonlocal framework.</description>

      <title>Fermion mass ratios from the exceptional Jordan algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the "three generations" problem and the pattern of charged-fermion masses from the vantage of octonionic and Clifford algebra structures. Working with the exceptional Jordan algebra J3(OC) (right-handed flavor) and the symmetric cube of SU(3) (left-handed charge frame), we show that a single minimal ladder in the symmetric cube, together with the Dynkin Z2 swap (the A2 diagram flip), leads to closed-form expressions for the square-root mass ratios of all three charged families. The universal Jordan spectrum (q - delta, q, q + delta) with a theoretically derived delta squared = 3/8 fixes the endpoint contrasts; fixed Clebsch factors (2, 1, 1) ensure rung cancellation ("edge universality") so that adjacent ratios depend only on which edge is taken. The down ladder determines one step, its Dynkin reflection gives the lepton ladder, and choosing the other outward leg from the middle yields the up sector.
  From the same inputs we obtain compact CKM "root-sum rules": with one 1-2 phase and a mild 2-3 cross-family normalization, the framework reproduces the Cabibbo angle and Vcb and provides leading predictions for Vub and Vtd/Vts. We perform apples-to-apples phenomenology (common scheme/scale) and find consistency with current determinations within quoted uncertainties. Conceptually, rank-1 idempotents (points of the octonionic projective plane), fixed symmetric-cube Clebsches, and the Dynkin swap together account for why electric charge is generation-blind while masses follow the observed hierarchies, and they furnish clear, falsifiable mass-ratio relations beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning (ML) techniques to distinguish between isotropic and jet-like event topologies in heavy-ion collisions via the spherocity observable. State-of-the-art ML algorithms, optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, are employed to predict both traditional transverse spherocity $S_{0}$ and unweighted transverse spherocity $S_{0}^{p_{\rm T}=1}$ directly from raw event data. Moreover, the results from this study demonstrated that our approach remains largely model-independent, underscoring its potential applicability in future experimental heavy-ion physics analyses.</description>

      <title>On the Lagrangian and fermion mass of the unified $SU(2) \otimes SU(4)$ gauge field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Standard Model of elementary particles the fermions are assumed to be intrinsically massless. Here we propose a new theoretical idea of fermion mass generation (other than by the Higgs mechanism) through the coupling with the vector gauge fields of the unified $SU(2) \otimes SU(4)$ gauge symmetry, especially with the $Z$ boson of the weak interaction that affects all elementary fermions. The resulting small masses are suggested to be proportional to the self-energy of the $Z$ field as described by a Yukawa potential. Thereby the electrically neutral neutrino just gets a tiny mass through its $Z$-field coupling. In contrast, the electrically charged electron and quarks can become more massive by the inertia induced through the Coulomb energy of the electrostatic fields surrounding them in their rest frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on available experimental results on $\chi _{cJ}(J=0,1,2)$ decays, we investigate the $\chi_{cJ}\to PP$, $VV$, $PV$, and $PT$ decays by using SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking approach, where $P$, $V$, and $T$ denote light pseudoscalar, vector, and tensor mesons, respectively. With the decay amplitude relations determined by SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking, we present the branching ratios for all $\chi_{cJ}\to PP$ and $\chi_{cJ}\to VV$ modes, including ones without experimental data. While theoretical considerations strongly suppress or even forbid most $\chi_{cJ}\to PV$ and $PT$ decays, we also provide quantitative predictions constrained by existing experimental data. Our results are expected to be accessible in future experiments at BESIII and the planned Super Tau-Charm Facility.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency with De Sitter Spacetime in a New Approach to Gravitational Particle Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a claimed new mechanism for particle production and black hole evaporation through a spatially dependent temperature. This new temperature is comparable to the Hawking result near the black hole, but is very small far away, and therefore could be a small correction. Here we apply the proposed reasoning to the case of de Sitter space, finding that it over predicts the de Sitter temperature of a minimally coupled scalar by factor of $\approx 4.3$ and over predicts the particle production rate by a factor of $\approx 52$. For non-minimally coupled scalars, it has other various problems; it predicts a negative particle production for conformal, or nearly conformal, coupled scalars; it predicts unsuppressed productions of heavy scalars. This all demonstrates an inconsistency in the proposed formalism.</description>

      <title>Second-order spin hydrodynamics from Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism, we derive the second-order expression for the dissipative tensors in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, {\em viz.} rotational stress tensor ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$), boost heat vector ($q_\mu$), shear stress tensor ($\pi_{\mu\nu}$), and bulk viscous pressure ($\Pi$). The first two ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$ and $q_\mu$) emerge due to the inclusion of the antisymmetric part in the energy-momentum tensor, which, in turn, governs the conservation of spin angular momentum ($\Sigma^{\alpha\mu\nu}$). As a result, new thermodynamic forces, generated due to the antisymmetric part of $T_{\mu \nu}$, contain the spin chemical potential. In this work, we have also taken the spin density ($S^{\mu \nu}$) as an independent thermodynamic variable, in addition to the energy density and particle density, thereby resulting in two novel transport coefficients given by the correlation between spin density tensor and rotational stress tensor and vice versa. Additionally, the newly found terms in $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Pi$ are the artifacts of the new thermodynamic forces that arise due to the antisymmetric part of $T^{\mu \nu}$. Finally, we have derived the evolution equations for the aforesaid tensors: $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, $q_\mu$, $\pi_{\mu\nu}$, and $\Pi$.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.</description>

      <title>An introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin polarization and spin transport are common phenomena in many quantum systems. Relativistic spin hydrodynamics provides an effective low-energy framework to describe these processes in quantum many-body systems. The fundamental symmetry underlying relativistic spin hydrodynamics is angular momentum conservation, which naturally leads to inter-conversion between spin and orbital angular momenta. This inter-conversion is a key feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics, closely related to entropy production and introducing ambiguity in the construction of constitutive relations. In this article, we present a pedagogical introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics. We demonstrate how to derive the constitutive relations by applying local thermodynamic laws and explore several distinctive aspects of spin hydrodynamics. These include the pseudo-gauge ambiguity, the behavior of the system in the presence of strong vorticity, and the challenges of modeling the freeze-out of spin in heavy-ion collisions. We also outline some future prospects for spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02668v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extract the complex frequency of the lowest quasi-normal mode from the holographically computed entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. The system consists of a purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills N=4 plasma in homogeneous isotropization dynamics. The initial state is far-from-equilibrium, proceeding to thermalization over time. The system evolves to equilibrium entropy forming a stairway pattern. The analysis reveals that the rate of increase of the stairway is twice the decay rate of the lowest quasi-normal mode. This leads us to propose a model explaining how this information is encoded in entropy. The model is extended to consider finite temperature, R-charge density and scalar condensate of the medium, disclosing an additional feature. The system's main dissipation channel may shift to one driven by the scalar condensate, depending on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Potential search for direct slepton pair production in $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV at CEPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is designed to operate at 240 GeV for its first decade, with a subsequent upgrade to a center-of-mass energy of 360 GeV (CEPC@360GeV). Beyond enabling high-precision measurements of the Standard Model (SM), CEPC@360GeV holds significant potential for searches beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, serving as a valuable complement to hadron colliders. This paper presents a sensitivity study on the direct pair production of staus and smuons at CEPC with $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV, conducted via full Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Under the assumptions of integrated luminosity 1.0 ab^{-1} and a flat 5% systematic uncertainty, CEPC@360GeV could potentially discover the combined production of left-handed and right-handed staus up to a mass of 170 GeV (if they exist), or up to 169 GeV for pure left-handed staus and 162 GeV for pure right-handed staus. For direct smuon production, the discovery potential reaches up to 178 GeV under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>DeepSSM: an emulator of gravitational wave spectra from sound waves during cosmological first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present DeepSSM, an open-source code powered by neural networks (NNs) to emulate gravitational wave (GW) spectra produced by sound waves during cosmological first-order phase transitions in the radiation-dominated era. The training data is obtained from an enhanced version of the Sound Shell Model (SSM), which accounts for the effects of cosmic expansion and yields more accurate spectra in the infrared regime. The emulator enables instantaneous predictions of GW spectra given the phase transition parameters, while achieving agreement with the enhanced SSM model within 10\% accuracy in the worst-case scenarios. The emulator is highly computationally efficient and fully differentiable, making it particularly suitable for direct Bayesian inference on phase transition parameters without relying on empirical templates, such as broken power-law models. We demonstrate this capability by successfully reconstructing phase transition parameters and their degeneracies from mock LISA observations using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. The code is available at: https://github.com/ctian282/DeepSSM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study linear scalar perturbations in single-field models of inflation featuring a non-attractor phase. These models lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum that may result in the formation of primordial black holes. We develop a transfer-matrix formalism, analogous to the S-matrix program in quantum-field theory, that maps perturbations throughout the transitory phase. At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which power-law damping switches to exponential damping. At scales larger than the peak, we demonstrate that a dip appears in the power spectrum if and only if the inflaton's velocity does not flip sign. We show that the amplitude at the dip always scales as the inverse square-rooted amplitude of the peak, and comment on the physical consequences of this universal relationship. We also test the robustness of our results with a few toy models and interpret them with an intuitive mechanical analogy.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Massive Boson Stars using Gravitational Waves from Fundamental Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boson Stars are macroscopic self-gravitating configurations made of complex scalar fields. These exotic compact objects would manifest as dark Boson stars and, in the absence of electromagnetic signatures, could mimic properties of compact stars in the gravitational wave spectrum. In a recent study, using the simplest potential for massive Boson stars, we demonstrated that fundamental non-radial oscillations ($f$-modes) obey scaling relations that allow them to be distinguished from neutron stars and black holes. In this work, we provide analytical fits for these scaling relations, valid for the dark matter parameter space compatible with current astrophysical and cosmological data that can be directly incorporated into future studies of massive Boson stars in the strong coupling regime, avoiding the need for numerical calculations. We also provide analytical fits for empirical and universal relations, for gravitational wave asteroseismology, which can be used to infer microscopic dark matter properties following a successful detection. Further, we investigate the possibility of the detection of $f$-modes and the dark matter parameter space that can be probed with current and future gravitational wave detectors across multiple frequency bands.</description>

Abstract: The Dark Matter (DM) distribution in dwarf galaxies provides crucial insights into both structure formation and the particle nature of DM. GraphNPE (Graph Neural Posterior Estimator), first introduced in Nguyen et al. (2023), is a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines graph neural networks and normalizing flows to infer the DM density profile from line-of-sight stellar velocities. Here, we apply GraphNPE to satellite dwarf galaxies in the FIRE-2 Latte simulation suite of Milky Way-mass halos, testing it against both Cold and Self-Interacting DM scenarios. Our method demonstrates superior precision compared to conventional Jeans-based approaches, recovering DM density profiles to within the 95% confidence level even in systems with as few as 30 tracers. Moreover, we present the first evaluation of mass modeling methods in constraining two key parameters from realistic simulations: the peak circular velocity, $V_\mathrm{max}$, and the peak virial mass, $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$. Using only line-of-sight velocities, GraphNPE can reliably recover both $V_\mathrm{max}$ and $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$ within our quoted uncertainties, including those experiencing tidal effects ($\gtrsim$ 63% of systems are recovered with our 68% confidence intervals and $\gtrsim$ 92% within our 95% confidence intervals). The method achieves 10-20% accuracy in $V_\mathrm{max}$ recovery, while $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$ is recovered to 0.1-0.4 dex accuracy. This work establishes GraphNPE as a robust tool for inferring DM density profiles in dwarf galaxies, offering promising avenues for constraining DM models. The framework's potential extends beyond this study, as it can be adapted to non-spherical and disequilibrium models, showcasing the broader utility of simulation-based inference and graph-based learning in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIb. Eigenmodes and correlation matrices of spin-2 perturbations in orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the eigenmodes of the spin-2 Laplacian in orientable Euclidean manifolds and their implications for the tensor-induced part of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies. We provide analytic expressions for the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes and of spherical harmonic coefficients. We demonstrate that non-trivial spatial topology alters the statistical properties of CMB tensor anisotropies, inducing correlations between harmonic coefficients of differing $\ell$ and $m$ and across every possible pair of temperature and $E$- and $B$-modes of polarization. This includes normally forbidden $TB$ and $EB$ correlations. We compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the pure tensor-induced CMB fluctuations in the usual infinite covering space and those in each of the non-trivial manifolds under consideration, varying both the size of the manifolds and the location of the observer. We find that the amount of information about the topology of the Universe contained in tensor-induced anisotropies does not saturate as fast as its scalar counterpart; indeed, the KL divergence continues to grow with the inclusion of higher multipoles up to the largest $\ell$ we have computed. Our results suggest that CMB polarization measurements from upcoming experiments can provide new avenues for detecting signatures of cosmic topology, motivating a full analysis where scalar and tensor perturbations are combined and noise is included.</description>

      <title>Redshift-space galaxy bispectrum in presence of massive neutrinos: A multipole expansion approach for Euclid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive neutrinos imprint distinctive signatures on the evolution of cosmic structures, notably suppressing small-scale clustering. We investigate the impact of massive neutrinos on the galaxy bispectrum in redshift-space, adopting a spherical harmonic multipole decomposition $B_L^m(k_1, \mu, t)$, that captures the full angular dependence. We develop an analytical and numerical framework incorporating neutrino-corrected perturbation theory kernels and redshift-space distortions. Our results demonstrate that the linear triangle configurations are particularly sensitive to massive neutrinos, with deviations reaching up to $\sim 2\%$ for a total mass $\sum m_\nu = 0.12\,\mathrm{eV}$. To assess detection prospects in galaxy surveys like \textit{Euclid}, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individual multipoles, including the effects of Finger-of-God damping and shot noise. The neutrino-induced signatures in $B_0^0$ and $B_2^0$ are found to be detectable with SNR $\gtrsim 5$ across a range of configurations, even after accounting for small-scale suppression. Higher-order multipoles such as $B_2^1$ and $B_2^2$ are moderately sensitive, with SNR $\gtrsim$ ($2-3$) in squeezed limits, while hexadecapole moments are more suppressed but still exhibit measurable signals at high $k_1$. Additionally, the SNR generally increases with wave number $k_1$, particularly for squeezed and stretched triangles, suggesting that access to smaller scales significantly enhances detection prospects. Our study highlights the potential of the redshift-space bispectrum multipoles as sensitive probes of massive neutrinos, complementing traditional power spectrum analyses, and underscores the importance of angular information and higher-order statistics for galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>A frequentist view on the two-body decaying dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) has emerged as an interesting framework to extend the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter (LCDM) model, as many particle physics models predict that dark matter may not be stable over cosmic time and can impact structure formation. In particular, a model in which DDM decays at a rate $\Gamma$ and imprints a velocity kick $v$ onto its decay products leads to a low amplitude of fluctuations, as quantified by the parameter $S_8$, in better agreement with that measured by some weak lensing surveys. Bayesian analyses have provided mixed conclusions regarding its viability, with a reconstructed clustering amplitude only slightly below the standard LCDM value. In this paper, we contrast previous results with a frequentist analysis of Planck and SDSS BAO data. We find that the $68\%$ confidence level region corresponds to a decay half-life of $6.93^{+7.88}_{-2.85}$Gyr and a velocity kick of $1250^{+1450}_{-1000}$~km/s. These $1\sigma$ constraints strongly differ from their Bayesian counterparts, indicating the presence of volume effect in the Bayesian analysis. Moreover, we find that under the DDM model, the frequentist analysis predicts lower values of $S_8$, in agreement with those found by KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 at $\sim 1.5\sigma$. We further show that previously derived KiDS-1000 constraints that appeared to exclude the best-fit model from Planck data were driven by priors on the primordial amplitude $A_s$ and spectral index $n_s$. When those are removed from the analysis, KiDS-1000 constraints on the DDM parameters are fully relaxed. It is only when applying Planck-informed priors on $A_s$ and $n_s$ to the KiDS-1000 analysis that one can constrain the model. We note that without such priors, the scales best measured by KiDS-1000 do not exactly match the $S_8$ kernel, so $S_8$ constraints should not be applied directly to a model in place of the full likelihood.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on small-scale primordial non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the large-scale primordial power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$, which are strictly constrained, the small-scale $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ remain less restricted. Considering local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the PBH and SIGW caused by large-amplitude small-scale primordial power spectrum. By analyzing current observational data from PTA, CMB, BAO, and abundance of PBH, and combining them with the SNR analysis of LISA, we rigorously constrain the parameter space of $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Furthermore, we examine the effects of different shapes of the primordial power spectrum on these constraints and comprehensively calculate the Bayes factors for various models. Our results indicate that SIGW generated by a monochromatic primordial power spectrum are more likely to dominate current PTA observations, with the corresponding constraint on the primordial non-Gaussian parameter being $-10.0&lt;f_{\mathrm{NL}}&lt;1.2$.</description>

Abstract: The "ringdown" radiation emitted by oscillating black holes has great scientific potential. By carefully predicting the frequencies and amplitudes of black hole quasinormal modes and comparing them with gravitational-wave data from compact binary mergers we can advance our understanding of the two-body problem in general relativity, verify the predictions of the theory in the regime of strong and dynamical gravitational fields, and search for physics beyond the Standard Model or new gravitational degrees of freedom. We summarize the state of the art in our understanding of black hole quasinormal modes in general relativity and modified gravity, their excitation, and the modeling of ringdown waveforms. We also review the status of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA ringdown observations, data analysis techniques, and the bright prospects of the field in the era of LISA and next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameter with cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.</description>
