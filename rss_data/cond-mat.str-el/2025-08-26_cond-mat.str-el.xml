      <title>Hunting for superconductivity in doped triangular lattice Kitaev magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by exploring correlated metals with frustrating bond-dependent exchange interactions, we study hole and electron doped Kitaev Mott insulators on the triangular lattice. Using homogeneous parton mean field theory, we find that the stripe antiferromagnetic (AFM) order for Kitaev coupling $K&gt;0$ and the ferromagnetic (FM) order for $K&lt;0$, both vanish at sufficiently large doping, beyond which we find regimes with chiral $d\pm i d$ singlet pairing and $p\pm ip$ triplet pairing respectively. Our tensor network computations however reveal that the superconducting correlations are strongly suppressed; while FM order stubbornly persists for the doped $K&lt;0$ model, the doped $K&gt;0$ model features emergent spin-charge modulated stripe orders. At higher hole doping for $K &gt; 0$, where AFM order is more strongly suppressed than for the electron doped case, incorporating a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbor attraction yields evidence for singlet $d$-wave superconductivity with Luttinger parameter $K_{\rm sc} &lt; 1$. Our work sets the stage for a broader exploration of doping effects in triangular lattice magnets such as NaRuO$_2$ which feature bond-dependent exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Unnecessary quantum criticality in $SU(3)$ kagome magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic/Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of critical quantum ground states that do not have a quasi-particle description. DSLs and related spin liquid phases often arise in strongly frustrated quantum spin systems, in which strong correlations and quantum fluctuations among constituent spins persist down to zero temperature. In this work, we analyze Mott insulating phases of $SU(3)$ fermions on a kagome lattice which may realize a DSL phase, described at low energies by $(2 + 1)d$ quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) with $N_f=6$ Dirac fermions. By analyzing the action of physical symmetries on the operators of the QED$_3$ theory, we conclude that the low energy DSL is a quantum critical point that can be accessed by tuning a single microscopic parameter. Aided by the emergent symmetry and anomalies of the low energy effective theory, we conjecture and present supporting arguments that the $SU(3)$ Kagome magnet DSL is an unnecessary quantum critical point, lying completely within a single phase.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional unfrustrated and frustrated quantum Heisenberg magnets. Specific heat study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg magnet on four three-dimensional lattices -- simple-cubic, diamond, pyrochlore, and hyperkagome ones -- for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic signs of the exchange interaction in order to illustrate the effect of lattice geometry on the finite-temperature thermodynamic properties with a focus on the specific heat $c(T)$. To this end, we use quantum Monte Carlo simulations or high-temperature expansion series complemented with the entropy method. We also discuss a recent proposal about hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Particle-hole Symmetric Slave Boson Method for the Mixed Valence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an analytic slave boson method for treating the finite $U$ Anderson impurity model. Our approach introduces two bosons to track both $Q\rightleftharpoons Q\pm1$ valence fluctuations and reduces to a single symmetric $s$-boson in the effective action, encoding all the high energy atomic physics information in the boson's kinematics, while the low energy part of the action remains unchanged across finite $U$, infinite $U$, and Kondo limits. We recover the infinite $U$ and Kondo limit actions from our approach and show that the Kondo resonance already develops in the normal state when the slave boson has yet to condense. We show that the slave rotor and $s$-boson have the same algebraic structure, and we establish a unified functional integral framework connecting the $s$-boson and slave rotor representations for the single impurity Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Spectral Functions of an Extended Antiferromagnetic $S=1/2$ Heisenberg Model on the Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extended spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice, which includes both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, as well as a scalar chiral term. This model exhibits a rich phase diagram featuring several competing phases: different quantum spin liquids and various magnetically ordered states, including coplanar $120^\circ$ order, stripe order, and non-coplanar tetrahedral order. We employ large-scale matrix product state simulations optimized for GPUs to obtain high-resolution dynamical responses. Our calculations reveal the spectral features across both ordered and liquid regimes of the phase diagram, which we analyze in comparison with analytical predictions and field-theoretical approaches. We identify unique signatures of the ordered phases in the form of gapless Goldstone modes at the ordering wave vectors. Our results in the $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin-liquid regime are indicative of a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. In the chiral spin-liquid phase, we find signatures of spinons as the fractional excitations of the underlying theory, manifested as the onset of a two-spinon continuum that agrees with predictions from the Kalmeyer-Laughlin ansatz for the ground-state wave function, and collective modes that can be viewed as spinon bound states. We discuss finite-size effects, their consistency with the presumptions from field-theory, and review the dynamical structure factor with regard to experimentally relevant features such as the occurrence of highly dispersive signals and the global distribution of spectral weight.</description>

      <title>Robust Mottness and tunable interlayer magnetism in Nb3X8 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials have attracted extensive attention due to their correlated properties. The breathing kagome material system Nb3X8 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) is regarded as a Mott insulator. However, studies on the influence of interlayer coupling on its magnetic and Mott properties are lacking. In this work, we investigated the effect of interlayer coupling on bilayer properties of each Nb3X8 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) compound via density functional theory (DFT) calculations, considering 24 stacking configurations per material. We found that each bilayer material is a Mott insulator. Due to the competition between interlayer Pauli repulsion and hopping, most interlayer magnetism is AFM, a small number of cases show AFM-FM degeneracy, and the magnetic ground state of 3 configurations is interlayer FM, i.e., tunable interlayer magnetism occurs. This robustness of Mott states coexisting with tunable interlayer magnetism provide novel and comprehensive analysis and insights for the research of breathing kagome Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Scalable implementations of mean-field and correlation methods based on Lie-algebraic similarity transformation of spin Hamiltonians in the Jordan-Wigner representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted that the strong correlation inherent in spin Hamiltonians can be effectively reduced by mapping spins to fermions via the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JW). The Hartree-Fock method is straightforward in the fermionic domain and may provide a reasonable approximation to the ground state. Correlation with respect to the fermionic mean-field can be recovered based on Lie-algebraic similarity transformation (LAST) with two-body correlators. Specifically, a unitary LAST variant eliminates the dependence on site ordering, while a non-unitary LAST yields size-extensive correlation energies. Whereas the first recent demonstration of such methods was restricted to small spin systems, we present efficient implementations using analytical gradients for the optimization with respect to the mean-field reference and the LAST parameters, thereby enabling the treatment of larger clusters, including systems with local spins s &gt; 1/2.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in bilayer nickelates: Impact of quasi-quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17668v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient pressure has attracted great interest. Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\pi/4,\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\mu\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM.</description>

      <title>Mapping of Fermionic Lattice Models for Ising Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end, symmetry-aware pipeline that converts interacting fermionic and quantum-spin models into annealer-ready QUBOs while preserving low-energy physics. The workflow combines Bravyi-Kitaev encoding, exact Z2 symmetry tapering, Xia-Bian-Kais (XBK) diagonalization to a Z-only form, and k-local to 2-local quadratization, with ground energies recovered via a Dinkelbach fixed-point over the resulting Ising objective. We validate the approach across a complexity ladder: (i) a frustrated 2D Ising model run on a D-Wave Advantage QPU reproduces the known ferromagnet-stripe transition; (ii) finite-temperature checks on 1D Ising recover standard finite-size trends; (iii) a genuinely quantum spin target (XXZ) matches exact diagonalization (ED) on small chains; and (iv) interacting fermions (t-V) in 1D (rings L=2-8) show ED-level energies and the expected kink near V/t ~ 2, with a 2D 2x2 cluster tracking ED slopes up to a uniform offset. A replication-factor study quantifies the accuracy-overhead trade-off, with order-of-magnitude error reduction and diminishing returns beyond r ~ Nq. Except for the classical Ising benchmark and molecular benchmarks, experiments use D-Wave's public DIMOD and Neal simulators; a molecular benzene case in the appendix illustrates portability beyond lattices. The results establish a practical pathway for mapping quantum matter to current annealers, with clear knobs for fidelity, resources, and embedding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the excitations captured by the dynamical response of XYZ triangular spin-1/2 ladders. We complement experimental inelastic neutron scattering results on the compound $\text{Cs}_\text{2}\text{CoBr}_\text{4}$ with numerically exact simulations based on time-dependent matrix product state methods. Our results show that bound states of spinon excitations can arise in XYZ beyond the requirement of strong Ising anisotropies. We analyze the role of the frustrated triangular couplings on the excitations giving rise to the spin dynamical structure factor and show how the features of the bound states manifest themselves in the different polarization channels.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional electronic domain correlations in 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of nanoscale electronic domains underpins many emergent phenomena of quantum materials, including the competition between charge density waves (CDW) and superconductivity in high-Tc cuprates, or the storage of information in phase-change memory devices. Coupling to electronic domains provides an observable for pinpointing key interactions, e.g. affecting phase transitions. While the equilibrium phase diagram of 1T-TaS2 - characterized by unique transport properties and varying degrees of CDW commensurability - has been studied extensively, an understanding of how the electronic domains in the bulk behave across phase boundaries is lacking. We reveal the three-dimensional evolution of electronic domains in 1T-TaS2 using temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and reciprocal space mapping, complemented by structure factor simulations based on the Hendricks-Teller method. With this methodology, we identify an increasing number of stacking faults near the phase transitions, and a growing fraction of dimerized layers in the commensurate phase upon cooling. We provide structural evidence that the CDW domains mediate the transport properties at phase boundaries, and that they also account for an anomalous intermediate electronic phase within the triclinic regime upon heating. As a paradigmatic material with potential in phase-change memory applications, our study underscores the importance of domain sizes and layer stacking in defining electronic behaviors of van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Incompressible quantum liquid on the four-dimensional sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explo- rations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four-dimensional (4D) QHE has been experi- mentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent dynamical Hubbard functional for correlated solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body functionals of the Green's function can provide fundamental advances in electronic-structure calculations, due to their ability to accurately predict both spectral and thermodynamic properties, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments and total energies of materials. However, fully first-principles, self-consistent calculations with these dynamical functionals remain a major challenge, ultimately limiting their application to thermodynamic quantities, and restricting spectral predictions to one-shot calculations. In this paper, we present a fully self-consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solids using a dynamical functional. Our approach leverages the so-called dynamical Hubbard functional, which generalizes the DFT+$U$ correction by incorporating frequency-dependent screening, augmenting the static density functional to accurately describe both spectral and thermodynamic properties of materials with $d$- or $f$-localized orbitals near the Fermi level. To enable this, we employ the algorithmic-inversion method based on a sum-over-poles representation, resulting in a numerically accurate self-consistent scheme for frequency-integrated properties, while keeping real-axis spectral resolution for dynamically-resolved quantities. Using this framework, we study the paradigmatic correlated solid SrVO$_3$, accurately reproducing its spectral features, essentially confirming previous one-shot predictions, and improving the description of its equilibrium properties, such as the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus, bringing these significantly closer to experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Unitary network: Tensor network unitaries with local unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce unitary network, an oriented architecture for tensor network unitaries. Compared to existing architectures, in a unitary network each local tensor is required to be a unitary matrix upon suitable reshaping. Global unitarity is ensured when the network obeys a suitable ordering property. Unitary operators represented by unitary networks need not preserve locality. In particular, we show that the class of unitary networks encompasses global unitaries which preserve locality up to exponentially suppressed tails, as in those that naturally arise from the finite-time evolution of local Hamiltonians. Non-invertible symmetries, as exemplified by the non-local Kramers-Wannier duality in one dimension, can also be represented using unitary networks. We also show that information flow in a unitary network can be characterized by a flow index, which matches the known index for quantum cellular automata as a special case.</description>

Abstract: Multicomponent Heusler alloys exhibit various magnetic properties arising from their diverse atomic compositions and crystal structures. Identifying the general physical principles that govern these behaviors is essential for advancing their potential in spintronic applications. In this work, we combine density functional theory with atomistic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the magnetic ground states, finite-temperature magnetic transitions, and electronic structures of fully-ordered $L2_1$-, $XA$-type, and partially-ordered V$_2X$Al ($X=$ Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) Heusler alloys. We introduce the concept of magnetic genes, defined as V-$X$-V triangular motifs connected by the nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange interactions $J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$. Within this framework, the magnetic ground states and transition temperatures across the V$_2X$Al family can be consistently understood. The magnetic order is primarily governed by the NN $J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$ interactions in the triangular genes, while the transition temperatures are additionally influenced by $J_{X-X}$ couplings. Furthermore, the magnetic genes are still proven to be effective in our calculations on partially-ordered V$_2$$X$Al alloys from $L2_1$ to $XA$-type structures. Our results suggest that the concept of magnetic genes provides a unifying principle for understanding magnetic ordering in V-based Heusler alloys and could serve as a powerful guide for exploring magnetism and designing advanced spintronic materials in a broader class of Heusler systems.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent chiral transport and chiral solitons in spin Kitaev models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic quantum matter allow researchers to design quantum models inaccessible in traditional materials. Here, we propose protocols to engineer a new class of quantum spin models, which we call spin Kitaev models. The building blocks are basic spin-exchange interactions combined with locally selective Floquet pulses, a capability recently demonstrated in a range of experimental platforms. The resulting flip-flip and flop-flop terms lead to intriguing quantum transport dynamics beyond conventional spin models. For instance, in the absence of a magnetic field, spin excitations polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes propagate chirally in opposite directions, producing polarization-dependent spin transport. In the large-spin limit, the spin Kitaev model maps to a nonlinear Hatano-Nelson model, where the interplay of nonlinearity and the underlying curvature yields polarization-dependent chiral solitons. A magnetic field binds two oppositely polarized chiral solitons into a chiral solitonic molecule, whose travel direction depends on its orientation. Our results, directly accessible in current experiments, open new opportunities for simulating transport in curved spaces and for applications in spintronics, information processing, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a number of 1+1d lattice models with anti-unitary symmetries that simultaneously reflect space and reverse time. Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.</description>

      <title>Metal-Free Room-Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving robust room-temperature ferromagnetism in purely organic 2D crystals remains a fundamental challenge, primarily due to antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling mediated by {\pi}-electron superexchange. Here, we present a mix-topology design strategy to induce strong ferromagnetic (FM) coupling in metal-free 2D systems. By covalently connecting radical polyaromatic hydrocarbon monomers (also referred to as nanographenes) with distinct sublattice topologies, this approach rationally breaks inversion symmetry and enables selective alignment of majority spins across the extended network, giving rise to metal-free ferromagnetism. Based on this strategy, we designed a family of 32 organic 2D crystals featuring spin-1/2 and mixed spin-1/2-spin-1 honeycomb lattices. Systematic first-principles calculations reveal that these materials are robust FM semiconductors with tunable spin-dependent bandgaps ranging from 0.9 to 3.8 eV. Notably, we demonstrate record-high magnetic coupling of up to 127 meV, spin-splitting energies exceeding 2 eV, and Curie temperatures surpassing 550 K, indicating thermal stability well above room temperature. The microscopic origin of the strong FM exchange stems from enhanced spin-orbital overlap and dominant direct exchange, while AFM superexchange is effectively suppressed. Our findings establish a generalizable design principle for realizing robust metal-free FM semiconductors and open new avenues for developing flexible and biocompatible magnets for next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Phonons Drive the Topological Phase Transition in Quasi-One-Dimensional Bi$_4$I$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional bismuth halides offer an exceptional platform for exploring diverse topological phases, yet the nature of the room-temperature topological phase transition in Bi$_4$I$_4$ remains unresolved. While theory predicts the high-temperature $\beta$-phase to be a strong topological insulator (TI), experiments observe a weak TI. Here we resolve this discrepancy by revealing the critical but previously overlooked role of electron-phonon coupling in driving the topological phase transition. Using our newly developed ab initio framework for phonon-induced band renormalization, we show that thermal phonons alone drive $\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ from the strong TI predicted by static-lattice calculations to a weak TI above ~180 K. At temperatures where $\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ is stable, it is a weak TI with calculated surface states closely match experimental results, thereby reconciling theory with experiment. Our work establishes electron-phonon renormalization as essential for determining topological phases and provides a broadly applicable approach for predicting topological materials at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions between bosonic and fermionic quantum Hall states near even-denominator filling factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum critical point between the fermionic $\nu=8$ quantum Hall state and the bosonic $\nu=2$ quantum Hall state of Cooper pairs. Our study is motivated by the composite fermion construction for the daughter states of even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states and the experimentally observed transition between the daughter and the Jain states at the same filling. We show that this transition is equivalent to the transition between a neutral invertible $E_8$ state and a topologically trivial state. These transitions can be described in a partonic framework as a cascade of mass changes of four neutral Dirac fermions coupled to multiple Abelian Chern-Simons $U(1)$ gauge fields. In the absence of fine-tuning, the transition is split into a series of four or more different transitions, with at least three distinct intermediate topologically ordered phases hosting neutral anyons.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of higher-order cumulants in quantum isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding universal behavior of far-from-equilibrium transport dynamics at a quantum many body level is a longstanding challenge. In particular, a full characterization of universal dynamics of nonlocal correlation functions still remains largely unknown. In this letter, we uncover universal scaling laws of higher-order cumulants in one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, revealing anomalous behaviors of nonequilibrium dynamics exclusively accessible in higher-order correlations. By means of numerical simulations and full counting statistics, we determine the power laws of both the spin polarization transfer and contrast cumulants for different kinds of helix and domain-wall initial states. Building on such physical states, we unify the scaling behavior of the higher-order cumulants, giving rise to two types of dynamics: anomalous diffusive and superdiffusive. For the former, these higher cumulants show a deviation from Gaussian statistics, with the scaling exponents being identical for the first four orders. For the latter, however, we observe a breakdown of KPZ universality, with the exponents of the third and fourth orders differing significantly from those of the first two. Our results are also agreeable with recent experimental observations, advancing understanding of far-from-equilibrium transport phenomena.</description>

Abstract: An exact expression is derived for the kinetic contribution to the odd (arbitrary order) frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor via a finite summation that features averages of even (all lower orders) powers of the momentum over the exact momentum distribution. The derivation is carried out for the non-interacting Fermi gas and generalized to the interacting case based on the conjecture that averages over the Fermi distribution can be substituted with averages over the exact distribution. The expression is validated against known results (first, third frequency moments) and new explicit calculations (fifth, seventh frequency moments).</description>

      <title>Symmetry Classification of Altermagnetism and Emergence of Type-IV Magnetism in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism, particularly 2D altermagnetism (AM), has attracted considerable interest due to its exceptional physical properties and broad application potential. However, the classification of AM undergoes a fundamental paradigm shift when transitioning from three-dimensional (3D) to 2D symmetry-enforced fully compensated collinear magnetism$-$a shift that has remained largely overlooked. Here, by extending unconventional magnetism to 2D collinear systems, we identify the symmetry conditions and electronic band characteristics of a distinct magnetic phase: type-IV magnetism. This new class lies beyond the established descriptions of ferromagnetism, conventional antiferromagnetism, and AM. Type-IV magnetism supports the successive emergence of both nonrelativistic spin-degenerate and relativistic spin-splitting phenomena, belonging strictly to neither conventional antiferromagnetism nor standard AM. We further establish a universal symmetry classification framework for 2D type-IV magnets via a mapping from the collinear spin layer group to the magnetic layer group. Monolayer MgCr$_2$O$_3$ and monolayer BaMn$_2$Ch$_3$ (Ch=Se, Te) are showcased as representative materials, exhibiting gate-tunable reversible spin textures and the quantum electric Hall effect, respectively. Our work underscores the rich functional prospects of type-IV magnets, offering a new route toward spin manipulation and anomalous transport that promises innovative designs for high-performance spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Succession of Ising criticality and its threshold in critical quantum Ising model subject to symmetric decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mixed state quantum criticality in the Ising model under $X+ZZ$ decoherence. In the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decohered state resides on the self-dual critical line of the quantum Ashkin-Teller (qAT) model, as a result of the specific choice of the decoherence channel. On the other hand, since the mixed state under $X+ZZ$ decoherence satisfies the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in a weak sense, the Ising criticality of the pure state can be partially preserved in the mixed system. By making use of the combination of the doubled Hilbert space formalism and matrix product states, we carry out extensive numerical study to elucidate the mixed state criticality. We find that under decoherence up to moderate strength, the mixed states on the critical line have properties of the Ising CFT, where $c=1/2$, $\eta=0.25$ and, $\nu=1$. These values of the central charge and critical exponents contrast with the ones in the $c=1$ orbifold boson CFT describing the critical state of the qAT model. In addition, we also observe the threshold of the mixed Ising CFT. The strong decoherence washes out the remnant Ising criticality and induces strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: We apply the formally exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method to probe the unprecedentedly low-temperature regime recently achieved in an ultracold-atom quantum simulation of the 2D Hubbard model [Xu et al., Nature 642, 909 (2025)]. Computing the experimentally measured observables directly in the thermodynamic limit with a priori control of systematic errors, we find striking agreement with the experimental data across all accessible temperatures -- including the lowest, where existing numerical benchmarks show significant deviations. This validates the quantum simulator's control over systematic errors in this challenging regime and delivers unbiased benchmarks for future method development. Our results demonstrate that classical algorithms remain competitive with state-of-the-art analogue quantum simulators, and emphasise the importance of controlled numerical methods for continuing the development of these experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new frontier in condensed matter physics is to stack atomically thin layered-materials with different properties and create intriguing phenomena which do not exist in any of the constituent layers. Transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS$_2$, with an alternating stacking of a spin liquid candidate 1T-TaS$_2$ and a superconductor 1H-TaS$_2$, is a natural heterostructure for such a purpose. Recently, rare phenomena are indeed observed, including chiral superconductivity, two-component nematic superconductivity, topological surface superconductivity and enigmatic magnetic memory. A widely proposed starting point to understand such a mysterious heterostructure requires strong electronic correlation, presumably provided by 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with a narrow flat band near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal the theoretically expected flat band near $E_F$ in the energy-momentum space for the first time. However, this flat band only exists on the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer with broken translational symmetry, but not on the 1T-TaS$_2$ layers buried in the bulk. These results directly challenge the foundation of the current theoretical paradigm. On the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer, we further reveal a pseudogap and an anomalous doping effect. These phenomena and the dichotomy between surface and bulk layers also shed new light on the unusual coexistence of distinct electronic orders in this mysterious heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators for quantum impurity problems after a quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An emergent numerical approach to solve quantum impurity problems is to encode the impurity path integral as a matrix product state. For time-dependent problems, the cost of this approach generally scales with the evolution time. Here we consider a common non-equilibrium scenario where an impurity, initially in equilibrium with a thermal bath, is driven out of equilibrium by a sudden quench of the impurity Hamiltonian. Despite that there is no time-translational invariance in the problem, we show that we could still make full use of the infinite matrix product state technique, resulting in a method whose cost is essentially independent of the evolution time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in the integrable case against exact diagonalization, and against existing calculations on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour in the general case. Our method could be a very competitive method for studying long-time non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, and be potentially used as an efficient impurity solver in the non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the viscoelasticity tensor for altermagnets and formulate the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. The anisotropy of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces allows for additional terms in the viscoelasticity tensor and is manifested in transport properties, including electron and spin flows in a channel and nonlocal responses. In the channel geometry, the altermagnetic spin splitting leads to nontrivial spin density and spin current. Like the electric current, the spin current acquires a Poiseuille profile for no-slip boundary conditions. In nonlocal responses, the altermagnetic anisotropy affects current streamlines and electric potential distributions in the viscous regime. Our results provide signatures of the hydrodynamic transport regime in altermagnets, potentially facilitating its experimental studies and discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study pseudogap behavior in a metal near an antiferromagnetic instability and apply the results to electron-doped cuprates. We associate pseudogap behavior with thermal magnetic fluctuations and compute the fermionic self-energy along the Fermi surface beyond Eliashberg approximation. We analyze the spectral function as a function of frequency (energy distribution curves, EDC) and momentum (momentum distribution curves, MDC). We show that the EDC display pseudogap behavior with peaks at a finite frequency at all momenta. On the other hand, MDC peaks disperse within the pseudogap, ending at a gossamer Fermi surface. We analyze magnetically-mediated superconductivity and show that thermal fluctuations almost cancel out in the gap equation, even when the self-energy is obtained beyond the Eliashberg approximation. We favorably compare our results with recent ARPES study [K-J Xu et al, Nat. Phys. 19, 1834-1840 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Direct probe of magnetic field effects on phonons by ultrasound propagation in a quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>

Abstract: We study the phonon behavior of a Co-based honeycomb frustrated magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ under magnetic field applied perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The temperature and field dependence of the sound velocity and sound attenuation unveil prominent spin-lattice coupling in this material, promoting ultrasound as a sensitive probe for magnetic properties. An out-of-plane ferrimagnetic order is determined below the N\'eel temperature $T_N=27$~K. A comprehensive analysis of our data further supports a triple-Q ground state of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. Furthermore, the ultrasound data were systematically compared to the thermal transport results from literature, to unveil the importance of phononic contribution to the observed transport behaviors.</description>

      <title>Non-ergodic one-magnon magnetization dynamics of the kagome lattice antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing with Nanoelectronics: Fisher Information for an Applied Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems used for metrology can offer enhanced precision over their classical counterparts. The design of quantum sensors can be optimized by maximizing the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which characterizes the precision of parameter estimation for an ideal measurement. Here we consider the response of a quantum system as a means to estimate the strength of a weak external perturbation. General expressions for the QFI in the nonequilibrium steady-state are derived, which hold for arbitrary interacting many-body systems at finite or zero temperature, and can be related to susceptibilities or linear-response transport coefficients. For quantum dot nanoelectronics devices, we show that electron interactions can lead to *exponential* scaling of the QFI with system size, highlighting that quantum resources can be utilized in the full Fock space. The precision estimation of voltages and fields can also be achieved by practical measurements. In particular, we show that current-based metrology in quantum circuits can leverage many-body effects for enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric of electrons with spin-momentum locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials are characterized by electromagnetic responses intrinsically linked to the geometry and topology of electronic wavefunctions, encoded in the quantum metric and Berry curvature. Whereas Berry curvature-mediated transport effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum locking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and enable previously unexplored strategies to design functionalities based on quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial damping of magnetization currents in perturbed spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since perturbations are omnipresent in physics, understanding their impact on the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is a vitally important but notoriously difficult question. On the one hand, random-matrix and typicality arguments suggest a rather simple damping in the overwhelming majority of cases, e.g., exponential damping according to Fermi's Golden Rule. On the other hand, counterexamples are known to exist, and it remains unclear how frequent and under which conditions such counterexamples appear. In our work, we consider the spin-1/2 XXZ chain as a paradigmatic example of a quantum many-body system and study the dynamics of the magnetization current in the easy-axis regime. Using numerical simulations based on dynamical quantum typicality, we show that the standard autocorrelation function is damped in a nontrivial way and that only a modified version of this function is damped in a simple manner. Employing projection-operator techniques in addition, we demonstrate that both, the nontrivial and simple damping relation can be understood on perturbative grounds. Our results are in agreement with earlier findings for the particle current in the Hubbard chain.</description>

      <title>Fracton and Non-Lorentzian Particle Duality: Gauge Field Couplings and Geometric Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractons, characterized by restricted mobility and governed by higher-moment conservation laws, represent a novel phase of matter with deep connections to tensor gauge theories and emergent gravity. This work systematically explores the duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles-Carroll and Galilean-within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical actions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of motion and demonstrate a new set of dualities between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles in gauge fields. The algebraic underpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses, revealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean algebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a framework for coupling fracton gauge fields and background geometry, linking them to non-Lorentzian spacetimes and deriving the corresponding constraint on geometry. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity and exotic condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Absence of dissipation-free topological edge states in quadratic open fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a no-go theorem: generic quadratic open fermionic systems governed by Lindblad master equations do not host dissipation-free topological edge states protected by the dissipation gap. By analogy with topological insulators and superconductors, we map the Lindblad generator to a first-quantized non-Hermitian matrix representation that plays the role of a band Hamiltonian. Edge modes of this matrix with vanishing real part are exactly dissipation-free. We show that this matrix is always adiabatically deformable, through a symmetry-preserving path, to a topologically trivial Hermitian matrix. Hence no symmetry-protected, dissipation-free edge modes exist in quadratic open fermions. Our results apply to generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians and require only a gapped bulk and a bounded spectrum. They establish a clear boundary for robust topological phenomena in open fermionic systems.</description>
