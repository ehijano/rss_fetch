      <title>Synthetic perspectives on spaces and categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered domain-specific formal systems -- specifically homotopy type theory and simplicial type theory -- provide new perspectives on spaces and categories in a natively equivalence-invariant setting. In this note, we expose fundamental proof techniques from these parallel settings: describing induction principles over paths or arrows and constructions involving universes that are either univalent or directed univalent.</description>

      <title>Level Inequalities for Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for all noetherian rings, the level of any homologically bounded complex $M$ with respect to the collection of projective or injective modules is bounded above by the projective dimension of $\bigoplus H(M)$ plus one or the injective dimemsion of $\bigoplus H(M)$ plus one, respectively. In addition, we also prove that if $\mathsf{C}$ is the collection of flat, Gorenstein projective, Gorenstein injective, or Gorenstein flat modules, then the level of any homologically bounded complex $M$ is bounded above by the maximum of 2 or the $\mathsf{C}$-dimension of $\bigoplus H(M)$ plus 1. These results give universal bounds for the projective, injective, and flat levels over regular local rings, and give universal bounds for the Gorenstein projective, Gorenstein injective, and Gorenstein flat levels over Gorenstein local rings. As an application of the above results, we prove a version of the Bass Formula for complexes with respect to injective level.</description>

      <title>Lie groups in tangent join restriction categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Principal bundles have at least three different definitions, depending on the category of geometric objects studied.
  In Differential Geometry, they are defined as locally trivial projection map of smooth manifolds with an atlas whose transition maps are given by group multiplication. In Topology they are $G$-equivariantly trivial $G$-spaces. In Algebraic Geometry, they are \'Etale locally isotrivial geometric quotients of $G$-varieties.
  The goal of this work is to have a categorical notion that recovers all of them. While they are different structures, they are all locally isomorphic to the Cartesian product of a base space with a group.
  There are a variety of other results on group objects and their tangent bundle. In particular we show that the tangent bundle is the product of the tangent space and the group object and that the tangent space has an external Lie algebra structure, generalizing the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras.
  In order to give a purely categorical definition of a principal bundle, we formulate this notion in the language of join restriction categories. Restriction categories were developed by Cockett and Lack to generalize partial maps (maps defined only on a subset of the domain) and have since then found applications in mathematics and computer science. Join restriction categories, as described by Guo are restriction categories where local restrictions can be joined to obtain a global map. Together with a manifold construction due to Grandis, that allows us to glue together objects, we can describe principal bundles entirely in the language of join-restriction categories.</description>

      <title>Hereditarily indecomposable continua as generic mathematical structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the pseudo-arc as well as P-adic pseudo-solenoids (for a set of primes P) as generic structures, arising from a natural game in which two players alternate in building an inverse sequence of surjections. The second player wins if the limit of this sequence is homeomorphic to a concrete (fixed in advance) space, called generic whenever the second player has a winning strategy.
  For this purpose, we develop a new robust approximate Fra\"iss\'e theory in the context of MU-categories, a generalization of metric-enriched categories, suitable for working directly with continuous maps between metrizable compacta. Our framework extends both the classical and projective Fra\"iss\'e theories.
  We reprove the Fra\"iss\'e-theoretic characterization of the pseudo-arc and we realize every P-adic pseudo-solenoid as a Fra\"iss\'e limit of a suitable category of continuous surjections on the circle. Moreover, we show that, when playing the game with continuous surjections between non-degenerate Peano continua, the pseudo-arc is always generic, while the universal pseudo-solenoid is generic over all surjections between circle-like continua. This gives a complete classification of generic continua over full non-trivial subcategories of connected polyhedra with continuous surjections.</description>

      <title>A Context for Manifold Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop Weiss's manifold calculus in the setting of $\infty$-categories, where we allow the target $\infty$-category to be any $\infty$-category with small limits. We will establish the connection between polynomial functors, Kan extensions, and Weiss sheaves, and will classify homogeneous functors. We will also generalize Weiss and Boavida de Brito's theorem to functors taking values in arbitrary $\infty$-categories with small limits.</description>
