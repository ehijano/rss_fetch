      <title>Topology-driven deconfined quantum criticality in magnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets are believed to host phases of matter whose excitations are more fundamental than those of the ordered phases. When combining two such spin systems in a bilayer, strong interaction between the emergent excitations can produce phases not realized in either of its subsystems. We show that the critical fluctuations of a two-dimensional spin liquid state can induce a deconfined quantum critical point in a proximate antiferromagnet. The most relevant coupling between the associated effective field theories is given by a mixed Chern-Simons, or BF term of the emergent gauge fields in each layer. This describes a topological current-current interaction. In contrast to the local spin-spin interaction, it strongly modifies the renormalization group flow of the theory describing the N\'eel-VBS transition of the antiferromagnet. In particular, the protected coupling constant associated with it implies non-trivial quantum critical scaling characterized by a non-universal power-law divergence of the correlation length in the critical domain and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless divergence approaching it.</description>

      <title>Universal charge conductance at Abelian--non-Abelian quantum Hall interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple topologically distinct quantum Hall phases can occur at the same Landau level filling factor. It is a major challenge to distinguish between these phases as they only differ by the neutral modes, which do not affect the charge conductance in conventional geometries. We show that the neutral sector can be determined with coherent charge conductance in a $\pi$-shaped geometry that interfaces three different filling factors. Specifically, non-Abelian paired states at a half-filled Landau level and the anti-Read-Rezayi state can be identified. Interestingly, for interfaces between paired states and Jain states, the electric current in the $\pi$ geometry behaves as if pairs of neutral Majoranas edge modes were charge modes of Jain states.</description>

      <title>Multiple metamagnetic transitions in helical antiferromagnet CeVGe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on neutron diffraction, magnetoresistance, magnetization, and magnetic torque measurements under high magnetic field in the helical antiferromagnet CeVGe$_3$. This compound exhibits Kondo lattice coherence and helical antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at ambient pressure, similar to the well-studied CeRhIn$_5$. Our measurements reveal that CeVGe$_3$ undergoes a magnetic transition from an incommensurate (ICM) AFM state to an up-up-down-down commensurate (CM) AFM structure, followed by a transition to a novel phase at higher fields. A quantum phase transition occurs around 21.3 T. This rich magnetic field phase diagram closely resembles that of CeRhIn$_5$. Furthermore, angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements reveal that all transitions in CeVGe$_3$ occur from the field component along the $ab$ plane. These findings highlight the intricate interplay among exchange interactions, crystal field effects, ground state properties, and crystalline symmetries.</description>

      <title>Energy and momentum relaxation through the Curie temperature in an itinerant ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we combine conventional linear response time-domain THz spectroscopy with non-linear THz-pump THz-probe techniques to study metallic strained thin films of $\mathrm{Ca}_2\mathrm{RuO}_4$, which undergo a transition into a ferromagnetic state at 10 K. Such measurements allowing us to independently measure momentum and energy relaxation rates. We find that while the momentum relaxation rate decreases significantly at the ferromagnetic transition, the energy relaxation rate remains unaffected by the emergence of magnetic order. This shows that the dominant changes to scattering across the transition correspond to scatterings that relax momentum without relaxing energy. It is consistent with a scenario where energy is not carried off by coupling to collective magnetic degrees of freedom. Instead, the principal channel for energy relaxation remains the conventional one e.g. coupling to acoustic phonons. This observation validates the approximation used in the conventional understanding of resistive anomalies of ferromagnets across the Curie temperature, which due to critical slowing down, spin fluctuations can be treated as effectively static and scattering off of them elastic. This scenario can likely be extended to resistive anomalies at other phase transitions to charge- and spin-density wave states in kagome metals or pnictide system</description>

      <title>Exact Valence-Bond Solid Scars in the Square-Lattice Heisenberg Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the spin-s square-lattice Heisenberg model has exact many-body scars. These scars are simple valence-bond solids with exactly zero energy, and they exist in even-by-even systems and ladders of width 2. Ladders have additional scars corresponding to injecting one or two magnons on top of a parent valence-bond solid scar. These scars have a remarkably simple physical origin based only the angular momentum algebra and cancellations from spin-antialignment within a valence bond. Our comprehensive exact diagonalization calculations suggest that our valence-bond solids exhaust all exact eigenstates in the Heisenberg model except for few-magnon states near the top of the spectrum. Our scars are interesting because they are not part of a tower, have area-law entanglement, break translation symmetry, and exist for Heisenberg models of all spin.</description>

      <title>Evolution of magnetism in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate revealed by muon spin relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report the positive muon spin relaxation study on Pr-doped La$_{1.9}$Pr$_{1.1}$Ni$_2$O$_{6.97}$ and oxygen-deficient La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{6.63}$ polycrystalline under ambient pressure. Zero-field $\mu^+$SR experiments reveal the existence of bulk long-range magnetic order in La$_{1.9}$Pr$_{1.1}$Ni$_2$O$_{6.97}$ with $T_{N}=161\ \rm{K}$, while La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{6.63}$ exhibits a short-range magnetic ground state with $T_N=30\ \rm{K}$. The magnetic transition width of La$_{1.9}$Pr$_{1.1}$Ni$_2$O$_{6.97}$ revealed by weak-transverse-field $\mu^+$SR is narrower compared to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{6.92}$. Our $\mu^+$SR experiment results provide a comprehensive view on the correlation between magnetism and structure perfection in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates under ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Rotational Gr\"{u}neisen ratio: a new probe for quantum criticality in anisotropic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gr\"{u}neisen ratio $\Gamma$ and its magnetic analog, the magnetic Gr\"{u}neisen ratio $\Gamma_H$, are powerful probes to study the nature of quantum phase transitions. Here, we propose a new Gr\"{u}neisen parameter, the rotational Gr\"{u}neisen ratio $\Gamma_\phi$, by introducing the orientation of the external field as a control parameter. We investigate $\Gamma_\phi$ of the highly anisotropic paramagnets CeRhSn and CeIrSn by measuring the rotational magnetocaloric effect in a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. We find that the $\Gamma_\phi$ data of both compounds are scaled by using the same critical exponents and the field-invariant critical field angle. Remarkably, the scaling function for the $\Gamma_\phi$ data reveals the presence of highly-anisotropic quantum criticality that develops as a function of the easy-axis component of the magnetic field from the quantum critical line. This study provides a novel thermodynamic approach to detect and identify magnetic quantum criticality in highly anisotropic systems.</description>

      <title>Interplay between topology and electron-electron interactions in the moir\'{e} MoTe$_{\mathrm{2}}$/WSe$_{\mathrm{2}}$ heterobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study, the interplay between topology and electron-electron interactions in the moir\'{e} MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayer. In our analysis we apply an effective two-band model with complex hoppings that incorporate the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and lead to a non-trivial topology after the application of perpendicular electric field (displacement field). The model is supplemented by on-site and inter-site Coulomb repulsion terms and treated by both Hartree-Fock and Gutzwiller methods. According to our analysis, for the case of one hole per moir\'{e} unit cell, the system undergoes two phase transitions with increasing displacement field. The first one is from an in-plane 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic charge transfer insulator to a topological insulator. At the second transition, the system becomes topologically trivial and an out-of-plane ferromagnetic metallic phase becomes stable. In the topological region a spontaneous spin-polarization appears and the holes are distributed in both layers. Moreover, the hybridization of states from different layers and different valleys is allowed near the Fermi level. Those aspects are in qualitative agreement with the available experimental data. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the intersite Coulomb repulsion terms on the appearance of the topological phase as well as on the formation of the charge density wave state.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Enriched Floquet Topological Excitonic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intertwining of electron-hole correlation and nontrivial topology is known to give rise to exotic topological excitonic insulators. Here, we show that the involvement of quantum geometry can lead to more exotic excitonic phases exhibiting physical properties that are not determined by their topology but geometry. Starting from a topological band insulator and gradually reducing the band bap, many-body interaction can firstly generate a p+ip-wave and then an s-wave excitonic insulator. Interestingly, they bare the same Chern number but exhibit completely different spin textures and magneto-optical Kerr responses, reflecting the intricate geometric distinctions in their wavefunctions. We also propose to enhance the correlation effect via Floquet engineering, which provides a systematic way to realize these novel topological excitonic insulators and their phase transitions in the non-equilibrium steady states. Our results demonstrate new correlated phenomena enriched by quantum geometry, beyond the conventional topological classifications.</description>

      <title>Ferrimagnetic Kitaev spin liquids in mixed spin 1/2 spin 3/2 honeycomb magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential experimental realization of the mixed-spin Kitaev model in materials such as Zr$_{0.5}$Ru$_{0.5}$Cl$_3$, where spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 ions occupy distinct sublattices of a honeycomb lattice. By developing a superexchange theory specifically for this mixed-spin system, we identify the conditions under which dominant Kitaev-like interactions emerge. Focusing on the limiting case of pure Kitaev coupling with single-ion anisotropy, we employ a combination of superexchange theory, parton mean-field theory, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. We establish a comprehensive ground-state phase diagram identifying four distinct quantum spin liquid phases. Our findings highlight the importance of spin-orbital couplings and quadrupolar order parameters in stabilizing exotic phases, providing a foundation for exploring mixed-spin Kitaev magnets.</description>

      <title>Quasi-symmetry Constrained Spin Ferromagnetism in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry and their spin-orbit coupling (SOC) allow for an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that depends on the direction of the N\'eel ordering vector. The AHE and the ferromagnetic spin moment share the same symmetry and hence are usually proportional. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations find that the AHE exists with negligible ferromagnetic spin moment for some compounds, whereas it reaches sizable values for other altermagnets. By examining realistic minimal models for altermagnetism in which the DFT phenomenology is captured, we uncover a general SOC-enabled quasi-symmetry that provides a natural explanation for the amplitude of the ferromagnetic spin moment across the vast range of different altermagnetic materials. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for the magnetic anisotropy energy, providing a simple means to identify the preferred N\'eel vector orientation for altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Proposal of realizing the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model from a Kitaev Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is zero-dimensional model simulating quantum chaos using interacting Majorana fermions.Previously proposals have been made to realize the SYK model in fermionic systems that can support majorana zero modes. In this work, we simulate the SYK model in a Kitaev spin chain, where zero modes also exist in the ground state from the fermionic representation of spins. By adding other interactions as perturbations, we lift the degenerate majorana zero modes and obatin an effective SYK interactions. Although the majorana fermions are nonlocal in forms of spin operators, we show that the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) of the majorana fermions can be approximately simulated in forms of spin operators. Our proposal sheds light in simulating the fermonic SKY model and the related physics in purely bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Axionic quantum criticality of generalized Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a field theoretic description for $d$-dimensional interacting nodal semimetals, featuring dispersion that scales with the linear ($n$th) power of momentum along $d_L$ ($d_M$) mutually orthogonal directions around a few isolated points in the reciprocal space with $d_L+d_M=d$, and residing at the brink of isotropic insulation, described by $N_b$-component bosonic order parameter fields. The resulting renormalization group (RG) procedure, tailored to capture the associated quantum critical phenomena, is controlled by a `small' parameter $\epsilon=2-d_M$ and $1/N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of identical fermion copies (flavor number). When applied to three-dimensional interacting general Weyl semimetals ($d_L=1$ and $d_M=2$), characterized by the Abelian monopole charge $n&gt;1$, living at the shore of the axionic insulation ($N_b=2$), a leading order RG analysis suggests Gaussian nature of the underlying quantum phase transition, around which the critical exponents assume mean-field values. A traditional field theoretic RG analysis yields same outcomes for simple Weyl semimetals ($n=1$, $d_L=3$, and $d_M=0$). Consequently, emergent marginal Fermi liquids showcase only logarithmic corrections to physical observables at intermediate scales of measurements.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Time-Evolving Block Decimation for Improved Quantum Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple yet significant improvement to the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) tensor network algorithm for simulating the time dynamics of strongly correlated one-dimensional (1D) mixed quantum states. The efficiency of 1D tensor network methods stems from using a product of matrices to express either: the coefficients of a wavefunction, yielding a matrix product state (MPS); or the expectation values of a density matrix, yielding a matrix product density operator (MPDO). To avoid exponential computational costs, TEBD truncates the matrix dimension while simulating the time evolution. However, when truncating a MPDO, TEBD does not favor the likely more important low-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_i^\dagger c_j \rangle$, over the exponentially many high-weight expectation values, such as $\langle c_{i_1}^\dagger c^\dagger_{i_2} \cdots c_{i_n} \rangle$ of weight $n$, despite the critical importance of the low-weight expectation values. Motivated by this shortcoming, we propose a reweighted TEBD (rTEBD) algorithm that deprioritizes high-weight expectation values by a factor of $\gamma^{-n}$ during the truncation. This simple modification (which only requires reweighting certain matrices by a factor of $\gamma$ in the MPDO) makes rTEBD significantly more accurate than the TEBD time-dependent simulation of an MPDO, and competive with and sometimes better than TEBD using MPS. Furthermore, by prioritizing low-weight expectation values, rTEBD preserves conserved quantities to high precision.</description>

Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets.
  The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</description>

      <title>Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid parameters in Multi-wall Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) theory is a canonical formalism used to describe one-dimensional (1D) metals, where the low energy physics is determined by collective bosonic excitations. In this work, we present a theoretical model to compute the parameters of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) in multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs). MWNTs introduce additional complexity to the usual fermionic chains due to interactions and hybridization between their multiple coaxial shells. We consider a model in which conducting paths along the length of the MWNTs are randomly distributed among the shells. Since the valley degree of freedom remains a good quantum number, the TLL description in addition to spin and charge, contains also valley degree of freedom, hence four mode description applies. The values of all four TLL parameters are obtained for this model. A surprising outcome is that the compressibility of the holon mode becomes a universal quantity, while the parameters of neutral modes will depend on the details of inter-shell coupling. Finally, we propose experiments where our predictions can be tested.</description>

      <title>Observation of 1/3 fractional quantum Hall physics in balanced large angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetotransport of conventional semiconductor based double layer systems with barrier suppressed interlayer tunneling has been a rewarding subject due to the emergence of an interlayer coherent state that behaves as an excitonic superfluid. Large angle twisted bilayer graphene offers unprecedented strong interlayer Coulomb interaction, since both layer thickness and layer spacing are of atomic scale and a barrier is no more needed as the twist induced momentum mismatch suppresses tunneling. The extra valley degree of freedom also adds richness. Here we report the observation of fractional quantum Hall physics at 1/3 total filling for balanced layer population in this system. Monte Carlo simulations support that the ground state is also an excitonic superfluid but the excitons are composed of fractional rather than elementary charges. The observed phase transitions with an applied displacement field at this and other fractional fillings are also addressed with simulations. They reveal ground states with different topology and symmetry properties.</description>

      <title>Realization of strongly-interacting Meissner phases in large bosonic flux ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can realize novel phases of matter that are not present in time-independent Hamiltonians. One important application is the engineering of synthetic gauge fields, which opens the realm of topological many-body physics to neutral atom quantum simulators. In this work, we leverage a neutral atom quantum simulator to experimentally realize the strongly-interacting Mott-Meissner phase in large-scale, bosonic flux ladders with 48 sites at half filling. By combining quantum gas microscopy with local basis rotations, we reveal the emerging equilibrium particle currents with local resolution across large systems. We find chiral currents exhibiting a characteristic interaction scaling, providing direct experimental evidence of the interacting Mott-Meissner phase. Moreover, we benchmark density correlations with numerical simulations and find that the effective temperature of the system is on the order of the tunnel coupling. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling periodically driven quantum systems to large, strongly correlated phases, paving the way for exploring topological quantum matter with single-atom resolution and control.</description>

      <title>Echoes and defects in the Calogero model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries and statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a harmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in terms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a scale invariant fluid in 1D displaying $SO(2,1)$ hidden symmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally-relevant drive protocols spanning both quasi-static and non-adiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground state echo amplitude and closely related ground state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dynamical Phase Transition as a Complex Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum dynamical phase transition induced by the competition between local unitary evolution and dissipation in a qubit chain with a strong, on-site $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. While the steady-state of this evolution is always maximally-mixed, we show that the dynamical behavior of certain non-local observables on the approach to this steady-state is dictated by a quantum Ising model with a $\textit{complex}$ transverse-field (cTFIM). We investigate these observables analytically, uncovering a dynamical phase transition as the relative rate of unitary evolution and dissipation is tuned. We show that the weak-dissipation limit corresponds to a cTFIM with a large magnitude of the imaginary transverse-field, for which the many-body "ground-state" (with smallest real eigenvalue) is gapless, exhibiting quasi-long-range correlations of the local magnetization with a continuously-varying exponent. Correspondingly, the dynamics of the non-local observables show oscillatory behavior with an amplitude decaying exponentially in time. The strong-dissipation limit corresponds to a gapped ferromagnetic phase of the cTFIM, and non-local observables show exponential decay on the approach to equilibrium. This transition in (1+1)-dimensions has a peculiar, "two-sided" nature appearing as either first- or second-order depending on the phase from which the transition is approached, an analytic result which is corroborated by numerical studies. In higher dimensions, we present a field-theoretic understanding of the first-order nature of this transition, when approaching from the ferromagnetic phase of the cTFIM, though the nature of the phase with large imaginary transverse-field remains to be understood.</description>

Abstract: The standard paradigm of topological phases posits that two phases with identical symmetries are separated by a bulk phase transition, while symmetry breaking provides a path in parameter space that allows adiabatic connection between the phases. Typically, if symmetry is broken only at the boundary, topological surface states become gapped, and single-particle surface properties no longer distinguish between the two phases. In this work, we challenge this expectation. We demonstrate that the single-particle surface Green's function contains zeros, or "Luttinger surfaces," which maintain the same bulk-boundary correspondence as topological surface states. Remarkably, these Luttinger surfaces persist under symmetry-breaking perturbations that destroy the surface states. Moreover, we point out that low-energy and surface theories, often used synonymously in discussions of (gapped) topological matter, are actually different, with the difference captured by the Luttinger surfaces.</description>

      <title>Microwave Hall measurements using a circularly polarized dielectric cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a circularly polarized dielectric rutile (TiO$_2$) cavity with a high quality-factor that can generate circularly polarized microwaves from two orthogonal linearly polarized microwaves with a phase difference of $\pm \pi/2$ using a hybrid coupler. Using this cavity, we have established a new methodology to measure the microwave Hall conductivity of a small single crystal of metal in the skin-depth region. Based on the cavity perturbation technique, we have shown that all components of the surface impedance tensor can be extracted under the application of a magnetic field by comparing the right- and left-handed circularly polarized modes. To verify the validity of the developed method, we performed test measurements on tiny Bi single crystals at low temperatures. As a result, we have successfully obtained the surface impedance tensor components and confirmed that the characteristic field dependence of the ac Hall angle in the microwave region is consistent with the expectation from the dc transport measurements. These results demonstrate a significant improvement in sensitivity compared to previous methods. Thus, our developed technique allows more accurate microwave Hall measurements, opening the way for new approaches to explore novel topological quantum phenomena, such as time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Splitting of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman density wave and the nature of chiral gravitons in fractional quantum Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental manifestation of the nontrivial correlations of an incompressible fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state is that an electron added to it disintegrates into more elementary particles, namely fractionally-charged composite fermions (CFs). We show here that the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) density-wave excitation of the $\nu{=}n/(2pn{\pm }1)$ FQH states also splits into more elementary single CF excitons. In particular, the GMP graviton, which refers to the recently observed spin-2 neutral excitation in the vanishing wave vector limit [Liang {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)], remains undivided for $\nu{=}n/(2n{\pm} 1)$ but splits into two gravitons at $\nu{=}n/(4n{\pm} 1)$ with $n{&gt;}1$. A detailed experimental confirmation of the many observable consequences of the splitting of the GMP mode should provide a unique window into the correlations underlying the FQH effect.</description>

      <title>Elastic softness of low-symmetry frustrated $A$Ti$_2$O$_5$ ($A$ = Co, Fe)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthorhombic pseudobrookites CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ have a low-symmetry crystal structure comprising magnetic Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions and nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ ions, where the orbital-nondegenerate Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions form one-dimensional chains running along the orthorhombic $a$ axis. These compounds undergo an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \sim$ 26 K for CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and $T_N \sim$ 40 K for FeTi$_2$O$_5$. Ultrasound velocity measurements on single crystals of CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ reveal that CoTi$_2$O$_5$ exhibits unusual elastic softness above $T_N$ in the symmetry-lowering elastic mode of $ac$-plane shear elastic modulus, inconsistent with the structural symmetry breaking caused by antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N$. This suggests the presence of two distinct types of magnetostructural fluctuations above $T_N$ that should be a precursor to the symmetry-lowering lattice distortion at $T_N$. In contrast, FeTi$_2$O$_5$ exhibits either negligible or smaller elastic softness, indicating weaker spin-lattice coupling. These findings highlight CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ as unique spin-latticed-coupled frustrated systems with low crystal symmetry, where, while the exchange interactions are quasi-one-dimensional in nature, the frustration is released by further lowering the crystal symmetry through three-dimensional spin-lattice coupling, which is stronger in CoTi$_2$O$_5$ than in FeTi$_2$O$_5$.</description>

      <title>Strong Inter-valley Electron-Phonon Coupling in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unusual properties of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have sparked enormous research interest. However, despite the dedication of intensive experimental efforts and the proposal of several possible pairing mechanisms, the origin of its superconductivity remains elusive. Here, utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometer spatial resolution, we have revealed flat band replicas in superconducting MATBG, where MATBG is unaligned with its hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate11. These replicas exhibit uniform energy spacing, approximately 150 +- 15 meV apart, indicative of strong electron-boson coupling. Strikingly, these replicas are absent in non-superconducting twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems, either when MATBG is aligned to hBN or when TBG deviates from the magic angle. Calculations suggest that the formation of these flat band replicas in superconducting MATBG are attributed to the strong coupling between flat band electrons and an optical phonon mode at the graphene K point, facilitated by inter-valley scattering. These findings, although do not necessarily put electron phonon coupling as the main driving force for the superconductivity in MATBG, unravel the unique electronic structure inherent in superconducting MATBG, thereby providing crucial information for understanding the unusual electronic landscape from which the superconductivity is derived.</description>

Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), time reversal (T), and fermion parity $(-1)^{\rm F}$ are basic discrete spacetime and internal symmetries of the Dirac fermions. In this article, we determine the group, called the C-R-T fractionalization, which is a group extension of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm C}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm R}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm T}$ by the fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$, and its extension class in all spacetime dimensions $d$, for a single-particle fermion theory. For Dirac fermions, with the canonical CRT symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm CRT}$, the C-R-T fractionalization has two possibilities that only depend on spacetime dimensions $d$ modulo 8, which are order-16 nonabelian groups, including the famous Pauli group. For Majorana fermions, we determine the R-T fractionalization in all spacetime dimensions $d=0,1,2,3,4\mod8$, an order-8 abelian or nonabelian group. For Weyl fermions, we determine the C or T fractionalization in all even spacetime dimensions $d$, which is an order-4 abelian group. We only have an order-2 $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$ group for Majorana-Weyl fermions. We determine the maximal number of linearly independent Dirac and Majorana mass terms and construct them explicitly. We also discuss how the conventional Dirac and Majorana mass terms break the symmetries C, R, or T. We study the domain wall dimensional reduction of the fermions and their C-R-T fractionalization: from $d$-dim Dirac to $(d-1)$-dim Dirac or Weyl and from $d$-dim Majorana to $(d-1)$-dim Majorana or Majorana-Weyl.</description>

      <title>Slow measurement-only dynamics of entanglement in Pauli subsystem codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-unitary dynamics of a class of quantum circuits based on stochastically measuring check operators of subsystem quantum error-correcting codes, such as the Bacon-Shor code and its various generalizations. Our focus is on how properties of the underlying code are imprinted onto the measurement-only dynamics. We find that in a large class of codes with nonlocal stabilizer generators, at late times there is generically a nonlocal contribution to the subsystem entanglement entropy which scales with the subsystem size. The nonlocal stabilizer generators can also induce slow dynamics, since depending on the rate of competing measurements the associated degrees of freedom can take exponentially long (in system size) to purify (disentangle from the environment when starting from a mixed state) and to scramble (become entangled with the rest of the system when starting from a product state). Concretely, we consider circuits for which the nonlocal stabilizer generators of the underlying subsystem code take the form of subsystem symmetries. We present a systematic study of the phase diagrams and relevant time scales in two and three spatial dimensions for both Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) and non-CSS codes, focusing in particular on the link between slow measurement-only dynamics and the geometry of the subsystem symmetry. A key finding of our work is that slowly purifying or scrambling degrees of freedom appear to emerge only in codes whose subsystem symmetries are nonlocally {\it generated}, a strict subset of those whose symmetries are simply nonlocal. We comment on the link between our results on subsystem codes and the phenomenon of Hilbert-space fragmentation in light of their shared algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>Exact low-temperature Green's functions in AdS/CFT: From Heun to confluent Heun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain exact expressions for correlation functions of charged scalar operators at finite density and low temperature in CFT$_4$ dual to the RN-AdS$_5$ black brane. We use recent developments in the Heun connection problem in black hole perturbation theory arising from Liouville CFT and the AGT correspondence. The connection problem is solved perturbatively in an instanton counting parameter, which is controlled in a double-scaling limit where $\omega, T \to 0$ holding $\omega/T$ fixed. This provides analytic control over the emergence of the zero temperature branch cut as a confluent limit of the Heun equation. From the Green's function we extract analytic results for the critical temperature of the holographic superconductor, as well as dispersion relations for both gapped and gapless low temperature quasinormal modes. We demonstrate precise agreement with numerics.</description>

      <title>The boundary entropy function for interface conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: {In 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary the boundary contribution to the entanglement entropy is determined by a single number $g$ effectively counting the boundary degrees of freedom. In contrast, in 1+1 dimensional interface CFTs the corresponding quantity is a non-trivial {\it function} depending on the position of the interval relative to the interface, giving access to much more detailed information about the defect. In this work we determined this $g$-function in several examples using holography and derive some of its basic properties from holography and strong subadditivity.</description>
