      <title>Local Synchronization of Power System Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel concept of local synchronization of power systems devices based on the difference between the complex frequency of the voltage and current injected at terminals. Formal definitions are provided to account for bounded and asymptotic local synchronization. The definitions are suitable for modern power systems as they remove classical assumptions limiting the application of the concept of synchronization to synchronous machines and omitting voltage dynamics. The paper also provides a systematic analytical description of the synchronization mechanisms of common power system devices. Finally, a variety of examples is included to illustrate the theoretical value and practical application of the proposed definitions to power systems modeling and stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scalability of Optimal Kron-based Reduction of Networks (Opti-KRON) via Decomposition with Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical networks contain thousands of interconnected nodes and edges, which leads to computational challenges in some power system studies. To address these challenges, we contend that network reductions can serve as a framework to enable scalable computing in power systems. By building upon a prior AC "Opti-KRON" formulation, this paper presents a DC power flow formulation for finding network reductions that are optimal within the context of large transmission analysis. Opti-KRON previously formulated optimal Kron-based network reductions as a mixed integer linear program (MILP), where the number of binary variables scaled with the number of nodes. To improve the scalability of the Opti-KRON approach, we augment the MILP formulation with a community detection (CD) technique that segments a large network into smaller, disjoint, but contiguous sub-graphs (i.e., communities). For each sub-graph, we then (in parallel) apply MILP-based along with a new cutting plane constraint, thus, enhancing scalability. Ultimately, the new DC-based Opti-KRON method can achieve a 80-95\% reduction of networks (in terms of nodes) while statistically outperforming other CD- and Kron-based methods. We present simulation results for the IEEE RTS-96 and the 2383-bus Polish networks.</description>

      <title>Building a Better B-Dot: Fast Detumbling with Non-Monotonic Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacecraft detumbling with magnetic torque coils is an inherently underactuated control problem. Contemporary and classical magnetorquer detumbling methods do not adequately consider this underactuation, and suffer from poor performance as a result. These controllers can get stuck on an uncontrollable manifold, resulting in long detumbling times and high power consumption. This work presents a novel detumble controller based on a non-monotonic Lyapunov function that predicts the future magnetic field along the satellite's orbit and avoids uncontrollable configurations. In comparison to other controllers in the literature, our controller detumbles a satellite in significantly less time while also converging to lower overall angular momentum. We provide a derivation and proof of convergence for our controller as well as Monte-Carlo simulation results demonstrating its performance in representative use cases.</description>

      <title>A Two-stage Identification Method for Switched Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a new two-stage identification method based on dynamic programming and sparsity inducing is proposed for switched linear systems. Our method achieves sparsity inducing in the identification of switched linear systems by the constrained switching mechanism, in contrast to previous optimization-based identification techniques that rely on the rigid data distribution assumption in the parameter space. The proposed mechanism assumes the existence of a minimal interval between adjacent switching instants. First, an efficient iterative dynamic programming approach is used to determine the switching instants and segments using the constrained switching mechanism. Then, each submodel is identified as a combinatorial $\ell_0$ optimization problem, and the true parameter for each submodel is determined by solving the problem. The problem of combinatorial $\ell_0$ optimization is solved by relaxing it into a convex $\ell_1$-norm optimization problem. Furthermore, the unbiasedness of the switched linear system identification is discussed thoroughly with the constrained switching mechanism and a new persistent excitation condition is proposed. Simulation experiments are conducted to indicate that our algorithms exhibit strong robustness against noise.</description>

      <title>Graphon Particle Systems, Part II: Dynamics of Distributed Stochastic Continuum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distributed optimization problem over a graphon with a continuum of nodes, which is regarded as the limit of the distributed networked optimization as the number of nodes goes to infinity. Each node has a private local cost function. The global cost function, which all nodes cooperatively minimize, is the integral of the local cost functions on the node set. We propose stochastic gradient descent and gradient tracking algorithms over the graphon. We establish a general lemma for the upper bound estimation related to a class of time-varying differential inequalities with negative linear terms, based upon which, we prove that for both kinds of algorithms, the second moments of the nodes' states are uniformly bounded. Especially, for the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm, we transform the convergence analysis into the asymptotic property of coupled nonlinear differential inequalities with time-varying coefficients and develop a decoupling method. For both kinds of algorithms, we show that by choosing the time-varying algorithm gains properly, all nodes' states achieve $\mathcal{L}^{\infty}$-consensus for a connected graphon. Furthermore, if the local cost functions are strongly convex, then all nodes' states converge to the minimizer of the global cost function and the auxiliary states in the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm converge to the gradient value of the global cost function at the minimizer uniformly in mean square.</description>

      <title>Exact Instability Radius of Discrete-Time LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robust instability of an unstable plant subject to stable perturbations is of significant importance and arises in the study of sustained oscillatory phenomena in nonlinear systems. This paper analyzes the robust instability of linear discrete-time systems against stable perturbations via the notion of robust instability radius (RIR) as a measure of instability. We determine the exact RIR for certain unstable systems using small-gain type conditions by formulating the problem in terms of a phase change rate maximization subject to appropriate constraints at unique peak-gain frequencies, for which stable first-order all-pass functions are shown to be optimal. Two real-world applications -- minimum-effort sampled-data control of magnetic levitation systems and neural spike generations in the FitzHugh--Nagumo model subject to perturbations -- are provided to illustrate the utility of our results.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of UAV-Assisted RF-UOWC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a relay-assisted solution for downlink communications in a mixed system of Radio Frequency (RF) and Underwater Optical Wireless Communications (UOWC) technologies. During the initial downlink phase, data transmission occurs via RF link between hovering Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and the floating buoys at the water surface. As fixed buoy acts as amplify-and-forward relays, the second UOWC link represents downlink signal transmission from the floating buoy to the underwater device. Best relay selection is adopted, meaning that only the buoy with the best estimated RF-based UAV-buoy channel will perform signal transmission to an underwater device. Analytical expression for the outage probability is derived and utilized to examine the system's performance behaviour for various UOWC and RF channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Federated Fine-Tuning for Pre-Trained Foundation Models Over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models (FMs), with extensive number of neurons, are key to advancing next-generation intelligence services, where personalizing these models requires massive amount of task-specific data and computational resources. The prevalent solution involves centralized processing at the edge server, which, however, raises privacy concerns due to the transmission of raw data. Instead, federated fine-tuning (FedFT) is an emerging privacy-preserving fine-tuning (FT) paradigm for personalized pre-trained foundation models. In particular, by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning (FL), federated LoRA enables the collaborative FT of a global model with edge devices, achieving comparable learning performance to full FT while training fewer parameters over distributed data and preserving raw data privacy. However, the limited radio resources and computation capabilities of edge devices pose significant challenges for deploying federated LoRA over wireless networks. To this paper, we propose a split federated LoRA framework, which deploys the computationally-intensive encoder of a pre-trained model at the edge server, while keeping the embedding and task modules at the edge devices. Building on this split framework, the paper provides a rigorous analysis of the upper bound of the convergence gap for the wireless federated LoRA system. This analysis motivates the formulation of a long-term upper bound minimization problem, where we decompose the formulated long-term mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem into sequential sub-problems using the Lyapunov technique. We then develop an online algorithm for effective device scheduling and bandwidth allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed online algorithm in enhancing learning performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future energy systems are subject to various uncertain influences. As resilient systems they should maintain a constantly high operational performance whatever happens. We explore different levels and time scales of decision making in energy systems, highlighting different uncertainty sources that are relevant in different domains. We discuss how the uncertainties can be represented and how one can react to them. The article closes by summarizing, which uncertainties are already well examined and which ones still need further scientific inquiry to obtain resilient energy systems.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Protection Adoption Against Networked SIS Epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate game-theoretic strategies for containing spreading processes on large-scale networks. Specifically, we consider the class of networked susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemics where a large population of agents strategically choose whether to adopt partially effective protection. We define the utilities of the agents which depends on the degree of the agent, its individual infection status and action, as well as the the overall prevalence of the epidemic and strategy profile of the entire population. We further present the coupled dynamics of epidemic evolution as well as strategy update which is assumed to follow the replicator dynamics. By relying on timescale separation arguments, we first derive the optimal strategy of protection adoption by the agents for a given epidemic state, and then present the reduced epidemic dynamics. The existence and uniqueness of endemic equilibrium is rigorously characterized and forms the main result of this paper. Finally, we present extensive numerical results to highlight the impacts of heterogeneous node degrees, infection rates, cost of protection adoption, and effectiveness of protection on the epidemic prevalence at the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A Formal Model for Artificial Intelligence Applications in Automation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into automation systems has the potential to enhance efficiency and to address currently unsolved existing technical challenges. However, the industry-wide adoption of AI is hindered by the lack of standardized documentation for the complex compositions of automation systems, AI software, production hardware, and their interdependencies. This paper proposes a formal model using standards and ontologies to provide clear and structured documentation of AI applications in automation systems. The proposed information model for artificial intelligence in automation systems (AIAS) utilizes ontology design patterns to map and link various aspects of automation systems and AI software. Validated through a practical example, the model demonstrates its effectiveness in improving documentation practices and aiding the sustainable implementation of AI in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Power Flow Linearization: Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This two-part tutorial dives into the field of data-driven power flow linearization (DPFL), a domain gaining increased attention. DPFL stands out for its higher approximation accuracy, wide adaptability, and better ability to implicitly incorporate the latest system attributes. This renders DPFL a potentially superior option for managing the significant fluctuations from renewable energy sources, a step towards realizing a more sustainable energy future, by translating the higher model accuracy into increased economic efficiency and less energy losses. To conduct a deep and rigorous reexamination, this tutorial first classifies existing DPFL methods into DPFL training algorithms and supportive techniques. Their mathematical models, analytical solutions, capabilities, limitations, and generalizability are systematically examined, discussed, and summarized. In addition, this tutorial reviews existing DPFL experiments, examining the settings of test systems, the fidelity of datasets, and the comparison made among a limited number of DPFL methods. Further, this tutorial implements extensive numerical comparisons of all existing DPFL methods (40 methods in total) and four classic physics-driven approaches, focusing on their generalizability, applicability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Through these simulationmethodss, this tutorial aims to reveal the actual performance of all the methods (including the performances exposed to data noise or outliers), guiding the selection of appropriate linearization methods. Furthermore, this tutorial discusses future directions based on the theoretical and numerical insights gained. As the first part, this paper reexamines DPFL theories, covering all the training algorithms and supportive techniques. Capabilities, limitations, and aspects of generalizability, which were previously unmentioned in the literature, have been identified.</description>

      <title>Impact of an Autonomous Shuttle Service on Urban Road Capacity: Experiments by Microscopic Traffic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are expected to transform transportation systems with rapid technological advancement. Human mobility would become more accessible and safer with the emergence of driverless vehicles. To this end, autonomous shuttle services are currently introduced in different urban conditions throughout the world. As a result, studies are needed to assess the safety and mobility performance of such autonomous shuttle services. However, calibrating the movement of autonomous shuttles in a simulation environment has been a difficult task due to the absence of any real-world data. This study aims to calibrate autonomous shuttles in a microscopic traffic simulation model and consequently assess the impact of the shuttle service on urban road capacity through simulation experiments. For this analysis, a prototype of an operational shuttle system at Lake Nona, Orlando, Florida is emulated in a microscopic traffic simulator during different times of the day. The movements of autonomous vehicles are calibrated using real-world trajectory data which help replicate the driving behavior of the shuttle in the simulation. The analysis reveals that with increasing frequency of the shuttle service the delay time percentage of the shared road sections increases and traveling speed decreases. It is also found that increasing the speed of shuttles up to 5 mph during off-peak hours and 10 mph during peak hours will improve traffic conditions. The findings from this study will assist policymakers and transportation agencies to revise policies for deploying autonomous shuttles and for planning road infrastructures for shared road-use of autonomous shuttles and human driven vehicles.</description>

Abstract: Runway Safety Assistant Foreseeing Excursions (RUN.S.A.F.E.) is a complete embedded system solution that predicts a potential runway overrun during the takeoff and landing of a civil aviation aircraft. The system executes both static and dynamic calculations, the former being completely dependent, while the latter completely independent to the user's inputs. The solution is adapted to a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with CFM56-7B engines. However, the calculations also apply for similar aicrafts, equipped with a tricycle landing gear and turbofan engines. The system is aligned with current regulations and certification specifications, where applicable.</description>

      <title>Impact of Network Deployment on the Performance of NCR-assisted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the need of coverage enhancement in the fifth generation (5G) of wireless cellular telecommunications, while taking into account possible bottlenecks related to deploying fiber based backhaul (e.g., required cost and time), the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) proposed in Release 18 the concept of network-controlled repeaters (NCRs). NCRs enhance previous radio frequency (RF) repeaters by exploring beamforming transmissions controlled by the network through side control information. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of NCR. Furthermore, we present a system level model that allows the performance evaluation of an NCR-assisted network. Finally, we evaluate the network deployment impact on the performance of NCR-assisted networks. As we show, with proper network planning, NCRs can boost the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the user equipments (UEs) in a poor coverage of a macro base station. Furthermore, celledge UEs and uplink (UL) communications are the ones that benefit the most from the presence of NCRs.</description>

      <title>Mobile Edge Generation-Enabled Digital Twin: Architecture Design and Research Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel paradigm of mobile edge generation (MEG)-enabled digital twin (DT) is proposed, which enables distributed on-device generation at mobile edge networks for real-time DT applications. First, an MEG-DT architecture is put forward to decentralize generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models onto edge servers (ESs) and user equipments (UEs), which has the advantages of low latency, privacy preservation, and individual-level customization. Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation scenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of MEG-DT over centralized generation. Finally, promising applications and research opportunities are identified.</description>

Abstract: Mobile robots, becoming increasingly autonomous, are capable of operating in diverse and unknown environments. This flexibility allows them to fulfill goals independently and adapting their actions dynamically without rigidly predefined control codes. However, their autonomous behavior complicates guaranteeing safety and reliability due to the limited influence of a human operator to accurately supervise and verify each robot's actions. To ensure autonomous mobile robot's safety and reliability, which are aspects of dependability, methods are needed both in the planning and execution of missions for autonomous mobile robots. In this article, a twofold approach is presented that ensures fault removal in the context of mission planning and fault prevention during mission execution for autonomous mobile robots. First, the approach consists of a concept based on formal verification applied during the planning phase of missions. Second, the approach consists of a rule-based concept applied during mission execution. A use case applying the approach is presented, discussing how the two concepts complement each other and what contribution they make to certain aspects of dependability.
 Unbemannte Fahrzeuge sind durch zunehmende Autonomie in der Lage in unterschiedlichen unbekannten Umgebungen zu operieren. Diese Flexibilit\"at erm\"oglicht es ihnen Ziele eigenst\"andig zu erf\"ullen und ihre Handlungen dynamisch anzupassen ohne starr vorgegebenen Steuerungscode. Allerdings erschwert ihr autonomes Verhalten die Gew\"ahrleistung von Sicherheit und Zuverl\"assigkeit, bzw. der Verl\"asslichkeit, da der Einfluss eines menschlichen Bedieners zur genauen \"Uberwachung und Verifizierung der Aktionen jedes Roboters begrenzt ist. Daher werden Methoden sowohl in der Planung als auch in der Ausf\"uhrung von Missionen f\"ur unbemannte Fahrzeuge ben\"otigt, um die Sicherheit und Zuverl\"assigkeit dieser Fahrzeuge zu gew\"ahrleisten. In diesem Artikel wird ein zweistufiger Ansatz vorgestellt, der eine Fehlerbeseitigung w\"ahrend der Missionsplanung und eine Fehlerpr\"avention w\"ahrend der Missionsausf\"uhrung f\"ur unbemannte Fahrzeuge sicherstellt. Die Fehlerbeseitigung basiert auf formaler Verifikation, die w\"ahrend der Planungsphase der Missionen angewendet wird. Die Fehlerpr\"avention basiert auf einem regelbasierten Konzept, das w\"ahrend der Missionsausf\"uhrung angewendet wird. Der Ansatz wird an einem Beispiel angewendet und es wird diskutiert, wie die beiden Konzepte sich erg\"anzen und welchen Beitrag sie zu verschiedenen Aspekten der Verl\"asslichkeit leisten.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the problem of controlling an aerial manipulator, composed of an omnidirectional tilting drone equipped with a five-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm. The robot has to interact with the environment to inspect structures and perform non-destructive measurements. A parallel force-impedance control technique is developed to establish contact with the designed surface with a desired force profile. During the interaction, a pushing phase is required to create a vacuum between the surface and the echometer sensor mounted at the end-effector, to measure the thickness of the interaction surface. Repetitive measures are performed to show the repeatability of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Protection Degree and Migration in the Stochastic SIRS Model: A Queueing System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the prevalence of COVID-19, the modeling of epidemic propagation and its analyses have played a significant role in controlling epidemics. However, individual behaviors, in particular the self-protection and migration, which have a strong influence on epidemic propagation, were always neglected in previous studies. In this paper, we mainly propose two models from the individual and population perspectives. In the first individual model, we introduce the individual protection degree that effectively suppresses the epidemic level as a stochastic variable to the SIRS model. In the alternative population model, an open Markov queueing network is constructed to investigate the individual number of each epidemic state, and we present an evolving population network via the migration of people. Besides, stochastic methods are applied to analyze both models. In various simulations, the infected probability, the number of individuals in each state and its limited distribution are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>PPO-based Dynamic Control of Uncertain Floating Platforms in the Zero-G Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of space exploration, floating platforms play a crucial role in scientific investigations and technological advancements. However, controlling these platforms in zero-gravity environments presents unique challenges, including uncertainties and disturbances. This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Model Predictive Control (MPC) in the zero-gravity laboratory (Zero-G Lab) at the University of Luxembourg. This approach leverages PPO's reinforcement learning power and MPC's precision to navigate the complex control dynamics of floating platforms. Unlike traditional control methods, this PPO-MPC approach learns from MPC predictions, adapting to unmodeled dynamics and disturbances, resulting in a resilient control framework tailored to the zero-gravity environment. Simulations and experiments in the Zero-G Lab validate this approach, showcasing the adaptability of the PPO agent. This research opens new possibilities for controlling floating platforms in zero-gravity settings, promising advancements in space exploration.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tie-knotting task is highly challenging due to the tie's high deformation and long-horizon manipulation actions. This work presents TieBot, a Real-to-Sim-to-Real learning from visual demonstration system for the robots to learn to knot a tie. We introduce the Hierarchical Feature Matching approach to estimate a sequence of tie's meshes from the demonstration video. With these estimated meshes used as subgoals, we first learn a teacher policy using privileged information. Then, we learn a student policy with point cloud observation by imitating teacher policy. Lastly, our pipeline learns a residual policy when the learned policy is applied to real-world execution, mitigating the Sim2Real gap. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TieBot in simulation and the real world. In the real-world experiment, a dual-arm robot successfully knots a tie, achieving 50% success rate among 10 trials.

      <title>Magnetic Hysteresis Modeling with Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hysteresis modeling is crucial to comprehend the behavior of magnetic devices, facilitating optimal designs. Hitherto, deep learning-based methods employed to model hysteresis, face challenges in generalizing to novel input magnetic fields. This paper addresses the generalization challenge by proposing neural operators for modeling constitutive laws that exhibit magnetic hysteresis by learning a mapping between magnetic fields. In particular, two prominent neural operators -- deep operator network and Fourier neural operator -- are employed to predict novel first-order reversal curves and minor loops, where novel means they are not used to train the model. In addition, a rate-independent Fourier neural operator is proposed to predict material responses at sampling rates different from those used during training to incorporate the rate-independent characteristics of magnetic hysteresis. The presented numerical experiments demonstrate that neural operators efficiently model magnetic hysteresis, outperforming the traditional neural recurrent methods on various metrics and generalizing to novel magnetic fields. The findings emphasize the advantages of using neural operators for modeling hysteresis under varying magnetic conditions, underscoring their importance in characterizing magnetic material based devices.</description>

      <title>Final-state, Open-loop Control of Parabolic PDEs with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a quadratic optimal control problem is considered for second-order parabolic PDEs with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, in which the "point" control function (depending only on time) constitutes a source term. These problems involve choosing a control function (with or without "peak-value" constraints) to approximately steer the solution of the PDE in question to a desired function at the end of a prescribed (finite) time-interval. To compute approximations to the desired optimal control functions, semi-discrete, Galerkin approximations to the equation involved are introduced and the corresponding (approximating) control problems are tackled. It is shown that the sequences of solutions to both the constrained and unconstrained approximating (finite-dimensional) control problems converge, respectively, to the optimal solutions of the control problems involving the original initial/boundary value problem. The solution to the unconstrained approximating problem can be quite explicitly characterized, with the main numerical step for its computation requiring only the solution of a Lyapunov equation. Whereas approximate solutions to the constrained control problems can be obtained on the basis of Lagrangian duality and piecewise linear multipliers. These points are worked out in detail and illustrated by numerical examples involving the heat equation (HEq).</description>

      <title>Traffic State Estimation for Connected Vehicles using the Second-Order Aw-Rascle-Zhang Traffic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of traffic state estimation (TSE) in the presence of heterogeneous sensors which include both fixed and moving sensors. Traditional fixed sensors are expensive and cannot be installed throughout the highway. Moving sensors such as Connected Vehicles (CVs) offer a relatively cheap alternative to measure traffic states across the network. Moving forward it is thus important to develop such models that effectively use the data from CVs. One such model is the nonlinear second-order Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model which is a realistic traffic model, reliable for TSE and control. A state-space formulation is presented for the ARZ model considering junctions in the formulation which is important to model real highways with ramps. A Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) implementation is presented for TSE using a linearized ARZ model. Various state-estimation methods used for TSE in the literature along with the presented approach are compared with regard to accuracy and computational tractability with the help of a numerical study using the VISSIM traffic simulation software. The impact of various strategies for querying CV data on the estimation performance is also considered. Several research questions are posed and addressed with a thorough analysis of the results.</description>

      <title>Regret Optimal Control for Uncertain Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider control of uncertain linear time-varying stochastic systems from the perspective of regret minimization. Specifically, we focus on the problem of designing a feedback controller that minimizes the loss relative to a clairvoyant optimal policy that has foreknowledge of both the system dynamics and the exogenous disturbances. In this competitive framework, establishing robustness guarantees proves challenging as, differently from the case where the model is known, the clairvoyant optimal policy is not only inapplicable, but also impossible to compute without knowledge of the system parameters. To address this challenge, we embrace a scenario optimization approach, and we propose minimizing regret robustly over a finite set of randomly sampled system parameters. We prove that this policy optimization problem can be solved through semidefinite programming, and that the corresponding solution retains strong probabilistic out-of-sample regret guarantees in face of the uncertain dynamics. Our method naturally extends to include satisfaction of safety constraints with high probability. We validate our theoretical results and showcase the potential of our approach by means of numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose using a hierarchical retail market structure to alert and dispatch resources to mitigate cyber-physical attacks on a distribution grid. We simulate attacks where a number of generation nodes in a distribution grid are attacked. We show that the market is able to successfully meet the shortfall between demand and supply by utilizing the flexibility of remaining resources while minimizing any extra power that needs to be imported from the main transmission grid. This includes utilizing upward flexibility or reserves of remaining online generators and some curtailment or shifting of flexible loads, which results in higher costs. Using price signals and market-based coordination, the grid operator can achieve its objectives without direct control over distributed energy resources and is able to accurately compensate prosumers for the grid support they provide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of graphon particle systems with time-varying random coefficients. In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Comparing Lazy Constraint Selection Strategies in Train Routing with Moving Block Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Railroad transportation plays a vital role in the future of sustainable mobility. Besides building new infrastructure, capacity can be improved by modern train control systems, e.g., based on moving blocks. At the same time, there is only limited work on how to optimally route trains using the potential gained by these systems. Recently, an initial approach for train routing with moving block control has been proposed to address this demand. However, detailed evaluations on so-called lazy constraints are missing, and no publicly available implementation exists. In this work, we close this gap by providing an extended approach as well as a flexible open-source implementation that can use different solving strategies. Using that, we experimentally evaluate what choices should be made when implementing a lazy constraint approach. The corresponding implementation and benchmarks are publicly available as part of the Munich Train Control Toolkit (MTCT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.</description>

Abstract: The convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic produces good solutions to the Euclidean Traveling Salesperson Problem, but it has never been extended to the non-Euclidean problem. This paper uses multidimensional scaling to first project the points from a non-Euclidean space into a Euclidean space, enabling the generation of a convex hull that initializes the algorithm. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, non-Euclidean spaces are created by adding separators to the TSPLIB data-set, or by using the L1 norm as a metric.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Decision-Making and the k-Strong Price of Anarchy in Common Interest Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of large-scale, multi-agent systems often entails distributing decision-making across the system components. However, with advances in communication and computation technologies, we can consider new collaborative decision-making paradigms that exist somewhere between centralized and distributed control. In this work, we seek to understand the benefits and costs of increased collaborative communication in multi-agent systems. We specifically study this in the context of common interest games in which groups of up to k agents can coordinate their actions in maximizing the common objective function. The equilibria that emerge in these systems are the k-strong Nash equilibria of the common interest game; studying the properties of these states can provide relevant insights into the efficacy of inter-agent collaboration. Our contributions come threefold: 1) provide bounds on how well k-strong Nash equilibria approximate the optimal system welfare, formalized by the k-strong price of anarchy, 2) study the run-time and transient performance of collaborative agent-based dynamics, and 3) consider the task of redesigning objectives for groups of agents which improve system performance. We study these three facets generally as well as in the context of resource allocation problems, in which we provide tractable linear programs that give tight bounds on the k-strong price of anarchy.</description>

      <title>Minimax problems for ensembles of affine-control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider ensembles of affine-control systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and we study simultaneous optimal control problems related to the worst-case minimization. After proving that such problems admit solutions, denoting with $(\Theta^N)_N$ a sequence of compact sets that parametrize the ensembles of systems, we first show that the corresponding minimax optimal control problems are $\Gamma$-convergent whenever $(\Theta^N)_N$ has a limit with respect to the Hausdorff distance. Besides its independent interest, the previous result is crucial role for establishing the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) when the ensemble is parametrized by a set $\Theta$ consisting of infinitely many points. Namely, we first approximate $\Theta$ by finite and increasing-in-size sets $(\Theta^N)_N$ for which the PMP is known, and then we derive the PMP for the $\Gamma$-limiting problem. The same strategy can be pursued in applications, where we can reduce infinite ensembles to finite ones to compute the minimizers numerically. We bring as a numerical example the Schr\"odinger equation for a qubit with uncertain resonance frequency.</description>
