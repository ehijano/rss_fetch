      <title>FLARE: Flying Learning Agents for Resource Efficiency in Next-Gen UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter addresses a critical challenge in the context of 6G and beyond wireless networks, the joint optimization of power and bandwidth resource allocation for aerial intelligent platforms, specifically uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), operating in highly dynamic environments with mobile ground user equipment (UEs). We introduce FLARE (Flying Learning Agents for Resource Efficiency), a learning-enabled aerial intelligence framework that jointly optimizes UAV positioning, altitude, transmit power, and bandwidth allocation in real-time. To adapt to UE mobility, we employ Silhouette-based K-Means clustering, enabling dynamic grouping of users and UAVs' deployment at cluster centroids for efficient service delivery. The problem is modeled as a multi-agent control task, with bandwidth discretized into resource blocks and power treated as a continuous variable. To solve this, our proposed framework, FLARE, employs a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that combines Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to enhance learning efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances user coverage, achieving a 73.45% improvement in the number of served users under a 5 Mbps data rate constraint, outperforming MADDPG baseline.</description>

      <title>Automatic Network Planning with Digital Radio Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network planning seeks to determine base station parameters that maximize coverage and capacity in cellular networks. However, achieving optimal planning remains challenging due to the diversity of deployment scenarios and the significant simulation-to-reality discrepancy. In this paper, we propose \emph{AutoPlan}, a new automatic network planning framework by leveraging digital radio twin (DRT) techniques. We derive the DRT by finetuning the parameters of building materials to reduce the sim-to-real discrepancy based on crowdsource real-world user data. Leveraging the DRT, we design a Bayesian optimization based algorithm to optimize the deployment parameters of base stations efficiently. Using the field measurement from Husker-Net, we extensively evaluate \emph{AutoPlan} under various deployment scenarios, in terms of both coverage and capacity. The evaluation results show that \emph{AutoPlan} flexibly adapts to different scenarios and achieves performance comparable to exhaustive search, while requiring less than 2\% of its computation time.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Assisted Resilient Planning for mmWave IAB Networks via Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technology enables real-time monitoring and optimization of complex network infrastructures by creating accurate virtual replicas of physical systems. In millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G/6G networks, the deployment of Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) nodes faces highly dynamic urban environments, necessitating intelligent DT-enabled optimization frameworks. Traditional IAB deployment optimization approaches struggle with the combinatorial complexity of jointly optimizing coverage, connectivity, and resilience, often leading to suboptimal solutions that are vulnerable to network disruptions. With this consideration, we propose a novel Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2)-based reinforcement learning approach for resilient IAB deployment in urban mmWave networks. Specifically, we formulate the deployment problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with explicit resilience constraints and employ edge-conditioned GATv2 to capture complex spatial dependencies between heterogeneous node types and dynamic connectivity patterns. The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on critical deployment locations to maximize coverage and ensure fault tolerance through redundant backhaul connections. To address the inherent vulnerability of mmWave links, we train the GATv2 policy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a carefully designed balance between coverage, cost, and resilience. Comprehensive simulations across three urban scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves 98.5-98.7 percent coverage with 14.3-26.7 percent fewer nodes than baseline approaches, while maintaining 87.1 percent coverage retention under 30 percent link failures, representing 11.3-15.4 percent improvement in fault tolerance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Unified Learning-based Optimization Framework for 0-1 Mixed Problems in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several wireless networking problems are often posed as 0-1 mixed optimization problems, which involve binary variables (e.g., selection of access points, channels, and tasks) and continuous variables (e.g., allocation of bandwidth, power, and computing resources). Traditional optimization methods as well as reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been widely exploited to solve these problems under different network scenarios. However, solving such problems becomes more challenging when dealing with a large network scale, multi-dimensional radio resources, and diversified service requirements. To this end, in this paper, a unified framework that combines RL and optimization theory is proposed to solve 0-1 mixed optimization problems in wireless networks. First, RL is used to capture the process of solving binary variables as a sequential decision-making task. During the decision-making steps, the binary (0-1) variables are relaxed and, then, a relaxed problem is solved to obtain a relaxed solution, which serves as prior information to guide RL searching policy. Then, at the end of decision-making process, the search policy is updated via suboptimal objective value based on decisions made. The performance bound and convergence guarantees of the proposed framework are then proven theoretically. An extension of this approach is provided to solve problems with a non-convex objective function and/or non-convex constraints. Numerical results show that the proposed approach reduces the convergence time by about 30% over B&amp;B in small-scale problems with slightly higher objective values. In large-scale scenarios, it can improve the normalized objective values by 20% over RL with a shorter convergence time.</description>

      <title>Joint AoI and Handover Optimization in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread deployment of terrestrial networks, providing reliable communication services to remote areas and maintaining connectivity during emergencies remains challenging. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer promising solutions with their global coverage capabilities and reduced latency, yet struggle with intermittent coverage and limited communication windows due to orbital dynamics. This paper introduces an age of information (AoI)-aware space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture that leverages a high-altitude platform (HAP) as intelligent relay between the LEO satellites and ground terminals. Our three-layer design employs hybrid free-space optical (FSO) links for high-capacity satellite-to-HAP communication and reliable radio frequency (RF) links for HAP-to-ground transmission, and thus addressing the temporal discontinuity in LEO satellite coverage while serving diverse user priorities. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the AoI and satellite handover frequency through optimal transmit power distribution and satellite selection decisions. This highly dynamic, non-convex problem with time-coupled constraints presents significant computational challenges for traditional approaches. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-enhanced dueling double deep Q-network with action decomposition and state transformer encoder (DD3QN-AS) algorithm that incorporates transformer-based temporal feature extraction and employs a DM-based latent prompt generative module to refine state-action representations through conditional denoising. Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with policy-based methods and some other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) benchmarks.</description>

      <title>State Aware Traffic Generation for Real-Time Network Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) enable smarter, self-optimizing mobile networks, but they rely on a steady supply of real world data. Collecting and transferring complete traces in real time is a significant challenge. We present a compact traffic generator that combines hidden Markov model, capturing the broad rhythms of buffering, streaming and idle periods, with a small feed forward mixture density network that generates realistic payload sizes and inter-arrival times to be fed to the DT. This traffic generator trains in seconds on a server GPU, runs in real time and can be fine tuned inside the DT whenever the statistics of the generated data do not match the actual traffic. This enables operators to keep their DT up to date without causing overhead to the operational network. The results show that the traffic generator presented is able to derive realistic packet traces of payload length and inter-arrival time across various metrics that assess distributional fidelity, diversity, and temporal correlation of the synthetic trace.</description>

      <title>It Takes a Village: Bridging the Gaps between Current and Formal Specifications for Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal specifications have numerous benefits for both designers and users of network protocols. They provide clear, unambiguous representations, which are useful as documentation and for testing. They can help reveal disagreements about what a protocol "is" and identify areas where further work is needed to resolve ambiguities or internal inconsistencies. They also provide a foundation for formal reasoning, making it possible to establish important security and correctness guarantees on all inputs and in every environment. Despite these advantages, formal methods are not widely used to design, implement, and validate network protocols today. Instead, Internet protocols are usually described in informal documents, such as IETF Requests for Comments (RFCs) or IEEE standards. These documents primarily consist of lengthy prose descriptions, accompanied by pseudocode, header descriptions, state machine diagrams, and reference implementations which are used for interoperability testing. So, while RFCs and reference implementations were only intended to help guide the social process used by protocol designers, they have evolved into the closest things to formal specifications the Internet community has. In this paper, we discuss the different roles that specifications play in the networking and formal methods communities. We then illustrate the potential benefits of specifying protocols formally, presenting highlights from several recent success stories. Finally, we identify key differences between how formal specifications are understood by the two communities and suggest possible strategies to bridge the gaps.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy Agentic IoEV: AI Agents for Explainable Cyberthreat Mitigation and State Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV) envisions a tightly coupled ecosystem of electric vehicles (EVs), charging infrastructure, and grid services, yet it remains vulnerable to cyberattacks, unreliable battery-state predictions, and opaque decision processes that erode trust and performance. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AAI) framework tailored for IoEV, where specialized agents collaborate to deliver autonomous threat mitigation, robust analytics, and interpretable decision support. Specifically, we design an AAI architecture comprising dedicated agents for cyber-threat detection and response at charging stations, real-time State of Charge (SoC) estimation, and State of Health (SoH) anomaly detection, all coordinated through a shared, explainable reasoning layer; develop interpretable threat-mitigation mechanisms that proactively identify and neutralize attacks on both physical charging points and learning components; propose resilient SoC and SoH models that leverage continuous and adversarial-aware learning to produce accurate, uncertainty-aware forecasts with human-readable explanations; and implement a three-agent pipeline, where each agent uses LLM-driven reasoning and dynamic tool invocation to interpret intent, contextualize tasks, and execute formal optimizations for user-centric assistance. Finally, we validate our framework through comprehensive experiments across diverse IoEV scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in security and prediction accuracy. All datasets, models, and code will be released publicly.</description>

      <title>Secure and Efficient Out-of-band Call Metadata Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The STIR/SHAKEN (S/S) attestation Framework mandated by the United States, Canada, and France to combat pervasive telephone abuse has not achieved its goals, partly because legacy non-VoIP infrastructure could not participate. The industry solution to extend S/S broadcasts sensitive metadata of every non-VoIP call in plaintext to every third party required to facilitate the system. It has no mechanism to determine whether a provider's request for call data is appropriate, nor can it ensure that every copy of that call data is unavailable after its specified expiration. It threatens subscriber privacy and provider confidentiality.
  In this paper, we present Sidecar, a distributed, privacy-preserving system with tunable decentralization that securely extends S/S across all telephone network technologies. We introduce the notion of secure out-of-band signaling for telephony and formalize its system and security requirements. We then design novel, scalable protocols that realize these requirements and prove their security within the Universal Composability framework. Finally, we demonstrate Sidecar's efficiency with our open-sourced reference implementation. Compared to the current solution, Sidecar 1) protects the confidentiality of subscriber identity and provider trade secrets, 2) guarantees record expiration as long as a single node handling a record is honest, 3) reduces resource requirements while providing virtually identical call-setup times and equivalent or better uptimes, and 4) enables secure pay-per-use billing and integrates mechanisms to mitigate and detect misbehavior. Moreover, Sidecar can be extended to provide the same security guarantees for arbitrary call metadata. Not only is Sidecar a superior approach, it is also a transformative tool to retrofit fragmented global telephony and enable future improvements, such as stronger call authentication and Branded Calling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanners are daily visitors of public IPv4 hosts. Scanning IPv6 nodes successfully is still a challenge, which an increasing crowd of actors tries to master. In this paper, we analyze current IPv6 scanning under various network conditions. We observe scanner behavior during eleven months in four network telescopes, one of which is periodically reconfigured by changing BGP announcements. We analyze and classify the observed scanners w.r.t. their temporal behavior, their target, and network selection strategy, as well as their individual tools, fingerprints, and correlations across categories. We find that silent subnets of larger prefixes remain invisible, whereas BGP prefix announcements quickly attract attention by scanners. Based on our findings, we derive operational guidance on how to deploy network telescopes to increase visibility of IPv6 scanners.</description>

      <title>Federated Foundation Models in Harsh Wireless Environments: Prospects, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generalized intelligence, multimodal understanding, and adaptive learning across a wide range of domains. However, their deployment in harsh or austere environments -- characterized by intermittent connectivity, limited computation, noisy data, and dynamically changing network topologies -- remains an open challenge. Existing distributed learning methods such as federated learning (FL) struggle to adapt in such settings due to their reliance on stable infrastructure, synchronized updates, and resource-intensive training. In this work, we explore the potential of Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) as a promising paradigm to address these limitations. By integrating the scalability and generalization power of FMs with novel decentralized, communication-aware FL frameworks, we aim to enable robust, energy-efficient, and adaptive intelligence in extreme and adversarial conditions. We present a detailed breakdown of system-level constraints in harsh environments, and discuss the open research challenges in communication design, model robustness, and energy-efficient personalization for these unique settings.</description>

      <title>Online Learning Based Efficient Resource Allocation for LoRaWAN Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of large-scale LoRaWAN networks requires jointly optimizing conflicting metrics like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and Energy Efficiency (EE) by dynamically allocating transmission parameters, including Carrier Frequency, Spreading Factor, and Transmission Power. Existing methods often oversimplify this challenge, focusing on a single metric or lacking the adaptability needed for dynamic channel environments, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose two online learning-based resource allocation frameworks that intelligently navigate the PDR-EE trade-off. Our foundational proposal, D-LoRa, is a fully distributed framework that models the problem as a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit. By decomposing the joint parameter selection and employing specialized, disaggregated reward functions, D-LoRa dramatically reduces learning complexity and enables nodes to autonomously adapt to network dynamics. To further enhance performance in LoRaWAN networks, we introduce CD-LoRa, a hybrid framework that integrates a lightweight, centralized initialization phase to perform a one-time, quasi-optimal channel assignment and action space pruning, thereby accelerating subsequent distributed learning. Extensive simulations and real-world field experiments demonstrate the superiority of our frameworks, showing that D-LoRa excels in non-stationary environments while CD-LoRa achieves the fastest convergence in stationary conditions. In physical deployments, our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines, improving PDR by up to 10.8% and EE by 26.1%, confirming their practical effectiveness for scalable and efficient LoRaWAN networks.</description>

Abstract: Currently, the TCP/IP model enables exploitation of vulnerabilities anonymously by unconditionally fulfilling every request for a connection into an application; the model only incorporates authentication within applications themselves, rather than as a precondition for access into applications. I am proposing the Universal Session Protocol as a change to the architecture of the TCP/IP model to include a session layer featuring a structured generalized process for authentication negotiation and fulfillment. The Universal Session Protocol addresses an urgent and vital need to eliminate unauthenticated data processing on security critical systems. Previous work regarding TCP/IP security has focused on the application design and implementation and existing protocol layers, but has failed to posit the addition of a session layer as a mitigating control. Failing to implement a distinct authentication layer leaves every resource connected to the global Internet, including life and security critical infrastructure, vulnerable to attacks from anonymous and untraceable sources. The Universal Session Protocol provides a solution by establishing a TCP/IP Session Layer that explicitly provides authentication before a data stream is accessible within an application. After authentication, an identity is associated with the data stream so that all data may be related back to that identity for forensic purposes. If authentication fails, the application will never process user data, rendering the service safe from anonymous bad actors.</description>

      <title>AI/ML Based Detection and Categorization of Covert Communication in IPv6 Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flexibility and complexity of IPv6 extension headers allow attackers to create covert channels or bypass security mechanisms, leading to potential data breaches or system compromises. The mature development of machine learning has become the primary detection technology option used to mitigate covert communication threats. However, the complexity of detecting covert communication, evolving injection techniques, and scarcity of data make building machine-learning models challenging. In previous related research, machine learning has shown good performance in detecting covert communications, but oversimplified attack scenario assumptions cannot represent the complexity of modern covert technologies and make it easier for machine learning models to detect covert communications. To bridge this gap, in this study, we analyzed the packet structure and network traffic behavior of IPv6, used encryption algorithms, and performed covert communication injection without changing network packet behavior to get closer to real attack scenarios. In addition to analyzing and injecting methods for covert communications, this study also uses comprehensive machine learning techniques to train the model proposed in this study to detect threats, including traditional decision trees such as random forests and gradient boosting, as well as complex neural network architectures such as CNNs and LSTMs, to achieve detection accuracy of over 90\%. This study details the methods used for dataset augmentation and the comparative performance of the applied models, reinforcing insights into the adaptability and resilience of the machine learning application in IPv6 covert communication. We further introduce a Generative AI-driven script refinement framework, leveraging prompt engineering as a preliminary exploration of how generative agents can assist in covert communication detection and model enhancement.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Aware GPU Resource Allocation for Distributed LLM Inference via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large language model (LLM) services imposes increasing demands on distributed GPU inference infrastructure. Most existing scheduling systems follow a reactive paradigm, relying solely on the current system state to make decisions, without considering how task demand and resource availability evolve over time. This lack of temporal awareness in reactive approaches leads to inefficient GPU utilization, high task migration overhead, and poor system responsiveness under dynamic workloads. In this work, we identify the fundamental limitations of these instantaneous-state-only scheduling approaches and propose Temporal Optimal Resource scheduling via Two-layer Architecture (TORTA). TORTA introduces a spatiotemporal scheduling framework that captures both long-term workload patterns and short-term execution constraints. It adopts a two-layer design: a macro-level scheduler leverages reinforcement learning and optimal transport to coordinate inter-region task distribution, while a micro-level allocator refines task-to-server assignments within each region to reduce latency and switching costs. Experimental results across multiple network topologies show that TORTA reduces average inference response time by up to 15\%, improves load balance by approximately 4-5\%, and cuts total operational cost by 10-20\% compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained licensed bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL systems.</description>
