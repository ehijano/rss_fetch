      <title>Massive Compact Quiescent Galaxies in the $M_\star$ vs. $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ Plane: Insights from stellar Population Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the stellar population properties of a sample of 1858 massive compact galaxies (MCGs) extracted from the SDSS survey. Motivated by previous results showing that older compact galaxies tend to have larger velocity dispersion at fixed stellar mass, we used the distance to the $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ vs. $R_\mathrm{e}$ and $M_\star$ vs. $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ relations as selection criteria. We found that MCGs are old ($\gtrsim 10$ Gyr), $\alpha$-enhanced ([$\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}] \sim 0.2$) and have solar to super-solar stellar metallicities. Metallicity increases with $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$, while age and [$\alpha$/Fe] do not vary significantly. Moreover, at fixed $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$, metallicity and stellar mass are correlated. Compared to a control sample of typical quiescent galaxies, MCGs have, on average, lower metallicities than control sample galaxies (CSGs) of similar $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$. For $\sigma_\mathrm{e} \lesssim 225$ km/s, MCGs are older and more $\alpha$-enhanced than CSGs, while for higher $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ ages and $\alpha$-enhancement are similar. The differences in age and $\alpha$-enhancement can be explained by lower-$\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ CSGs being an amalgam of quiescent galaxies with a variety of ages. The origin of the differences in metallicity, however, is not clear. Lastly, we compared the stellar mass within the region probed by the SDSS fiber finding that, at fixed fiber velocity dispersion, MCGs have lower stellar masses on average. Since the velocity dispersion is a tracer of the dynamical mass, this raises the possibility that MCGs have, on average, a bottom heavier initial mass function or a larger dark matter fraction within the inner $\sim 1-2$ kpc.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal Catastrophe in Resonant Self-interacting Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model featuring a velocity-dependent cross section with an order-of-magnitude resonant enhancement of the cross section at $\sim 16\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. To understand the implications for the structure of dark matter halos, we perform N-body simulations of isolated dark matter halos of mass $\sim 10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$, a halo mass selected to have a maximum response to the resonance. We track the core formation and the gravothermal collapse phases of the dark matter halo in this model and compare the halo evolving with the resonant cross section with halos evolving with velocity-independent cross sections. We show that dark matter halo evolution with the resonant cross section exhibits a deviation from universality that characterizes halo evolution with velocity-independent cross sections. The halo evolving under the influence of the resonance reaches a lower minimum central density during core formation. It subsequently takes about $20\%$ longer to reach its initial central density during the collapse phase. These results motivate a more detailed exploration of halo evolution in models with pronounced resonances.</description>

      <title>Geometry, Dissipation, Cooling, and the Dynamical Evolution of Wind-Blown Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubbles driven by energy and mass injection from small scales are ubiquitous in astrophysical fluid systems and essential to feedback across multiple scales. In particular, O stars in young clusters produce high velocity winds that create hot bubbles in the surrounding gas. We demonstrate that the dynamical evolution of these bubbles is critically dependent upon the geometry of their interfaces with their surroundings and the nature of heat transport across these interfaces. These factors together determine the amount of energy that can be lost from the interior through cooling at the interface, which in turn determines the ability of the bubble to do work on its surroundings. We further demonstrate that the scales relevant to physical dissipation across this interface are extremely difficult to resolve in global numerical simulations of bubbles for parameter values of interest. This means the dissipation driving evolution of these bubbles in numerical simulations is often of a numerical nature. We describe the physical and numerical principles that determine the level of dissipation in these simulations; we use this, along with a fractal model for the geometry of the interfaces, to explain differences in convergence behavior between hydrodynamical and magneto-hydrodynamical simulations presented here. We additionally derive an expression for momentum as a function of bubble radius expected when the relevant dissipative scales are resolved and show that it still results in efficiently-cooled solutions as postulated in previous work.</description>

      <title>Star Formation Rates in [Ne V] 3426 \r{A} Selected Active Galactic Nuclei: Evidence for a Decrease along the Main Sequence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the behavior along the galaxy main sequence is key in furthering our understanding of the possible connection between AGN activity and star formation. We select a sample of 1215 AGN from the catalog of SDSS galaxy properties from the Portsmouth group by detection of the high-ionization [Ne V] 3426 \r{A} emission line. Our sample extends from 10$^{40}$ to 10$^{42.5}$ erg/s in [Ne V] luminosity in a redshift range z = 0.17 to 0.57. We compare the specific star formation rates (sSFRs, SFR scaled by galaxy mass) obtained from the corrected [O II] and H{\alpha} luminosities, and the SED-determined values from Portsmouth. We find that the emission-line-based sSFR values are unreliable for the [Ne V] sample due to the AGN contribution, and proceed with the SED sSFRs for our study of the main sequence. We find evidence for a decrease in sSFR along the main sequence in the [Ne V] sample which is consistent with results from the hard X-ray BAT AGN sample, which extends to lower redshifts than our [Ne V] sample. Although we do not find evidence that the concurrent AGN activity is suppressing star formation, our results are consistent with a lower gas fraction in the host galaxies of the AGN as compared to that of the star forming galaxies. If the evacuation of gas, and therefore suppression of star formation is due to AGN activity, it must have occurred in a previous epoch.</description>

      <title>Distance estimate method for Asymptotic Giant Branch stars using Infrared Spectral Energy Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to estimate distances to Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in the Galaxy, using spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in the near- and mid-infrared. By assuming that a given set of source properties (initial mass, stellar temperature, composition, and evolutionary stage) will provide a typical SED shape and brightness, sources are color-matched to a distance-calibrated template and thereafter scaled to extract the distance. The method is tested by comparing the distances obtained to those estimated from Very Long Baseline Interferometry or Gaia parallax measurements, yielding a strong correlation in both cases. Additional templates are formed by constructing a source sample likely to be close to the Galactic center, and thus with a common, typical distance for calibration of the templates. These first results provide statistical distance estimates to a set of almost 15,000 Milky Way AGB stars belonging to the Bulge Asymmetries and Dynamical Evolution (BAaDE) survey, with typical distance errors of $\pm 35$%. With these statistical distances a map of the intermediate-age population of stars traced by AGBs is formed, and a clear bar structure can be discerned, consistent with the previously reported inclination angle of 30$^\circ$ to the GC-Sun direction vector. These results motivate deeper studies of the AGB population to tease out the intermediate-age stellar distribution throughout the Galaxy, as well as determining statistical properties of the AGB population luminosity and mass-loss rate distributions.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric drift in MaNGA: Mass and radially-dependent stratification rates in galaxy disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the age-velocity relationship from the lag between ionized gas and stellar tangential speeds in ~500 nearby disk galaxies from MaNGA in SDSS-IV. Selected galaxies are kinematically axisymmetric. Velocity lags are asymmetric drift, seen in the Milky Way's (MW) solar neighborhood and other Local Group galaxies; their amplitude correlates with stellar population age. The trend is qualitatively consistent in rate (d(sigma)/dt) with a simple power-law model where sigma is proportional to t^b that explains the dynamical phase-space stratification in the solar neighborhood. The model is generalized based on disk dynamical times to other radii and other galaxies. We find in-plane radial stratification parameters sigma_(0,r} (dispersion of the youngest populations) in the range of 10-40 km/s and 0.2&lt;b_r&lt;0.5 for MaNGA galaxies. Overall b_r increases with galaxy mass, decreases with radius for galaxies above 10.4 dex (M_solar) in stellar mass, but is ~constant with radius at lower mass. The measurement scatter indicates the stratification model is too simple to capture the complexity seen in the data, unsurprising given the many possible astrophysical processes that may lead to stellar population dynamical stratification. Nonetheless, the data show dynamical stratification is broadly present in the galaxy population, with systematic trends in mass and density. The amplitude of the asymmetric drift signal is larger for the MaNGA sample than the MW, and better represented in the mean by what is observed in the disks of M31 and M33. Either typical disks have higher surface-density or, more likely, are dynamically hotter (hence thicker) than the MW.</description>

      <title>Discovery of merging twin quasars at z = 6.05</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two quasars at a redshift of $z$ = 6.05, in the process of merging. They were serendipitously discovered from the deep multi-band imaging data collected by the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program survey. The quasars, HSC $J$121503.42$-$014858.7 (C1) and HSC $J$121503.55$-$014859.3 (C2), both have luminous ($&gt;$10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) Ly$\alpha$ emission with a clear broad component (full width at half maximum $&gt;$1000 km s$^{-1}$). The rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) absolute magnitudes are $M_{1450} = -23.106 \pm 0.017$ (C1) and $-22.662 \pm 0.024$ (C2). Our crude estimates of the black hole masses provide $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) = 8.1 \pm 0.3$ in both sources. The two quasars are separated by 12 kpc in projected proper distance, bridged by a structure in the rest-UV light suggesting that they are undergoing a merger. This pair is one of the most distant merging quasars reported to date, providing crucial insight into galaxy and black hole build-up in the hierarchical structure formation scenario. A companion paper will present the gas and dust properties captured by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations, which provide additional evidence for and detailed measurements of the merger and also demonstrate that the two sources are not gravitationally-lensed images of a single quasar.</description>

      <title>Merging gas-rich galaxies that harbor low-luminosity twin quasars at z = 6.05: a promising progenitor of the most luminous quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA [CII] 158 $\mu$m line and underlying far-infrared continuum emission observations ($0''.57 \times 0''.46$ resolution) toward a quasar-quasar pair system recently discovered at $z = 6.05$ (Matsuoka et al. 2024). The quasar nuclei (C1 and C2) are very faint ($M_{\rm 1450} \gtrsim -23$ mag), but we detect very bright [CII] emission bridging the 12 kpc between the two objects and extending beyond them (total luminosity $L_{\rm [CII]} \simeq 6 \times 10^9~L_\odot$). The total star formation rate of the system is $\sim 100$ to 550 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, with a [CII]-based total gas mass of $\sim 10^{11}~M_\odot$. The dynamical masses of the two galaxies are large ($\sim 9 \times 10^{10}~M_\odot$ for C1 and $\sim 5 \times 10^{10}~M_\odot$ for C2). There is a smooth velocity gradient in [CII], indicating that these quasars are a tidally interacting system. We identified a dynamically distinct, fast [CII] component around C1. Detailed inspection of the line spectrum reveals the presence of a broad wing component, which we interpret as the indication of fast outflows with a velocity of $\sim 600$ km s$^{-1}$. The expected mass loading factor of the outflows, after accounting for multiphase gas, would be $\gtrsim 3-8$, as expected for an AGN-driven outflow. Hydrodynamic simulations in the literature predicted that this pair will evolve to a luminous ($M_{\rm 1450} \lesssim -26$ mag), starbursting ($\gtrsim 1000~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) quasar after coalescence, one of the most extreme populations in the early universe.</description>

      <title>A catalog of newly discovered close binary open clusters in the Milky Way from Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented precision in Gaia measurements of parallax allows us to capture a larger number of binary clusters. With the releases of Gaia data, the number of Galactic open clusters (OCs) increases with great rapidity, providing an excellent opportunity to confirm more binary clusters in the Milky Way. Using a recently released OC catalog, we employed the photometric and astrometric data of and OCs and their member stars to find close binary open clusters (CBOCs). The 3-dimensional spatial coordinates, proper motions, and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and a new CBOC identification technique are used for identifying CBOCs. We finally found 13 new pairs of CBOCs. The fundamental parameters of these CBOCs are determined by fitting the CMDs to the isochrones of stellar populations. When we check the similarity of reddenings, ages and metallicities of the sub-clusters of CBOCs, eight CBOCs are shown to be primordial binary open clusters (PBOCs). This paper reports the detailed data of the 13 newly found CBOCs, which will help us to do many further researches on binary star clusters.</description>

      <title>A new timescale-mass scaling for the optical variation of active galactic nuclei across the intermediate-mass to supermassive scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has long been servicing as an essential avenue of exploring the accretion physics of black hole (BH). There are two commonly used methods for analyzing AGN variability. First, the AGN variability, characterized by the structure function (SF) of a single band, can be well described by a damped random walk (DRW) process on timescales longer than ~weeks, shorter than which departures have been reported. Second, the color variation (CV) between two bands behaves timescale-dependent, raising challenges to the widely accepted reprocessing scenario. However, both the departure from the DRW process and the timescale-dependent CV are hitherto limited to AGNs, mainly quasars, at the supermassive scale. Here, utilizing the high-cadence multi-wavelength monitoring on NGC 4395 harboring an intermediate-mass BH, we unveil at the intermediate-mass scale for the first time, prominent departures from the DRW process at timescales shorter than ~hours in all three nights and bands, and plausible timescale-dependent CVs in the two longest nights of observation. Furthermore, comparing SFs of NGC 4395 to four AGNs at the supermassive scale, we suggest a new scaling relation between the timescale (\uptau; across nearly three orders of magnitude) and the BH mass (M_BH): \uptau \propto M^\gamma_BH where the exponent \gamma is likely ~ 0.6 - 0.8. This exponent differs from most previous measurements, but confirms a few and is consistent with a recent theoretical prediction, suggesting a similar accretion process in AGNs across different mass scales.</description>

      <title>Close Encounters of Wide Binaries Induced by the Galactic Tide: Implications for Stellar Mergers and Gravitational-Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A substantial fraction of stars can be found in wide binaries with projected separations between $\sim10^2$ and $10^5\,\rm AU$. In the standard lore of binary physics, these would evolve as effectively single stars that remotely orbit one another on stationary Keplerian ellipses. However, embedded in their Galactic environment their low binding energy makes them exceptionally prone to perturbations from the gravitational potential of the Milky Way and encounters with passing stars. Employing a fully relativistic $N$-body integration scheme, we study the impact of these perturbations on the orbital evolution of wide binaries along their trajectory through the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals that the torques exerted by the Galaxy can cause large-amplitude oscillations of the binary eccentricity to $1-e\lesssim10^{-8}$. As a consequence, the wide binary members pass close to each other at periapsis, which, depending on the type of binary, potentially leads to a mass transfer or collision of stars or to an inspiral and subsequent merger of compact remnants due to gravitational-wave radiation. Based on a simulation of $10^5$ wide binaries across the Galactic field, we find that this mechanism could significantly contribute to the rate of stellar collisions and binary black hole mergers as inferred from observations of Luminous Red Novae and gravitational-wave events by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra. We conclude that the dynamics of wide binaries, despite their large mean separation, can give rise to extreme interactions between stars and compact remnants.</description>

      <title>MHD Modeling of the Molecular Filament Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of a cylindrical molecular cloud with the help of the FLASH code. The cloud collapses rapidly along its radius without any signs of fragmentation in the simulations without magnetic field. The radial collapse of the cloud is stopped by the magnetic pressure gradient in the simulations with parallel magnetic field. Cores with high density form at the cloud ends during further evolution. The core densities are $n \approx 1.7 \cdot 10^{8}$ and $2 \cdot 10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the cases with initial magnetic field strengths $B = 1.9 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and $6 \cdot 10^{-4}$ G, respectively. The cores move toward the cloud center with supersonic speeds $|v_{z}|=3.6$ and $5.3$ km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. The sizes of the cores along the filaments radius and filament main axis are $d_{r} = 0.0075$ pc and $d_{z} = 0.025$ pc, $d_{r} = 0.03$ pc and $d_{z} = 0.025$ pc, respectively. The masses of the cores increase during the filament evolution and lie in range of $\approx 10-20\,M_\odot$. According to our results, the cores observed at the edges of molecular filaments can be a result of the filament evolution with parallel magnetic field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) We present narrow-band images in several emission lines, and high- and intermediate-resolution long-slit spectra of Me2-1 to investigate its morphology and 3D structure, its physical parameters and chemical abundances. We identified in Me2-1: an elliptical ring; two elongated, curved structures (caps) that contain three pairs of bright point-symmetric (PS) knots; a shell interior of the ring; and a faint halo or attached shell. The caps are observed in all images, the PS knots only in the low-excitation emission line ones. These structures are also identified in the high-resolution long-slit spectra. The 3D reconstruction shows that Me2-1 consists of a ring seen almost pole-on, and a virtually spherical shell, to which the caps and PS knots are attached. Caps and PS knots most probably trace the sites where high-velocity collimated bipolar outflows, ejected along a wobbling axis, collide with the spherical shell, are slowed down, and remain attached to it. Although the main excitation mechanism in Me2-1 is found to be photoionization, a contribution of shocks in the PS knots is suggested by their emission line ratios. The combination of collimated outflows and a ring with a spherical shell is unusual among planetary nebulae. We speculate that two planets, each with less than one Jupiter mass, could be involved in the formation of Me2-1 if both enter a common envelope evolution during the asymptotic giant branch phase of the progenitor. One planet is tidally disrupted, forming an accretion disk around the central star, from which collimated bipolar outflows are ejected; the other planet survives, causing wobbling of the accretion disk. The derived physical parameters and chemical abundances are similar to those obtained in previous analyses, with the abundances also pointing to a low-mass progenitor of Me2-1.</description>

      <title>Four-hundred Very Metal-poor Stars Studied with LAMOST and Subaru. III. Dynamically Tagged Groups and Chemodynamical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very metal-poor (VMP) stars record the signatures of early accreted galaxies, making them essential tools for unraveling the early stages of Galaxy formation. Understanding the origin of VMP stars requires comprehensive studies of their chemical compositions and kinematics, which are currently lacking. Hence, we conduct a chemodynamical analysis of 352 VMP stars selected from one of the largest uniform high-resolution VMP star samples, jointly obtained from LAMOST and Subaru. We apply a friends-of-friends clustering algorithm to the master catalog of this high-resolution sample, which consists of 5778 VMP stars. It results in 131 dynamically tagged groups with 89 associated with known substructures in the Milky Way, including Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Thamnos, Helmi streams, Sequoia, Wukong, Pontus, and the very metal-poor disk (VMPD). Our findings are: (i) the VMPD shows lower Zn abundances than the rest, which indicates that it could be a relic of small stellar systems; (ii) Sequoia shows moderately high r-process abundances; (iii) Helmi streams show deficiencies in carbon and light neutron-capture elements; (iv) the fraction of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with no enhancement in heavy elements (CEMP-no stars) seems low in the VMPD and the Helmi streams; and (v) a subgroup in GSE exhibits a very high fraction of r-process enhanced stars, with four out of five showing [Eu/Fe]&gt; +1.0. The abundance patterns of other elements in VMP substructures largely match the whole VMP sample. We also study large-scale correlations between abundance ratios and kinematics without classifying stars into substructures, but it does not yield significant correlations once the overall chemical evolution is considered for most elements.</description>

      <title>A census of new globular clusters in the Galactic bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of known globular clusters in the Galactic bulge has been increasing steadily thanks to different new surveys. The aim of this study is to provide a census of the newly revealed globular clusters in the Galactic bulge, and analyze their characteristics. In recent years, many globular clusters have been discovered or identified. The stellar populations to which they belong are indicated in their original studies: they are mostly bulge clusters, with some identified as disk or halo members. We collected 41 new globular clusters revealed in the last decade and compared them to the known bulge clusters. The new clusters are intrinsically faint with $M_V$ of around -6.0 mag. The distance to the Sun of the ensemble of well-known and new bulge clusters is compatible with the Galactocentric distance measurements from the Galactic black hole location. The ensemble sample shows metallicity peaks at [Fe/H] ~ -1.08 $\pm$ 0.35 and -0.51 $\pm$ 0.25 dex, confirming previous findings. The age-metallicity relation of the new clusters younger than 10 Gyr is compatible with that of the ex situ samples of the dwarf galaxies Sagittarius, Canis Majoris, and Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage. The clusters with ages between 11.5 and 13.5 Gyr show no age-metallicity relation, because they are all old. This is compatible with their formation in situ in the early Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Galaxies with Biconical Ionized Structure in MaNGA - I. Sample Selection and Driven Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the integral field unit (IFU) data from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, we develop a new method to select galaxies with biconical ionized structures, building a sample of 142 edge-on biconical ionized galaxies. We classify these 142 galaxies into 81 star-forming galaxies, 31 composite galaxies, and 30 AGNs (consisting of 23 Seyferts and 7 LI(N)ERs) according to the {\nii}-BPT diagram. The star-forming bicones have bar-like structures while AGN bicones display hourglass structures, and composite bicones exhibit transitional morphologies between them due to both black hole and star-formation activities. Star-forming bicones have intense star-formation activities in their central regions, and the primary driver of biconical structures is the central star formation rate surface density. The lack of difference in the strength of central black hole activities (traced by dust attenuation corrected {\oiii}$\lambda$5007 luminosity and Eddington ratio) between Seyfert bicones and their control samples can be naturally explained as that the accretion disk and the galactic disk are not necessarily coplanar. Additionally, the biconical galaxies with central LI(N)ER-like line ratios are edge-on disk galaxies that show strong central dust attenuation. The radial gradients of {\ha} surface brightness follow the $r^{-2.35}$ relation, roughly consistent with $r^{-2}$ profile, which is expected in the case of photoionization by a central point-like source. These observations indicate obscured AGNs or AGN echoes as the primary drivers of biconical structures in LI(N)ERs.</description>

      <title>On bursty star formation during cosmological reionization - how does it influence the baryon mass content of dark matter halos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryon mass content of dark matter halos in the early Universe depends on global factors - e.g. ionising ultraviolet (UV) radiation background - and local factors - e.g. star formation efficiency and assembly history. We use a lightweight semi-analytical model to investigate how local and global factors impact halo baryon mass content at redshifts of $z\geq 5$. Our model incorporates a time delay between when stars form and when they produce feedback, which drive bursts of star formation, and a mass and redshift dependent UV background, which captures the influence of cosmological reionization on gas accretion onto halos. We use statistically representative halo assembly histories and assume that the cosmological gas accretion rate is proportional to the halo mass accretion rate. Delayed feedback leads to oscillations in gas mass with cosmic time, behaviour that cannot be captured with instantaneous feedback. Highly efficient star formation drives stronger oscillations, while strong feedback impacts when oscillations occur; in contrast, inefficient star formation and weak feedback produce similar long-term behaviour to that observed in instantaneous feedback models. If the delayed feedback timescale is too long, a halo retains its gas reservoir but the feedback suppresses star formation. Our model predicts that lower mass systems ($\leq 10^7 \text{M}_\odot$) at $z \leq 10$ should be strongly gas deficient, whereas higher mass systems retain their gas reservoirs because they are sufficiently massive to continue accreting gas through cosmological reionization. Interestingly, in higher mass halos, the median $m_\star/(m_\star+m_\text{g}) \simeq 0.01-0.05$, but is a factor of 3-5 smaller when feedback is delayed. Our model does not include seed supermassive black hole feedback, which is necessary to explain massive quenched galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Accretion Efficiency Evolution of Central Supermassive Black Holes in Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing debate regarding the most accurate accretion model for supermassive black holes at the center of quasars has remained a contentious issue in astrophysics. One significant challenge is the variation in calculated accretion efficiency, with values exceeding the standard range of $0.038 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 0.42$. This discrepancy is especially pronounced in high redshift supermassive black holes, necessitating the development of a comprehensive model that can address the accretion efficiency for supermassive black holes in both the low and high redshift ranges. In this study, we have focused on low redshift ($z &lt; 0.5$) PG quasars (79 quasars) and high redshift ($z \geq 3$) quasars with standard disks from the flux- and volume-limited QUOTAS+QuasarNET dataset (76 quasars) to establish a model for accretion efficiency. An interesting trend is revealed where in redshift larger than 3, accretion efficiency increases as redshift decreases, while in redshift lower than 0.5, accretion efficiency decreases with reducing redshift. This suggests a peak in accretion efficiency between the low and high redshift quasars. This peak is recognized for the flux- and volume-limited QUOTAS+QuasarNET+DL11 dataset, which is $z \sim 2.675$, and it seems to be related to the peak of the star formation rate. ($1 &lt; z_{SFR} &lt; 3$). This result can potentially lead to a more accurate correlation between the star formation rate in quasars and their relationship with the mass of the central supermassive black holes with a more comprehensive disk model in future studies.</description>

      <title>Blueberry galaxies up to 200 Mpc and their optical/infrared properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf highly star-forming galaxies (SFGs) dominated the early Universe and are considered the main driver of its reionization. Direct observations of these very distant galaxies are limited mainly to rest-frame ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, and as a result, some of their properties are out of reach. Therefore, the study of their local analogs, the Green Pea (GP) and Blueberry (BB) galaxies is still of paramount importance. This work aims to expand the number of known BBs to smaller distances and the south equatorial sky. In addition to the already known, this new sample of BBs allows for a statistically significant study of their properties probed by visible and infrared (IR) light. We utilize HECATE, a catalog of galaxies up to 200 Mpc, which provides optical/IR photometry and characterization of the sources. We adopt the Pan-STARSS and SDSS optical photometries, and MPA-JHU analysis for sources having spectroscopic observations. Benefited by the multiwavelength coverage, we perform spectral energy distribution fitting to provide homogeneous star-formation rates and stellar masses. This work has identified 48 BBs out of which 40 are new. The nearest BB lies at 19 Mpc while 14 BBs are in the south equatorial sky. The BBs tend to be extremely IR red in both WISE W1-W2 and W2-W3 colors, located in different positions in this diagram compared to typical SFGs. Overall, dwarf SFGs with higher specific star-formation rates tend to have redder IR colors. Although GPs and BBs share many similarities, the latter are the most intensively star-forming sources of the local Universe among dwarf galaxies. Overall BBs are intrinsically bluer in visible light, redder in the IR, less massive, have higher specific star-formation rates and equivalent widths, lower metallicities, and have the most strongly ionized interstellar medium compared to typical SFGs and GPs.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae of the Large Magellanic Cloud I: A multiwavelength analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) have three main components: a central star (CS), ionised gas and dust in the nebula. Each of them contains critical chemical fingerprints of their evolution, serving as tracers of the evolution, nucleosynthesis and dust production that occurred during the preceding asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. We aim to build a bridge to link the PN phase to the evolution of their progenitors, trying to better understand the dust production and mass-loss mechanism during the final AGB phase. Here, we present a comprehensive study of nine Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) spherical or elliptical PNe whose observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the infrared (IR) are available in the literature. We characterize nebulae and CSs, finding information as the amount of gas that makes up the nebula and the dust that surrounds the CS, necessary to reconstruct the evolutionary history of mass-loss and dust production. We compare the observed energy distribution of the selected PNe to that obtained from photoionization modeling, taking into account the presence of dust. The physical and chemical parameters of the central stars are then compared with the predictions from the evolutionary tracks. We characterized the source, assigning to each CS a progenitor, early-AGB mass. We estimated the mass of the nebula and the dust-to-gas ratio. For 5 objects, we find evidence for the presence of a near-IR bump, which would be connected to the presence of hot dust.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Starbursts: Cold Clouds and Plumes Launching in the M82 Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the filamentary substructure of 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission from JWST/NIRCam observations in the base of the M82 star-burst driven wind. We identify plume-like substructure within the PAH emission with widths of $\sim$50 pc. Several of the plumes extend to the edge of the field-of-view, and thus are at least 200-300 pc in length. In this region of the outflow, the vast majority ($\sim$70\%) of PAH emission is associated with the plumes. We show that those structures contain smaller scale "clouds" with widths that are $\sim$5-15 pc, and they are morphologically similar to the results of "cloud-crushing" simulations. We estimate the cloud-crushing time-scales of $\sim$0.5-3 Myr, depending on assumptions. We show this time scale is consistent with a picture in which these observed PAH clouds survived break-out from the disk rather than being destroyed by the hot wind. The PAH emission in both the midplane and the outflow is shown to tightly correlate with that of Pa$\alpha$ emission (from HST/NICMOS data), at the scale of both plumes and clouds, though the ratio of PAH-to-Pa$\alpha$ increases at further distances from the midplane. Finally, we show that the outflow PAH emission is suppressed in regions of the M82 wind that are bright in X-ray emission. Overall, our results are broadly consistent with a picture in which cold gas in galactic outflows is launched via hierarchically structured plumes, and those small scale clouds are more likely to survive the wind environment when collected into the larger plume structure.</description>

      <title>Bayesian and Convolutional Networks for Hierarchical Morphological Classification of Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is focused on the morphological classification of galaxies following the Hubble sequence in which the different classes are arranged in a hierarchy. The proposed method, BCNN, is composed of two main modules. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained with images of the different classes of galaxies (image augmentation is carried out to balance some classes); the CNN outputs the probability for each class of the hierarchy, and its outputs/predictions feed the second module. The second module consists of a Bayesian network that represents the hierarchy and helps to improve the prediction accuracy by combining the predictions of the first phase while maintaining the hierarchical constraint (in a hierarchy, an instance associated with a node must be associated to all its ancestors), through probabilistic inference over the Bayesian network so that a consistent prediction is obtained. Different images from the Hubble telescope have been collected and labeled by experts, which are used to perform the experiments. The results show that BCNN performed better than several CNNs in multiple evaluation measures, reaching the next scores: 67% in exact match, 78% in accuracy, and 83% in hierarchical F-measure.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamic response of small-scale structure to reionization drives large IGM temperature fluctuations that persist to z = 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal history and structure of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z \geq 4$ is a key boundary condition for reionization, which has been measured using the Ly$\alpha$ forest of high-redshift quasars. It is also a key input for studies that use the forest to constrain the particle masses of alternative dark matter candidates. Most such inferences rely on simulations that lack the spatial resolution to fully resolve the hydrodynamic response of IGM filaments and minihalos caused by HI reionization heating. In this letter, we use high-resolution hydrodynamic+radiative transfer simulations to study the impact of these on the IGM thermal structure. We find that the adiabatic heating and cooling driven by the expansion of initially cold gas filaments and minihalos drives significant temperature fluctuations on small scales. These likely persist in much of the IGM until at least $z = 4$. Capturing this effect requires resolving the characteristic clumping scale of cold, pre-ionized gas, which demands spatial resolutions of at least $2$ $h^{-1}$kpc. Pre-heating of the IGM by X-Ray sources can slightly reduce the effect. Our preliminary estimate of the effect on the Ly$\alpha$ forest finds that, at $\log(k /[{\rm km^{-1} s}]) = -1.0$, the forest flux power (at fixed mean flux) can increase by $10-20\%$ when going from $8$ and $2$ $h^{-1}$kpc resolution at $z = 4-5$ for gas ionized at $z &lt; 7$. These findings motivate a more careful analysis of how temperature fluctuations driven by pressure smoothing from reionization affect the Ly$\alpha$ forest.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an accretion streamer and a slow wide-angle outflow around FU Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ALMA 12-m, 7-m &amp; Total Power (TP) Array observations of the FU Orionis outbursting system, covering spatial scales ranging from 160 to 25,000 au. The high-resolution interferometric data reveals an elongated $^{12}$CO(2-1) feature previously observed at lower resolution in $^{12}$CO(3-2). Kinematic modeling indicates that this feature can be interpreted as an accretion streamer feeding the binary system. The mass infall rate provided by the streamer is significantly lower than the typical stellar accretion rates (even in quiescent states), suggesting that this streamer alone is not massive enough to sustain the enhanced accretion rates characteristic of the outbursting class prototype. The observed streamer may not be directly linked to the current outburst but rather a remnant of a previous, more massive streamer that may have contributed enough to the disk mass to render it unstable and trigger FU Ori's outburst. The new data detects, for the first time, a vast, slow-moving carbon monoxide molecular outflow emerging from this object. To accurately assess the outflow properties (mass, momentum, kinetic energy), we employed $^{13}$CO(2-1) data to correct for optical depth effects. The analysis indicates that the outflow corresponds to swept-up material not associated with the current outburst, similar to slow-molecular outflows observed around other FUor and Class I protostellar objects.</description>

Abstract: The chemistry of an astrophysical environment is closely coupled to its dynamics, the latter often found to be complex. Hence, to properly model these environments a 3D context is necessary. However, solving chemical kinetics within a 3D hydro simulation is computationally infeasible for a even a modest parameter study. In order to develop a feasible 3D hydro-chemical simulation, the classical chemical approach needs to be replaced by a faster alternative. We present mace, a Machine learning Approach to Chemistry Emulation, as a proof-of-concept work on emulating chemistry in a dynamical environment. Using the context of AGB outflows, we have developed an architecture that combines the use of an autoencoder (to reduce the dimensionality of the chemical network) and a set of latent ordinary differential equations (that are solved to perform the temporal evolution of the reduced features). Training this architecture with an integrated scheme makes it possible to successfully reproduce a full chemical pathway in a dynamical environment. mace outperforms its classical analogue on average by a factor 26. Furthermore, its efficient implementation in PyTorch results in a sub-linear scaling with respect to the number of hydrodynamical simulation particles.</description>

Abstract: The problem of missing Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) refers to the issue that the currently known Galactic SNRs are significantly incomplete compared to the theoretical prediction. To expand the sample of Galactic SNRs, we use GLEAM and THOR+VGPS data across four wavebands ranging from 118 to 1420 MHz to drive a spectral index map covering the region within 26.6{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 30.6{\deg}, $\vert b \vert \leq$ 1.25{\deg}, where numerous SNR candidates were recently found. By using the spectral index map of the sky region and detailed analysis of the spectral indices of individual sources, we confirmed four SNR candidates, namely G26.75+0.73, G27.06+0.04, G28.36+0.21, and G28.78$-$0.44, as SNRs. Additionally, we discovered an expanding molecular superbubble located in this region, discussed pulsars associated with SNR candidates, and discovered a long H$\alpha$ filament that spatially overlaps with the candidate G29.38+0.10. We suggest that the problem of missing Galactic SNRs not only arises from observation limitations, but also could be due to the low-density environments of some SNRs, and the different SN explosion properties.</description>

      <title>Swarm intelligence for full Stokes dynamic imaging reconstruction of interferometric data</title>

Abstract: In very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) the combination of multiple antennas permits the synthesis of a virtual telescope with a larger diameter and consequently higher resolution than the individual antennae. Yet, due to the sparse nature of the array, recovering an image from the observed data is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem. The VLBI community is interested in not only recovering an image in total intensity from interferometric data, but also to obtain results in the polarimetric and the temporal domain. Only a few algorithms are able to work in all these domains simultaneously. In particular, the algorithms based on optimization that consider various penalty terms specific to static total intensity imaging, time-variability and polarimetry are restricted to grids the domain of the objective function. In this work we present a novel algorithm, multiobjective particle swarm optimization, that is able to recover the optimal weights without any space-gridding, and to obtain the marginal contribution of each the playing terms. To this end, we utilize multiobjective optimization together with particle swarm metaheuristics. We let the swarm of weights to converge together to the best position. We evaluate our algorithm with representative synthetic data sets focused on the instrumental configuration of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration and its planned successors. We successfully recover the polarimetric, static and time-dynamic signature of the ground truth movie, even with relative sparsity, and a set of realistic data corruptions. This is a novel, fast, weighting space gridding-free algorithm that successfully recovers static and dynamic polarimetric reconstructions. Compared to Regularized Maximum Likelihood methods, it avoids the need for parameter surveys, and it is not limited to the number of pixels such as recently proposed multiobjective imaging algorithms.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Uncertainties of the Gaia DR3 Catalog Based on Data on Wide Binary Stars of the Galaxy Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The catalog of wide binary stars by El-Badry et al. (2021) [arXiv:2101.05282], created on the basis of Gaia EDR3 data and including more than a million pairs, was used to analyze Gaia DR3 data obtained independently for their components. By comparison with the model distribution, it is shown that the catalog contains approximately 2.5 times fewer binary stars than would be expected in the absence of spatial incompleteness. It is confirmed that the radius of spatial completeness of the catalog is on average close to 200 pc and depends on the absolute magnitude of the main component. The spatial density of binary stars in the catalog depends weakly on the difference in the magnitudes of the components, and significantly depends on the physical distance between the components. A high correlation between the degree of agreement between the characteristics and the reliability of the pair was found for radial velocities. Qualitative agreement is observed for metallicity [Fe/H] estimates and, to a lesser extent, for absorption A_G estimates. No agreement was found for the ages of the stars, which indicates their great uncertainty in the ensemble, consisting mainly of main sequence stars. Age estimates for pairs with evolved components show significantly better agreement than for the dataset as a whole. Using the parameters of the components of the pairs from Gaia DR3, an independent estimate of the uncertainties in the radial velocities and metallicities depending on the apparent magnitude of the sources was performed. Estimates of the probable median values of errors in the radial velocities and metallicities of Gaia DR3 sources are proposed. Depending on the apparent magnitude, they exceed the median error values given in the catalog: for radial velocities by 1.5-3 times, for metallicities [Fe/H] by 7-25 times.</description>

Abstract: We report high angular resolution observations, made with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array in band 6, of high excitation molecular lines of $\rm CH_3CN$ and $\rm SO_2$ and of the H29$\alpha$ radio recombination line towards the G345.0061+01.794 B HC H II region, in order to investigate the physical and kinematical characteristics of its surroundings. Emission was detected in all observed components of the J=14$\rightarrow$13 rotational ladder of $\rm CH_3CN$ and in the $30_{4,26}-30_{3,27}$ and $32_{4,28}-32_{3,29}$ lines of $\rm SO_2$. The peak of the velocity integrated molecular emission is located $\sim$0$\,.\!\!^{\prime\prime}$4 northwest of the peak of the continuum emission. The first-order moment images and channel maps show a velocity gradient, of 1.1 km s$^{-1}$ arcsec$^{-1}$, across the source, and a distinctive spot of blueshifted emission towards the peak of the zero-order moment. The rotational temperature is found to decrease from 252$\pm24$ Kelvin at the peak position to 166$\pm16$ Kelvin at its edge, indicating that our molecular observations are probing a hot molecular core that is internally excited. The emission in the H29$\alpha$ line arises from a region of 0$\,.\!\!^{\prime\prime}$65 in size, where its peak coincides with that of the dust continuum. We model the kinematical characteristics of the "central blue spot" feature as due to infalling motions, suggesting a central mass of 172.8$\pm8.8 M_{\odot}$. Our observations indicate that this HC H II region is surrounded by a compact structure of hot molecular gas, which is rotating and infalling toward a central mass, that is most likely confining the ionized region. The observed scenario is reminiscent of a "butterfly pattern" with an approximately edge-on torus and ionized gas roughly parallel to its rotation axis.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Spatial Separation of Galactic Dust Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an implementation of a Bayesian mixture model using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) techniques to search for spatial separation of Galactic dust populations. Utilizing intensity measurements from Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI), we apply this model to high-latitude Galactic dust emission. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for a spatially-varying two-population dust model over a one-population dust model, when the latter must capture the total variance in the sky. Each dust population is well characterized by a single-component spectral energy distribution (SED) and accommodates small variations. These populations could signify two distinct components, or may originate from a one-component model with different temperatures resulting in different SED scalings. While no spatial information is built into the likelihood, our investigation unveils large-scale spatially coherent structures with high significance, pointing to a physical origin for the observed spatial variation. These results are robust to our choice of likelihood and of input data. Furthermore, this spatially varying two-population model is the most favored from Bayesian evidence calculations. Incorporating IRAS 100 $\mu$m to constrain the Wein-side of the blackbody function, we find the dust populations differ at the 2.5$\sigma$ level in the spectral index ($\beta_d$) vs. temperature ($T_d$) plane. The presence of multiple dust populations has implications for component separation techniques frequently employed in the recovery of the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Ionised AGN outflows in the Goldfish galaxy -- The illuminating and interacting red quasar eFEDSJ091157.4+014327 at z $\sim$ 0.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary models suggest that the initial growth phases of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are dust-enshrouded, and characterised by jet/wind outflows that should gradually clear the interstellar medium (ISM) in the host by heating and/or expelling the surrounding gas. eFEDSJ091157.4$+$014327 (z$\sim$0.6) was selected from X-ray samples for its characteristics that are similar to sources with outflows which include red, obscured and X-ray luminous. We aim to explore the environment around this red quasar and characterise kinematics within the system. We used spatially resolved spectroscopic data from Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) with an average seeing of 0.6" to construct flux, velocity and velocity dispersions maps. We found that the quasar is embedded in an interacting and merging system with three other galaxies $\sim$ 50 kpc from its nucleus. Spatially resolved kinematics reveal that the quasar has extended ionised outflows of up to 9.2 kpc with positive and negative velocities up to 1000 km s$^{-1}$ and -1200 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The velocity dispersion (W$_{80}$) ranges from 600-1800 km s$^{-1}$. We associate the presence of turbulent and high-velocity components with the outflow. The total mass outflow rate is estimated to be $\sim$ 10 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic power of 2x10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The kinetic coupling efficiencies range from 0.01%-0.03% and the momentum boosts are $\sim$ 0.2. These low values indicate that the ionised outflow is not energetically relevant. These values don't align with the theoretical predictions of both radiation-pressure-driven outflows and energy-conserving mechanisms. However, note that our results are based only on the ionised phase while theoretical predictions are multiphase. Moreover, the mass loading factor of $\sim$ 5 is an indication that these outflows are more likely AGN-driven than star formation-driven.</description>

      <title>New method for estimating molecular cloud distances based on Gaia, 2MASS, and the TRILEGAL galaxy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17276v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating the distances of molecular clouds traced by CO line emission. Stars from 2MASS and Gaia EDR3 are selected as on-cloud stars when they are projected on a cloud. The background on-cloud stars have redder colors on average than the foreground stars. Instead of searching for stars projected away from the cloud, we employed the TRILEGA galaxy model to mimic the stellar population without cloud extinction along the sightline toward the cloud. Our method does not require an exact boundary of a cloud. The boundaries are highly variable and depend on the sensitivity of the molecular line data. For each cloud, we compared the distributions of on-cloud stars to the TRILEGAL stellar populations in the diagram of $J-K_s$ color versus distance. The intrinsic $J-K_s$ colors of main-sequence and evolved stars from TRILEGAL were considered separately, and they were used as the baseline for subtracting the observed $J-K_s$ colors. The baseline-corrected $J-K_s$ color was deployed with the Bayesian analysis and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to determine the distance at which the $J-K_s$ color jump is largest. This method was successfully applied to measure the distances of 27 molecular clouds, which were selected from previously published cloud samples. By replacing TRILEGAL with the GALAXIA galaxy model, we were able to measure the distances for 21 of the 27 clouds. The distances of the 21 clouds based on the GALAXIA model agree well with those based on the TRILEGAL model. The distances of the 27 clouds estimated by this method are consistent with previous estimates. We will apply this new method to a larger region of the gaseous galactic plane, in particular, for the inner galactic region, where a region free of CO emission is hard to separate from the crowded field of clouds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy velocities in clusters, rotation curves of galaxies, and "vertical" oscillations in the Milky Way currently show too high velocities with respect to the masses thought to be involved. While these velocity excesses are currently interpreted as the consequence of dark matter, it can also be naturally explained as a consequence of scale invariant theory, which rests on a very simple first principle: the addition of a new fundamental symmetry. In the present work, the case of scale invariance, present in General Relativity and Maxwell equations for the empty space without charge and current, is considered. Cosmological models predict a rapid decrease of these effects with increasing mean density up to the critical density, where they totally disappear. Starting from the scale invariant geodesic equation by Dirac (1973), for which a demonstration by an action principle is presented, a modified Newton equation is derived. The solutions of this equation are applied to clusters of galaxies, galactic rotation at different redshifts and "vertical" motions in the Milky Way. In this new framework, the convergence of theoretical predictions and observations, in different gravitational systems, epochs, mass range and spatial scales, opens interesting perspectives that deserve to be explored further.</description>

      <title>The HI Mass Function of Star-forming Galaxies at $z\approx1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first estimate, based on direct HI 21 cm observations, of the HI mass function (HIMF) of star-forming galaxies at $z\approx1$, obtained by combining our measurement of the scaling relation between HI mass ($M_{HI}$) and B-band luminosity ($M_B$) of star-forming galaxies with literature estimates of the B-band luminosity function at $z\approx1$. We determined the $M_{HI}-M_B$ relation by using the GMRT-CATz1 survey of the DEEP2 fields to measure the average HI mass of blue galaxies at $z=0.74-1.45$ in three separate $M_B$ subsamples. This was done by separately stacking the HI 21 cm emission signals of the galaxies in each subsample to detect, at (3.5-4.4)$\sigma$ significance, the average HI 21 cm emission of each subsample. We find that the $M_{HI}-M_B$ relation at $z\approx1$ is consistent with that at $z\approx0$. We combine our estimate of the $M_{HI}-M_B$ relation at $z\approx1$ with the B-band luminosity function at $z\approx1$ to determine the HIMF at $z\approx1$. We find that the number density of galaxies with $M_{HI}&gt;10^{10} M_\odot$ (higher than the knee of the local HIMF) at $z\approx1$ is a factor of $\approx4-5$ higher than that at $z\approx0$, for a wide range of assumed scatters in the $M_{HI}-M_B$ relation. We rule out the hypothesis that the number density of galaxies with $M_{HI}&gt;10^{10} M_\odot$ remains unchanged between $z \approx 1$ and $z\approx0$ at $\gtrsim99.7$\% confidence. This is the first statistically significant evidence for evolution in the HIMF of galaxies from the epoch of cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>The effects of stellar feedback on molecular clumps in the Lagoon Nebula (M8)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lagoon Nebula (M8) is host to multiple regions with recent and ongoing massive star formation. With M8-Main and M8 East, two prominent regions of massive star formation have been studied in detail over the past years, while large parts of the nebula have received little attention. These largely unexplored regions comprise a large sample of molecular clumps that are affected by the presence of massive O- and B-type stars. We establish an inventory of species observed towards 37 known molecular clumps in M8 by conducting an unbiased line survey for each clump. For this, we used APEX and the IRAM 30m telescope for pointed on-off observations on the clumps. These observations cover bandwidths of 53GHz and 40GHz in frequency ranges from 210GHz to 280GHz and from 70GHz to 117GHz, respectively. Temperatures are derived from rotational transitions of CH3CN, CH3C2H and para-H2CO. Additional archival data from the Spitzer, Herschel, MSX, APEX, WISE, JCMT and AKARI telescopes are used to derive physical parameters of the dust emission by fitting spectral energy distributions to the observed flux densities. Across the observed M8 region, we identify 346 transitions from 70 different molecular species, including isotopologues. We detect tracers of photo-dissociation regions across all the clumps and 38% of these clumps show signs of star formation. We find that PDR tracers are most abundant in clumps with relatively lower H2 column densities. When comparing M8 clumps to ATLASGAL sources at similar distances, we find them to be slightly less massive and have compatible luminosities and radii. This possibly indicates a fragmentation of the gas caused by the O- and B-type stars. In contrast, dust temperatures of the clumps in M8 are found to be increased by approximately 5K (25%) indicating substantial external heating of the clumps by radiation of the present massive stars.</description>

      <title>Dark supernova remnant buried in the Galactic-Centre "Brick" G0.253+0.016 revealed by an expanding CO-line bubble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a 12CO and 13CO-line study of the "Brick" (G0.253+0.016) in the Galactic Centre (GC) by analyzing archival data obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. We present kinematics and molecular gas distributions in the longitude-velocity diagram, and suggest that the Brick is located along the GC Arm I in the central molecular zone (CMZ), which yields a distance from the Sun of 8 kpc and galacto-centric distance of 0.2 kpc. The major and minor-axis diameters of the Brick are $D_x\times D_y=8.4 {\rm pc} \times 4.1 {\rm epc}$ at position angle of $40\deg$ and $130\deg$, respectively, and the scale radius is $r_{\rm brick}=\sqrt{D_x D_y}=2.96$ pc. The molecular mass inferred from the 12CO-line integrated intensity is $M_{\rm bri,xco}\sim 5.1\times 10^4 M_\odot$ for a conversion factor $X_{\rm CO}=1.0\times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km/s]$^{-1}$. On the other hand, the dynamical (Virial) mass for the measured velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=10.0 $ km/s is calculated to be $M_{\rm bri,vir}\sim 6.8 \times 10^4M_\odot$, which yields a new conversion factor of $X_{\rm CO} =1.3\times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ [K km/s]${-1}$. The Brick's center has a cavity surrounded by a spherical molecular bubble of radius $r_{\rm bub}=1.85$ pc and mass $\sim 1.7\times 10^4M_\odot$ expanding at $v_{\rm exp}\simeq 10 $ km/s with kinetic energy of $E_0\sim 1.7\times 10^{49}$ erg. If the bubble is approximated by an adiabatic spherical shock wave, the age is estimated to be $t\sim 2/5 r_{\rm bub}/v_{\rm exp}\sim 7.2\times 10^4$ y. Neither non-thermal radio structures nor thermal radio emission indicative of HII region are found in the archival data from the MeerKAT. We suggest that the molecular bubble will be a dark supernova remnant buried in the Brick, which, therefore, has experienced in the past ($\sim 0.1$ Myr ago) massive-star formation with a supernova explosion.</description>

      <title>Time-Delay Cosmography: Measuring the Hubble Constant and other cosmological parameters with strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10833v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiply lensed sources experience a relative time delay in the arrival of photons. This effect can be used to measure absolute distances and the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and is known as time-delay cosmography. The methodology is independent of the local distance ladder and early-universe physics and provides a precise and competitive measurement of $H_0$. With upcoming observatories, time-delay cosmography can provide a 1% precision measurement of $H_0$ and can decisively shed light on the current reported 'Hubble tension'. This paper presents the theoretical background and the current techniques applied for time-delay cosmographic studies and the measurement of the Hubble constant. The paper describes the challenges and systematics in the different components of the analysis and strategies to mitigate them. The current measurements are discussed in context and the opportunities with the anticipated data sets in the future are laid out.</description>

      <title>Mapping Obscured Star Formation in the Host Galaxy of FRB 20201124A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution 1.5 $-$ 6 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and infrared observations of the extremely active repeating fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 20201124A and its barred spiral host galaxy. We constrain the location and morphology of star formation in the host and search for a persistent radio source (PRS) coincident with FRB 20201124A. We resolve the morphology of the radio emission across all frequency bands and measure a star formation rate SFR $\approx 8.9\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, approximately $\approx 2.5-6$ times larger than optically-inferred SFRs, demonstrating dust-obscured star formation throughout the host. Compared to a sample of all known FRB hosts with radio emission, the host of FRB 20201124A has the most significantly obscured star formation. While HST observations show the FRB to be offset from the bar or spiral arms, the radio emission extends to the FRB location. We propose that the FRB progenitor could have formed in situ (e.g., a magnetar born from a massive star explosion). It is still plausible, although less likely, that the progenitor of FRB 20201124A migrated from the central bar of the host. We further place a limit on the luminosity of a putative PRS at the FRB position of $L_{\rm 6.0 \ GHz}$ $\lesssim$ 1.8 $\times 10^{27}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, among the deepest PRS luminosity limits to date. However, this limit is still broadly consistent with both magnetar nebulae and hypernebulae models assuming a constant energy injection rate of the magnetar and an age of $\gtrsim 10^{5}$ yr in each model, respectively.</description>

      <title>Estimating major merger rates and spin parameters ab initio via the clustering of critical events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build a model to predict from first principles the properties of major mergers. We predict these from the coalescence of peaks and saddle points in the vicinity of a given larger peak, as one increases the smoothing scale in the initial linear density field as a proxy for cosmic time. To refine our results, we also ensure, using a suite of $\sim 400$ power-law Gaussian random fields smoothed at $\sim 30$ different scales, that the relevant peaks and saddles are topologically connected: they should belong to a persistent pair before coalescence. Our model allows us to (a) compute the probability distribution function of the satellite-merger separation in Lagrangian space: they peak at three times the smoothing scale; (b) predict the distribution of the number of mergers as a function of peak rarity: haloes typically undergo two major mergers ($&gt;$1:10) per decade of mass growth; (c) recover that the typical spin brought by mergers: it is of the order of a few tens of percent.</description>

      <title>The star formation, dust, and abundance of galaxies with unWISE-CIB cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic infrared background (CIB) is the accumulated infrared (IR) radiation mainly from interstellar dust heated up by early stars. In this work, we measure the cross-correlation between galaxies from the unWISE catalog and the CIB maps from the Planck satellite to simultaneously constrain the cosmic star formation rate (SFR), dust spectral energy distribution (SED), and the halo occupation distribution (HOD). The unWISE galaxy catalog is divided into three tomographic bins centered at $z\sim 0.6, 1.1, 1.5$, and the CIB maps are at 353, 545, and 857 GHz. We measure the cross-correlations between these galaxy samples and CIB maps and get a 194$\sigma$ signal within an angular scale $100&lt;\ell&lt;2000$, from which we constrain two CIB halo models from previous literature and one new model. The SFR, SED, and HOD model parameters are constrained consistently among the three models. Specifically, the dust temperature at $z=0$ is constrained $T_0={21.14}^{+1.02}_{-1.34}$ K, which is slightly lower than $T_0=24.4\pm1.9$ K measured by the Planck collaboration. The halo mass that gives the most efficient star formation is around $10^{{11.79}^{+0.73}_{-0.86}}M_{\odot}$. From the model parameters, combined with the SFR density at $z=0$ synthesized from multi-wavelength observations, we break the degeneracy between SED and SFR and recover the cosmic star formation history that is consistent with multi-wavelength surveys. We also constrain the graybody SED model in agreement with previous measurements from infrared flux stacking. From the HOD constraints, we derive an increasing trend of galaxy linear bias along redshifts that agrees with the results from cross- and auto-correlation with unWise galaxies. This study indicates the power of using CIB-galaxy cross-correlation to study star formation, dust, and abundance of galaxies across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Black holes immersed in dark matter: energy condition and sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of the environment around a black hole in detail. We introduce non-vanishing radial pressure in a manner analogous to compact stars. We examine both isotropic and anisotropic fluid configurations with and without radial pressure respectively. Our focus extends beyond just dark matter density to the vital role of the energy condition and sound speed in the spacetime of a black hole immersed in matter. In cases of anisotropic pressure with vanishing radial pressure, all profiles violate the dominant energy condition near the BH, and the tangential sound speed exceeds light speed for all dark matter profiles. In our second approach, without assuming vanishing radial pressure, we observe similar violations and superluminal sound speeds. To rectify this, we introduce a hard cutoff for the sound speed, ensuring it remains subluminal. As a consequence, the energy condition is also satisfied. However, this results in increased density and pressure near the BH. This raises questions about the sound speed and its impact on the density structure, as well as questions about the validity of the model itself. With the matter distribution, we also compute the metric for different configurations. It reveals sensitivity to the profile structure. The metric components point towards the horizon structure.</description>

      <title>The Basic Iterative Deconvolution: A fast instrumental point-spread function deconvolution method that corrects for light that is scattered out of the field of view of a detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A point-spread function describes the optics of an imaging system and can be used to correct collected images for instrumental effects. The state of the art for deconvolving images with the point-spread function is the Richardson-Lucy algorithm; however, despite its high fidelity, it is slow and cannot account for light scattered out of the field of view of the detector. We reinstate the Basic Iterative Deconvolution (BID) algorithm, a deconvolution algorithm that considers photons scattered out of the field of view of the detector, and extend it for image subregion deconvolutions. Its runtime is 1.8 to 7.1 faster than the Richardson-Lucy algorithm for 4096 x 4096 pixels images and up to an additional factor of 150 for subregions of 250 x 250 pixels. We test the extended BID algorithm for solar images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and find that the deviations between the reconstructed intensities of BID and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm are smaller than 1%.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Matter from Dynamical Heating of Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarfs. Part 2: Substructure and the Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a large and growing interest in observations of small-scale structure in dark matter. We propose a new way to probe dark matter structures in the $\sim 10 - 10^8 \, M_\odot$ range. This allows us to constrain the primordial power spectrum over shorter distances scales than possible with direct observations from the CMB. For $k$ in the range $\sim 10 - 1000 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ our constraints on the power spectrum are orders of magnitude stronger than previous bounds.
  We also set some of the strongest constraints on dark matter isocurvature perturbations. Our method relies on the heating effect such dark matter substructures would have on the distribution of stars in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. Many models of inflation produce enhanced power at these short distance scales and can thus be constrained by our observation. Further, many dark matter models such as axion dark matter, self-interacting dark matter and dissipative dark matter, produce dense structures which could be constrained this way.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant using DESI emission-line galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present strong constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In this pilot work, we utilize $\sim110,000$ galaxies with strong and narrow O III $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines to measure the relative variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in space and time. The O III doublet is arguably the best choice for this purpose owing to its wide wavelength separation between the two lines and its strong emission in many galaxies. Our galaxy sample spans a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.95$, covering half of all cosmic time. We divide the sample into subsamples in 10 redshift bins ($\Delta z=0.1$), and calculate $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ for the individual subsamples. The uncertainties of the measured $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ are roughly between $2\times10^{-6}$ and $2\times10^{-5}$. We find an apparent $\alpha$ variation with redshift at a level of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha=(2\sim3)\times10^{-5}$. This is highly likely to be caused by systematics associated with wavelength calibration, since such small systematics can be caused by a wavelength distortion of $0.002-0.003$ \AA, which is beyond the accuracy that the current DESI data can achieve. We refine the wavelength calibration using sky lines for a small fraction of the galaxies, but it does not change our main results. We further probe the spatial variation of $\alpha$ in small redshift ranges, and do not find obvious, large-scale structures in the spatial distribution of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$. As DESI is ongoing, we will include more galaxies, and by improving the wavelength calibration, we expect to obtain a better constraint that is comparable to the strongest current constraint.</description>

      <title>On the Pair-Instability Supernova origin of J1010+2358</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first (Pop III) stars formed only out of H and He and were likely more massive than present-day stars. Massive Pop III stars in the range 140-260 M$_\odot$ are predicted to end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), enriching the environment with a unique abundance pattern, with high ratios of odd to even elements. Recently, the most promising candidate for a pure descendant of a zero-metallicity massive PISN (260 M$_{\odot}$) was discovered by the LAMOST survey, the star J1010+2358. However, the key elements to verify the high PISN contribution, C and Al, were missing from the analysis. To rectify this, we obtained and analyzed a high-resolution VLT/UVES spectrum, correcting for 3D and/or non-LTE effects. Our measurements of both C and Al give much higher values (~1 dex) than expected from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Furthermore, we find significant discrepancies with the previous analysis, and therefore a much less pronounced odd-even pattern. Thus, we show that J1010+2358 cannot be a pure descendant of a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Instead, we find that the best fit model consists of a 13 M$_{\odot}$ Pop II core-collapse supernova combined with a Pop III supernova. Alternative, less favoured solutions $(\chi^2/\chi^2_{\rm best}\approx2.3)$ include a 50% contribution from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN, or a 40% contribution from a Pop III type Ia supernova. Ultimately, J1010+2358 is certainly a unique star giving insights into the earliest chemical enrichment, however, this star is not a pure PISN descendant.</description>
