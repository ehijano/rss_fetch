      <title>Lipid membrane domains control actin network viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mammalian cell membrane is embedded with biomolecular condensates of protein and lipid clusters, which interact with an underlying viscoelastic cytoskeleton network to organize the cell surface and mechanically interact with the extracellular environment. However, the mechanical and thermodynamic interplay between the viscoelastic network and liquid-liquid phase separation of 2-dimensional (2D) lipid condensates remains poorly understood. Here, we engineer materials composed of 2D lipid membrane condensates embedded within a thin viscoelastic actin network. The network generates localized anisotropic stresses that deform lipid condensates into triangular morphologies with sharp edges and corners, shapes unseen in 3D composite gels. Kinetic coarsening of phase-separating lipid condensates accelerates the viscoelastic relaxation of the network, leading to an effectively softer composite material over intermediate timescales. We dynamically manipulate the membrane composition to control the elastic-to-viscous crossover of the network. Such viscoelastic composite membranes may enable the development of coatings, catalytic surfaces, separation membranes, and other interfaces with tunable spatial organization and plasticity mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Chiral {\pi} Domain Walls Composed of Twin Half-Integer Surface Disclinations in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals are polar fluids characterized by microscopic orientational ordering and macroscopic spontaneous polarizations. Within these fluids, walls that separate domains of different polarizations are ubiquitous. We demonstrate that the {\pi} walls in films of polar fluids consist of twin half-integer surface disclinations spaced horizontally, enclosing a subdomain where the polarization exhibits left- or right-handed {\pi} twists across the film. The degenerate geometric configurations of these twin disclinations give rise to kinks and antikinks, effectively partitioning subdomains of opposite chirality like Ising chains. The hierarchical topological structures dictate that field-driven polar switching entails a two-step annihilation process of the disclinations. These findings serve as a cornerstone for comprehending other walls in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials, thereby laying the base for domain engineering crucial for advancing their nonlinear and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions alter density and stress fluctuations in shear-thickening suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuous shear thickening (DST) in dense suspensions is accompanied by significant fluctuations in stress at a fixed shear rate. In this work, normal stress fluctuations are shown to have a one-to-one relationship with the formation and dissolution of local high-density regions. Namely, a burst in the force response corresponds to the spontaneous appearance of inhomogeneity. We observe that boundary conditions can significantly alter the spatiotemporal scale of these fluctuations, from short-lived to more sustained and enduring patterns. We estimate the occurrence frequency R and the average intensity Q of individual bursts/inhomogeneity events. The growth of R with the shear rate is the most rapid for the rigid boundary, whereas Q is nonmonotonic with confinement stiffness. Our results indicate that boundary conditions alter the development of inhomogeneity and thus the stress response under shear.</description>

      <title>Unifying Mixed Gas Adsorption in Molecular Sieve Membranes and MOFs using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent machine learning models to accurately obtain gas adsorption isotherms focus on polymers or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) separately. The difficulty in creating a unified model that can predict the adsorption trends in both types of adsorbents is challenging, owing to the diversity in their chemical structures. Moreover, models trained only on single gas adsorption data are incapable of predicting adsorption isotherms for binary gas mixtures. In this work, we address these problems using feature vectors comprising only the physical properties of the gas mixtures and adsorbents. Our model is trained on adsorption isotherms of both single and binary mixed gases inside carbon molecular sieving membrane (CMSM), together with data available from CoRE MOF database. The trained models are capable of accurately predicting the adsorption trends in both classes of materials, for both pure and binary components. ML architecture designed for one class of material, is not suitable for predicting the other class, even after proper training, signifying that the model must be trained jointly for proper predictions and transferability. The model is used to predict with good accuracy the CO2 uptake inside CALF-20 framework. This work opens up a new avenue for predicting complex adsorption processes for gas mixtures in a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Designing necks and wrinkles in inflated auxetic membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the potentiality of inflatable, functionally-graded auxetic membranes to produce wrinkles and necks. We obtain elastic instabilities at desired locations in axisymmetric membranes and with prescribed patterns in square membranes. First, we use an analytical approach to obtain a series of universal results providing insights into the formation of wrinkles and necks in inflated, axisymmetric membranes. For example, we prove analytically that necks and wrinkles may never overlap in pressurized, axially symmetric membranes. Second, we implement the relaxed strain energy of tension field theory into a Finite Element solver (COMSOL). By tuning spatial inhomogeneities of the material moduli, we corroborate our universal results, describe the onset of wrinkling in an averaged way, and also generate non-trivial instabilities at desired locations. This study on membranes with morphing or corrugation on demand has potential applications in Braille reading and haptics.</description>

      <title>Voltage-controlled non-axisymmetric vibrations of soft electro-active tubes with strain-stiffening effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material properties of soft electro-active (SEA) structures are significantly sensitive to external electro-mechanical biasing fields (such as pre-stretch and electric stimuli), which generate remarkable knock-on effects on their dynamic characteristics. In this work, we analyze the electrostatically tunable non-axisymmetric vibrations of an incompressible SEA cylindrical tube under the combination of a radially applied electric voltage and an axial pre-stretch. Following the theory of nonlinear electro-elasticity and the associated linearized theory for superimposed perturbations, we derive the nonlinear static response of the SEA tube to the inhomogeneous biasing fields for the Gent ideal dielectric model. Using the State Space Method, we efficiently obtain the frequency equations for voltage-controlled small-amplitude three-dimensional non-axisymmetric vibrations, covering a wide range of behaviors, from the purely radial breathing mode to torsional modes, axisymmetric longitudinal modes, and prismatic diffuse modes. We also perform an exhaustive numerical analysis to validate the proposed approach compared with the conventional displacement method, as well as to elucidate the influences of the applied voltage, axial pre-stretch, and strain-stiffening effect on the nonlinear static response and vibration behaviors of the SEA tube. The present study clearly indicates that manipulating electro-mechanical biasing fields is a feasible way to tune the small-amplitude vibration characteristics of an SEA tube. The results should benefit experimental work on, and design of, voltage-controlled resonant devices made of SEA tubes.</description>

      <title>Shape and Size Tunability of Sheets of Interlocked Ring Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanically bonded membranes of interlocked ring polymers are a significant generalization of conventional elastic sheets, where connectivity is provided by covalent bonding, and represent a promising class of topological meta-materials. In this context, two open questions regard the large-scale reverberations of the heterogeneous composition of the rings and the inequivalent modes of interlocking neighboring rings. We address these questions with Langevin dynamics simulations of chainmails with honeycomb-lattice connectivity, where the rings are block copolymers with two segments of different rigidity. We considered various combinations of the relative lengths of the two segments and the patterns of the over- and under-passes linking neighboring rings. We find that varying ring composition and linking patterns have independent and complementary effects. While the former sets the overall size of the chainmail, the latter defines the shape, enabling the selection of starkly different conformation types. Notably, one of the considered linking patterns favors saddle-shaped membranes, providing a first example of spontaneous negative Gaussian curvature in mechanically bonded sheets. The results help establish the extent to which mechanically bonded membranes can differ from conventional elastic membranes, particularly for the achievable shape and size tunability.</description>

      <title>Chirality Effects in Molecular Chainmail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of positive Gaussian curvature in kinetoplast DNA networks, we consider the effect of linking chirality in square lattice molecular chainmail networks using Langevin dynamics simulations and constrained gradient optimization. Linking chirality here refers to ordering of over-under versus under-over linkages between a loop and its neighbors. We consider fully alternating linking, maximally non-alternating, and partially non-alternating linking chiralities. We find that in simulations of polymer chainmail networks, the linking chirality dictates the sign of the Gaussian curvature of the final state of the chainmail membranes. Alternating networks have positive Gaussian curvature, similar to what is observed in kinetoplast DNA networks. Maximally non-alternating networks form isotropic membranes with negative Gaussian curvature. Partially non-alternating networks form flat diamond-shaped sheets which undergo a thermal folding transition when sufficiently large, similar to the crumpling transition in tethered membranes. We further investigate this topology-curvature relationship on geometric grounds by considering the tightest possible configurations and the constraints that must be satisfied to achieve them.</description>

      <title>3D Visualization Reveals the Cooling Rate Dependent Crystallization near a Wall in Dense Microgel Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled crystallization, melting and vitrification are important fundamental processes in nature and technology. However, the microscopic details of these fundamental phenomena still lack understanding, in particular how the cooling rate and presence of a wall influence the crystal nucleation and glass formation. Thermoresponsive microgels provide the possibility to study phase transitions on a single-particle level, owing to the ability to tune the particle size with temperature. In this study, we employ composite microgels consisting of a hard core and a crosslinked poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-methacrylic acid) shell to study the crystallization of dense suspensions of soft colloids near a wall using confocal microscopy. We investigate the effect of cooling rate on the fluid-to-solid transition close to the sample wall. The structures formed during cooling range from glassy in case of a rapid temperature quench, to crystalline when a slow cooling rate is used. Detailed analysis of the final structure reveals that the cooling rate also sets the degree of alignment of the crystal domains with the wall as a result of a balance between homogeneous and heterogenous crystal nucleation. The results presented here yield valuable insight into the microscopic details of temperature-controlled crystallization near a wall. This understanding will help pave the way towards optimal crystallization conditions for microgel applications.</description>

      <title>Traveling Fronts and the Smoothing of the Collective-Motion Phase Transition in Vibrated Polar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most well known features of active matter is the tendencey of self-propelled particles to undergo system-wide collective motion. With low enough rotational noise or high enough global density, these systems spontaneously break symmetry and transition to a state with nonzero net momentum. The transition is currently understood as discontinuous, with phase coexistence manifesting in terms of dense travelling bands propagating through a dilute background. Here we show that the phase transition appears continuous in experiments with a system of hundreds of polar vibrated disks, and compare the fluctuations in this system to the traveling bands that are present in larger systems. We argue that this difference is due to finite size effects, which are often considered an artifact of simulations in studies with equilibrium systems, but that are of fundamental importance in many systems of self-propelled particles such as those composed of living individuals.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Deformation Modes for Micromorphic Homogenization from Experiments on Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A micromorphic computational homogenization framework has recently been developed to deal with materials showing long-range correlated interactions, i.e. displaying patterning modes. Typical examples of such materials are elastomeric mechanical metamaterials, in which patterning emerges from local buckling of the underlying microstructure. Because pattern transformations significantly influence the resulting effective behaviour, it is vital to distinguish them from the overall deformation. To this end, the following kinematic decomposition into three parts was introduced in the micromorphic scheme: (i) a smooth mean displacement field, corresponding to the slowly varying deformation at the macro-scale, (ii) a long-range correlated fluctuation field, related to the buckling pattern at the meso-scale, and (iii) the remaining uncorrelated local microfluctuation field at the micro-scale. The micromorphic framework has proven to be capable of predicting relevant mechanical behaviour, including size effects and spatial as well as temporal mixing of patterns in elastomeric metamaterials, making it a powerful tool to design metamaterials for engineering applications. The long-range correlated fluctuation fields need to be, however, provided a priori as input parameters. The main goal of this study is experimental identification of the decomposed kinematics in cellular metamaterials based on the three-part ansatz. To this end, a full-field micromorphic Integrated Digital Image Correlation (IDIC) technique has been developed. The methodology is formulated for finite-size cellular elastomeric metamaterial specimens deformed in (i) virtually generated images and (ii) experimental images attained during in-situ compression of specimens with millimetre sized microstructure using optical microscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates play a central role in the spatial organization of living matter. Their formation is now well understood as a form of liquid-liquid phase separation that occurs very far from equilibrium. For instance, they can be modeled as active droplets, where the combination of molecular interactions and chemical reactions result in microphase separation. However, so far, models of chemically active droplets are spatially continuous and deterministic. Therefore, the relationship between the microscopic parameters of the models and some crucial properties of active droplets (such as their polydispersity, their shape anisotropy, or their typical lifetime) is yet to be established. In this work, we address this question computationally, using Brownian dynamics simulations of chemically active droplets: the building blocks are represented explicitly as particles that interact with attractive or repulsive interactions, depending on whether they are in a droplet-forming state or not. Thanks to this microscopic and stochastic view of the problem, we reveal how driving the system away from equilibrium in a controlled way determines the fluctuations and dynamics of active emulsions.</description>

      <title>Cluster Formation induced by local dielectric saturation in Restricted Primitive Model Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments using the Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) have found anomalously long ranged charge-charge underscreening in concentrated salt solutions. Meanwhile, theory and simulations have suggested ion clustering to be the possible origin of this behaviour. The popular Restricted Primitive Model of electrolyte solutions, in which the solvent is represented by a uniform relative dielectric constant, $\varepsilon_r$, is unable to resolve the anomalous underscreening seen in experiments. In this work, we modify the Restricted Primitive Model to account for local dielectric saturation within the ion hydration shell. The dielectric constant in our model locally decreases from the bulk value to a lower saturated value at the ionic surface. The parameters for the model are deduced so that typical salt solubilities are obtained. Our simulations for both bulk and slit geometries show that our model displays strong cluster formation and these give rise to long-ranged interactions between charged surfaces at distances similar to what has been observed in SFA measurements. An electrolyte model wherein the dielectric constant remains uniform does not display similar clusters, even with $\varepsilon_r$ equal to the saturated value at ion contact. Hence, the observed behaviours are not simply due to an enhanced Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Molecular simulations of crazes in glassy polymers under cyclic loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study with molecular dynamics simulations of a generic bead-spring model the cyclic crazing behaviour of glassy polymers. The aim is to elucidate the mechanical response of sole fibrillated craze matter as well as its interaction with bulk material. The macroscopic stress response exhibits a hysteresis, which is quasi stationary after the first cycle and largely independent of deformation rate and temperature. It results from a complex interplay between constraints imposed by the entanglement network, pore space and pore space closure. Once the craze fibrils are oriented, stretching of the covalent backbone bonds leads to a rapid stress increase. In the initial stages of unloading, a loss in entanglement contact yields a quick stress relaxation in the backbone. During unloading, the craze fibrils undergo a rigid body (i.e.\ stress-free) folding motion due to the surrounding pore space, so that the structural behaviour of craze fibrils during unloading is most accurately described as string-like. The reloading response depends significantly on the degree of pore space closure and the enforced intermolecular interaction during unloading. It ranges from a linear stress increase to a re-cavitation with a re-drawing response. Compared to the bulk stiffness, the craze stiffness is two orders of magnitude lower and as a result, the macro response of coexisting craze and bulk matter is governed by the sole fibrillated craze matter.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of colloidal rods rotating in viscoelastic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the in-plane rotational motion of ferromagnetic colloidal rods in viscoelastic media under a rotating magnetic field. Contrary to their rotation in a Newtonian fluid, in a viscoelastic fluid the rods continue to exhibit a net angular drift even for applied field frequencies which is an order of magnitude larger than the step-out frequency. Despite experimental evidence, previous studies failed to explain the observed behavior. This is due to the inherent assumption that the rods angular velocity beyond step-out follows same dependence on the applied field frequency as the Newtonian fluids. We demonstrated that the observed net rotation of rods after step-out originates from their interaction with the microstructural stress-relaxation processes within the viscoelastic fluid. Consequently, it exhibits a strong dependence on the rheological properties of the fluid. Our results are further supported by a minimal model which incorporates the memory-mediated response of the viscoelastic fluid on their motion. Furthermore, we demonstrate, both experimentally and numerically, that the observed effect represents a generic feature of viscoelastic media and is expected to manifest for elongated probes in other complex surroundings such as biological assays and colloidal glasses.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of turbulent channel flow with one-point closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For low enough flow rates, turbulent channel flow displays spatial modulations of large wavelengths. This phenomenon has recently been interpreted as a linear instability of the turbulent flow. We question here the ability of linear stability analysis around the turbulent mean flow to predict the onset and wavelengths of such modulations. Both the mean flow and the Reynolds stresses are extracted from direct numerical simulation (DNS) in periodic computational domains of different size. The Orr-Sommerfeld-Squire formalism is used here, with the turbulent viscosity either ignored, evaluated from DNS, or modeled using a simple one-point closure model. Independently of the closure model and the domain size, the mean turbulent flow is found to be linearly stable, in marked contrast with the observed behavior. This suggests that the one-point approach is not sufficient to predict instability, at odds with other turbulent flow cases. For generic wall-bounded shear flows we discuss how the correct models for predicting instability could include fluctuations in a more explicit way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poiseuille flow in cylindrical and planar geometries with a simplified, pseudoplastic (shear thinning) rheology characterized by constant viscosity plateaus above and below a transition strain rate is considered. Analytical, steady state solutions for velocity profile and volume flux are formulated. Transient flow development is addressed numerically and compared to the theory in the steady state limit. Stationary flow is approached after the momentum diffusion timescale based on the spatially dominant kinematic viscosity. For large viscosity ratio and shear thinning region confined near the domain boundary, velocity distributions are quasi-plug like with large boundary to interior strain rate ratio.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Mechanics of Knitted Fabrics Through Hierarchical Geometric Representation</title>

Abstract: Knitting interloops one-dimensional yarns into three-dimensional fabrics that exhibit behaviours beyond their constitutive materials. How extensibility and anisotropy emerge from the hierarchical organisation of yarns into knitted fabrics has long been unresolved. We sought to unravel the mechanical roles of tensile mechanics, assembly and dynamics arising from the yarn level on fabric nonlinearity by developing a yarn-based dynamical model. This physically validated model captures the fundamental mechanical response of knitted fabrics, analogous to flexible metamaterials and biological fiber networks due to geometric nonlinearity within such hierarchical systems. Fabric anisotropy originates from observed yarn-yarn rearrangements during alignment dynamics and is topology-dependent. This yarn-based model also provides a design space of knitted fabrics to embed functionalities by varying geometric configuration and material property in instructed procedures compatible to machine manufacturing. Our hierarchical approach to build up a knitted fabrics computationally modernizes an ancient craft and represents a first step towards mechanical programmability of knitted fabrics in wide engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Transport and Energetics of Bacterial Rectification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomly moving active particles can be herded into directed motion by asymmetric geometric structures. Although such a rectification process has been extensively studied due to its fundamental, biological, and technological relevance, a comprehensive understanding of active matter rectification based on single particle dynamics remains elusive. Here, by combining experiments, simulations, and theory, we study the directed transport and energetics of swimming bacteria navigating through funnel-shaped obstacles -- a paradigmatic model of rectification of living active matter. We develop a microscopic parameter-free model for bacterial rectification, which quantitatively explains experimental and numerical observations and predicts the optimal geometry for the maximum rectification efficiency. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of time irreversibility and measure the extractable work associated with bacterial rectification. Our study provides quantitative solutions to long-standing questions on bacterial rectification and establishes a generic relationship between time irreversibility, particle fluxes, and extractable work, shedding light on the energetics of non-equilibrium rectification processes in living systems.</description>

      <title>Exact transport coefficients from the inelastic rough Maxwell model of a granular gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Granular gases demand models capable of capturing their distinct characteristics. The widely employed inelastic hard-sphere model (IHSM) introduces complexities that are compounded when incorporating realistic features like surface roughness and rotational degrees of freedom, resulting in the more intricate inelastic rough hard-sphere model (IRHSM). This paper focuses on the inelastic rough Maxwell model (IRMM), presenting a more tractable alternative to the IRHSM and enabling exact solutions. Building on the foundation of the inelastic Maxwell model (IMM) applied to granular gases, the IRMM extends the mathematical representation to encompass surface roughness and rotational degrees of freedom. The primary objective is to provide exact expressions for the Navier--Stokes--Fourier transport coefficients within the IRMM, including the shear and bulk viscosities, the thermal and diffusive heat conductivities, and the cooling-rate transport coefficient. In contrast to earlier approximations in the IRHSM, our study unveils inherent couplings, such as shear viscosity to spin viscosity and heat conductivities to counterparts associated with a torque-vorticity vector. These exact findings provide valuable insights into refining the Sonine approximation applied to the IRHSM, contributing to a deeper understanding of the transport properties in granular gases with realistic features.</description>

      <title>Modelling of initially stressed solids: structure of the energy density in the incompressible limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the modelling of elastic bodies, particularly when the relaxed configuration is unknown or non-existent. We adopt the theory of initially stressed materials, incorporating the deformation gradient and stress state of the reference configuration (initial stress tensor) into the response function. We show that for the theory to be applicable, the response function of the relaxed material is invertible up to an element of the material symmetry group. Additionally, we establish that commonly imposed constitutive restrictions, namely the initial stress compatibility condition and initial stress reference independence, naturally arise when assuming an initial stress generated solely from elastic distortion. The paper delves into modelling aspects concerning incompressible materials, showcasing the expressibility of strain energy density as a function of the deviatoric part of the initial stress tensor and the isochoric part of the deformation gradient. This not only reduces the number of independent invariants in the energy functional, but also enhances numerical robustness in finite element simulations. The findings of this research hold significant implications for modelling materials with initial stress, extending potential applications to areas such as mechanobiology, soft robotics, and 4D printing.</description>

      <title>Right On Time: Ultrafast Charge Separation Before Hybrid Exciton Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organic/inorganic hybrid systems offer great potential for novel solar cell design combining the tunability of organic chromophore absorption properties with high charge carrier mobilities of inorganic semiconductors. However, often such material combinations do not show the expected performance: while ZnO, for example, basically exhibits all necessary properties for a successful application in light-harvesting, it was clearly outpaced by TiO$_2$ in terms of charge separation efficiency. The origin of this deficiency has long been debated. This study employs femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and many-body ab initio calculations to identify and quantify all elementary steps leading to the suppression of charge separation at an exemplary organic/ZnO interface. We demonstrate that charge separation indeed occurs efficiently on ultrafast (350 fs) timescales, but that electrons are recaptured at the interface on a 100 ps timescale and subsequently trapped in a strongly bound (0.7 eV) hybrid exciton state with a lifetime exceeding 5 $\mu$s. Thus, initially successful charge separation is followed by delayed electron capture at the interface, leading to apparently low charge separation efficiencies. This finding provides a sufficiently large timeframe for counter-measures in device design to successfully implement specifically ZnO and, moreover, invites material scientists to revisit charge separation in various kinds of previously discarded hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic work of partial resetting</title>

Abstract: Partial resetting, whereby a state variable $x(t)$ is reset at random times to a value $a x (t)$, $0\leq a \leq 1$, generalizes conventional resetting by introducing the resetting strength $a$ as a parameter. Partial resetting generates a broad family of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) that interpolates between the conventional NESS at strong resetting ($a=0$) and a Gaussian distribution at weak resetting ($a \to 1$). Here, such resetting processes are studied from a thermodynamic perspective, and the mean cost associated with maintaining such NESS are derived. The resetting phase of the dynamics is implemented by a resetting potential $\Phi(x)$ that mediates the resets in finite time. By working in an ensemble of trajectories with a fixed number of resets, we study both the steady-state properties of the propagator and its moments. The thermodynamic work needed to sustain the resulting NESS is then investigated. We find that different resetting traps can give rise to rates of work with widely different dependencies on the resetting strength $a$. Surprisingly, in the case of resets mediated by a harmonic trap with otherwise free diffusive motion, the asymptotic rate of work is insensitive to the value of $a$. For general anharmonic traps, the asymptotic rate of work can be either increasing or decreasing as a function of the strength $a$, depending on the degree of anharmonicity. Counter to intuition, the rate of work can therefore in some cases increase as the resetting becomes weaker $(a\to 1)$ although the work vanishes at $a=1$. Work in the presence of a background potential is also considered. Numerical simulations confirm our findings.</description>

Abstract: Employing a two-species Cahn-Hilliard model with nonreciprocal interactions we show that the interplay of nonreciprocity and conservation laws results in the coexistence of uniform stationary and oscillatory phases as well as of uniform and crystalline phases. For nonequilibrium models with a \textit{spurious gradient dynamics structure} [T. Frohoff-H{\"u}lsmann \textit{et al.}, Phys.\ Rev.\ E 107, 64210 (2023)] the coexistence between nonequilibrium phases can nevertheless be predicted by a Maxwell double-tangent construction including phases with sustained out-of-equilibrium dynamics. This is further corroborated by bifurcation studies and time simulations.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional vertex model for curvy cell-cell interfaces at the subcellular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-sections of cell shapes in a tissue monolayer typically resemble a tiling of convex polygons. Yet, examples exist where the polygons are not convex with curved cell-cell interfaces, as seen in the adaxial epidermis. To date, two-dimensional vertex models predicting the structure and mechanics of cell monolayers have been mostly limited to convex polygons. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a framework to study curvy cell-cell interfaces at the subcellular scale within vertex models by using a parameterized curve between vertices that is expanded in a Fourier series and whose coefficients represent additional degrees of freedom. This extension to non-convex polygons allows for cells with same shape index, or dimensionless perimeter, to be, for example, either elongated or globular with lobes. In the presence of applied, anisotropic stresses, we find that local, subcellular curvature, or buckling, can be energetically more favorable than larger scale deformations involving groups of cells. Inspired by recent experiments, we also find that local, subcellular curvature at cell-cell interfaces emerges in a group of cells in response to the swelling of additional cells surrounding the group. Our framework, therefore, can account for a wider array of multi-cellular responses to constraints in the tissue environment.</description>
