      <title>Linear-Response Quantum-Electrodynamical Density Functional Theory Based on Two-Component X2C Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear-response quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT) enables the description of molecular spectra under strong coupling to quantized photonic modes, such as those in optical cavities. Recently, this approach was extended to the relativistic domain using the four-component Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian. To provide a computationally efficient yet accurate alternative-particularly for modeling 2D spectra or collective coupling for large, heavy-element systems-this article introduces a two-component linear-response QEDFT method based on exact two-component (X2C) Hamiltonian models. We derive how the parent four-component Hamiltonian for coupled electron-photon systems undergoes the X2C transformation. Moreover, we show that, under common weak-field and dipole approximations, it suffices to apply the X2C transformation only during the ground-state self-consistent field procedure, with the subsequent calculations performed fully in the two-component regime using the same X2C decoupling matrix. The current implementation includes the atomic mean-field (amfX2C), extended atomic mean-field (eamfX2C), and molecular mean-field (mmfX2C) Hamiltonian models. Benchmark calculations demonstrate that the X2C approach closely reproduces reference four-component results, enabling us to efficiently tackle systems that would be otherwise computationally too expensive. As applications, we compute 2D spectra of a mercury porphyrin complex in a Fabry-Perot cavity, demonstrating off-resonant coupling and the appearance of multiple polaritonic branches. We also study a chain of AuH molecules, showing that collective coupling can locally modify chemical properties of a molecule with a perturbed bond length.</description>

      <title>NNQS-AFQMC: Neural network quantum states enhanced fermionic quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient approach to implement neural network quantum states (NNQS) as trial wavefunctions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ans\"atze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recent progress has shown that a broad class of highly correlated wavefunctions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries. Our results demonstrate that AFQMC with an NNQS trial wavefunction can attain near-exact total energies, highlighting the potential of AFQMC with NNQS to overcome longstanding challenges in strongly correlated electronic structure calculations. We also outline future research directions for improving this promising methodology.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Surrogate Modeling with Multi-Objective Optimization and Decision-Making of a Steam Methane Reforming Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an integrated modeling and optimization framework for a steam methane reforming (SMR) reactor, combining a mathematical model, artificial neural network (ANN)-based hybrid modeling, advanced multi-objective optimization (MOO) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. A one-dimensional fixed-bed reactor model accounting for internal mass transfer resistance was employed to simulate reactor performance. To reduce the high computational cost of the mathematical model, a hybrid ANN surrogate was constructed, achieving a 93.8% reduction in average simulation time while maintaining high predictive accuracy. The hybrid model was then embedded into three MOO scenarios using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) solver: 1) maximizing methane conversion and hydrogen output; 2) maximizing hydrogen output while minimizing carbon dioxide emissions; and 3) a combined three-objective case. The optimal trade-off solutions were further ranked and selected using two MCDM methods: technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and simplified preference ranking on the basis of ideal-average distance (sPROBID). Optimal results include a methane conversion of 0.863 with 4.556 mol/s hydrogen output in the first case, and 0.988 methane conversion with 3.335 mol/s hydrogen and 0.781 mol/s carbon dioxide in the third. This comprehensive methodology offers a scalable and effective strategy for optimizing complex catalytic reactor systems with multiple, often conflicting, objectives.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Inference of Liquid Structure from Scattering Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian framework to infer radial distribution functions from experimental scattering measurements with uncertainty quantification using non-stationary Gaussian processes. The Gaussian process prior mean and kernel functions are designed to mitigate well-known numerical challenges with the Fourier transform, including discrete measurement binning and detector windowing, while encoding fundamental yet minimal physical knowledge of liquid structure. We demonstrate uncertainty propagation of the Gaussian process posterior to unmeasured quantities of interest. The methodology is applied to liquid argon and water as a proof of principle. The full implementation is available on GitHub at https://github.com/hoepfnergroup/LiquidStructureGP-Sullivan.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Plausibility-Validity Gap by Fine-Tuning a Reasoning-Enhanced LLM for Chemical Synthesis and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also delineating critical areas for future improvement.</description>

      <title>General purpose models for the chemical sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models, general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process. While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Effects of One-particle Reduced Density Matrix Optimization in Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising method for simulating molecular systems on near-term quantum computers. This approach employs energy estimation; however, other relevant molecular properties can be extracted from the one-particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM) generated by VQE. The accuracy of these properties strongly depends on the reliability and convergence of the 1-RDM, which is not guaranteed by energy-only optimization. Thus, we investigate the effect of optimizing the 1-RDM within VQE to improve the accuracy of both the energy and molecular properties. A two-step algorithm was implemented that optimizes the energy and 1-RDM by incorporating a penalty term in the cost function to enforce the convergence of the 1-RDM. The first step focuses on energy minimization, while in the second step, a weighted penalty is added to the cost function to promote simultaneous improvement of the energy and 1-RDM. This approach was tested and validated for the k-UpCCGSD and GateFabric ans\"atzes with active spaces (4,4) and (2,2), respectively. k-UpCCGSD produces energies close to CISD, so optimizing 1-RDM has little effect on the energy but significantly improves electronic properties such as electron density, dipole moments, and atomic charges. GateFabric initially shows higher energy deviations from CISD, but optimizing 1-RDM substantially improves both the energy accuracy and the quality of 1-RDM. These results demonstrate that simultaneous optimization of energy and 1-RDM is an effective strategy to improve the accuracy of energies and molecular properties in variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Kernel Ridge Regression for conformer ensembles made easy with Structured Orthogonal Random Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A computationally efficient protocol for machine learning in chemical space using Boltzmann ensembles of conformers as input is proposed; the method is based on rewriting Kernel Ridge Regression expressions in terms of Structured Orthogonal Random Features, yielding physics-motivated trigonometric neural networks. To evaluate the method's utility for materials discovery, we test it on experimental datasets of two quantities related to battery electrolyte design, namely oxidation potentials in acetonitrile and hydration energies, using several popular molecular representations to demonstrate the method's flexibility. Despite only using computationally cheap forcefield calculations for conformer generation, we observe systematic decrease of machine learning error with increased training set size in all cases, with experimental accuracy reached after training on hundreds of molecules and prediction errors being comparable to state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. We also present novel versions of Huber and LogCosh loss functions that made hyperparameter optimization of the new approach more convenient.</description>

      <title>A Large Language Model for Chemistry and Retrosynthesis Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have achieved impressive progress across a broad range of general-purpose tasks, but their effectiveness in chemistry remains limited due to scarce domain-specific datasets and the demand for precise symbolic and structural reasoning. Here we introduce ECNU-ChemGPT(name after East China Normal University), a chemistry-specialized LLM engineered for deep chemical knowledge understanding and accurate retrosynthetic route planning. Our approach is distinguished by four key strategies: structured prompt-based knowledge distillation from authoritative chemistry textbooks to construct a high-quality question-answering dataset; domain-specific prompt engineering using curated chemical keywords, combined with LLMs APIs for data derivation and knowledge distillation; large-scale fine-tuning on a meticulously cleaned and enriched Pistachio reaction dataset to enhance retrosynthesis prediction accuracy; and integration of BrainGPT, a dynamic multi-model scheduling framework that enables task-specific invocation of multiple specialized models trained for diverse chemistry-related tasks. ECNU-ChemGPT exhibits superior performance on chemistry question-answering and retrosynthetic planning benchmarks, outperforming leading general-purpose models-including Deepseek-R1, Qwen-2.5, and GPT-4o. In retrosynthesis, it achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 68.3% on the USPTO_50K dataset and successfully reconstructed 13 complete experimental pathways for real-world drug molecules from medicinal chemistry journals. These results underscore the effectiveness of domain-adapted fine-tuning combined with dynamic multi-model task scheduling, providing a scalable and robust solution for chemical knowledge question answering and retrosynthetic planning.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent molecular rotor-based polymer materials for local microviscosity mapping in microfluidic channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A viscosity-sensitive monomer consisting of a methacrylate-functionalized julolidone-based molecular rotor (MECVJ) was synthesized and used to obtain viscosity-sensitive polymers (poly(DMA-\textit{s}-MECVJ)). The qualitative properties of the molecular rotor were preserved after its inclusion in the new polymer, in particular the effect of the viscosity of the surrounding medium on the fluorescence lifetime of the rotor. By grafting these polymers onto glass slides, viscosity-sensitive surfaces were obtained, showing good robustness in time after successive use and washing. As proof of concept, these surfaces were used to assemble a microfluidic chip capable of mapping viscosity of fluids flowing inside the channel.</description>

      <title>Towards Excitations and Dynamical Quantities in Correlated Lattices with Density Matrix Embedding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) provides a framework to describe ground-state expectation values in strongly correlated systems, but its extension to dynamical quantities is still an open problem. We show one route to obtaining excitations and dynamical spectral functions by using the techniques of DMET to approximate the matrix elements that arise in a single-mode inspired excitation ansatz. We demonstrate this approach in the 1D Hubbard model, comparing the neutral excitations, single-particle density of states, charge, and spin dynamical structure factors to benchmarks from the Bethe ansatz and density matrix renormalization group. Our work highlights the potential of these ideas in building computationally efficient approaches for dynamical quantities.</description>
