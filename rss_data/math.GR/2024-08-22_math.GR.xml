      <title>Finite-dimensional pseudofinite groups of small dimension, without CFSG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any simple pseudofinite group G is known to be isomorphic to a (twisted) Chevalley group over a pseudofinite field. This celebrated result mostly follows from the work of Wilson in 1995 and heavily relies on the classification of finite simple groups (CFSG). It easily follows that G is finite-dimensional with additive and fine dimension and, in particular, that if dim(G)=3 then G is isomorphic to PSL(2,F) for some pseudofinite field F. We describe pseudofinite finite-dimensional groups when the dimension is fine, additive and \&lt;4 and, in particular, show that the classification G isomorphic to PSL(2,F) is independent from CFSG.</description>

      <title>Detecting virtual homomorphisms via Banach metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of "Banach metrics" on finitely generated infinite groups. This extends the notion of a Cayley graph (as a metric space). Our motivation comes from trying to detect the existence of virtual homomorphisms into Z, the additive group of integers. We show that detection of such homomorphisms through metric functional boundaries of Cayley graphs isn't always possible. However, we prove that it is always possible to do so through a metric functional boundary of some Banach metric on the group.</description>

      <title>On soficity for certain fundamental groups of graphs of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we study a family of graphs of groups over arbitrary base graphs where all vertex groups are isomorphic to a fixed countable sofic group $G$, and all edge groups $H&lt;G$ are such that the embeddings of $H$ into $G$ are identical everywhere. We prove soficity for this family of groups under a flexible technical hypothesis for $H$ called $\sigma$-co-sofic. This proves soficity for group doubles $*_H G$, where $H&lt;G$ is an arbitrary separable subgroup and $G$ is countable and sofic. This includes arbitrary finite index group doubles of sofic groups among various other examples.</description>

      <title>On the semigroup of monoid endomorphisms of the semigroup $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ be the submooid of the bicyclic monoid which which is studied in \cite{Makanjuola-Umar=1997}. We describe monoid endomorphisms of the semigroup $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ which are generated by the family of all congruences of the bicyclic monoid and all injective monoid endomorphisms of $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$.</description>

      <title>Pushforward measures on homogeneous spaces of non-unimodular groups and properties of modular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that a formula for the pushforward measures on the fiber bundle $ G \to G / H $ of homogeneous space of locally compact groups $ G $ and $ H $ can be written down by using the modular functions. As a result, we obtain the equality \begin{align} \frac{ \Delta_G ( h ) }{ \Delta_{ G / N } ( h N ) } = \frac{ \Delta_H ( h ) }{ \Delta_{ H / N } ( h N ) } \end{align} on the modular functions for any closed subgroups $ N $ and $ H $ of a locally compact group $ G $ with $ N \lhd G $ and $ N \subset H \subset G $ and any $ h \in H $.</description>

      <title>Sandpiles on the Vicsek fractal explode with probability 1/4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vicsek fractal graphs are an important class of infinite graphs with self similar properties, polynomial growth and treelike features, on which several dynamical processes such as random walks or Abelian sandpiles can be rigorously analyzed and one can obtain explicit closed form expressions. While such processes on Vicsek fractals and on Euclidean lattices $\mathbb{Z}^2$ share some properties for instance in the recurrence behaviour, many quantities related to sandpiles on Euclidean lattices are still poorly understood. The current work focuses on the stabilization and explosion of Abelian sandpiles on Vicsek fractal graphs, and we prove that a sandpile sampled from the infinite volume limit plus one additional particle stabilizes with probability 3/4, that is, it does not stabilize almost surely and it explodes with the complementary probability 1/4. We prove the main result by using two different approaches: one of probabilistic nature and one of algebraic flavor. The first approach is based on investigating the particles sent to the boundary of finite volumes and showing that their number stays above four with positive probability. In the second approach we relate the question of stabilization and explosion of sandpiles in infinite volume to the order of elements of the sandpile group on finite approximations of the infinite Vicsek graph. The method applies to more general state spaces and by employing it we also find all invariant factors of the sandpile groups on the finite approximations of the infinite Vicsek fractal.</description>
