      <title>Generating ensembles of spatially-coherent in-situ forecasts using flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a machine-learning-based methodology for in-situ weather forecast postprocessing that is both spatially coherent and multivariate. Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional turbulent condensates without bottom drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extent to which statistical equilibrium theory is applicable to driven dissipative dynamics remains an important open question in many systems. We use extensive direct numerical simulations of the incompressible two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equation to examine the steady state of large-scale condensates in 2D turbulence at finite Reynolds number $Re$ in the absence of bottom drag. Large-scale condensates appear above a critical Reynolds number $Re_c\approx 4.19$. Close to this onset, we find a power-law scaling of the energy with $Re-Re_c$, with the energy spectrum at large scales following the absolute equilibrium form proposed by Kraichnan. At larger $Re$, the energy spectrum deviates from this form, displaying a steep power-law range at low wave numbers with exponent $-5$, with most of the energy dissipation occurring within the condensate at large scales. We show that this spectral exponent is consistent with the logarithmic radial vorticity profile of the condensate vortices predicted by quasi-linear theory for a viscously saturated condensate. Our findings shed new light on the classical problem of large-scale turbulent condensation in forced dissipative 2D flows in finite domains, showing that the large scales are close to equilibrium dynamics in weakly turbulent flows but not in the strong condensate regime with $Re\gg1$.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of atmospheric transport and dispersion of Phakopsora pachyrhizi urediniospores in South America using the state of Paran\'a-Brazil as a model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phakopsora pachyrhizi is a biotrophic fungus that requires living plant tissue to survive in the wild for extended periods. The fungus causes Asian rust and costs billions of US dollars every year for its control in South American soy production. Despite the regulatory measure that prohibits the cultivation of soybeans in some months of the year (soybean-free period) in Brazil, the presence of soybean production areas in neighboring countries, such as Paraguay and Bolivia, can help the survival of the pathogen between crop seasons. It is known that P. pachyrhizi urediniospores can be spread/transported thousands of kilometres by the wind. In this context, the objective of this work was to develop a mathematical model to simulate the atmospheric transport of P. pachyrhizi urediniospores from the west, Paraguay/Bolivia to Paran\'a Brazil, through storms coming from cold fronts. The transport of urediniospores was modeled by a diffusive-convective-reactive equation. Wind direction and the velocity of cold fronts that crossed Paran\'a state between October 2018 and February 2019 were used. For validation, real cases of rust occurrence in the Paran\'a state informed by the Anti-rust Consortium Portal in the season 2018/19 were used. The results confirm mathematically that urediniospores from infected areas located in a country on the west can be transported and deposited on the east, in the state of Paran\'a. The first case of soybean rust in Paran\'a state/Brazil was registered 10 days after the first cold front, suggesting that the transported and deposited urediniospores were still viable for host infection. This work reinforces the importance of the establishment of the soybean-free period in other soybean-producing countries. It will also provide a better understanding of the fungus dispersion system, potentially enabling the correct use of fungicides.</description>
