      <title>A dynamics-based density profile for dark haloes -- III. Parameter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous paper of this series, we proposed a new function to fit halo density profiles out to large radii. This truncated Einasto profile models the inner, orbiting matter as $\rho_{\rm orb} \propto \exp \left[-2/\alpha\ (r / r_{\rm s})^\alpha - 1/\beta\ (r / r_{\rm t})^\beta \right]$ and the outer, infalling term as a power-law overdensity. In this paper, we analyse the resulting parameter space of scale radius $r_{\rm s}$, truncation radius $r_{\rm t}$, steepening $\alpha$, truncation sharpness $\beta$, infalling normalisation $\delta_1$, and infalling slope $s$. We show that these parameters are non-degenerate in averaged profiles, and that fits to the total profiles generally recover the underlying properties of the orbiting and infalling terms. We study the connection between profile parameters and halo properties such as mass (or peak height) and accretion rate. We find that the commonly cited dependence of $\alpha$ on peak height is an artefact of fitting Einasto profiles to the actual, truncated profiles. In our fits, $\alpha$ is independent of mass but dependent on accretion rate. When fitting individual halo profiles, the parameters exhibit significant scatter but otherwise follow the same trends. We confirm that the entire profiles are sensitive to the accretion history of haloes, and that the two radial scales $r_{\rm s}$ and $r_{\rm t}$ particularly respond to the formation time and recent accretion rate. As a result, $r_{\rm t}$ is a more accurate measure of the accretion rate than the commonly used radius where the density slope is steepest.</description>

      <title>Anisotropies of cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds in non-flat spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports of stochastic gravitational wave background from four independent pulsar-timing-array collaborations have renewed the interest in the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB), which is expected to open a new window into the early Universe. Although the early Universe is supposed to be flat from an inflationary point of view, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data alone from the Planck satellite measurement prefers an enhanced lensing amplitude that can be explained by a closed Universe. In this paper, we propose an independent method to constrain the early-Universe flatness from the anisotropies of CGWB. Using the generalized harmonic decompositions in the non-flat spacetime, we find CGWBs from different physical mechanisms such as cosmic inflation and phase transitions share the same integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) term but possess different SW terms, which would exhibit different behaviors when including the spatial curvature since the ISW effect is more sensitive to the spatial curvature than the SW effect. Furthermore, we provide the cross-correlations between CGWB and CMB, implying a positive or negative correlation between their SW effect terms depending on the GW mechanisms, which may hint at the sign of f NL when considering non-Gaussianity contributions to anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Effects of scalar non-Gaussianity on induced scalar-tensor gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If primordial scalar or tensor perturbations are enhanced on short scales, it may lead to the production of observable gravitational wave signals. These waves may be sourced by scalar-scalar, scalar-tensor or tensor-tensor interactions. Typically, models of inflation capable of producing large peaks in the scalar primordial power spectrum also generate sizeable scalar non-Gaussianity. Previous studies have investigated the possible effects of this on the scalar-scalar induced gravitational wave spectrum by assuming a local expansion in terms of the parameters $F_{\textrm{NL}}$, $G_{\textrm{NL}}$ and so on. We extend this approach to the case of scalar-tensor induced gravitational waves, introducing a local expansion for scalar non-Gaussianity into the scalar-tensor sector equations. We compute the contribution to the gravitational wave spectrum from the resulting new term and analyse its distinguishing features.</description>

      <title>Exploring the halo-galaxy connection with probabilistic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between galaxies and dark matter halos encompasses a range of processes and play a pivotal role in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. Traditionally, this link has been established through physical or empirical models. Machine learning techniques are adaptable tools that handle high-dimensional data and grasp associations between numerous attributes. In particular, probabilistic models capture the stochasticity inherent to these complex relations. We compare different probabilistic machine learning methods to model the uncertainty in the halo-galaxy connection and efficiently generate galaxy catalogs that faithfully resemble the reference sample by predicting joint distributions of central galaxy properties conditioned to their host halo features. The analysis is based on the IllustrisTNG300 simulation. The methods model the distributions in different ways. We compare a multilayer perceptron that predicts the parameters of a multivariate Gaussian distribution, a multilayer perceptron classifier, and the method of normalizing flows. The classifier predicts the parameters of a Categorical distribution, which are defined in a high-dimensional parameter space through a Voronoi cell-based hierarchical scheme. We evaluate the model's performances under various sample selections based on halo properties. The three methods exhibit comparable results, with normalizing flows showing the best performance in most scenarios. The models reproduce the main features of galaxy properties distributions with high-fidelity and reproduce the results obtained with traditional, deterministic, estimators. Our results also indicate that different halos and galaxy populations are subject to varying degrees of stochasticity, which has relevant implications for studies of large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>Small noise expansion of stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing the small noise expansion techniques, we show that the fully nonlinear (non-Markovian) stochastic inflationary system, may be re-cast in terms of an infinite set of Wiener processes (stochastic equations with white noises). As a byproduct, we show that the Starobinsky test field approximation might only provide information about the linear regime of cosmological perturbations and scalar-feld non-Gaussianities might only appear at next to leading order in slow-roll parameters.</description>

      <title>Local Primordial Non-Gaussian Bias at the Field Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local primordial non-Gaussianity (LPNG) couples long-wavelength cosmological fluctuations to the short-wavelength behavior of galaxies. This coupling is encoded in bias parameters including $b_{\phi}$ and $b_{\delta\phi}$ at linear and quadratic order in the large-scale biasing framework. We perform the first field-level measurement of $b_{\phi}$ and $b_{\delta\phi}$ using Lagrangian bias and non-linear displacements from N-body simulations. We compare our field level measurements with universality predictions and separate universe results, finding qualitative consistency, but disagreement in detail. We also quantify the information on $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})}$ available in the field given various assumptions on knowledge of $b_{\phi}$ at fixed initial conditions. We find that it is not possible to precisely constrain $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})}$ when marginalizing over $b_{\phi} f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})}$ even at the field level, observing a 2-3X degradation in constraints between a linear and quadratic biasing model on perturbative field-level mocks, suggesting that a $b_{\phi}$ prior is necessary to meaningfully constrain $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})}$ at the field level even in this idealized scenario. For simulated dark matter halos, the pure $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})}$ constraints from both linear and quadratic field-level models appear biased when marginalizing over bias parameters including $b_{\phi}$ and $b_{\delta\phi}$ due largely to the $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})} - b_\phi$ degeneracy. Our results are an important consistency test of the large-scale bias framework for LPNG and highlight the importance of physically motivated priors on LPNG bias parameters for future surveys.</description>

      <title>Towards a Complete Treatment of Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves with Early Matter Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large curvature perturbations can source an observable amount of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). We consider several scenarios where small-scale curvature perturbations are naturally enhanced due to the presence of additional spectator fields during inflation. The same spectator fields can lead to a period of early matter domination (EMD) after inflation. We compute the inflationary spectrum of curvature perturbation and determine its evolution at later times, taking into account both the onset and the end of the EMD epoch, and also the impact of relative velocity perturbation between matter and radiation. The feature that the same field is responsible for both enhanced perturbations and the EMD era, leads to a predictive framework within which the full frequency dependence of SGWB can be computed. The SGWB can be observed in several detectors, including those focused on the nano-Hz regime. Our numerical framework can also be used to study other non-standard cosmological histories.</description>

      <title>Gas-induced perturbations on the gravitational wave in-spiral of live post-Newtonian LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $53$ to $30$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also identify and measure a novel GW-gas coupling term in the in-spiral rate that makes gas effects an order of magnitude stronger than the gas-only contribution. We show that the evolution rate ($\dot a$) of the MBHB can be neatly expressed as the sum of the GW rate ($\dot a_{\rm GW}$), the pure gas-driven rate ($\dot a_{\rm gas}$), and their cross-term $\propto\dot a_{\rm GW}\dot a_{\rm gas}$. The source-frame gas-induced dephasing in the GW waveform is equivalent to losing $\sim0.5$ GW cycles over the expected $\sim1700$ cycles in a vacuum, which LISA should detect at redshift $z=1$. We also propose a phenomenological model that captures the essence of simulations and can be used to perform Bayesian inference. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications on multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Early formation of supermassive black holes from the collapse of strongly self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence for high-redshift supermassive black holes challenges standard scenarios for how such objects form in the early universe. Here, we entertain the possibility that a fraction of the cosmological dark matter could be ultra-strongly self interacting. This would imply that gravothermal collapse occur at early times in the cores of dark matter halos, followed by accretion. We study under which conditions on the abundance and interaction strength and structure of such ultra self-interacting dark matter the black holes resulting from the end-point of gravothermal core collapse can seed the observed, early-forming supermassive black holes. We find, depending on the velocity dependence of the self-interaction cross section, a bimodal structure in the favored parameter space, where data points to either a small collapsing dark matter fraction with a large cross section, or a large fraction and a relatively small cross section. While self-interaction cross sections with different velocity dependence can explain observations, we find that the best, self-consistent results correspond to a Rutherford-like self-interaction, typical of long-range dark-sector forces with light mediators. We discuss complementary observational probes if this scenario is realized in nature, focusing especially on the expected intermediate mass black holes predicted to exist in smaller galaxies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from burdened primordial black holes dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the natural candidate of dark matter (DM) as they only interact gravitationally and can evade any experiments on earth. In the standard semiclassical calculation of Hawking radiation, PBHs with mass below $10^{15}\rm g$ evaporated by now and therefore cannot be DM. However, the recently-discovered quantum memory burden effect can significantly suppress the evaporation of PBHs after the half-decay time. This quantum effect could open up a new mass window below $10^{10} \rm g$ where PBHs can still exist today and be DM. In this paper, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals associated with the formation of PBHs in this new mass window. We consider two formation scenarios: PBHs formed from inflationary perturbation and PBHs formed from collapse of Fermi-balls in a first-order phase transition (FOPT). GWs produced from these two scenarios have distinct features and, while the GW from inflation peaks at high frequency, the GW from FOPT peaks at lower frequency that can be within the reach of future experiments.</description>

      <title>ProGeny I: a new simple stellar population generator and impact of isochrones / stellar atmospheres / initial mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce ProGeny, a new stellar population library (SPL) software package written in R. This release encapsulates the core software to generate simple/single stellar populations (SSPs); the various data inputs required (in particular isochrones and stellar atmospheres); example scripts to generate the SSPs; and a number of pre-generated static SSP available forimmediate use.The mostnovelfeature ofProGeny is itsabilitytoproduce SSPs with evolving initial mass functions, allowing functional dependencies on stellar age or metallicity. We perform both internal comparisons (within the ProGeny SPL) and external comparisons (with other public SSPs) and tests. The main conclusion is that the choice of isochrone has significantly more impact on the predicted spectra than the choice of stellar atmospheres and/or IMF (comparing Chabrier and Kroupa variants). A number of limiting uncertaintiesand corrections forstarformationrates andstellar massesare alsopresented.</description>

      <title>Reconciling PTA and JWST and preparing for LISA with \texttt{POMPOCO}: a Parametrisation Of the Massive black hole POpulation for Comparison to Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Bound on Light Dark Photon Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a general and robust bound on dark photon dark matter with a mass acquired through the Higgs mechanism:$$m_{\gamma'}/(q_H e_H)\;\gg \;60\,{\rm eV}$$ where $m_{\gamma'}$ is the dark photon mass, $e_H$ is the gauge coupling, and $q_H$ is the charge of the dark Higgs boson. This bound arises from the requirement that the symmetry breaking occurs and the dark photon must acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism by the time of redshift $z \sim 10^6$ to form cold dark matter, independent of any specific production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Flow for Cosmological Loop Integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, an interesting pattern was found in the differential equations satisfied by the Feynman integrals describing tree-level correlators of conformally coupled scalars in a power-law FRW cosmology [1,2]. It was proven that simple and universal graphical rules predict the equations for arbitrary graphs as a flow in kinematic space. In this note, we show that the same rules$\unicode{x2013}$with one small addition$\unicode{x2013}$also determine the differential equations for loop integrands. We explain that both the basis of master integrals and the singularities of the differential equations can be represented by tubings of marked graphs. An important novelty in the case of loops is that some basis functions can vanish, and we present a graphical rule to identify these vanishing functions. Taking this into account, we then demonstrate that the kinematic flow correctly predicts the differential equations for all loop integrands.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of Overlap Reduction Functions for Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays seek and study gravitational waves (GWs) through the angular two-point correlation function of timing residuals they induce in pulsars. The two-point correlation function induced by the standard transverse-traceless GWs is the famous Hellings-Downs curve, a function only of the angle between the two pulsars. Additional polarization modes (vector/scalar) that may arise in alternative-gravity theories have different angular correlation functions. Furthermore, anisotropy, linear, or circular polarization in the stochastic GW background gives rise to additional structure in the two-point correlation function that cannot be written simply in terms of the angular separation of the two pulsars. In this paper, we provide a simple formula for the most general two-point correlation function--or overlap reduction function (ORF)--for a gravitational-wave background with an arbitrary polarization state, possibly containing anisotropies in its intensity and polarization (linear or circular). We provide specific expressions for the ORFs sourced by the general-relativistic transverse-traceless GW modes as well as vector (or spin-1) modes that may arise in alternative-gravity theories.</description>

      <title>No-go guide for the Hubble tension: late-time or local-scale new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard model of modern cosmology might be cracked by the recent persistent hot debate on the Hubble-constant ($H_0$) tension, which manifests itself as the sound-horizon ($r_s$) tension or absolute-magnitude ($M_B$) tension if deeming the origin of the Hubble tension from modifying the early or late Universe, respectively. In this paper, we achieve a fully model-independent constraint (fitting a model-independent global parameterization to a model-independent inverse distant ladder with a model-independent high-redshift calibration) on late-time models with strong evidence against homogeneous new physics over the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Further using this model-independent constraint to calibrate sufficiently local supernovae with corresponding late-time models extrapolated below the homogeneity scale, we find surprisingly that, although both $H_0$ tension and $M_B$ tension are absent in our local Universe, a combination of $H_0$ and $M_B$ as the intercept $a_B$ of the magnitude-redshift relation exhibits $3\sim 7\sigma$ tension even for the $\Lambda$CDM model. This $a_B$ tension seems to call for local-scale inhomogeneous new physics disguised as local observational systematics.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Redshifts of Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) is caused by the wavelength dependence of our atmosphere's refractive index, which shifts the apparent positions of stars and galaxies and distorts their shapes depending on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). While this effect is typically mitigated and corrected for in imaging observations, we investigate how DCR can instead be used to our advantage to infer the redshifts of supernovae from multi-band, time-series imaging data. We simulate Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the proposed Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Deep Drilling Field (DDF), and evaluate astrometric redshifts. We find that the redshift accuracy improves dramatically with the statistical quality of the astrometric measurements as well as with the accuracy of the astrometric solution. For a conservative choice of a 5-mas systematic uncertainty floor, we find that our redshift estimation is accurate at $z &lt; 0.6$. We then combine our astrometric redshifts with both host galaxy photometric redshifts and supernovae photometric (light-curve) redshifts and show that this considerably improves the overall redshift estimates. These astrometric redshifts will be valuable especially since Rubin will discover a vast number of supernovae for which we will not be able to obtain spectroscopic redshifts.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the extent to which collisionless dark matter impacts the stability of supermassive stars $(M\gtrsim10^4\,M_\odot)$. We find that, depending on the star's mass, a dark matter content in excess of ${\sim}1\%$ by mass throughout the entire star can raise the critical central density for the onset general relativistic instability, in some cases by orders of magnitude. We consider implications of this effect for the onset of nuclear burning and significant neutrino energy losses.</description>

      <title>Eigen-decomposition of Covariance matrices: An application to the BAO Linear Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in the two-point correlation function (TPCF) of discrete tracers such as galaxies is an accurate standard ruler. The covariance matrix of the TPCF plays an important role in determining how the precision of this ruler depends on the number density and clustering strength of the tracers, as well as the survey volume. An eigen-decomposition of this matrix provides an objective way to separate the contributions of cosmic variance from those of shot-noise to the statistical uncertainties. For the signal-to-noise levels that are expected in ongoing and next-generation surveys, the cosmic variance eigen-modes dominate. These modes are smooth functions of scale, meaning that: they are insensitive to the modest changes in binning that are allowed if one wishes to resolve the BAO feature in the TPCF; they provide a good description of the correlated residuals which result from fitting smooth functional forms to the measured TPCF; they motivate a simple but accurate approximation for the uncertainty on the Linear Point (LP) estimate of the BAO distance scale. This approximation allows one to quantify the precision of the BAO distance scale estimate without having to generate a large ensemble of mock catalogs and explains why: the uncertainty on the LP does not depend on the functional form fitted to the TPCF or the binning used; the LP is more constraining than the peak or dip scales in the TPCF; the evolved TPCF is less constraining than the initial one, so that reconstruction schemes can yield significant gains in precision.</description>

      <title>Efficient hybrid technique for generating sub-grid haloes in reionization simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the distribution of cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) during the epoch of reionization requires a high dynamic range and is hence computationally expensive. The size of the simulation is dictated by the largest scales one aims to probe, while the resolution is determined by the smallest dark matter haloes capable of hosting the first stars. We present a hybrid approach where the density and tidal fields of a large-volume, low-resolution simulation are combined with small haloes from a small-volume, high-resolution box. By merging these two boxes of relatively lower dynamic range, we achieve an effective high-dynamic range simulation using only 13% of the computational resources required for a full high-dynamic range simulation. Our method accurately reproduces the one- and two-point statistics of the halo field, its cross-correlation with the dark matter density field, and the two-point statistics of the HI field computed using a semi-numerical code, all within 10% accuracy at large scales and across different redshifts. Our technique, combined with semi-numerical models of reionization, provides a resource-efficient tool for modeling the HI distribution at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Testing the phenomenological interacting dark energy model with gamma-ray bursts and Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize recent observational data from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and Pantheon+ supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) sample to explore the interacting dark energy (IDE) model in a phenomenological scenario. Results from GRBs alone, SNe Ia and GRBs+SNe Ia indicate that the energy is transferred from dark energy to dark matter and the coincidence problem is alleviated. The value of $H_0$ from GRBs+SNe Ia in the IDE scenario shows agreement with the SH0ES measurement. Considering the age estimate of the quasar APM 08279+5255 at $z = 3.91$, we find that the phenomenological IDE scenario can predict a cosmic age greater than that of the $\Lambda$CDM model, thus the cosmic age problem can be alleviated.</description>

      <title>LiteBIRD Science Goals and Forecasts. Mapping the Hot Gas in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the capabilities of the LiteBIRD mission to map the hot gas distribution in the Universe through the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. Our analysis relies on comprehensive simulations incorporating various sources of Galactic and extragalactic foreground emission, while accounting for specific instrumental characteristics of LiteBIRD, such as detector sensitivities, frequency-dependent beam convolution, inhomogeneous sky scanning, and $1/f$ noise. We implement a tailored component-separation pipeline to map the thermal SZ Compton $y$-parameter over 98% of the sky. Despite lower angular resolution for galaxy cluster science, LiteBIRD provides full-sky coverage and, compared to the Planck satellite, enhanced sensitivity, as well as more frequency bands to enable the construction of an all-sky $y$-map, with reduced foreground contamination at large and intermediate angular scales. By combining LiteBIRD and Planck channels in the component-separation pipeline, we obtain an optimal $y$-map that leverages the advantages of both experiments, with the higher angular resolution of the Planck channels enabling the recovery of compact clusters beyond the LiteBIRD beam limitations, and the numerous sensitive LiteBIRD channels further mitigating foregrounds. The added value of LiteBIRD is highlighted through the examination of maps, power spectra, and one-point statistics of the various sky components. After component separation, the $1/f$ noise from LiteBIRD is effectively mitigated below the thermal SZ signal at all multipoles. Cosmological constraints on $S_8=\sigma_8\left(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right)^{0.5}$ obtained from the LiteBIRD-Planck combined $y$-map power spectrum exhibits a 15% reduction in uncertainty compared to constraints from Planck alone. This improvement can be attributed to the increased portion of uncontaminated sky available in the LiteBIRD-Planck combined $y$-map.</description>

Abstract: We measure the speed of light with current observations, such as Type Ia Supernova, galaxy ages, radial BAO mode, as well as simulations of forthcoming redshift surveys and gravitational waves as standard sirens. By means of a Gaussian Process reconstruction, we find that the precision of such measurements can be improved from roughly 6\% and to about $2-2.5\%$ when the gravitational wave simulations are considered, and to $1.5-2\%$ when redshift survey are included in the analysis as well. This result demonstrates that we will be able to perform a cosmological measurement of a fundamental physical constant with significantly improved precision, which will help us underpinning if its value is truly consistent with local measurements, as predicted by the standard model of Cosmology.</description>

Abstract: We show that a universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using various information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

Abstract: The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment is sensitive to narrow axion flows, given axions compose a fraction of the dark matter with a non-negligible local density. Detecting these low-velocity dispersion flows requires a high spectral resolution and careful attention to the expected signal modulation due to Earth's motion. We report an exclusion on the local axion dark matter density in narrow flows of $\rho_a \gtrsim 0.03\,\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$ and $\rho_a \gtrsim 0.004\,\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$ for Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitski and Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov axion-photon couplings, respectively, over the mass range $3.3-4.2\,\mu\text{eV}$. Measurements were made at selected resolving powers to allow for a range of possible velocity dispersions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological inhomogeneities, primordial black holes, and a hypothesis on the death of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of the expansion of the universe on a broad class of objects, including black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, and others. Using metrics that incorporate primordial inhomogeneities, the effects of a hypothetical "center of the universe" on inflation are calculated. Dynamic coordinates for black holes that account for expansions or contractions with arbitrary rates are provided. We consider the possibility that the universe may be bound to evolve into an ultimate state of "total dilution", wherein stable particles are so widely separated that physical communication among them will be impossible for eternity. This is also a scenario of "cosmic virtuality", as no wave-function collapse would occur again. We provide classical models evolving this way, based on the Majumdar-Papapetrou geometries. More realistic configurations, instead, indicate that gravitational forces locally counteract expansion, except in the universe's early stages. We comment on whether quantum phenomena may dictate that total dilution is indeed the cosmos' ultimate destiny.</description>

      <title>How Viable Is a QCD Axion near 10 MeV?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been an attempt to revive the visible QCD axion at the 10 MeV scale assuming that it exclusively couples to the first-generation quarks and the electron. This variant of the QCD axion is claimed to remain phenomenologically viable, partly due to a clever model construction that induces tree-level pion-phobia and exploits uncertainties inherent in the chiral perturbation theory. We confront this model with the cosmological domain wall problem, the quality issue and constraints arising from the electron electric dipole moment. It is also pointed out that the gluon loop-generated axion-top coupling can provide a very large contribution to rare $B$-meson decays, such that the present LHCb data for $B^0 \to K^{*0} e^+ e^-$ rule out the model for the axion mass larger than 30 MeV. There is a strong motivation for pushing the experimental analysis of $B \to K^{(*)} e^+ e^-$ to a lower $e^+ e^-$ invariant mass window, which will conclusively determine the fate of the model, as its contribution to this branching ratio significantly exceeds the Standard Model prediction.</description>

      <title>Strong Balmer break objects at z ~ 7-10 uncovered with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of robust spectroscopically confirmed Balmer break (BB) galaxies and candidates, with secure spectroscopic redshifts $7.1 \le z \le 9.6$ from publicly available JWST extra-galactic photometric and spectroscopic surveys. To do so, we used dedicated filters probing the Balmer break and inspected the objects with NIRSpec spectroscopy. We recover the previously known objects with strong Balmer breaks and reveal 10-11 new objects with clear BBs, thus tripling the number of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with a BB at z &gt;7. Approximately half of them show a pure BB and no signs of recent star formation, whereas the other half shows BB and emission lines, indicating most likely galaxies whose star formation ceased earlier and has restarted recently. Overall we find that ~10-20% of all galaxies from our sample show signatures of an evolved stellar population. Furthermore, we find that the strength of the BB does not significantly depend on the rest-UV and rest-optical brightness of these sources. In short, our work confirms that photometry alone has the potential to measure BB strengths and to identify evolved stellar populations at high redshift and that such objects may be more frequent than previously thought. The presence of galaxies with a range of break strengths and the joint presence of BB and emission lines indicate a bursty nature of the star formation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Roles of Dark Photons in Axion-induced Electroweak Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By coupling to both the Higgs and electroweak gauge sectors, an axion can generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe via electroweak baryogenesis when the axion decay constant lies within the range of approximately $10^5$ and $10^7$GeV, corresponding to axion masses between the MeV and GeV scales. In this work, we explore the intriguing possibility that the axion interacts with a dark sector, particularly with dark photons through anomalous couplings. Notably, axion-coupled dark photons can play multiple roles, including $(i)$ suppressing the branching ratio of axion decay to Standard Model (SM) particles, which would otherwise conflict with the constraints from supernovae explosions, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and neutron star merger events, $(ii)$ serving as a candidate for cold dark matter if they are massive and stable, and $(iii)$ contributing to dark radiation if they are ultralight. The axion decouples from the SM thermal bath when it becomes non-relativistic, facilitating the production of dark matter dark photons through the freeze-in mechanism, while dark radiation dark photons are thermally generated prior to the electroweak phase transition.</description>
