      <title>A local treatment of finite alignment and path groupoids of nonfinitely aligned higher-rank graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a local treatment of finite alignment by identifying the finitely aligned part of any (not necessarily finitely aligned) higher-rank graph. We show the finitely aligned part is itself a constellation and forms a finitely aligned relative category of paths together with the original higher-rank graph. We show that the elements of the finitely aligned part are precisely those whose cylinder sets are compact, which allows us to give novel definitions of locally compact path and boundary-path spaces for nonfinitely aligned higher-rank graphs. We extend a semigroup action and the associated semidirect product groupoid developed by Renault and Williams to define ample Hausdorff path and boundary-path groupoids. The groupoids are amenable for nonfinitely aligned $k$-graphs by a result of Renault and Williams. In the finitely aligned case, the path groupoids coincide with Spielberg's groupoids, and the boundary-path groupoid has an inverse semigroup model via a result of Ortega and Pardo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider three types of operads: alternative, assosymmetric, and bicommutative. We prove that the Hadamard product of these operads with the Novikov operad coincides with their white Manin product. As an application, we identify a variety of algebras in which all algebras are special.</description>

      <title>Rings Whose Non-Invertible Elements are Strongly Weakly Nil-Clean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The target of the present work is to give a new insight in the theory of {\it strongly weakly nil-clean} rings, recently defined by Kosan and Zhou in the Front. Math. China (2016) and further explored in detail by Chen-Sheibani in the J. Algebra Appl. (2017). Indeed, we consider those rings whose non-units are strongly weakly nil-clean and succeed to establish that this class of rings is strongly $\pi$-regular and, even something more, that it possesses a complete characterization in terms of the Jacobson radical and sections of the $2\times 2$ full matrix ring. Additionally, some extensions like Morita context rings and groups rings are also studied in this directory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Max $d$-Cut via qudit swap operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Max Cut (QMC) problem for systems of qubits is an example of a 2-local Hamiltonian problem, and a prominent paradigm in computational complexity theory. This paper investigates the algebraic structure of a higher-dimensional analog of the QMC problem for systems of qudits. The Quantum Max d-Cut (d-QMC) problem asks for the largest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian on a graph with n vertices whose edges correspond to swap operators acting on $(\mathbb{C}^d)^{\otimes n}$. The algebra generated by the swap operators is identified as a quotient of a free algebra modulo symmetric group relations and a single additional relation of degree d. This presentation leads to a tailored hierarchy of semidefinite programs, leveraging noncommutative polynomial optimization (NPO) methods, that converges to the solution of the d-QMC problem. For a large class of complete bipartite graphs, exact solutions for the d-QMC problem are derived using the representation theory of symmetric groups. This in particular includes the d-QMC problem for clique and star graphs on n vertices, for all d and n. Lastly, the paper addresses a refined d-QMC problem focused on finding the largest eigenvalue within each isotypic component (irreducible block) of the graph Hamiltonian. It is shown that the spectrum of the star graph Hamiltonian distinguishes between isotypic components of the 3-QMC problem. For general d, low-degree relations for separating isotypic components are presented, enabling adaptation of the global NPO hierarchy to efficiently compute the largest eigenvalue in each isotypic component.</description>

      <title>On the center of the generic affine Hecke algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the center of the generic affine Hecke algebra $H_q$ corresponding to some root datum with the semigroup algebra $\mathbb C[q][\check X^+]$ of the dominant chamber of its coweight lattice. This is done by first identifying a maximal commutative subalgebra $A_q \subset H_q$ with the Rees algebra associated to the semigroup algebra of the coweight lattice for the filtration induced by the length function. We explain how this subalgebra $A_q$ can also be identified with (quantum) cohomology of the toric variety given by the fan corresponding to the coroot lattice (a Hessenberg variety).</description>

      <title>Minimal generating sets of large powers of bivariate monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a monomial ideal $I$, it is known that for increasing $n$ the number of minimal generators $\mu(I^n)$ eventually follows a polynomial pattern. In general, little is known about the power at which this pattern emerges. Even less is known about the exact form of the minimal generators after this power. We show that for large $n$ the ideal $I^n$ can be constructed from certain subideals of a specific power $I^s$. We determine $s$ explicitly in terms of $I$ and show that $s\le\mu(I)(d^2-1)+1$, where $d$ is at most the maximal $x$- or $y$-degree appearing in the minimal generators $\mathsf{G}(I)$. This provides an explicit description of $\mathsf{G}(I^n)$ in terms of $\mathsf{G}(I^s)$, significantly reducing computational complexity in determining high powers of bivariate monomial ideals. This further enables us to explicitly compute $\mu(I^n)$ for all $n\ge s$ in terms of a linear polynomial in $n$. We include runtime measurements for the attached implementation in SageMath.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the geometric construction of the framed braid group, we define and study the framization of several Brauer-type monoids and also the set partition monoid, all of which appear in knot theory. We introduce the concept of deframization, which is a procedure to obtain a tied monoid from a given framed monoid. Furthermore, we show in detail how this procedure works on the monoids mentioned above. We also discuss the framization and deframization of some algebras, which are deformations, respectively, of the framized and deframized monoids discussed here.</description>

      <title>The structure of rough sets defined by reflexive relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For several types of information relations, the induced rough sets system RS does not form a lattice but only a partially ordered set. However, by studying its Dedekind-MacNeille completion DM(RS), one may reveal new important properties of rough set structures. Building upon D. Umadevi's work on describing joins and meets in DM(RS), we previously investigated pseudo-Kleene algebras defined on DM(RS) for reflexive relations. This paper delves deeper into the order-theoretic properties of DM(RS) in the context of reflexive relations. We describe the completely join-irreducible elements of DM(RS) and characterize when DM(RS) is a spatial completely distributive lattice. We show that even in the case of a non-transitive reflexive relation, DM(RS) can form a Nelson algebra, a property generally associated with quasiorders. We introduce a novel concept, the core of a relational neighborhood, and use it to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for DM(RS) to determine a Nelson algebra.</description>

      <title>On the conjecture of Shang about free alternative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kashuba and Mathieu proposed a conjecture on vanishing of some components of the homology of certain Lie algebras, implying a description of the $GL_d$-module structure of the free $d$-generated Jordan algebra. Their conjecture relies on a functorial version of the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction that builds Lie algebras out of Jordan algebras. Recently, Shang used a functorial construction of Allison, Benkart and Gao that builds Lie algebras out of alternative algebras to propose another conjecture on vanishing of some components of the homology of certain Lie algebras, implying a description of the $GL_d$-module structure of the free $d$-generated alternative algebra. In this note, we explain why the conjecture of Shang is not true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the structure theory of finite dimensional algebras in order to deduce dimension formulas for spaces of period numbers, i.e., complex numbers defined by integrals of algebraic nature. We get a complete and conceptually clear answer in the case of $1$-periods, generalising classical results like Baker's theorem on the logarithms of algebraic numbers and partial results in Huber--W{\"u}stholz \cite{huber-wuestholz}.
  The application to the case of Mixed Tate Motives (i.e., Multiple Zeta Values) recovers the dimension estimates of Deligne--Goncharov \cite{deligne-goncharov}.</description>

Abstract: The notion of double depth associated with quasi-Jacobi forms allows distinguishing, within the algebra of quasi-Jacobi singular forms of index zero, certain significant subalgebras (modular-type forms, elliptic-type forms, Jacobi forms). We study the stability of these subalgebras under the derivations of this algebra and through certain sequences of bidifferential operators constituting analogs of Rankin-Cohen brackets or transvectants</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use folding techniques to define a new class of gentle-like algebras that generalise the iterated tilted algebras of type $C$ and $\widetilde{C}$, which we call folded gentle algebras. We then show that folded gentle algebras satisfy many of the same remarkable properties of gentle algebras, and that the proof of these properties follows directly from folding arguments. In particular, we classify the indecomposable modules of folded gentle algebras in terms symmetric and asymmetric string and band modules. We classify the Auslander-Reiten sequences over these algebras, showing that irreducible morphisms between string modules are given by adding/deleting hooks and cohooks to/from strings. Finally, we show that the class of folded gentle algebras are closed under derived equivalence.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of Pythagoras numbers of finitely generated real algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish two finiteness results and propose a conjecture concerning the Pythagoras number $P(A)$ of a finitely generated real algebra $A$. Let $X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n$ be an integral projective surface over $\mathbb{R}$, and let $s \in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$ be a nonzero section such that the boundary $\partial_{X(\mathbb{C})}\bigl(X_{s\neq 0}(\mathbb{R})\bigr)$, taken in the standard topology, is Zariski dense in $X_{s=0}$. We prove $P\bigl(\Gamma(X_{s\neq 0})\bigr)=\infty$. As a corollary, the Pythagoras numbers of integral smooth affine curves over $\mathbb{R}$ are shown to be unbounded. For any finitely generated $\mathbb{R}$-algebra $A$, if the Zariski closure of the real points of $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ has dimension less than two, we demonstrate $P(A)&lt;\infty$.</description>
