      <title>Stability of the spatially homogeneous Landau equation in relative entropy and applications to score-based numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a short and elementary proof of stability for strong solutions of the spatially homogeneous Landau equation with Coulomb collisions, measured in relative entropy. The argument yields an explicit differential inequality for relative entropy under natural moment and regularity assumptions. The same computation provides an a posteriori error bound for score-based transport modeling and related deterministic numerical schemes, linking the training loss to the relative-entropy error.</description>

      <title>The role of the curvature of a surface in the shape of the solutions to elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove uniqueness and non-degeneracy of the critical point of positive, semi-stable solutions of $-\Delta u=f(u)$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions for a class of star-shaped domains of the sphere and of the hyperbolic plane satisfying a geometric condition. In the spherical case, this condition is weaker than convexity, while in the hyperbolic case it is weaker than horoconvexity. Finally, we construct examples showing that this geometric condition is indeed optimal.</description>

      <title>Limiting absorption principle for a hybrid resonance in a two-dimensional cold plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a limiting absorption principle for the boundary-value problem describing a hybrid plasma resonance, with a regular coefficient in the principal part of the operator that vanishes on a curve inside the domain and changes its sign across this curve. We prove the limiting absorption principle by establishing a priori bounds on the solution in certain weighted Sobolev spaces. Next, we show that the solution can be decomposed into regular and singular parts. A peculiar property of this decomposition enables us to introduce a radiation-like condition in a bounded domain and to state a well-posed problem satisfied by the limiting absorption solution.</description>

      <title>Rogue waves and large deviations for 2D pure gravity deep water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rogue waves are extreme ocean events characterized by the sudden formation of anomalously large crests, and remain an important subject of investigation in oceanography and mathematics. A central problem is to quantify the probability of their formation under random Gaussian sea initial data. In this work, we rigorously characterize the tail probability for the formation of rogue waves of the pure gravity water wave equations in deep water, the most accurate quasilinear PDE modeling waves in open ocean. This large deviation result confirms various conjectures from the oceanography literature in the weakly nonlinear regime. Moreover, the result holds up to the optimal timescales allowed by deterministic well-posedness theory. The proof shows that rogue waves most likely arise through "dispersive focusing", where phase quasi-synchronization produces constructive amplification of the water crest. The main difficulty in justifying this mechanism is propagating statistical information over such long timescales, which we overcome by combining normal forms and probabilistic methods. Unlike prior work, this novel approach does not require approximate solutions to be Gaussian. Our general method tracks the tail probability of solutions to Hamiltonian PDEs with an integrable normal form and random Gaussian initial data, even in the absence of (quasi-)invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Dyadic microlocal partition for anisotropic metrics and uniform Weyl quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a dyadic microlocal partition adapted to position-dependent anisotropic metrics in phase space and prove uniform bounds for localized Weyl quantization and for Moyal truncation with explicit control of remainders. A semiclassical, per-band renormalization recovers the exact scaling on each frequency band, while a Cotlar-Stein almost-orthogonality scheme ensures global convergence and operator-norm estimates with transparent dependence on finitely many symbol seminorms. The approach is robust in non-homogeneous settings where anisotropy varies with position. As applications, we construct a microlocal parametrix via truncated Moyal expansion and develop a local-global analysis of the Radon transform viewed as a model Fourier integral operator. The results provide a constructive toolset for uniform localization, composition, and recombination of pseudodifferential and Fourier integral operators.</description>

      <title>H\"older damping for fractional wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fractional wave equations with low H\"older regularity damping, we establish quantitative energy decay rates for their solutions when the geometric control condition holds. The energy decay rates depend explicitly on the H\"older regularity of the damping. In particular, we show damping functions with lower H\"older regularities that below a certain threshold give slower energy decay.</description>

      <title>Nonradial Quenching Profile for a MEMS Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a quenching solution to the parabolic MEMS model \[ u_t = \Delta u - \frac{1}{u^2} \quad \text{in } \mathcal{B} \times (0,T), \quad u|_{\partial \mathcal{B}} = 1, \] where $\mathcal{B}$ is the unit disc in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and $T &gt; 0$ denotes the quenching time. The constructed solution quenches only at the origin and admits the final profile \[ u(x,T) \sim \left(x_1^2 x_2^2 + \theta(x_1^6 + x_2^6)\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \quad \text{as } |x| \to 0, \] where $\theta \in (0, \theta^*)$ for some $\theta^* &gt; 0$. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a quenching solution with a genuinely non-radial profile. The proof relies on the construction of a good approximate solution, using a perturbative expansion in self-similar variables. We then justify the true solution that remains close to this approximation through a spectral analysis combined with a robust energy method.</description>

      <title>The Wiener Criterion at $\infty$ for Degenerate Elliptic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a Wiener criterion at $\infty$ to characterise the unique solvability of the Dirichlet problem for degenerate elliptic equations with power-like weights in arbitrary open sets. In the measure-theoretical context, the criterion determines whether the $\A$-harmonic measure of $\infty$ is null or positive. From the topological point of view, it presents a test for the thinness of the exterior set at $\infty$ in the $\A$-fine topology.</description>

      <title>Global existence and stability in a class of chemotaxis systems with lethal interactions, nonlinear diffusion and production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of chemotaxis systems modeling lethal interactions in a smooth, bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. We examine two distinct cases: (i) a fully parabolic system where both equations exhibit parabolic dynamics, and (ii) a parabolic-elliptic system featuring a parabolic first equation coupled with an elliptic second equation. Under appropriate parameter constraints, we establish the existence of unique globally bounded classical solutions for arbitrary spatial dimensions $n \geq 1$. Additionally, we employ carefully constructed Lyapunov functionals to analyze the long-term behavior of solutions, obtaining rigorous asymptotic stability results.</description>

      <title>Continuity estimates for variable growth variational problems in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regularity results for local minimizers of variable growth variational problem in Heisenberg groups under suitable integrability assumption on the horizontal gradient of the exponent function. More precisely, our main focus is on the continuity properties of the horizontal gradient $\mathfrak{X} u$, where $u \in HW_{\text{loc}}^{1,1}$ is a local minimizer of the functional
  \begin{align*}
  I [u]:= \int_{\Omega} \frac{1}{p(x)}\left\lvert \mathfrak{X} u \right\rvert^{p(x)}\ \mathrm{d}x
  \end{align*} in a domain of $\Omega \subset \mathbb{H}_{n},$ where $\mathbb{H}_{n}$ is the Heisenberg group with homogeneous dimension $Q=2n+2,$ where $p \in HW^{1,1}\left( \Omega\right)$ and we assume suitable integrability hypothesis on $\mathfrak{X} p.$ We prove (a) if $\mathfrak{X} p \in L^{q}\left( \Omega; \mathbb{R}^{2n}\right)$ with $q&gt;Q,$ then $\mathfrak{X} u$ is H\"{o}lder continuous and (b) if $\mathfrak{X} p \in L^{(Q,1)}\log L \left( \Omega; \mathbb{R}^{2n}\right),$ then $\mathfrak{X} u$ is continuous.
  In fact, in the non-borderline case $(a)$, we prove H\"{o}lder continuity of the horizontal gradient for the minima of more general variational problems, assuming $p$ to be H\"{o}lder continuous, i.e. without any assumption on the weak derivative of $p.$ To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first regularity result for minimizers of variable growth variational problems in the setting of Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic limit of normalized solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations on noncompact metric graphs with localized nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonrelativistic limit of normalized solutions for the following nonlinear Dirac equation (NLDE) on noncompact metric graph $\G$ with finitely many edges and a non-empty compact core $\K$ \begin{equation*}
  \D u - \omega u= \chi_\K\abs{u}^{p-2}u, \end{equation*} under the constraint $\int_\G\abs{u}^2\,dx = 1$, where $\D$ is the Dirac operator on $\G$, $u: \G \to \mathbb{C}^2$, the frequency $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$ is part of the unknowns which arises as a Lagrange multiplier, $\chi_\K$ is the characteristic function of the compact core $\K$, and $2&lt;p&lt;6$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the nonrelativistic limit of normalized solutions to (NLDE) on metric graphs.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows for the $p$-Laplacian Arising from Biological Network Models: A Novel Dynamical Relaxation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a scalar partial differential equation model for the formation of biological transportation networks. Starting from a discrete graph-based formulation on equilateral triangulations, we rigorously derive the corresponding continuum energy functional as the $\Gamma$-limit under network refinement and establish the existence of global minimizers. The model possesses a gradient-flow structure whose steady states coincide with solutions of the $p$-Laplacian equation. Building on this connection, we implement finite element discretizations and propose a novel dynamical relaxation scheme that achieves optimal convergence rates in manufactured tests and exhibits mesh-independent performance, with the number of time steps, nonlinear iterations, and linear solves remaining stable under uniform mesh refinement. Numerical experiments confirm both the ability of the scalar model to reproduce biologically relevant network patterns and its effectiveness as a computationally efficient relaxation strategy for solving $p$-Laplacian equations for large exponents $p$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Blow-up Behavior for the Semilinear Heat Equation with Super-exponential Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the semilinear heat equation $u_t - \Delta u = f(u)$ in $\Omega = B_R(0) \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with super-exponential nonlinearities $f(u) = e^{u^p}u^q$ ($p&gt;1$, $q \in \{0\}\cup [1,\infty)$), nonnegative bounded radially symmetric initial data and 0-Dirichlet boundary condition. In this paper, we show the asymptotic blow-up behavior for nonnegative, radial type I blow-up solution. More precisely, we prove that if $n \leq 2$, then such blow-up solution satisfies \begin{equation*} \lim_{t \rightarrow T} \frac{T-t}{F(u(y\sqrt{T-t},t))} = 1, \quad \text{where } F(u) = \int_{u}^{\infty} \frac{ds}{f(s)}. \end{equation*} We note that this result corresponds to the one which is proved by Liu in 1989 for the case of $f(u) = e^u$, which has the scale invariance property unlike our super-exponential case. To prove the main result, we see the equation as a perturbation of the equation with $f(u) = e^u$ through a transformation introduced by Fujishima and Ioku in 2018 and estimate the additional term which appears after the transformation.</description>

      <title>Mixed local-nonlocal equations with critical nonlinearity on $\mathbb{R}^N$: Non-existence, Existence, and Multiplicity of positive solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following critical problem involving the mixed local-nonlocal operator: \begin{equation}\label{main_prob_abstract}\tag{$\mathcal{P}_2$}
  -\Delta u+(-\Delta)^s u=|u|^{2^*-2}u+f(x)\text{ in }\mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation} where $N \ge 3,\, s\in (0,1),\, 2^*= \frac{2N}{N-2}$, and $f$ is a nontrivial non-negative functional which lies in the dual space of the ambient solution space. For $f \equiv0$, ($\mathcal{P}_2$) does not admit any nontrivial weak solution in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)$. This phenomenon stands in contrast to the purely local (for $N&gt;4$) and purely nonlocal (for $N&gt;4s$) cases. On the other hand, when $f \not \equiv 0$, we prove the existence of at least two positive weak solutions to ($\mathcal{P}_2$), provided that the dimension $N$ satisfies certain restrictions and $\|f\|$ is small in the corresponding dual space. Next, we consider the nonlinear analogue to ($\mathcal{P}_2$), namely \begin{equation}\label{main_prob_abstract_1}\tag{$\mathcal{P}_p$}
  -\Delta_p u+(-\Delta_p)^s u=|u|^{p^*-2}u+f(x)\text{ in }\mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation} where $p \in (1, \infty), N&gt;p$, $p^*=\frac{Np}{N-p}$, $f$ is a nontrivial non-negative functional in the dual space of the ambient solution space. As in the semilinear case, no nontrivial weak solution exists for ($\mathcal{P}_p$) in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)$, when $f \equiv 0$. Moreover, for $f \not \equiv 0$ with sufficiently small $\|f\|$, ($\mathcal{P}_p$) admits a positive weak solution. For the existence, we prove a concentration compactness principle for $-\Delta_p+(-\Delta_p)^s$.</description>

      <title>Construction and properties for the Green's function with Neumann boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the construction and analysis of the Green's function for the Neumann boundary value problem associated with the operator $-\Delta + a$ on a smooth bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N \geq 3$) with $a\in L^\infty(\Omega)$. Under the assumption that $-\Delta + a$ is coercive, we obtain the existence, uniqueness, and qualitative properties of the Green's function $G(x,y)$. The Green's function $G(x,y)$ is constructed explicitly, satisfying pointwise estimates and derivative estimates near the singularity. Also, near the boundary of $\Omega$, $G$ is compared to the Green's function of the laplacian, with pointwise estimates. Other properties, like symmetry and positivity among other things, are established.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sobolev Regularity for Second Order Divergence Elliptic Operators on Domains with Buried Boundary Parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of solutions of elliptic second order boundary value problems on a bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb R^3$. The coefficients are not necessarily continuous and the boundary conditions may be mixed, i.e. Dirichlet on one part $D$ of the boundary and Neumann on the complementing part. The peculiarity is that $D$ is partly `buried' in $\Omega$ in the sense that the topological interior of $\Omega \cup D$ properly contains $\Omega$. The main result is that the singularity of the solution along the border of the buried contact behaves exactly as the singularity for the solution of a mixed boundary value problem along the border between the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary part.</description>

      <title>Derivation and quasi-invariant asymptotics of phenotype-structured integro-differential models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon kinetic theory approaches for multi-agent systems and generalising them to scenarios where the total mass of the system is not conserved, we develop a modelling framework for phenotype-structured populations that makes it possible to bridge individual-level mechanisms with population-scale evolutionary dynamics. We start by formulating a stochastic agent-based model, which describes the dynamics of single population members undergoing proliferation, death, and phenotype changes. Then, we formally derive the corresponding mesoscopic model, which consists of an integro-differential equation for the distribution of population members over the space of phenotypes, where phenotype changes are modelled via an integral kernel. Finally, considering a quasi-invariant regime of small but frequent phenotype changes, we rigorously derive a non-local Fokker-Planck-type equation counterpart of this model, wherein phenotype changes are taken into account by an advection-diffusion term. The theoretical results obtained are illustrated through a sample of results of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Existence results for variational quasilinear elliptic systems involving the vectiorial $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and regularity results for the following elliptic system: \[ \begin{cases} -\textbf{div}(|D\boldsymbol{u}|^{p-2}D\boldsymbol{u})=\boldsymbol{f}(x,\boldsymbol{u}) &amp; \text{in } \Omega \\ \boldsymbol{u}=0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega, \end{cases} \] where $\boldsymbol{u}=(u^1,\dots,u^m)$, $p&gt;1$, and $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain. We also consider the special case of the Lane-Emden-type system, taking \[\boldsymbol{f}(x,\boldsymbol{u})=\lambda|\boldsymbol{u}|^{p-2}\boldsymbol{u}+|\boldsymbol{u}|^{q-2}\boldsymbol{u},\] and we prove a classification result. In particular, we show that any least energy solution for the Lane-Emden system is of the form $(c^1\omega,\dots,c^m\omega)$, where $\boldsymbol{c}=(c^1,\dots,c^m)\in S^{m-1}$ (the $(m-1)$-sphere in $\mathbb R^m$) and $\omega$ is a positive solution of the corresponding scalar equation.</description>

      <title>On Turbulent Behavior of the Generalized Surface Quasigeostrophic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent behavior of the two-parameter family of generalized surface quasigeostrophic equations is examined both rigorously and numerically. We adapt a cascade mechanism argument to derive an energy spectrum that scales as $\kappa^{2\beta/3-3}$ where $\beta$ controls the regularity of the velocity ($\beta=1$ in the special case of the SQG). Direct numerical simulations indicate that this fits better than $\kappa^{\beta/3-3}$ which was derived in earlier work. Guided by earlier work on the 2D Navier-Stokes equations, we prove a certain condition implies a direct cascade of enstrophy, as well as an upper bound on the enstrophy dissipation rate, and sharp bounds on a dissipation wavenumber. The dependence of these rigorous results on the two parameters is demonstrated numerically.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory on clustering in spontaneous particle aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of short-term and long-term memory on spontaneous aggregation of organisms is investigated using a stochastic agent-based model. Each individual modulates the amplitude of its random motion according to the perceived local density of neighbors. Memory is introduced via a chain of $K$~internal variables that allow agents to retain information about previously encountered densities. The parameter $K$ controls the effective length of memory. A formal mean-field limit yields a macroscopic Fokker--Planck equation, which provides a continuum description of the system in the large-population limit. Steady states of this equation are characterized to interpret the emergence and morphology of clusters. Systematic stochastic simulations in one- and two-dimensional spatial domains reveal that short- or moderate-term memory promotes coarsening, resulting in a smaller number of larger clusters, whereas long-term memory inhibits aggregation and increases the proportion of isolated individuals. Statistical analysis demonstrates that extended memory reduces the agents' responsiveness to environmental stimuli, explaining the transition from aggregation to dispersion as $K$ increases. These findings identify memory as a key factor controlling the collective organization of self-driven agents and provide a bridge between individual-level dynamics and emergent spatial patterns.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical limit of entropies and free energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy and free energy are central concepts in both statistical physics and information theory, with quantum and classical facets. In mathematics these concepts appear quite often in different contexts (dynamical systems, probability theory, von Neumann algebras, etc.). In this work, we study the von Neumann and Wehrl entropies from the point of view of semiclassical analysis. We first prove the semiclassical convergence of the von Neumann to the Wehrl entropy for quantum Gibbs states (thermal equilibrium), after a suitable renormalization has been taken into account. Then, we show that, in the same limit, the free energy functional defined with the Wehrl entropy $ \Gamma-$converges to its classical counterpart, so implying convergence of the minima and the associated minimizers.</description>

      <title>Regularity and energy of hyperbolic boundary value problems on non-timelike hypersurfaces with lower order terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.09762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study second order hyperbolic equations with initial conditions, a nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and a source term. We prove the solution possesses $H^1$ regularity on any piecewise $C^1$-smooth non-timelike hypersurfaces. We generalize the notion of energy to these hypersurfaces, and establish an estimate of the difference between square roots of energies on these hypersurfaces and on the initial plane where the time $t = 0$. The energy is shown to be conserved when the source term and the boundary datum are both zero. We also obtain an $L^2$ estimate for the normal derivative of the solution. We establish these results for $C^2$-smooth solutions first by using multiplier methods, then we go back to the original setting using approximation.</description>

      <title>Resolvent Estimates in $L^\infty$ for the Stokes Operator in Nonsmooth Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish resolvent estimates in spaces of bounded solenoidal functions for the Stokes operator in a bounded domain $\Omega$ in $R^d$ under the assumptions that $\Omega$ is $C^1$ for $d\ge 3$ and Lipschitz for $d=2$. As a corollary, it follows that the Stokes operator generates a uniformly bounded analytic semigroup in the spaces of bounded solenoidal functions in $\Omega$. The smoothness conditions on $\Omega$ are sharp. The case of exterior domains with nonsmooth boundaries is also studied.The key step in the proof involves new estimates which connect the pressure to the velocity in the $L^q$ average, but only on scales above certain level.</description>

      <title>Density estimates for a nonlocal variational model with a degenerate double-well potential via the Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide density estimates for level sets of minimizers of the energy
  $\frac{1}{2} \int_{\Omega}\int_{\Omega} \frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^p}{|x-y|^{n+sp}}dxdy+\int_{\Omega}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\Omega} \frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^p}{|x-y|^{n+sp}}dxdy+\int_{\Omega}W(u(x))dx$
  where $p\in(1,+\infty)$ and $s\in\left(0,\frac{1}{p}\right)$ and $W$ is a double-well potential with polynomial growth $m\in [p,+\infty)$ from the minima.
  These kinds of potentials are ''degenerate'', since they detach ''slowly'' from the minima, therefore they provide additional difficulties if one wishes to determine the relative sizes of the ''layers'' and the ''pure phases''. To overcome these challenges, we introduce new barriers allowing us to rely on the fractional Sobolev inequality and on a suitable iteration method.
  The proofs presented here are robust enough to consider the case of quasilinear nonlocal equations driven by the fractional $p$-Laplacian, but our results are new even for the case $p=2$.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of individual eigenvalues of the Laplacian in domains with outward peaks for large negative Robin parameters. A large class of cross-sections is allowed, and the resulting asymptotic expansions reflect both the sharpness of the peak and the geometric shape of its cross-section. The results are an extension of previous works dealing with peaks whose cross-sections are balls.</description>

      <title>Regional and partial observability and control of waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish sharp regional observability results for solutions of the wave equation in a bounded domain of $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, in case where the geometric control condition is not satisfied. Assuming that the waves are observed on a non-empty open subset $\omega\subset \Omega$ and that the initial data are supported in another open subset $\mathscr{O} \subset\Omega$, we derive estimates for the energy of initial data localized in $\mathscr{O}$, in terms of the energy measured on the observation set $(0,T) \times \omega$. This holds under a suitable geometric condition relating the time horizon T and the subdomains $\omega $ and $\mathscr{O}$. By duality, we obtain new controllability results for the wave equation, ensuring that the projection of the solution onto $\mathscr{O}$ can be controlled by means of controls supported in $\omega$, with optimal spatial support. We also present several extensions of the main result, including the case of boundary observations, as well as a characterization of the observable fraction of the energy of the initial data from partial measurements on $(0,T) \times \omega$. Applications to wave control are discussed accordingly.</description>

Abstract: We study a fluid-structure interaction problem between a viscous incompressible fluid and an elastic beam with fixed endpoints in a static setting. The 3D fluid domain is bounded, nonsmooth and non simply connected, the fluid is modeled by the stationary Navier-Stokes equations subject to inflow/outflow conditions. The structure is modeled by a stationary 1D beam equation with a load density involving the force exerted by the fluid and, thereby, may vary its position. In a smallness regime, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the PDE-ODE coupled system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short remark on a previous paper \cite{SZ25}, we continue the study of Allen-Cahn equations associated with Ginzburg-Landau energies \begin{equation*}
  J(v,\Omega)=\int_{\Omega}\Big\{F(\nabla v,v,x)+W(v,x)\Big\}dx, \end{equation*} involving a Dirichlet energy $F(\vec{\xi},\tau,x)\sim|\vec{\xi}|^{p}$ and a degenerate double-well potential $W(\tau,x)\sim(1-\tau^{2})^{m}$. In contrast to \cite{SZ25}, we remove all regularity assumptions on the Ginzburg-Landau energy. Then, with further assumptions that $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{n}{n-1}$ and that $W(\tau,x)$ is monotone in $\tau$ on both sides of $0$, we establish a density estimate for the level sets of nontrivial minimizers $|u|\leq1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the regularity of the support of a Radon measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ for which anisotropic versions of its $n$-dimensional density ratio and its doubling character are assumed to converge with H\"older rate. We show that in either case, if the support of $\mu$ is flat enough, then it is a $C^{1,\gamma}$ $n$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$, for some $\gamma\in (0,1)$. If the flatness assumption is dropped, then the support of $\mu$ is the union of a $C^{1,\gamma}$ $n$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ and a closed singular set that is either empty if $n\leq 2$, or has Hausdorff dimension at most $n-3$ if $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>On elastic and non-elastic wave superpositions for the Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper contains an analysis of the conditions for the existence of elastic versus non-elastic wave superpositions governed by the Euler system in (1+1)-dimensions. This system admits entropic solutions and two types of sound wave solutions. It is shown that the smallest real Lie algebra containing vector fields (associated with these waves) is isomorphic to a semidirect sum of the infinite-dimensional Abelian real Lie algebra and the non-Abelian finite-dimensional real Lie algebra. Based on this fact, we are able to find a parametrization of the region of non-elastic wave superpositions which allows for the construction of the reduced form of the Euler system. It is proven that, in this case, the manifold spanned by the vector fields associated with waves possesses the structure of a local Lie group. It is also shown that this manifold has a torsion-free affine connection and the one-parameter subgroups of the Lie group are geodesics. Based on this fact, a description of the non-elastic wave superposition is given in terms of motion of the quasi-rectifiable surfaces spanned by the pair of vector fields associated with sound waves.</description>
