      <title>Slow-fast systems in infinite measure, with or without averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the asymptotic behaviour of the solution of a differential equation perturbed by a fast flow preserving an infinite measure. This question is related with limit theorems for non-stationary Birkhoff integrals. We distinguish two settings with different behaviour: the integrable setting (no averaging phenomenon) and the case of an additive "centered" perturbation term (averaging phenomenon). The paper is motivated by the case where the perturbation comes from the Z-periodic Lorentz gas flow or from the geodesic flow over a Z-cover of a negatively curved compact surface. We establish limit theorems in more general contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of existence of nonexpansive chaotic almost minimal (CAM) systems, and the existence of CAM systems on every residually finite group, were raised in a recent paper of Van Cyr, Bryna Kra and Scott Schmieding. We construct nonexpansive CAM systems on all finitely-generated residually finite groups.</description>

      <title>Pensive billiards, point vortices, and pucks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a new class of plane billiards - the `pensive billiard' - in which the billiard ball travels along the boundary for some distance depending on the incidence angle before reflecting, while preserving the billiard rule of equality of the angles of incidence and reflection. This generalizes so called `puck billiards' proposed by M.Bialy, as well as a `vortex billiard', i.e. the motion of a point vortex dipole in 2D hydrodynamics on domains with boundary. We prove the variational origin and invariance of a symplectic structure for pensive billiards, as well as study their properties including conditions for a twist map, the existence of periodic orbits, etc. We also demonstrate the appearance of both the golden and silver ratios in the corresponding hydrodynamical vortex setting. Finally, we introduce and describe basic properties of pensive outer billiards.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic framework for learning non-intrusive corrections to long-time climate simulations from short-time training data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic systems, such as turbulent flows, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. However, their study remains a challenge due to the large range scales, and the strong interaction with other, often not fully understood, physics. As a consequence, the spatiotemporal resolution required for accurate simulation of these systems is typically computationally infeasible, particularly for applications of long-term risk assessment, such as the quantification of extreme weather risk due to climate change. While data-driven modeling offers some promise of alleviating these obstacles, the scarcity of high-quality simulations results in limited available data to train such models, which is often compounded by the lack of stability for long-horizon simulations. As such, the computational, algorithmic, and data restrictions generally imply that the probability of rare extreme events is not accurately captured. In this work we present a general strategy for training neural network models to non-intrusively correct under-resolved long-time simulations of chaotic systems. The approach is based on training a post-processing correction operator on under-resolved simulations nudged towards a high-fidelity reference. This enables us to learn the dynamics of the underlying system directly, which allows us to use very little training data, even when the statistics thereof are far from converged. Additionally, through the use of probabilistic network architectures we are able to leverage the uncertainty due to the limited training data to further improve extrapolation capabilities. We apply our framework to severely under-resolved simulations of quasi-geostrophic flow and demonstrate its ability to accurately predict the anisotropic statistics over time horizons more than 30 times longer than the data seen in training.</description>

      <title>4D-Var using Hessian approximation and backpropagation applied to automatically-differentiable numerical and machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraining a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model with observations via 4D variational (4D-Var) data assimilation is often difficult to implement in practice due to the need to develop and maintain a software-based tangent linear model and adjoint model. One of the most common 4D-Var algorithms uses an incremental update procedure, which has been shown to be an approximation of the Gauss-Newton method. Here we demonstrate that when using a forecast model that supports automatic differentiation, an efficient and in some cases more accurate alternative approximation of the Gauss-Newton method can be applied by combining backpropagation of errors with Hessian approximation. This approach can be used with either a conventional numerical model implemented within a software framework that supports automatic differentiation, or a machine learning (ML) based surrogate model. We test the new approach on a variety of Lorenz-96 and quasi-geostrophic models. The results indicate potential for a deeper integration of modeling, data assimilation, and new technologies in a next-generation of operational forecast systems that leverage weather models designed to support automatic differentiation.</description>

      <title>Spectral statistics of the Laplacian on random covers of a closed negatively curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,g)$ be a closed, connected surface, with variable negative curvature. We consider the distribution of eigenvalues of the Laplacian on random covers $X_n\to X$ of degree $n$. We focus on the ensemble variance of the smoothed number of eigenvalues of the square root of the positive Laplacian $\sqrt{\Delta}$ in windows $[\lambda-\frac 1L,\lambda+\frac 1L]$, over the set of $n$-sheeted covers of $X$. We first take the limit of large degree $n\to +\infty$, then we let the energy $\lambda$ go to $+\infty$ while the window size $\frac 1L$ goes to $0$. In this ad hoc limit, local energy averages of the variance converge to an expression corresponding to the variance of the same statistic when considering instead spectra of large random matrices of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). By twisting the Laplacian with unitary representations, we are able to observe different statistics, corresponding to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) when time reversal symmetry is broken. These results were shown by F. Naud for the model of random covers of a hyperbolic surface.
  For an individual cover $X_n\to X$, we consider spectral fluctuations of the counting function on $X_n$ around the ensemble average. In the large energy regime, for a typical cover $X_n\to X$ of large degree, these fluctuations are shown to approach the GOE result, a phenomenon called ergodicity in Random Matrix Theory. An analogous result for random covers of hyperbolic surfaces was obtained by Y. Maoz.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stochastic Closure Modeling via Conditional Diffusion Model and Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.</description>

      <title>Counting and Hausdorff measures for integers and $p$-adic integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to advance the development of a fractal theory for sets of integers. The core idea is to utilize the fractal structure of $p$-adic integers, where $p$ is a prime number, and compare this with conventional densities and counting measures for integers. Our approach yields some results in combinatorial number theory. The results show how the local fractal structure of a set in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ can provide bounds for the counting measure for its projection onto $\mathbb{Z}$. Additionally, we establish a relationship between the counting dimension of a set of integers and its box-counting dimension in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Since our results pertain to sets that are projections of closed sets in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, we also provide both necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions for a set $E\subset \mathbb{Z}$ to be the projection of a closed set in $\mathbb{Z}_p$.</description>

Abstract: The primary aim of this paper is to give topological obstructions to Cantor sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ being Julia sets of uniformly quasiregular mappings. Our main tool is the genus of a Cantor set. We give a new construction of a genus $g$ Cantor set, the first for which the local genus is $g$ at every point, and then show that this Cantor set can be realized as the Julia set of a uniformly quasiregular mapping. These are the first such Cantor Julia sets constructed for $g\geq 3$. We then turn to our dynamical applications and show that every Cantor Julia set of a hyperbolic uniformly quasiregular map has a finite genus $g$; that a given local genus in a Cantor Julia set must occur on a dense subset of the Julia set; and that there do exist Cantor Julia sets where the local genus is non-constant.</description>

      <title>Noninvasive Adaptive Control of a Class of Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control-based continuation (CBC) is a general and systematic method to explore the dynamic response of a physical system and perform bifurcation analysis directly during experimental tests. Although CBC has been successfully demonstrated on a wide range of systems, rigorous and general approaches to designing a noninvasive controller underpinning the methodology are still lacking. In this paper, a noninvasive adaptive control strategy for a wide class of nonlinear systems with unknown parameters is proposed. We prove that the proposed adaptive control methodology is such that the states of the dynamical system track a reference signal in a noninvasive manner if and only if the reference is a response of the uncontrolled system to an excitation force. Compared to the existing literature, the proposed method does not require any a priori knowledge of some system parameters, does not require a persistent excitation, and is not restricted to linearly-stable systems, facilitating the application of CBC to a much larger class of systems than before. Rigorous mathematical analyses are provided, and the proposed control method is numerically demonstrated on a range of single- and multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear systems, including a Duffing oscillator with multiple static equilibria. It is especifically shown that the unstable periodic orbits of the uncontrolled systems can be stabilized and reached, noninvasively, in controlled conditions.</description>

      <title>Equivariance and partial observations in Koopman operator theory for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator has become an essential tool for data-driven analysis, prediction and control of complex systems. The main reason is the enormous potential of identifying linear function space representations of nonlinear dynamics from measurements. This equally applies to ordinary, stochastic, and partial differential equations (PDEs). Until now, with a few exceptions only, the PDE case is mostly treated rather superficially, and the specific structure of the underlying dynamics is largely ignored. In this paper, we show that symmetries in the system dynamics can be carried over to the Koopman operator, which allows us to massively increase the model efficacy. Moreover, the situation where we only have access to partial observations (i.e., measurements, as is very common for experimental data) has not been treated to its full extent, either. Moreover, we address the highly-relevant case where we cannot measure the full state, such that alternative approaches such as delay coordinates have to be considered. We derive rigorous statements on the required number of observables in this situation, based on embedding theory. We present numerical evidence using various numerical examples including the wave equation and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

Abstract: We use time-independent incomplete Hamiltonian flows to excise interesting closed subsets of positive codimension from symplectic manifolds. Examples of such subsets include what we call a "Cantor brush", a "box with a tail", and -- more generally -- epigraphs of lower semicontinuous functions. This answers a question of Alan Weinstein about excision of a ray, and it generalizes a result of Bernd Stratmann about excision of the product of a ray with a manifold.</description>

Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact, boundaryless, Riemannian manifold whose geodesic flow on its unit sphere bundle is Anosov. Consider the (semiclassical) Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$. Let $\epsilon &gt;0$.
  We study the semiclassical measures $\mu_{sc}$ of quasimodes spectrally supported in intervals of width $\epsilon \frac{h}{|\log h|}$, a critical-type regime when considering ``delocalization". We derive a lower bound for the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of $\mu_{sc}$ that depends explicitly on $\epsilon$, in the spirit of that given by Ananthamaran-Koch-Nonnenmacher.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bonabeau model is a competing model where agents fight to maintain or change their positions. Originally studied on a finite lattice, in this model, one agent is randomly selected to move to a neighboring site chosen at random. If the neighboring site is vacant, the agent moves there. However, if the site is occupied, a fight ensues. If the agent wins, they switch places with the other agent; otherwise, they remain in their original position. We investigate the Bonabeau model on fully occupied site graphs and derive a critical bound for the stability of the egalitarian state applicable to all fully occupied connected site graphs. Furthermore, we develop a competing model where all fights end in finite time on all site graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01915v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People sometimes change their opinions when they discuss things with other people. Researchers can use mathematics to study opinion changes in simplifications of real-life situations. These simplified settings, which are examples of mathematical models, help researchers explore how people influence each other through their social interactions. In today's digital world, these models can help us learn how to promote the spread of accurate information and reduce the spread of inaccurate information. In this article, we discuss a simple mathematical model of opinion changes that arise from social interactions. We briefly describe what such opinion models can tell us and how researchers try to make them more realistic.</description>

      <title>State-dependent Delay Differential Equations on $H^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classically, solution theories for state-dependent delay equations are developed in spaces of continuous or continuously differentiable functions. The former can be technically challenging to apply in as much as suitably Lipschitz continuous extensions of mappings onto the space of continuous functions are required; whereas the latter approach leads to restrictions on the class of initial pre-histories. Here, we establish a solution theory for state-dependent delay equations for arbitrary Lipschitz continuous pre-histories and suitably Lipschitz continuous right-hand sides on the Sobolev space $H^1$. The provided solution theory is independent of previous ones and is based on the contraction mapping principle on exponentially weighted spaces. In particular, initial pre-histories are not required to belong to solution manifolds and the generality of the approach permits the consideration of a large class of functional differential equations even for which the continuity of the right-hand side has constraints on the derivative.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the linear growth of disturbances due to external forcing is crucial for flow stability analysis, flow control, and uncertainty quantification. These applications typically require a large number of forward simulations of the forced linearized dynamics, often in a brute-force fashion. When dealing with simple steady-state or periodic base flows, there exist powerful and cost-effective solution operator techniques. Once these solution operators are constructed, they can be used to determine the response to various forcings with negligible computational cost. However, these methods do not apply to problems with arbitrarily time-dependent base flows. This paper develops and investigates reduced-order modeling with time-dependent bases (TDBs) to build low-rank solution operators for forced linearized dynamics with arbitrarily time-dependent base flows. In particular, we use forced optimally time-dependent decomposition (f-OTD), which extracts the time-dependent correlated structures of the flow response to various excitations. Several demonstrations are included to illustrate the utility of the f-OTD low-rank approximation for performing global transient stability analysis. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of f-OTD in computing the post-transient response of linearized Navier-Stokes equations to a large number of impulses, which has applications in flow control.</description>
