      <title>Smith Normal Forms of Graphical Hermite Simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the family of graphical Hermite simplices and study the Smith normal forms of their matrices of vertex vectors, which is equivalent to studying the group structure of the cokernels for these matrices. Our motivation is to study the behavior of lattice simplices subject to small lattice perturbations of their vertices. In this case, a graphical Hermite simplex is a perturbation of a rectangular simplex, i.e., a simplex defined by a diagonal matrix and the origin, with the perturbation controlled by the structure of a directed graph. We first establish sufficient conditions on the graphs and diagonal entries of these matrices that imply having a single non-unit invariant factor, i.e., a cyclic cokernel. We then obtain bounds on the invariant factors of the defining matrices related to lengths of paths in the corresponding directed graph.</description>

      <title>A Polyhedral Perspective on the Perfect Matching Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the perfect matching lattice of a matching covered graph $G$, generated by the incidence vectors of its perfect matchings. Building on results of Lov\'asz and de Carvalho, Lucchesi, and Murty, we give a polynomial-time algorithm based on polyhedral methods that constructs a lattice basis for this lattice consisting of perfect matchings of $G$. By decomposing along certain odd cuts, we reduce the graph into subgraphs whose perfect matching polytopes coincide with their bipartite relaxations (known as \emph{Birkhoff von Neumann graphs}). This yields a constructive polyhedral proof of the existence of such bases and highlights new connections between combinatorial and geometric properties of perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>A step toward Chen-Lih-Wu conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equitable $k$-coloring of a graph is a proper $k$-coloring where the sizes of any two different color classes differ by at most one. In 1973, Meyer conjectured that every connected graph $G$ has an equitable $k$-coloring for some $k\leq \Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. Chen, Lih, and Wu strengthened this in 1994 by conjecturing that for $k\geq 3$, the only connected graphs of maximum degree at most $k$ with no equitable $k$-coloring are the complete bipartite graph $K_{k,k}$ for odd $k$ and the complete graph $K_{k+1}$. A more refined conjecture was proposed by Kierstead and Kostochka, relaxing the maximum degree condition to an Ore-type condition. Their conjecture states the following: for $k\geq 3$, if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph such that $d(x) + d(y)\leq 2k$ for every edge $xy\in E(G)$, and $G$ admits no equitable $k$-coloring, then $G$ contains either $K_{k+1}$ or $K_{m,2k-m}$ for some odd $m$. We prove that for any constant $c&gt;0$ and all sufficiently large $n$, the latter two conjectures hold for every $k\geq cn$. Our proof yields an algorithm with polynomial time that decides whether $G$ has an equitable $k$-coloring, thereby answering a conjecture of Kierstead, Kostochka, Mydlarz, and Szemer\'{e}di when $k \ge cn$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler's theorem asserts that $A(n)=B(n)$ where $A(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ into distinct parts and $B(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ into odd parts. In this paper, it is proved that for $n&gt;0$, \begin{align*} A(n)=B(n)=C(n+1)=\frac{1}{2}D(n+1), \end{align*} where $C(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ with largest part even and parts not exceeding half of the largest part are distinct, and $D(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ into non-negative parts wherein the smallest part appear exactly twice and no other parts are repeated.</description>

      <title>Rainbow planar Tur{\'a}n numbers of cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rainbow Tur{\'a}n number of a fixed graph $H$, denoted by ${\text{ex}}^*(n,H)$, is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph such that it admits a proper edge coloring with no rainbow $H$. We study this problem in planar setting. The rainbow planar Tur{\'a}n number of a graph $H$, denoted by ${\text{ex}_{\mathcal{P}}}^*(n,H)$, is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex planar graph such that it has a proper edge coloring with no rainbow $H$. We consider the rainbow planar Tur{\'a}n number of cycles. Since $C_3$ is complete, ${\text{ex}_{\mathcal{P}}}^*(n, C_3)$ is exactly its planar Tur{\'a}n number, which is $2n-4$ for $n\ge 3$. We show that ${\text{ex}_{\mathcal{P}}}^*(n, C_4)=3n-6$ for $n=k^2-3k+2$ where $k\ge 5$, and ${\text{ex}_{\mathcal{P}}}^*(n,C_k)=3n-6$ for all $k\ge 5$ and $n\ge 3$.</description>

      <title>On an analogue of BRK-type sets in finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Besicovitch-Rado-Kinney (BRK) set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ contains a hypersphere of every radius. In $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, BRK-type sets of degree $\ell$ analogously contain a family of $(n-1)$-dimensional surfaces, parametrized by a dilation factor and determined by a fixed homogeneous polynomial of degree $\ell$. We define $(n,d)$-BRK-type sets of degree $\ell$, which contain a family of $d$-dimensional sets parametrized by an $(n-d)$-dimensional dilation factor and determined by fixed homogeneous polynomials of degree $\ell$. We use the polynomial method to obtain a lower bound $|S| \gtrsim_{n, \ell} q^n$ on $(n,d)$-BRK-type sets $S$ of degree $\ell$. We obtain an improved lower bound $|S| \geq \frac{(q-1)^n}{(\ell + 1 - 2\ell/q)^n}$ by implementing the method of multiplicities; this is the same bound obtained by Trainor on BRK-type sets of degree $\ell$, and we obtain this bound independently of $d$.</description>

      <title>Automorphism Groups and Structure of 4-Valent Cayley Graphs on Dihedral Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a finite group and S be an inverse-closed subset of G not containing the identity. The Cayley graph Cay(G, S) has vertex set G, where two vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if the group element obtained by applying the group operation to x and the inverse of y belongs to S. Kaseasbeh and Erfanian (2021) determined the structure of all Cayley graphs on the dihedral group of order 2n for subsets S of size at most three. We extend their work by analyzing the structure of all such Cayley graphs for subsets S of size four. Among other results, our main results are as follows for subsets S of size at least four: (1) using a classical result of Burnside and Schur (1911), we determine the automorphism groups of a family of Cayley graphs where S contains only rotations; (2) if S consists only of rotations, then the Cayley graph is the disjoint union of two isomorphic circulant graphs on n vertices; and (3) if S is a set of k reflections generating the dihedral group, then the Cayley graph is bipartite, forming the disjoint union of k perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>Improved bound for the $k$-variate Elekes--R\'onyai theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f\in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots, x_k]$, for $k\ge 2$. For any finite sets $A_1,\ldots, A_k\subset \mathbb{R}$, consider the set $$ f(A_1,\ldots, A_k):=\{f(a_1,\ldots, a_k)\mid (a_1,\cdots,a_k)\in A_1\times\cdots \times A_k\}, $$ that is, the image of $A_1\times \cdots\times A_k$ under $f$. Extending a theorem of Elekes and R\'onyai, which deals with the case $k=2$, and a result of Raz, Sharir, and De Zeeuw, dealing with the case $k=3$, it was proved Raz and Shem Tov, that for every choice of finite $A_1,\ldots, A_k\subset \mathbb{R}$, each of size $n$, one has \begin{equation}\label{RSbound} |f(A_1,\ldots,A_k)|=\Omega(n^{3/2}), \end{equation} unless $f$ has some degenerate special form.
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of a {\it rank} of a $k$-variate polynomial $f$, denoted as ${\rm rank}(f)$. Letting $r={\rm rank}(f)$, we prove that \begin{equation} |f(A_1,\ldots,A_k)|=\Omega\left(n^{\frac{5r-4}{2r}-\varepsilon}\right), \end{equation} for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, where the constant of proportionality depends on $\varepsilon$ and on ${\rm deg}(f)$. This improves the previous lower bound, for polynomials $f$ for which ${\rm rank}(f)\ge 3$.
  We present an application of our main result, to lower bound the number of distinct $d$-volumes spanned by $(d+1)$-tuples of points lying on the moment curve in $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>On the Vietoris-Rips Complexes of Integer Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a metric space $X$ and $r \geq 0$, the Vietoris-Rips complex $\mathcal{VR}(X;r)$ is a simplicial complex whose simplices are finite subsets of $X$ with diameter at most $r$. Vietoris-Rips complexes have applications in various places, including data analysis, geometric group theory, sensor networks, etc. Consider the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ as a metric space equipped with the $d_1$-metric (the Manhattan metric or standard word metric in the Cayley graph). Ziga Virk proved that if either $r \geq n^2(2n-1)$, or $1\leq n \leq 3$ and $r \geq n$, then the complex $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible, and posed a question if $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for all $r \geq n$. Recently, Matthew Zaremsky improved Ziga's result and proved that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible if $r \geq n^2+ n-1$. Further, he conjectured that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for all $r \geq n$. We prove Zaremsky's conjecture for $n \leq 5$, i.e., we prove that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible if $n \leq 5$ and $r \geq n$. Further, we prove that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is contractible for $r \geq 10$.
  We determine the homotopy type of $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;2)$, and show that these complexes are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of countably infinite copies of $\mathbb{S}^3$. We also show that $\mathcal{VR}(\mathbb{Z}^n;r)$ is simply connected for $r \geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that Oda's question holds for $n$-dimensional simplicial reflexive polytope $P$ and lattice polytope $Q$ containing the origin, when the vertex of $Q$ is either a vertex of $P$ or the origin, provided that $P$ has no more than $n+1$ lattice points on each facet and possesses unimodular triangulation. Then we prove Oda's question is true for any two facet unimodular polytopes whose matrix defining the facets has at most two non-zero entries in each row, and also true for any almost co-unimodular pair of reflexive polytopes.</description>

      <title>Rainbow matchings in edge-colored graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an edge-colored graph. We use $e(G)$ and $c(G)$ to denote the number of edges and colors in $G$, respectively. A subgraph $H$ is called rainbow if $c(H)=e(H)$. Li et al. (European J. Combin., 36 (2014), 453-459) proved that every edge-colored graph on $n$ vertices with $e(G)+c(G) \geq n(n+1)/2$ contains rainbow triangles. Later, Xu et al. (European J. Combin., 54 (2016), 193-200) generalized the previous results concerning rainbow triangles to rainbow cliques $Kr$, where $r\geq 4$. In this paper, we consider the existence of rainbow matchings of size $k$ in general edge-colored graphs $G$ under the condition of $e(G)+c(G)$, and the condition in our result is tight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce $(r,i)$-regular fat linear sets, which are defined as linear sets containing exactly $r$ points of weight $i$ and all other points of weight one. This notion generalizes and unifies existing constructions; scattered linear sets, clubs, and other previously studied families are special cases. We present new classes of regular fat linear sets in PG$(k-1,q^n)$ for composite $n$ and study their equivalence classes. Finally, we show that regular fat linear sets naturally yield three-weight rank-metric codes, which we use to obtain bounds on their parameters.</description>

      <title>Different Forms of Imbalance in Strongly Playable Discrete Games I: Two-Player RPS Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct several definitions of imbalance and playability, both of which are related to the existence of dominated strategies. Specifically, a maximally balanced game and a playable game cannot have dominated strategies for any player. In this context, imbalance acts as a measure of inequality in strategy, similar to measures of inequality in wealth or population dynamics. Conversely, playability is a slight strengthening of the condition that a game has no dominated strategies. It is more accurately aligned with the intuition that all strategies should see play. We show that these balance definitions are natural by exhibiting a (2n+1)-RPS that maximizes all proposed imbalance definitions among playable RPS games. We demonstrate here that this form of imbalance aligns with the prevailing notion that different definitions of inequality for economic and game-theoretic distributions must agree on both the maximal and minimal cases. In the sequel paper, we utilize these definitions for multiplayer games to demonstrate that a generalization of this imbalanced RPS is at least nearly maximally imbalanced while remaining playable for under 50 players.</description>

      <title>Zeros of Stern polynomials in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Stern sequence of positive integers was extended to a polynomial sequence $S_n(\lambda)$ by Klav\v{z}ar et. al. by defining $S_0(\lambda) = 0$, $S_1(\lambda) = 1$, and $$S_{2n}(\lambda) = \lambda S_n(\lambda),\quad S_{2n+1}(\lambda) = S_n(\lambda) + S_{n+1}(\lambda).$$ Dilcher et. al. conjectured that all roots of $S_n(\lambda)$ lie in the half-plane $\{\operatorname{Re} w &lt; 1\}$. We make partial progress on this conjecture by proving that $\{|w-2| \leq 1\}\subseteq\mathbb C$ does not contain any roots of $S_n(\lambda)$. Our proof uses the Parabola Theorem for convergence of complex continued fractions. As a corollary, we establish a conjecture of Ulas and Ulas by showing that $S_p(\lambda)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb Z[\lambda]$ whenever $p$ is a positive prime.</description>

      <title>Induced matching treewidth and tree-independence number, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two graph parameters defined via tree decompositions: tree-independence number and induced matching treewidth. Both parameters are defined similarly as treewidth, but with respect to different measures of a tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}$ of a graph $G$: for tree-independence number, the measure is the maximum size of an independent set in $G$ included in some bag of $\mathcal{T}$, while for the induced matching treewidth, the measure is the maximum size of an induced matching in $G$ such that some bag of $\mathcal{T}$ contains at least one endpoint of every edge of the matching.
  While the induced matching treewidth of any graph is bounded from above by its tree-independence number, the family of complete bipartite graphs shows that small induced matching treewidth does not imply small tree-independence number. On the other hand, Abrishami, Bria\'nski, Czy\.zewska, McCarty, Milani\v{c}, Rz\k{a}\.zewski, and Walczak~[SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2025] showed that, if a fixed biclique $K_{t,t}$ is excluded as an induced subgraph, then the tree-independence number is bounded from above by some function of the induced matching treewidth. The function resulting from their proof is exponential even for fixed $t$, as it relies on multiple applications of Ramsey's theorem. In this note we show, using the K\"ov\'ari-S\'os-Tur\'an theorem, that for any class of $K_{t,t}$-free graphs, the two parameters are in fact polynomially related.</description>

      <title>Lower and Upper Bounds for Small Canonical and Ordered Ramsey Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate three extensions of Ramsey numbers to other combinatorial settings.
  We first consider ordered Ramsey numbers. Here, we ask for a monochromatic copy of a linearly ordered graph $G$ in every $2$-edge-coloring of a linearly ordered complete graph $K_n$. The smallest such $n$ is denoted by $\vec{R}(G)$.
  Next, we study canonical Ramsey numbers. A canonical coloring of a linearly ordered graph $G$ is an edge-coloring in which $G$ is monochromatic, rainbow, or min/max-lexicographic. In the latter case, each pair of edges receives the same color if and only if they share the same first (respectively, second) vertex. Erd\H{o}s and Rado showed that for every $p$ there exists $n$ such that every edge-coloring of a linearly ordered $K_n$ contains a canonical copy of $K_p$; the smallest such $n$ is denoted by $ER(G)$.
  Finally, we examine unordered canonical Ramsey numbers, introduced by Richer. An edge-coloring of $G$ is orderable if there exists a linear ordering of its vertices such that the color of each edge is determined by its first vertex. Unlike lexicographic colorings, this notion also includes monochromatic colorings. Richer proved that for all $s$ and $t$, there exists $n$ such that every edge-coloring of $K_n$ contains an orderable copy of $K_s$ or a rainbow $K_t$. The smallest such $n$ is denoted by $CR(s,t)$.
  In all three settings, we focus on determining the corresponding Ramsey numbers for small graphs $G$. We use tabu search and integer programming to obtain lower bounds, and flag algebras or integer programming to establish upper bounds. Among other results, we determine $\vec{R}(G)$ for all graphs $G$ on up to four vertices except $K_4^-$, $ER(P_4)$ for all orderings of $P_4$, and the exact values $CR(6,3)=26$ and $CR(3,5)=13$.</description>

      <title>The Difference Subgroup Graph of a Finite Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{difference subgroup graph} $D(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is defined as the graph whose vertices are the non-trivial proper subgroups of $G$, with two distinct vertices $H$ and $K$ adjacent if and only if $\langle H, K \rangle = G$ but $HK \ne G$. This graph arises naturally as the difference between the join graph $\Delta(G)$ and the comaximal subgroup graph $\Gamma(G)$. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of $D(G)$ and its reduced version $D^*(G)$, obtained by removing isolated vertices.
  We establish several fundamental structural properties of these graphs, including conditions for connectivity, forbidden subgraph characterizations, and the relationship between graph parameters - such as independence number, clique number, and girth - and the solvability or nilpotency of the underlying group.
  The paper concludes with a discussion of open problems and potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Numerical estimation of the Hausdorff dimension of D-random feuilletages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement numerical techniques to simulate D-random feuilletages, candidates for higher-dimensional random geometries introduced in L. Lionni and J.-F. Marckert, Math. Phys. Anal. Geom. 24 (2021) 39. Using finite-size scaling techniques, our approach allows to give a numerical estimation of the Hausdorff dimension $d_H$ of these feuilletages. The results obtained are compatible with the formal result known for the Brownian map, which corresponds to the D=2 random feuilletage. For the D=3 case, our numerical study finds a good agreement with the conjectured value $d_H=8$.</description>

      <title>Rainbow subgraphs of uniformly coloured randomly perturbed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given $\delta \in (0,1)$, the randomly perturbed graph model is defined as the union of any $n$-vertex graph $G_0$ with minimum degree $\delta n$ and the binomial random graph $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ on the same vertex set. Moreover, we say that a graph is uniformly coloured with colours in $\mathcal{C}$ if each edge is coloured independently and uniformly at random with a colour from $\mathcal{C}$.
  Based on a coupling idea of McDiarmird, we provide a general tool to tackle problems concerning finding a rainbow copy of a graph $H=H(n)$ in a uniformly coloured perturbed $n$-vertex graph with colours in $[(1+o(1))e(H)]$. For example, our machinery easily allows to recover a result of Aigner-Horev and Hefetz concerning rainbow Hamilton cycles, and to improve a result of Aigner-Horev, Hefetz and Lahiri concerning rainbow bounded-degree spanning trees.
  Furthermore, using different methods, we prove that for any $\delta \in (0,1)$ and integer $d \ge 2$, there exists $C=C(\delta,d)&gt;0$ such that the following holds. Let $T$ be a tree on $n$ vertices with maximum degree at most $d$ and $G_0$ be an $n$-vertex graph with $\delta(G_0)\ge \delta n$. Then a uniformly coloured $G_0 \cup \mathbf{G}(n,C/n)$ with colours in $[n-1]$ contains a rainbow copy of $T$ with high probability. This is optimal both in terms of colours and edge probability (up to a constant factor).</description>

      <title>A note on inverting the dijoin of oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an oriented graph $D$ and a set $X\subseteq V(D)$, the inversion of $X$ in $D$ is the graph obtained from $D$ by reversing the orientation of each edge that has both endpoints in $X$. Define the inversion number of $D$, denoted $\mathrm{inv}(D)$, to be the minimum number of inversions required to obtain an acyclic oriented graph from $D$. The dijoin, denoted $D_1\rightarrow D_2$, of two oriented graphs $D_1$ and $D_2$ is constructed by taking vertex-disjoint copies of $D_1$ and $D_2$ and adding all edges from $D_1$ to $D_2$. We show that $\mathrm{inv}({D_1 \rightarrow D_2}) &gt; \mathrm{inv}(D_1)$, for any oriented graphs $D_1$ and $D_2$ such that $\mathrm{inv}(D_1) = \mathrm{inv}(D_2) \ge 1$. This resolves a question of Aubian, Havet, H\"orsch, Klingelhoefer, Nisse, Rambaud and Vermande. Our proof proceeds via a natural connection between the graph inversion number and the subgraph complementation number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19547v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A desarrangement is a permutation whose first ascent is even. Desarrangements were introduced in the 1980s by Jacques D\'{e}sarm\'{e}nien, who proved that they are in bijection with derangements. We revisit the study of desarrangements, focusing on two themes: the refined enumeration of desarrangements with respect to permutation statistics, and pattern avoidance in desarrangements. Our main results include generating function formulas for counting desarrangements by the number of descents, peaks, valleys, double ascents, and double descents, as well as a complete enumeration of desarrangements avoiding a prescribed set of length 3 patterns. We find new interpretations of the Catalan, Fine, Jacobsthal, and Fibonacci numbers in terms of pattern-avoiding desarrangements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$, if we glue them by identifying a given pair of vertices $u \in V(H_1)$ and $v \in V(H_2)$, what is the extremal number of the resulting graph $H_1^u \odot H_2^v$? In this paper, we study this problem and show that interestingly it is equivalent to an old question of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits on the Zarankiewicz problem. When $H_1, H_2$ are copies of a same bipartite graph $H$ and $u, v$ come from a same part, we prove that $\operatorname{ex}(n, H_1^u \odot H_2^v) = \Theta \bigl( \operatorname{ex}(n, H) \bigr)$. As a corollary, we provide a short self-contained disproof of a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, which was recently disproved by Janzer.</description>

      <title>On the Anti-Ramsey Number of Spanning Linear Forests with Paths of Lengths 2 and 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An edge-coloring of a graph $G$ assigns a color to each edge in the edge set $E(G)$. A graph $G$ is considered to be rainbow under an edge-coloring if all of its edges have different colors. For a positive integer $n$, the anti-Ramsey number of a graph $G$, denoted as $AR(n, G)$, represents the maximum number of colors that can be used in an edge-coloring of the complete graph $K_n$ without containing a rainbow copy of $G$. This concept was introduced by Erd\H{o}s et al. in 1975. The anti-Ramsey number for the linear forest $kP_3 \cup tP_2$ has been extensively studied for two positive integers $k$ and $t$. Formulations exist for specific values of $t$ and $k$, particularly when $k \geq 2$, $t \geq \frac{k^2 - k + 4}{2}$, and $n \geq 3k + 2t + 1$. In this work, we present the anti-Ramsey number of the linear forest $kP_3 \cup tP_2$ for the case where $k \geq 1$, $t \geq 2$, and $n = 3k + 2t$. Notably, our proof for this case does not require any specific relationship between $k$ and $t$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establishe the extremal bounds of the topological indices -- Sigma index -- focusing on analyzing the sharp upper bounds and the lower bounds of the Sigma index, which is known $\sigma(G)=\sum_{uv\in E(G)}(d_G(u)-d_G(v))^2$. We establish precise lower and upper bounds for the Sigma index, leveraging a non-increasing degree sequence $\mathscr{D} = (d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n)$, A fundamental challenge in the study of topological indices lies in establishing precise bounds, as such findings illuminate intrinsic relationships among diverse indices.</description>

      <title>Divergent Infinite Series -- Ramanujan's Initial Intuition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08652v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates Srinivasa Ramanujan's initial intuitive methodology for assigning the finite value -1/12 to the sum of the divergent infinite series of all positive integers. We systematically examine Ramanujan's initial method, originally sketched in his notebooks, and set the methodology into an algebraic framework. The methodology has limited applicability to other classes of divergent series. The methodology is extended to assign a Ramanujan smoothed sum to the infinite sequences of integers raised to a positive integer power and to figurate binomial number sequences, including triangular numbers, tetrahedral numbers, and higher-dimensional analogues, avoiding analytical continuation. A key finding establishes that the Ramanujan smoothed sums of figurate binomial sequences are intrinsically connected to logarithmic numbers (Gregory coefficients), providing a novel perspective on Ramanujan summation through the lens of classical combinatorial functions. The paper applies asymptotic expansions of associated rational generating functions to demonstrate consistency with established results from analytic continuation methods. The results illuminate the deeper mathematical structures underlying Ramanujan's intuitive insights and suggest new avenues for research in divergent series summation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$ and a positive integer $k$, the {\it $k$-colored Ramsey number} $R_k(H)$ is the minimum integer $n$ such that in every $k$-edge-coloring of the complete graph $K_{n}$, there is a monochromatic copy of $H$. Given two graphs $H$ and $G$, the {\it constrained Ramsey number} (also called {\it rainbow Ramsey number}) $f(H,G)$ is defined as the minimum integer $n$ such that, in every edge-coloring of $K_{n}$ with any number of colors, there is either a monochromatic copy of $H$ or a rainbow copy of $G$. Let $P_t$ be the path on $t$ vertices. Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s, Lehel and Schelp proved that $f(H,P_5)=R_3(H)$ when $H$ is a path or a cycle. Li, Besse, Magnant, Wang and Watts conjectured that $f(H,P_5)=R_3(H)$ for any graph $H$, and confirmed this for all connected graphs and all bipartite graphs. In this paper, we address this conjecture for multiple classes of disconnected graphs with chromatic number at least 3. Our newly established general results encompass all known results on this problem. We also obtain several results for a bipartite variation of the problem. In addition, we propose a series of questions concerning this problem from multiple distinct aspects for further research.</description>

      <title>Edge-colored 3-uniform hypergraphs without rainbow paths of length 3 and its applications to Ramsey theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Ramsey theory problems, we consider edge-colorings of 3-uniform hypergraphs that contain no rainbow paths of length 3. There are three 3-uniform paths of length 3: the tight path $\mathcal{T}=\{v_1v_2v_3, v_2v_3v_4, v_3v_4v_5\}$, the messy path $\mathcal{M}=\{v_1v_2v_3, v_2v_3v_4, v_4v_5v_6\}$ and the loose path $\mathcal{L}=\{v_1v_2v_3,$ $v_3v_4v_5, v_5v_6v_7\}$. In this paper, we characterize the structures of edge-colored complete 3-uniform hypergraph $K_n^{(3)}$ without rainbow $\mathcal{T}$, $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{L}$, respectively. This generalizes a result of Thomason-Wagner on edge-colored complete graph $K_n$ without rainbow paths of length 3. We also obtain a multipartite generalization of these results.
  As applications, we obtain several Ramsey-type results. Given two $3$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ and $G$, the {\it constrained Ramsey number} $f(H,G)$ is defined as the minimum integer $n$ such that, in every edge-coloring of $K^{(3)}_n$ with any number of colors, there is either a monochromatic copy of $H$ or a rainbow copy of $G$. For $G\in \{\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{L}\}$ and infinitely many 3-uniform hypergraphs $H$, we reduce $f(H, G)$ to the 2-colored Ramsey number $R_2(H)$ of $H$, that is, $f(H, G)=R_2(H)$. Given a $3$-uniform hypergraph $G$ and an integer $n\geq |V(G)|$, the {\it anti-Ramsey number} $ar(n, G)$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that, in every edge-coloring of $K^{(3)}_n$ with at least $k$ colors, there is a rainbow copy of $G$. We show that $ar(n, \mathcal{T})=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{3}\right\rfloor+2$ for $n\geq 5$, $ar(n, \mathcal{M})=3$ for $n\geq 7$, and $ar(n, \mathcal{L})=n$ for $n\geq 7$. Our newly obtained Ramsey-type results extend results of Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s-Lehel-Schelp and Liu on constrained Ramsey numbers, and improve a result of Tang-Li-Yan on anti-Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>Blossoming bijection for bipartite maps: a new approach via orientations and applications to the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new bijective framework for the enumeration of bipartite planar maps with control on the degree distribution of black and white vertices. Our approach builds on the blossoming-tree paradigm, introducing a family of orientations on bipartite maps that extends Eulerian and quasi-Eulerian orientations and connects the bijection of Bousquet-M\'elou and Schaeffer to the general scheme of Albenque and Poulalhon. This enables us to generalize the Bousquet-M\'elou and Schaeffer's bijection to several families of bipartite maps.
  As an application, we also derive a rational and Lagrangian parametrization with positive integer coefficients for the generating series of quartic maps equipped with an Ising model, which is key to the probabilistic study of these maps.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for a generalization of the Ewens measure to random tuples of commuting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the number of joint orbits of random tuples of commuting permutations. In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory.</description>

      <title>Hodge-Riemann polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16992v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Schur classes of ample vector bundles on smooth projective varieties satisfy Hodge-Riemann relations on $H^{p,q}$ under the assumption that $H^{p-2,q-2}$ vanishes. More generally, we study Hodge-Riemann polynomials, which are partially symmetric polynomials that produce cohomology classes satisfying the Hodge-Riemann property when evaluated at Chern roots of ample vector bundles. In the case of line bundles and in bidegree $(1,1)$, these are precisely the nonzero dually Lorentzian polynomials. We prove various properties of Hodge-Riemann polynomials, confirming predictions and answering questions of Ross and Toma. As an application, we show that the derivative sequence of any product of Schur polynomials is Schur log-concave, confirming conjectures of Ross and Wu.</description>

      <title>Old problem revisited: Which equilateral convex polygons tile the plane?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified proof of a forty-year-old result concerning the tiling of the plane with equilateral convex polygons. Our approach is based on a theorem by M. Rao, who used an exhaustive computer search to confirm the completeness of the well-known list of fifteen pentagon types. Assuming the validity of Rao's result, we provide a concise and mainly geometrical proof of a tiling theorem originally due to Hirschhorn and Hunt. Finally, a possible connection to quasicrystals is sketched.</description>

      <title>Spectra of high-dimensional sparse random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of the high-dimensional random geometric graph $\mathcal G(n, d, p)$, formed by sampling $n$ i.i.d vectors $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ uniformly on a $d$-dimensional unit sphere and connecting each pair $\{i,j\}$ whenever $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle \geq \tau$ so that $p=\mathbb P(\langle v_i,v_j\rangle \geq \tau)$. This model defines a nonlinear random matrix ensemble with dependent entries. We show that if $d =\omega( np\log^{2}(1/p))$ and $np\to\infty$, the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized adjacency matrix $\frac{A}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$ is the semicircle law. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for $G(n, d, p)$ in the sparse regime. In the constant sparsity case $p=\alpha/n$, we further show that if $d=\omega(\log^2(n))$ the limiting spectral distribution of $A$ in $G(n,\alpha/n)$ coincides with that of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathcal G(n,\alpha/n)$.
  Our approach combines the classical moment method in random matrix theory with a novel recursive decomposition of closed-walk graphs, leveraging block-cut trees and ear decompositions, to control the moments of the empirical spectral distribution. A refined high trace analysis further yields a near-optimal bound on the second eigenvalue when $np=\Omega(\log^4 (n))$, removing technical conditions previously imposed in (Liu et al. 2023). As an application, we demonstrate that this improved eigenvalue bound sharpens the parameter requirements on $d$ and $p$ for spontaneous synchronization on random geometric graphs in (Abdalla et al. 2024) under the homogeneous Kuramoto model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the perfect matching function on $n$-vertex graphs requires monotone circuits of size $\smash{2^{n^{\Omega(1)}}}$. This improves on the $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ lower bound of Razborov (1985). Our proof uses the standard approximation method together with a new sunflower lemma for matchings.</description>

      <title>Learning stabilizer structure of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of learning a structured stabilizer decomposition of an arbitrary $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$: for $\epsilon &gt; 0$, output a state $|\phi\rangle$ with stabilizer-rank $\textsf{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ such that $|\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+|\phi'\rangle$ where $|\phi'\rangle$ has stabilizer fidelity $&lt; \epsilon$. We first show the existence of such decompositions using the recently established inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of states [AD,STOC'25].
  To learn this structure, we initiate the task of self-correction of a state $|\psi\rangle$ with respect to a class of states $S$: given copies of $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\geq \tau$ with a state in $S$, output $|\phi\rangle \in S$ with fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \tau^C$ for a constant $C&gt;1$. Assuming the algorithmic polynomial Frieman-Rusza (APFR) conjecture in the high doubling regime (whose combinatorial version was recently resolved [GGMT,Annals of Math.'25]), we give a polynomial-time algorithm for self-correction of stabilizer states. Given access to the state preparation unitary $U_\psi$ for $|\psi\rangle$ and its controlled version $cU_\psi$, we give a polynomial-time protocol that learns a structured decomposition of $|\psi\rangle$. Without assuming APFR, we give a quasipolynomial-time protocol for the same task.
  As our main application, we give learning algorithms for states $|\psi\rangle$ promised to have stabilizer extent $\xi$, given access to $U_\psi$ and $cU_\psi$. We give a protocol that outputs $|\phi\rangle$ which is constant-close to $|\psi\rangle$ in time $\textsf{poly}(n,\xi^{\log \xi})$, which can be improved to polynomial-time assuming APFR. This gives an unconditional learning algorithm for stabilizer-rank $k$ states in time $\textsf{poly}(n,k^{k^2})$. As far as we know, learning arbitrary states with even stabilizer-rank $2$ was unknown.</description>

      <title>Ising model with external magnetic field on random planar maps: Critical exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Ising model with an external magnetic field on random tetravalent planar maps and investigate its critical behavior. Explicit expressions for spontaneous magnetization and the susceptibility are computed and the critical exponents $\alpha=-1$ (third order phase transition), $\beta=\frac{1}{2}$ (spontaneous magnetization), $\gamma=2$ (susceptibility at zero external magnetic field) and $\delta=5$ (magnetization at critical temperature) are derived. To do so, we study the asymptotic behavior of the partition function of the model in the case of a weak external magnetic field using analytic combinatorics.</description>
