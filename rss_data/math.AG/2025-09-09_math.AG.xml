      <title>Construction of Higher Chow cycles on cyclic coverings of $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct higher Chow cycles of type $(2, 1)$ on a certain family of surfaces, which are constructed by a product of certain hypergeometric curves of degree $N$. We prove that for a very general member, these cycles are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Z}$ and generate a subgroup of $\operatorname{rank} \ge 36 \cdot \varphi(N)$, where $\varphi(N)$ is Euler's totient function, by computing the image of the transcendental regulator map.</description>

      <title>The intrinsic cohomology ring of the universal compactified Jacobian over the moduli space of stable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the cohomology rings of universal compactified Jacobians. Over the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_g$ of nonsingular curves, we show that the cohomology ring of the universal Jacobian is independent of the degree. Over the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ of Deligne-Mumford stable marked curves with $n\geq 1$, on the one hand we show that the cohomology ring of a universal fine compactified Jacobian is sensitive to the choice of a nondegenerate stability condition which answers a question of Pandharipande; on the other hand, we prove that the cohomology ring admits a degeneration via the perverse filtration which is independent of the (nondegenerate) stability condition. The latter defines the intrinsic cohomology ring of the universal compactified Jacobian which only relies on $g,n$.
  Our main tools include the support theorems, the recently developed Fourier theory for dualizable abelian fibrations, and the universal double ramification cycle relations associated with the universal Picard stack.</description>

      <title>Toric geometry of ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a continuous finitely piecewise linear function $f:\mathbb{R}^{n_0} \to \mathbb{R}$ and a fixed architecture $(n_0,\ldots,n_k;1)$ of feedforward ReLU neural networks, the exact function realization problem is to determine when some network with the given architecture realizes $f$. To develop a systematic way to answer these questions, we establish a connection between toric geometry and ReLU neural networks. This approach enables us to utilize numerous structures and tools from algebraic geometry to study ReLU neural networks. Starting with an unbiased ReLU neural network with rational weights, we define the ReLU fan, the ReLU toric variety, and the ReLU Cartier divisor associated with the network. This work also reveals the connection between the tropical geometry and the toric geometry of ReLU neural networks. As an application of the toric geometry framework, we prove a necessary and sufficient criterion of functions realizable by unbiased shallow ReLU neural networks by computing intersection numbers of the ReLU Cartier divisor and torus-invariant curves.</description>

      <title>Refined floor diagrams relative to a conic and Caporaso-Harris type formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a $q$-refined correspondence theorem between higher genus relative Gromov-Witten invariants with a Lambda class $\lambda_{g-g'}$ insertion in the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ at $k$ points on a conic and the refined counts of genus $g'$ floor diagrams relative to a conic, after the change of variables $q=e^{iu}$. We provide a Caporaso-Harris type recursive formula for the refined counts of higher genus floor diagrams. As an application of the correspondence theorem, we propose a higher genus version of BPS polynomials of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\geq3$ and Hirzebruch surfaces, which generalize the higher genus Block-G\"ottsche polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study jet schemes of Newton non-degenerate plane curve singularities. We identify a subgraph of the graph of jet components and show that it can be constructed from walks on the lattice points in the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane. In particular, we determine all the irreducible components of the jet schemes. Furthermore, we prove that this subgraph encodes the embedded topological type of the curve singularity in the plane. Finally, we introduce a generating series defined in terms of the irreducible components of the jet schemes and their (co-)dimensions, and we prove that this series is rational and explicitly determine its poles.</description>

      <title>Linear stability and rank two Clifford indices of algebraic curves with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any vector bundle computing the rank-two Clifford index of a smooth projective algebraic curve is linearly semistable. We also identify conditions under which such bundles become linearly stable, thereby addressing a question posed by A. Castorena, G. H. Hitching and E. Luna in the rank-two case. Furthermore, we demostrate that in certain special cases, this property is equivalent to the (semi)stability of the associated Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundles. This yields a positive answer, in specific cases, to a generalized version of a conjecture proposed by Mistretta and Stoppino. We also study the moduli space $S_0(n,d,5)$ of generated $\alpha$-stable coherent systems of type $(n,d,5)$ for small values of $\alpha$ and $n=2,3$. We show that a general element of an irreducible component of $S_0(2,d,5)$ or $S_0(3,d,5)$ is linearly stable whenever $2\delta_2 \leq d \leq \frac{3g}{2}$. As an application of this, we prove Butler's conjecture holds non-trivially for coherent systems of type $(2,d,5)$ within the given range for $d$.</description>

      <title>On the Jacobian polygon and \L ojasiewicz exponent of isolated complex hypersurface singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a hypersurface singularity $(X,0) \subset (\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0)$ defined by a holomorphic function $f:(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0) \to (\mathbb{C},0)$, we introduce an alternating version of Teissier's Jacobian Newton polygon, associated with a complex isolated hypersurface singularity, and prove formulas for both these invariants in terms of an embedded resolution of $(X,0)$. The formula for the alternating version has an advantage, in that for Newton nondegenerate functions, it can be calculated in terms of volumes of faces of the Newton diagram, whereas a similar formula for the original nonalternating version includes mixed volumes.
  The Milnor fiber can be given a handlebody decomposition, with handles corresponding to intersection points with the polar curve in generic plane sections of the singularity. This way we obtain a Morse-Smale complex. Teissier associates with each branch of the polar curve a vanishing rate, and we show that this induces a filtration of the Morse-Smale complex. We apply this result in order to calculate the {\L}ojasiewicz exponent in terms of the alternating Jacobian polygon, but we expect it to be of further independent interest. In the case of a Newton nondegenerate hypersurface, our result produces a formula for the {\L}ojasiewicz exponent in terms of Newton numbers of certain subdiagrams.
  This statement is related to a conjecture by Brzostowski, Krasi\'nski and Oleksik, for which we provide a counterexample. Our formula for the {\L}ojasiewicz exponent is based on a global calculation over the Newton diagram, rather than locally specifying a subset of the facets to consider, as in this conjecture. We conjecture a similar statement, which is based on our formula and inspired by the nonnegativity of local $h$-vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the general framework due to Donagi-Markman \cite{DM} and Markushevich \cite{M} we shall derive an expression for the differential of Abel-Jacobi mappings on Fano threefolds. This formula involves information normal to the Lagrangian submanifolds constructed in \cite{DM} and \cite{M}. It may be applied to give new proofs of a number of classical results about these varieties.</description>

      <title>Concentration and non-concentration of eigenfunctions of second-order elliptic operators with a divergence form in layered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ ' $\subset$ R^d , d = 1, 2, . . .  be an open bounded smooth domain, and $\Omega = \Omega'\times (0,H)\subset \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}_+.$ The coordinates in $\Omega$ are designated as x = (x ' , y) $\in$ $\Omega$ ' x (0, H). The paper deals with the concentration (and non-concentration) properties (in sectors of $\Omega$) of the eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint second-order elliptic operator    $A = -\nabla\cdot\tilde{c}\nabla$ in $L^2(\Omega,dx)$ with domain $D(A) = \{v\in H_0^1(\Omega); \tilde{c}\nabla v \in H^1(\Omega)\}.$   The coefficient $\tilde{c}&gt;0$ is assumed to be bounded, but no continuity assumption is imposed. It is analogous to the square of the speed of sound in the wave equation, and $\square{\tilde{c}}$ is commonly known in the physical literature as the celerity. This study deals with layered media, namely, $\tilde{c}(x)$) depends only on the single spatial coordinate y $\in$ (0, H), so that $\tilde{c}(x) = \tilde{c}(x ' , y) = c(y).$ The eigenvalues of A are partitioned (apart from a small residual set) into two disjoint infinite sets. The corresponding eigenfunctions are labeled as $F_G$ (guided) and $F_{N G}$ (non-guided). Their asymptotic properties are expressed by suitable estimates as the associated eigenvalues tend to infinity. The eigenfunctions in $F_G$ concentrate in ''wells'' of $c(y),$ subject to polynomial rate of decay away from the concentration sector. The non-concentrating eigenfunctions in $F_{N G}$ are oscillatory in every sector with non-decaying amplitudes. These results hold uniformly for families of celerities with a common bound on their total variation.   The paper leaves as an open problem the question of non-concentration in the case of a function $\tilde{c}y)$ which is continuous but not of bounded variation.</description>

      <title>Quadrature rules with few nodes supported on algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quadrature rules for measures supported on real algebraic and rational curves, focusing on the {odd-degree} case \(2s-1\). Adopting an optimization viewpoint, we minimize suitable penalty functions over the space of quadrature rules of strength \(2s-1\), so that optimal solutions yield rules with the minimal number of nodes. For plane algebraic curves of degree \(d\), we derive explicit node bounds depending on \(d\) and the number of places at infinity, improving results of Riener--Schweighofer, and Zalar. For rational curves in arbitrary dimension of degree \(d\), we further refine these bounds using the geometry of the parametrization and recover the classical Gaussian quadrature bound when \(d=1\). Our results reveal a direct link between the algebraic complexity of the supporting curve and the minimal size of quadrature formulas, providing a unified framework that connects real algebraic geometry, polynomial optimization, and moment theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Soma and Watari, we define a tree structure on the sub-semimodule of a semi-group $\Gamma$ associated an irreducible curve singularity $(C,O).$ Building on the results of Oblomkov, Rasmussen and Shende, we show that for certain singularities, this tree encodes some aspects of the geometric structure of the punctual Hilbert schemes of $(C,O).$ As an application, we compute the motivic Hilbert zeta function for some singular curves. A point of the Hilbert scheme corresponds to an ideal in the ring of global sections on $(C,O).$ We study the geometry of subsets of these Hilbert schemes defined by constraints on the minimal number of generators of the defining ideal, and describe some of their geometric properties.</description>

      <title>Galois Groups of Symmetric Cubic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galois group of a family of cubic surfaces is the monodromy group of the 27 lines of its generic fibre. We describe a method to compute this group for linear systems of cubic surfaces using certified numerical computations. Applying this to all families which are invariant under the action of a subgroup of $S_5$, we find that the Galois group is often much smaller than the Weyl group $W(E_6)$. As a byproduct, we compute the discriminants of these~families. Our method allows to compute the monodromy representation on homology of any family of generically smooth projective hypersurfaces. To illustrate this broader scope, we include computations for symmetric quartic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Rational cubic fourfolds with a symplectic group of automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well known conjecture asserts that a cubic fourfold X is rational if it has a cohomologically associated K3 surface. G.Ouchi proved that if X admits a finite group G of symplectic automorphisms, whose order is different from 2, then X has an associated K3 surface S in the derived sense.This is equivalent to have a cohomologically associated K3 surface and therefore X is conjecturally rational. In this note we prove that cubic fourfolds with a cyclic group of symplectic automorphisms whose order is not a power of 2, are rational and belong to the Hassett divisor C_d, with d = 14, 42. We also describe rational cubic fourfolds X with a symplectic group of automorphisms G, such that (G, S_G(X), is a Lech pair where th rank of S_G equals 19 or 20.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies affine algebraic varieties parametrized by sine and cosine functions, generalizing algebraic Lissajous figures in the plane. We show that, up to a combinatorial factor, the degree of these varieties equals the volume of a polytope. We deduce defining equations from rank constraints on a matrix with polynomial entries. We discuss applications of Lissajous varieties in dynamical systems, in particular the Kuramoto model. This leads us to study connections with convex optimization and Lissajous discriminants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete reimplementation of the LinearSystem package of Magma, with substantial improvements in design and performance. The resulting efficiency enables computations that were previously out of reach. We briefly describe the design principles, capabilities, and algorithms of the new implementation and illustrate them with examples that showcase its power. Rather than comparing speeds, our goal is to advertise the package by demonstrating what can now be achieved in practice. We also add one core capability: computing linear systems of plane curves with prescribed non-ordinary singularities.</description>

Abstract: We study the deformation behavior of compact hyperbolic complex manifolds. Let $\pi:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \Delta$ be a smooth family of compact complex manifolds over the unit disk in $\mathbb{C}$, and $H$ a compact hyperbolic complex manifold. Then the $H$-locus $\{t\in\Delta: X_t\cong H\}$ is either at most a discrete subset of $\Delta$ or the whole $\Delta$. For a smooth family over a compact Riemann surface $Y$, its $H$-locus is either at most finite or the whole $Y$. Furthermore, if $Y$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$ or an elliptic curve, then we conjecture that the $H$-locus is empty or the whole $Y$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real toric manifolds are the real loci of nonsingular complete toric varieties. In this paper, we calculate the integral cohomology groups of real toric manifolds in terms of the combinatorial data contained in the underlying simplicial fans, generalizing a formula due to Cai and Choi. We also present a combinatorial formula to describe the ring structure, modulo the ideal consisting of elements of order $2$. As an application, a combinatorial-algebraic criterion is established for when a real toric manifold is spin$^c$.</description>

      <title>Isotopy invariance and stratified $\mathbb{E}_2$-structure of the Ran Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a complex reductive group. A folklore result asserts the existence of an $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structure on the Ran Grassmannian of $G$ over $\mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$, seen as a topological space with the complex-analytic topology. The aim of this paper is to prove this theorem, by establishing a homotopy invariance result: namely, an inclusion of open balls $D' \subset D$ in $\mathbb{C}$ induces a homotopy equivalence between the respective Beilinson--Drinfeld Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_{G, {D'}^I} \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Gr}_{G, D^I}$, for any power $I$. We use a purely algebraic approach, showing that automorphisms of a complex smooth algebraic curve $X$ can be lifted to automorphisms of the associated Beilinson--Drinfeld Grassmannian. As a consequence, we obtain a stronger version of the usual homotopy invariance result: namely, the homotopies can be promoted to equivariant stratified isotopies, where "equivariant" refers to the action of the arc group $\mathrm{L}^+G$ and "stratified" refers to the stratification induced by the Schubert stratification of $\mathrm{Gr}_G$ and the incidence stratification of $\mathbb{C}^I$.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a complete equicharacteristic noetherian local domain with an algebraically closed residue field $k$. Let $\nu$ be a zero dimensional valuation of rank one centered in $R$ with value group $\Phi$. We show that there is a valuation preserving embedding of $R$ in the ring $k[[t^{\Phi_{\geq 0}}]]$ of Hahn series. The method relies on torific local uniformization for rational valuations with finitely generated semigroup and the approximation of rational valuations by semivaluations with finitely generated semigroup.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to study basic structures and interrelations of $\delta$-rings, perfectoid towers, and lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences over Noetherian rings in positive or mixed characteristic. Then we discuss some methods for constructing perfectoid towers, dealing with $p$-torsion free and $p$-torsion cases, respectively. Some interesting examples arise as quotients by monomial or binomial ideals or determinantal rings. We also explain a geometric method with a view toward constructing rings with certain singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and study various properties of a negative spin version of the Witten $ r $-spin class. By taking the top Chern class of a certain vector bundle on the moduli space of twisted spin curves that parametrises $ r $-th roots of the anticanonical bundle, we construct a non-semisimple cohomological field theory (CohFT) that we call the Theta class $ \Theta^r $. This CohFT does not have a flat unit and its associated Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold is nowhere semisimple. Despite this, we construct a semisimple deformation of the Theta class, and using the Teleman reconstruction theorem, we obtain tautological relations on $ \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} $. We further consider the descendant potential of the Theta class and prove that it is the unique solution to a set of $ \mathcal{W} $-algebra constraints, which implies a recursive formula for the descendant integrals. Using this result for $ r = 2 $, we prove Norbury's conjecture which states that the descendant potential of $ \Theta^2 $ coincides with the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten tau function of the KdV hierarchy. Furthermore, we conjecture that the descendant potential of $ \Theta^r $ is the $ r $-BGW tau function of the $ r $-KdV hierarchy and prove the conjecture for $ r = 3 $.</description>

      <title>Taking limits in topological recursion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When does topological recursion applied to a family of spectral curves commute with taking limits? This problem is subtle, especially when the ramification structure of the spectral curve changes at the limit point. We provide sufficient (straightforward-to-use) conditions for checking when the commutation with limits holds, thereby closing a gap in the literature where this compatibility has been used several times without justification. This takes the form of a stronger result of analyticity of the topological recursion along suitable families. To tackle this question, we formalise the notion of global topological recursion and provide sufficient conditions for its equivalence with local topological recursion. The global version facilitates the study of analyticity and limits. For nondegenerate algebraic curves, we reformulate these conditions purely in terms of the structure of its underlying singularities. Finally, we apply this to study deformations of $ (r,s) $-spectral curves, spectral curves for weighted Hurwitz numbers, and provide several other examples and non-examples (where the commutation with limits fails).</description>

      <title>Relative Dolbeault Geometric Langlands via the Regular Quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X = G/H$ be an affine homogeneous spherical variety with abelian regular centralizer and no type N roots. In this paper, we formulate a relative geometric Langlands conjecture in the Dolbeault setting for $M = T^*X$. More concretely, we conjecture a Fourier-Mukai duality between the Dolbeault period sheaf and a sheaf whose construction closely resembles the Dirac-Higgs bundle of a polarization of the dual symplectic representation of Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, and Venkatesh. These conjectures can be seen as a generalization of Hitchin's conjectural duality of branes for symmetric spaces. We verify these conjectures in several cases, including the Friedberg-Jacquet case $X = GL_{2n}/GL_n\times GL_n$, the Jacquet-Ichino case $X = PGL_2^3/PGL_2$, the Rankin-Selberg case $X = GL_n\times GL_{n+1}/GL_n$, and the Gross-Prasad case $X = SO_n\times SO_{n+1}/SO_n$. Our main tool is the theory of the regular quotient, which was described in the context of symmetric spaces in [HM24].</description>

      <title>A toric degeneration of Kronecker moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that there is a finite SAGBI basis of the coordinate ring of a Kronecker quiver moduli space, indexed by primitive semi-standard tableaux pairs. This induces a toric degeneration of the Kronecker moduli space to a normal toric variety, a generalization of the toric degeneration of the Grassmannian to the Gelfand--Cetlin polytope constructed by Gonciulea--Lakshmibai. The moment polytope of the degenerate toric variety can be described as the intersection of two Gelfand--Cetlin polytopes. We explain when this can be generalized to degenerations coming from matching fields.</description>

      <title>Tschirnhausen bundles of covers of the projective line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A degree $d$ genus $g$ cover of the complex projective line by a smooth curve $C$ yields a vector bundle on the projective line by pushforward of the structure sheaf. Which bundles are possible? Equivalently, which $\mathbb{P}^{d-2}$-bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1$ contain such covers? (In the language of many previous papers: what are the scrollar invariants of the cover?)
  We give a complete answer in degree $4$, which exhibits the expected pathologies. We describe a polytope (one per degree) which we propose gives the complete answer for primitive covers, i.e. covers that don't factor through a subcover. We show that all such bundles (for primitive covers) lie in this polytope, and that a ``positive proportion'' of the polytope arises from smooth covers. Moreover, we show the necessity of the primitivity assumption. Finally, we show that the image of the map from the Hurwitz space of smooth covers to the space of bundles is not preserved by generization (for $d&gt;5$ and $g \gg_d 1$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a concept of truncation for arbitrary smooth projective toric varieties and construct explicit cellular resolutions for nef truncations of their total coordinate rings. We show that these resolutions agree with the short resolutions of Hanlon, Hicks, and Lazarev, which were motivated by symplectic geometry, and we use our definition to exhibit nontrivial homology in the commutative algebraic analogue of their construction.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups and cylindricity of weighted hypersurface Fano threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that there are totally 130 deformation families of quasi-smooth terminal weighted hypersurface Fano threefolds and all members belonging to 95 families of Fano indices one are birationally rigid. Among remaining $35$ families, $15$ families have the property that general members are irrational, in particular, any of them has a finite automorphism group and is not cylindrical. In the present paper, we will observe the cylindricity and the full automorphism groups of every member in the remaining $20$ families. Moreover, we deal with the cylindricity of their forms.</description>

      <title>Relative Mather discrepancy on arc spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any generically \'etale morphism of varieties $f \colon X \to Y$, we define the relative Mather discrepancy function on the arc space $X_\infty$ of the domain and show that this function computes the dimension of the kernel of the differential map of the induced morphism on arc spaces $f_\infty \colon X_\infty \to Y_\infty$. We relate this result to the change-of-variable formula in motivic integration. We introduce the notion of $\widehat K$-equivalence, which agrees with $K$-equivalence for smooth varieties, and prove that $\widehat K$-equivalent varieties of arbitrary characteristic define the same class in the motivic ring.</description>

      <title>Higher G-theory of simplicial toric varieties and vanishing of Chow groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives computations of all the $G$-theory groups of several classes of simplicial toric varieties, including all affine toric surfaces when the base field is algebraically closed and has characteristic zero, all weighted projective spaces over any field and resolution of singularities of all affine toric surfaces $\operatorname{Spec}(k[x,xy,xy^2,...,xy^d])$ over any field $k$. The $G$-theory groups $G_0,G_1,G_2$ are computed for the product of any two weighted projective spaces over any field. The dimension of the rational vector space $G_0(X)\otimes\mathbb{Q}$ for any complete, simplicial toric variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is shown to be equal to the sum of the Betti numbers of even degrees. We also prove that the Chow group $A^2(X)$ of codimension 2 cycles vanishes for any affine, smooth toric variety, thereby proving a special case of my conjecture that the order of this Chow group $A^2(X)$ divides the determinant of the matrix whose columns are the minimal generators of the fan for any affine, simplicial toric variety $X$.</description>

      <title>Top Down Approach to 6D SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.06467v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional superconformal field theories (6D SCFTs) occupy a central place in the study of quantum field theories encountered in high energy theory. This article reviews the top down construction and study of this rich class of quantum field theories, in particular, how they are realized by suitable backgrounds in string / M- / F-theory. We review the recent F-theoretic classification of 6D SCFTs, explain how to calculate physical quantities of interest such as the anomaly polynomial of 6D SCFTs, and also explain recent progress in understanding renormalization group flows for deformations of such theories. Additional topics covered by this review include some discussion on the (weighted and signed) counting of states in these theories via superconformal indices. We also include several previously unpublished results as well as a new variant on the swampland conjecture for general quantum field theories decoupled from gravity. The aim of the article is to provide a point of entry into this growing literature rather than an exhaustive overview.</description>

      <title>$F$-rationality of two-dimensional graded rings with a rational singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.11090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that a two-dimensional $F$-rational ring has a rational singularity. However a two-dimensional ring with a rational singularity is not $F$-rational in general. In this paper, we investigate $F$-rationality of a two-dimensional graded ring with a rational singularity in terms of the multiplicity. Moreover, we determine when a two-dimensional graded ring with a rational singularity and a small multiplicity is $F$-rational.</description>

Abstract: This note corrects the paper \cite{ex}, where lattice sequences having exponentially large kissing numbers were constructed. However it was noted in \cite{dif} that the arguments in that paper are not sufficient. Here we correct the construction which leads to similar results, albeit with much smaller constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of the d-dimensional non-degenerate quadric hypersurface of characteristic p &gt; 2 is a rational function of p composed from the Ehrhart polynomials of integer polytopes. In consequence, we explain and recover a result of Gessel and Monsky and prove that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of quadrics of fixed characteristic is a decreasing function of dimension.</description>
