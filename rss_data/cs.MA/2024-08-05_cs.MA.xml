      <title>CommonUppRoad: A Framework of Formal Modelling, Verifying, Learning, and Visualisation of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining machine learning and formal methods (FMs) provides a possible solution to overcome the safety issue of autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. However, there are gaps to be bridged before this combination becomes practically applicable and useful. In an attempt to facilitate researchers in both FMs and AD areas, this paper proposes a framework that combines two well-known tools, namely CommonRoad and UPPAAL. On the one hand, CommonRoad can be enhanced by the rigorous semantics of models in UPPAAL, which enables a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the AD system's behaviour and thus strengthens the safety of the system. On the other hand, controllers synthesised by UPPAAL can be visualised by CommonRoad in real-world road networks, which facilitates AD vehicle designers greatly adopting formal models in system design. In this framework, we provide automatic model conversions between CommonRoad and UPPAAL. Therefore, users only need to program in Python and the framework takes care of the formal models, learning, and verification in the backend. We perform experiments to demonstrate the applicability of our framework in various AD scenarios, discuss the advantages of solving motion planning in our framework, and show the scalability limit and possible solutions.</description>

      <title>Agentic LLM Workflows for Generating Patient-Friendly Medical Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01112v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare is expanding rapidly, with one potential use case being the translation of formal medical reports into patient-legible equivalents. Currently, LLM outputs often need to be edited and evaluated by a human to ensure both factual accuracy and comprehensibility, and this is true for the above use case. We aim to minimize this step by proposing an agentic workflow with the Reflexion framework, which uses iterative self-reflection to correct outputs from an LLM. This pipeline was tested and compared to zero-shot prompting on 16 randomized radiology reports. In our multi-agent approach, reports had an accuracy rate of 94.94% when looking at verification of ICD-10 codes, compared to zero-shot prompted reports, which had an accuracy rate of 68.23%. Additionally, 81.25% of the final reflected reports required no corrections for accuracy or readability, while only 25% of zero-shot prompted reports met these criteria without needing modifications. These results indicate that our approach presents a feasible method for communicating clinical findings to patients in a quick, efficient and coherent manner whilst also retaining medical accuracy.

      <title>Spike Talk: Genesis and Neural Coding Scheme Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although digitalization of future power grids offer several coordination incentives, the reliability and security of information and communication technologies (ICT) hinders its overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Strategy Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10695v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonparametric statistical test for determining whether an agent is following a given mixed strategy in a repeated strategic-form game given samples of the agent's play. This involves two components: determining whether the agent's frequencies of pure strategies are sufficiently close to the target frequencies, and determining whether the pure strategies selected are independent between different game iterations. Our integrated test involves applying a chi-squared goodness of fit test for the first component and a generalized Wald-Wolfowitz runs test for the second component. The results from both tests are combined using Bonferroni correction to produce a complete test for a given significance level $\alpha.$ We applied the test to publicly available data of human rock-paper-scissors play. The data consists of 50 iterations of play for 500 human players. We test with a null hypothesis that the players are following a uniform random strategy independently at each game iteration. Using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, we conclude that 305 (61%) of the subjects are following the target strategy.</description>

      <title>Inverse Concave-Utility Reinforcement Learning is Inverse Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider inverse reinforcement learning problems with concave utilities. Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning (CURL) is a generalisation of the standard RL objective, which employs a concave function of the state occupancy measure, rather than a linear function. CURL has garnered recent attention for its ability to represent instances of many important applications including the standard RL such as imitation learning, pure exploration, constrained MDPs, offline RL, human-regularized RL, and others. Inverse reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm that focuses on recovering an unknown reward function that can rationalize the observed behaviour of an agent. There has been recent theoretical advances in inverse RL where the problem is formulated as identifying the set of feasible reward functions. However, inverse RL for CURL problems has not been considered previously. In this paper we show that most of the standard IRL results do not apply to CURL in general, since CURL invalidates the classical Bellman equations. This calls for a new theoretical framework for the inverse CURL problem. Using a recent equivalence result between CURL and Mean-field Games, we propose a new definition for the feasible rewards for I-CURL by proving that this problem is equivalent to an inverse game theory problem in a subclass of mean-field games. We outline future directions and applications in human--AI collaboration enabled by our results.</description>

      <title>When AI Meets Finance (StockAgent): Large Language Model-based Stock Trading in Simulated Real-world Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can AI Agents simulate real-world trading environments to investigate the impact of external factors on stock trading activities (e.g., macroeconomics, policy changes, company fundamentals, and global events)? These factors, which frequently influence trading behaviors, are critical elements in the quest for maximizing investors' profits. Our work attempts to solve this problem through large language model based agents. We have developed a multi-agent AI system called StockAgent, driven by LLMs, designed to simulate investors' trading behaviors in response to the real stock market. The StockAgent allows users to evaluate the impact of different external factors on investor trading and to analyze trading behavior and profitability effects. Additionally, StockAgent avoids the test set leakage issue present in existing trading simulation systems based on AI Agents. Specifically, it prevents the model from leveraging prior knowledge it may have acquired related to the test data. We evaluate different LLMs under the framework of StockAgent in a stock trading environment that closely resembles real-world conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the impact of key external factors on stock market trading, including trading behavior and stock price fluctuation rules. This research explores the study of agents' free trading gaps in the context of no prior knowledge related to market data. The patterns identified through StockAgent simulations provide valuable insights for LLM-based investment advice and stock recommendation. The code is available at https://github.com/MingyuJ666/Stockagent.</description>
