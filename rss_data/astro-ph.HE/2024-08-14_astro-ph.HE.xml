      <title>Analysis of optical spectroscopy and photometry of the type I X-ray bursting system UW CrB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UW Coronae Borealis (UW CrB) is a low mass X-ray binary that shows both Type 1 X-ray and optical bursts, which typically last for 20 s. The system has a binary period of close to 2 hours and is thought to have a relatively high inclination due to the presence of an eclipse in the optical light curve. There is also evidence that an asymmetric disc is present in the system, which precesses every 5.5 days based on changes in the depth of the eclipse. In this paper, we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of UW CrB taken over 2 years. We update the orbital ephemeris using observed optical eclipses and refine the orbital period to 110.97680(1) min. A total of 17 new optical bursts are presented, with 10 of these bursts being resolved temporally. The average $e$-folding time of $19\pm3$s for the bursts is consistent with the previously found value. Optical bursts are observed during a previously identified gap in orbital phase centred on $\phi=0.967$, meaning the reprocessing site is not eclipsed as previously thought. Finally, we find that the apparent P-Cygni profiles present in some of the atomic lines in the optical spectra are due to transient absorption.</description>

      <title>The Multiband Emission of the two-component Gamma-Ray Burst jet influenced by progenitor winds within the Accretion Disk of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), both from merger of binary compact objects (short GRBs) and collapse of massive stars (long GRBs), are expected to occur in the dense environments, e.g., the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The propagating of GRB jets in such dense environment will result in multiband transients. Investigating the properties of these transients plays important roles in their identification, understanding the jet structure and constraining population of the star and compact object in AGN disks. In this work, we intend to study the propagation and emission of a two-component GRB jet (a fast narrow component and wide slow one) in the AGN disk. We consider the influence of wind from the short and long GRB progenitors, which would reconstruct the surrounding density distribution and form a cavity in the AGN disk. We find that the long GRB jets will be chocked, the dynamcis and the emission are resemble to the case without cavity. The narrow and wide cocoon breakout emission can be detected by EP and HXMT, respectively. For short GRBs, we expect a non-thermal afterglow emission from the wide jet and a cocoon breakout emission from the chocked narrow jet, which can be monitored by EP and HXMT, respectively. Therefore, the joint observations by EP and HXMT might be helpful to distinguish the type of GRBs in the AGN disk and the jet components.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Text-Book-Version Afterglow Light curves of Gamma-Ray Bursts and Implication for Universal Radiation Physics of Baryonic Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard external shock model in the thin-shell scenario predicts an onset bump in the early optical afterglow light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We collect such a textbook-version light curve sample of $30$ GRBs, and derive the jet properties from our joint fit to their X-ray and optical afterglow light curves. It is found that the distributions of the isotropic initial Lorentz factors ($\Gamma_0$), the deceleration radii ($R_{\rm dec}$), and the magnetic field strength ($B_0$) are log-normal, but the distributions of the isotropic kinetic energy ($E_{\rm k, iso}$), medium density ($n_{0}$), and the magnetization parameter ($\sigma_{B}\equiv\epsilon_B/\epsilon_e$) are tentatively bimodal. A tight $R_{\rm dec}\mbox{-}B_{0}\mbox{-}\sigma_{B}$ relation is found. It infers a universal $\epsilon_e E_{\rm k,iso}$ among bursts, plausibly supporting the previous argument of a universal GRB radiation energy among GRBs. A jet break is required for modeling the light curves of $26$ GRBs. The distributions of the jet opening angles and the jet-corrected kinetic energies log-normally center at $\log \theta_{\rm j,c}/{\rm rad}=-1.51$ (standard deviation $\sigma=0.27$) and $\log (E_{\rm k, j,c}/{\rm erg})=51.78$ ($\sigma=0.54$), respectively. Those GRBs ($19$ GRBs), whose prompt gamma-ray emission is well estimated with broad energy-band observations, satisfy the previously discovered $L_{\rm \gamma, p, iso}-E_{\rm p,z}-\Gamma_{0}$ relation, and their gamma-ray radiation efficiencies log-normally distribute in the range from $0.04\%$ to $10\%$ with a central value of $0.42\%$. Such a low efficiency favors the baryonic fireball model, and the distribution of their baryon mass loading in the GRB ejecta log-normally centers at $\log (M_{\rm fb,c}/M_{\rm sun})=-5$ ($\sigma=0.75$).</description>

      <title>The Progenitor and Central Engine of short-duration GRB 201006A associated with a coherent radio flash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the detection of a coherent radio flash associated with short GRB 201006A, occurring 76.6 minutes after the burst, has attracted great attention. However, the physical origin of the coherent radio flash remains in debate. By reanalyzing its data observed by Fermi and Swift, we find that an early radio afterglow as the physical origin of the radio flash can be ruled out, but the coherent radio emission seems to be consistent with the hypothesis of a supramassive magnetar as the central engine collapsing into a black hole. Within this scenario, the derived magnetar surface magnetic field ($B_{\rm p}$) and the initial spin period ($P_{\rm 0}$) fall into a reasonable range, but require to prefer a low value of $\eta_{\rm R} = 10^{-7}$ or $10^{-6}$. Moreover, the calculated low-$\varepsilon$ value and $E_{\rm \gamma,iso}-E_{\rm p}$ correlation of GRB 201006A also support to the progenitor from merger of compact stars. No detected the kilonova emission associated with GRB 201006A to compare with the upper limits of optical observations is also discussed.</description>

      <title>X-ray and optical polarization aligned with the radio jet ejecta in GX 339-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first X-ray polarization measurements of GX 339-4. IXPE observed this source twice during its 2023-2024 outburst, once in the soft-intermediate state and again during a soft state. The observation taken during the intermediate state shows significant ($4\sigma$) polarization degree P = $1.3\% \pm 0.3\%$ and polarization angle $\theta$ = -74\degree $\pm$ 7\degree only in the 3 - 8 keV band. FORS2 at VLT observed the source simultaneously detecting optical polarization in the B, V, R, I bands (between $0.1%$ and $0.7\%$), all roughly aligned with the X-ray polarization. We also detect a discrete jet knot from radio observations taken later in time; this knot would have been ejected from the system around the same time as the hard-to-soft X-ray state transition and a bright radio flare occurred $\sim$3 months earlier. The proper motion of the jet knot provides a direct measurement of the jet orientation angle on the plane of the sky at the time of the ejection. We find that both the X-ray and optical polarization angles are aligned with the direction of the ballistic jet.</description>

      <title>X-ray spectral properties of the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17498-2921 during its 2023 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the X-ray spectral properties of the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17498$-$2921 during its 2023 outburst. Similar to other accreting millisecond pulsars, the broad-band spectral emission observed quasi-simultaneously by NICER and NuSTAR is well described by an absorbed Comptonized emission with an electron temperature of $\sim$17 keV plus a disk reflection component. The broadening of the disk reflection spectral features, such as a prominent iron emission line at 6.4-6.7 keV, is consistent with the relativistic motion of matter in a disk truncated at $\sim$$21 \, \mathrm{R_g}$ from the source, near the Keplerian co-rotation radius. From the high-cadence monitoring data obtained with NICER, we observe that the evolution of the photon index and the temperature of seed photons tracks variations in the X-ray flux. This is particularly evident close to a sudden $\sim$-0.25 cycles jump in the pulse phase, which occurs immediately following an X-ray flux flare and a drop in the pulse amplitude below the $3\sigma$ detection threshold. We also report on the non-detection of optical pulsations with TNG/SiFAP2 from the highly absorbed optical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Likely detection of GeV {\gamma}-ray emission from pulsar wind nebula G32.64+0.53 with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report the likely GeV {\gamma}-ray emissions originating from the pulsar PSR J1849-0001's pulsar wind nebula (PWN) G32.64+0.53. Our analysis covers approximately 14.7 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) Pass 8. The position of the source and its spectrum matches those in X-ray and TeV energy bands, so we propose that the GeV {\gamma}-ray source is indicative of PWN G32.64+0.53. We interpret the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) using a time-dependent one-zone model, which assumes that the multi-band non-thermal emission of the target source can be generated by synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the electrons/positrons. Our findings demonstrate that the model substantially elucidates the observed SED. These results lend support to the hypothesis that the {\gamma}-ray source originates from the PWN G32.64+0.53 powered by PSR J1849-0001. Furthermore, the {\gamma}-rays in TeV bands are likely generated by electrons/positrons within the nebula through Inverse Compton Scattering.</description>

      <title>Detecting exoplanet transits with the next generation of X-ray telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting exoplanet transits at X-ray wavelengths would provide a window into the effects of high energy irradiation on the upper atmospheres of planets. However, stars are relatively dim in the X-ray, making exoplanet transit detections difficult with current X-ray telescopes. To date, only one exoplanet (HD~189733~b) has an X-ray transit detection. In this study, we investigate the capability of future X-ray observatories to detect more exoplanet transits, focusing on both the NewAthena-WFI instrument and the proposed Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), which provide more light-collecting power than current instruments. We examined all the transiting exoplanet systems in the NASA Exoplanet Archive and gathered X-ray flux measurements or estimates for each host star. We then predicted the stellar count rates for both AXIS and NewAthena and simulated light curves, using null-hypothesis testing to identify the top 15 transiting planets ranked by potential detection significance. We also evaluate transit detection probabilities when the apparent X-ray radius is enlarged due to atmospheric escape, finding that $\geq 5$ of these planetary systems may be detectable on the $&gt;4\sigma$ level in this scenario. Finally, we note that the assumed host star coronal temperature, which affects the shape of an X-ray transit, can also significantly affect our ability to detect the planet.</description>

      <title>On the length scale of collective neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I present a discussion on the length scale of collective neutrino oscillations. There is a popular myth in the field that the length scale of collective neutrino oscillation is related to the strength of self-interaction potential; this is a result of confusion between the length scale and time scale. As a consequence of this myth, it is believed that the convergence of numerical simulation of quantum kinetic equations requires a spatial resolution (radial bin size) that is equal to the inverse of the self-interaction potential. I try to debunk this myth in this paper.</description>

      <title>Ancient nova shells of RX Pup indicate evolution of mass transfer rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RX Pup is a symbiotic binary which experienced a nova outburst in the 1970's. Here we report a discovery of a ~1300 year old nova shell around the system and a possible detection of a ~7000 year old nova shell. Together with the nova shell ejected in the 1970's this makes RX Pup the first system with three nova shells observed. This triad of eruptions suggests a change in the nova recurrence time. The most likely explanation is an alteration in the mass transfer rate attributed to evolutionary changes of the mass-donor in the system. Notably, comparative analyses with theoretical models indicate an increase in the average mass transfer rate by a factor of three over the past 10,000 years. This makes RX Pup a unique system, which allows us to probe millenium-scale evolution of mass transfer rates in binary systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field of the Quasar 1604+159 from Parsec to Kilo-parsec Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-frequency polarimetric study for the quasar 1604+159. The source was observed at the $L$ band with the American Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and the $L$, $X$, and $U$ bands with the Very Large Array (VLA). These observations provide different resolutions from mas to arcsec, enabling us to probe the morphology and magnetic field from tens of parsec to hundreds of kilo-parsec scale. We detect a symmetrical Fanaroff-Riley-Class-I-like structure. The source has several lobes and bulges, forming a cocoon shape. The polarization is normal to the edges of the structure with high fractional polarization up to $\sim 60\%$. Two hotspots are observed at the eastern and western sides of the source, located symmetrically relative to the core. The flux density ratio ($&gt;1.5$) between the two hotspots suggests the Doppler beaming effect exists at a large scale. The polarized emission in the hotspots also shows a symmetrical structure with an oblique direction from the jet direction. In general, the jet propagates in a collimating structure with several bends. Polarization is also detected perpendicular to the local jet from $\sim$100 mas to $\sim$ 1 arcsec. The jet shows strong polarized intensity and high fractional polarization at the bending edges. We discuss the possible origins of the observed structure and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Light Curve Parameter Estimation Using Likelihood-Free Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06947v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a parameter estimation algorithm on kilonova light curves using likelihood-free inference. Our inference is optimized through a pre-trained embedding network that marginalizes the time of arrival and the luminosity distance of the signal. We find that parameter inference utilizing a pre-trained embedding outperforms the use of likelihood-free inference alone, reducing training time and offering the capability to marginalize over certain nuisance parameters. The model is capable of retrieving the intrinsic parameters of the kilonova light curves with a comparable accuracy and precision to nested sampling methods while taking significantly less computational time. This framework has been integrated into the publicly available Nuclear Multi-Messenger Astronomy codebase so users can leverage the model for their inference purposes. This algorithm is broadly applicable to parameterized or simulated light curves of other transient objects.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton Perspective of the Unique Magnetic Binary- $\epsilon$ Lupi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\epsilon$ Lupi A (HD 136504) system stands out among magnetic massive binaries as the only short-period binary system in which both components have detectable magnetic fields. The proximity of the magnetospheres of the components leads to magnetospheric interactions, which are revealed as periodic pulses in the radio light curve of this system. In this work, we aim to investigate the magnetospheric interaction phenomenon in the X-ray domain. We observed this system with the XMM-Newton telescope, covering its orbital period. We observe variable X-ray emission with maximum flux near periastron, showing similarity with radio observations. The X-ray spectra show significantly elevated hard X-ray flux during periastron. We attribute the soft X-ray emission to individual magnetospheres, while the hard X-ray emission is explained by magnetospheric interaction, particularly due to magnetic reconnection. However, unlike in the radio, we do not find any significant short-term X-ray bursts. This exotic system can be an ideal target to study magnetospheric interactions in close binaries with organized magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>DarkMatters: A powerful tool for WIMPy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new software package, DarkMatters, which has been designed to facilitate the calculation of all aspects of indirect dark matter detection of WIMPs in astrophysical settings. Two primary features of this code are the improvement in performance compared to existing tools, and higher levels of accuracy when determining radio synchrotron emission associated with WIMP annihilations, both of which are enabled by the employment of a set of modern and novel numerical techniques. The code also includes functionality for a multi-wavelength set of output products including gamma-ray, radio and neutrino fluxes which can be saved in common formats used by the astronomical community, such as the FITS data file format. The calculations may be tailored to work with a wide range of astrophysical target structures, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters, and the configuration of the underlying calculations is managed by a set of key-value dictionary entries that are easy to understand and use. The code base is publicly accessible through an online repository with a permissive MIT source code licence.</description>

      <title>Impact of reflection Comptonization on X-ray reflection spectroscopy: the case of EXO 1846-031</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the disk-corona model, it is natural to expect that a fraction of reflection photons from the disk are Compton scattered by the hot corona (reflection Comptonization), even if this effect is usually ignored in X-ray reflection spectroscopy studies. We study the effect by using NICER and NuSTAR data of the Galactic black hole EXO 1846-031 in the hard-intermediate state with the model SIMPLCUTX. Our analysis suggests that a scattered fraction of order 10% is required to fit the data, but the inclusion of reflection Comptonization does not change appreciably the measurements of key-parameters like the black hole spin and the inclination angle of the disk.</description>

      <title>The Origins of Narrow Spectra of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01266</link>

Abstract: Observations find that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) have extremely narrow-band spectra, i.e., $\Delta\nu/\nu_0 \ll 1$. We show that when the angular size of the emission region is larger than the Doppler beaming angle, the observed spectral width ($\Delta\nu/\nu_0$) exceeds 0.58 due to the high latitude effects for a source outside the magnetosphere, even when the spectrum in the source's comoving frame is monochromatic. The angular size of the source for magnetospheric models of FRBs can be smaller than the Doppler beaming angle, in which case this geometric effect does not influence the observed bandwidth. We discuss various propagation effects to determine if any could transform a broad-spectrum radio pulse into a narrow-spectrum signal at the observer's location. We find that plasma lensing and scintillation can result in a narrow bandwidth in the observed spectrum. However, the likelihood of these phenomena being responsible for the narrow observed spectra with $\Delta\nu/\nu_0 &lt; 0.58$ in the fairly large observed sample of FRBs is exceedingly small.</description>

      <title>The Coherent Magnetic Field of the Milky Way</title>

Abstract: We present a suite of models of the coherent magnetic field of the Galaxy (GMF) based on new divergence-free parametric functions describing the global structure of the field. The model parameters are fit to the latest full-sky Faraday rotation measures of extragalactic sources (RMs) and polarized synchrotron intensity (PI) maps from WMAP and Planck. We employ multiple models for the density of thermal and cosmic-ray electrons in the Galaxy, needed to predict the skymaps of RMs and PI for a given GMF model. The robustness of the inferred properties of the GMF is gauged by studying many combinations of parametric field models and electron density models. We determine the pitch angle of the local magnetic field (11+/-1 deg.), explore the evidence for a grand-design spiral coherent magnetic field (inconclusive), determine the strength of the toroidal and poloidal magnetic halo fields below and above the disk (magnitudes the same for both hemispheres within 10%), set constraints on the half-height of the cosmic-ray diffusion volume (&gt;2.9 kpc), investigate the compatibility of RM- and PI-derived magnetic field strengths (compatible under certain assumptions) and check if the toroidal halo field could be created by the shear of the poloidal halo field due to the differential rotation of the Galaxy (possibly). A set of eight models is identified to help quantify the present uncertainties in the coherent GMF -- spanning different functional forms, data products and auxiliary input, and maximizing the differences in their predictions. We present the corresponding skymaps of rates for axion-photon conversion in the Galaxy, and deflections of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Development of a data overflow protection system for Super-Kamiokande to maximize data from nearby supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08725</link>

Abstract: Neutrinos from very nearby supernovae, such as Betelgeuse, are expected to generate more than ten million events over 10\,s in Super-Kamokande (SK). At such large event rates, the buffers of the SK analog-to-digital conversion board (QBEE) will overflow, causing random loss of data that is critical for understanding the dynamics of the supernova explosion mechanism. In order to solve this problem, two new DAQ modules were developed to aid in the observation of very nearby supernovae. The first of these, the SN module, is designed to save only the number of hit PMTs during a supernova burst and the second, the Veto module, prescales the high rate neutrino events to prevent the QBEE from overflowing based on information from the SN module. In the event of a very nearby supernova, these modules allow SK to reconstruct the time evolution of the neutrino event rate from beginning to end using both QBEE and SN module data. This paper presents the development and testing of these modules together with an analysis of supernova-like data generated with a flashing laser diode. We demonstrate that the Veto module successfully prevents DAQ overflows for Betelgeuse-like supernovae as well as the long-term stability of the new modules. During normal running the Veto module is found to issue DAQ vetos a few times per month resulting in a total dead time less than 1\,ms, and does not influence ordinary operations. Additionally, using simulation data we find that supernovae closer than 800~pc will trigger Veto module resulting in a prescaling of the observed neutrino data.</description>

      <title>Investigating the competition between the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in light of the multimessenger observations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the parity doublet model for hadronic matter and study the possible presence of quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the competition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL model. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement phase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position of the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model self-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The observations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in the parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement phase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Two radio cores in GPS J1543-0757: a new dual supermassive black hole system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of a dual supermassive black hole system in the radio galaxy J1543-0757, with a projected separation between the two black holes of 46 mas. The result is based on recent multifrequency observations using the Very Long Baseline Array and European VLBI Network, which reveal two compact, variable, flat-spectrum, active nuclei within the elliptical host galaxy of J1543-0757. Multiepoch observations from the VLBA also provide constraints on the spectral index and proper motions of all components. The flat spectra of both N and S at both frequencies strongly support that these radio components are associated with two separate, accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The two nuclei appear stationary, while the jets emanating from the weaker of the two nuclei appear to move out and terminate in bright hot spots. The discovery of this system has implications for the number of close dual black holes that might be sources of gravitational radiation.</description>
