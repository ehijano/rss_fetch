      <title>General Kontsevich-style formula for Hirzebruch Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tyomkin's correspondence theorem states the equality of counts of rational curves of fixed homology class in a toric surface satisfying point and cross-ratio conditions with their tropical counterparts. Such correspondence theorems allow us to derive non-tropical results from tropical ones; for example, Mikhalkin's correspondence theorem is used in the tropical proof of the famous Kontsevich formula for counts of plane rational curves of degree $d$ satisfying point conditions. This formula has been generalized to counts of curves in the Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ satisfying point conditions. Further generalizations allow curves in $\mathbb{P}^2$ to satisfy multiple cross-ratio conditions. In this paper, we present a Kontsevich-style formula for the Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_r$, $r \in \mathbb{N}$, which counts rational tropical curves of a fixed homology class satisfying point and multiple cross-ratio conditions using tropical methods. Moreover, the cross-ratio conditions we impose on the curves allow more freedom.</description>

      <title>Non-existence of negative derivations on the higher Nash blowup local algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f\in\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_s]$ be a weighted homogeneous polynomial having an isolated singularity and $\mathcal{T}_n(f)$ be its higher Nash blowup local algebra. We show that $\mathcal{T}_n(f)$ does not admit negative weighted derivations for $n\geq2$. This answers affirmatively a conjecture of Hussain-Ma-Yau-Zuo.</description>

Abstract: We show that the natural stratifications arising from certain deformation families of line singularities with constant L\^e numbers satisfy Bekka's $(c)$-regularity condition. As a corollary, we obtain that these families are topologically equisingular. Similar results for families of isolated singularities were established by Abderrahmane.</description>

      <title>Nonvanishing results for K\"ahler varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonvanishing theorems play a central role in birational geometry, since they derive geometric consequences from numerical information and constitute a crucial step towards abundance and semiampleness problems. General nonvanishing statements remain rare, especially in the K\"ahler setting.
  We present two types of nonvanishing results for compact K\"ahler varieties. First, on non-uniruled varieties with nonzero Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic, we prove nonvanishing for adjoint bundles of numerical dimension one on K\"ahler klt pairs, as well as nonvanishing for nef line bundles of numerical dimension one on $K$-trivial varieties. Second, on hyperk\"ahler manifolds we study line bundles $\mathcal L$ which are nef but not big, and establish a dichotomy: either nonvanishing holds for $\mathcal L$, or any closed positive current in the cohomology class of $\mathcal L$ has maximal Lelong components with a rather restricted geometry. We obtain much stronger abundance-type results in dimension $4$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linked projective spaces are quiver Grassmanians of constant dimension one of certain quiver representations, called linked nets, over special class of quivers, called $\mathbb{Z}^n$-quivers. They were recently introduced as a tool for describing schematic limits of families of divisors. They are subschemes of products of projective spaces of the same dimension. It is an open question whether they are degenerations of the (small) diagonal. We show that they have the Chow class of the diagonal.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to unirationality for product-quotient surfaces over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a surface over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$ with $\pi_1^{\'{e}t}(X) = 1$ that is supersingular -- in the sense that $H^2_{\'{e}t}(X, \mathbb{Q}_{\ell}(1))$ is spanned by algebraic cycles -- but is not unirational. This provides a counterexample to a 1977 conjecture of Shioda. To achieve this, we produce new obstructions to unirationality for product-quotient surfaces.</description>

      <title>The tropical crossing number of a finite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2015, Cartwright et al. showed that any $3$-regular metric graph arises as the skeleton of a tropical plane curve with nodes allowed. They introduced the tropical crossing number of a metric graph as the minimum number of nodes required for that graph with the prescribed lengths. We introduce the tropical crossing number of a finite, non-metric graph, the minimum number of nodes required to achieve that graph with any lengths on its edges. We prove that for any positive integer $d$ there exists a graph whose tropical crossing number is equal to $d$; moreover, this graph can be chosen with any prescribed graph-theoretic crossing number at most $d$. We then introduce and use computational methods to find the tropical crossing number of the smallest non-tropically planar graph, the lollipop graph of genus $3$. We also show that our tropical crossing number can grow quadratically in the number of vertices of the graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of the `exotic nilcone' of $F_4$ which is defined by exploiting certain characteristic two phenomena. We show that there are finitely many orbits on this nilcone and construct an associated Springer correspondence. Further to that, we show that all corresponding `exotic Springer fibers' admit an affine paving. We also deduce from this a geometric classification of certain simple modules for the affine Hecke algebra with unequal parameters of type $F_4$.</description>

      <title>Tropicalized quantum field theory and global tropical sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how to tropicalize scalar quantum field theory and show that tropicalized massive scalar quantum field theory is exactly solvable. This exact solution manifests as a non-linear recursion equation fulfilled by the expansion coefficients of the quantum effective action. Geometrically, this recursion computes specific volumes of moduli spaces of metric graphs and is thereby analogous to Mirzakhani's volume recursions on the moduli space of curves. Building on this exact solution, we construct an algorithm that samples points from the moduli space of graphs approximately proportional to their perturbative contribution. Remarkably, this algorithm requires only polynomial time and memory, suggesting that perturbative quantum field theory computations lie in the polynomial-time complexity class, while all known algorithms for evaluating individual Feynman integrals are exponential in time and memory. To demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm, we evaluate the primitive contribution to the $\phi^4$ beta function at 50 loops with a proof-of-concept implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a relation between Lelong numbers and the full mass property of relative non-pluripolar products. We use it to show that if the restricted volume of a big cohomology class $\alpha$ in a compact K\"ahler $n$-dimensional manifold $X$ to an effective divisor $D$ is of full mass, then the Lelong numbers of the non-pluripolar class $\langle \alpha^{n-1}\rangle$ at every point in the support of $D$ is zero. In particular, we obtain that on projective manifolds, the Lelong numbers of the non-pluripolar class $\langle \alpha^{n-1}\rangle$ of a big class $\alpha$ are zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connected components of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}(\mathbb{R})$ are in bijection with the $(n-1)!/2$ dihedral orderings of $[n]$. They are all isomorphic. We construct monomial maps between them, and use these maps to prove a conjecture of Arkani-Hamed, He, and Lam in the case of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$. Namely, we provide a bijection between connected components and sign patterns that are consistent with the extended $u$-relations for the dihedral embedding.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap with polynomial rate for Weil-Petersson random surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that a genus $g$ closed hyperbolic surface, sampled at random from the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g}$ with respect to the Weil-Petersson probability measure, has Laplacian spectral gap at least $\frac{1}{4}-O\left(\frac{1}{g^{c}}\right)$ with probability tending to $1$ as $g\to\infty$. This extends and gives a new proof of a recent result of Anantharaman and Monk proved in the series of works [2,3,5,4,6].
  Our approach adapts the polynomial method for the strong convergence of random matrices, introduced by Chen, Garza-Vargas, Tropp and van Handel [19], and its generalization to the strong convergence of surface groups by Magee, Puder and van Handel [41], to the Laplacian on Weil-Petersson random hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Infinite matroids in tropical differential algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a finite-dimensional vector space $W\subset K^E$ over an arbitrary field $K$ and an arbitrary set $E$. We show that the set $C(W)\subset 2^E$ consisting of the minimal supports of $W$ are the circuits of a matroid on $E$. In particular, we show that this matroid is cofinitary (hence, tame). When the cardinality of $K$ is large enough (with respect to the cardinality of $E$), then the set $trop(W)\subset 2^E$ consisting of all the supports of $W$ is a matroid itself.
  Afterwards we apply these results to tropical differential algebraic geometry and study the set of supports $trop(Sol(\Sigma))\subset (2^{\mathbb{N}^{m}})^n$ of spaces of formal power series solutions $\text{Sol}(\Sigma)$ of systems of linear differential equations $\Sigma$ in differential variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ having coefficients in the ring ${K}[\![t_1,\ldots,t_m]\!]$. If $\Sigma$ is of differential type zero, then the set $C(Sol(\Sigma))\subset (2^{\mathbb{N}^{m}})^n$ of minimal supports defines a matroid on $E=[n]\times\mathbb{N}^{m}$, and if the cardinality of $K$ is large enough, then the set of supports $\phi \circ trop(Sol(\Sigma))$ itself is a matroid on $E$ as well. By applying the fundamental theorem of tropical differential algebraic geometry (fttdag), we give a necessary condition under which the set of solutions $Sol(U)$ of a system $U$ of tropical linear differential equations to be a matroid.
  We also give a counterexample to the fttdag for systems $\Sigma$ of linear differential equations over countable fields. In this case, the set $\phi \circ trop(Sol(\Sigma))$ may not form a matroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for a dominant rational self-map $f$ on a quasi-projective variety defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, there is a point whose $f$-orbit is well-defined and its arithmetic degree is arbitrarily close to the first dynamical degree of $f$. As an application, we prove that Zariski dense orbit conjecture holds for a birational map defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ whose first dynamical degree is strictly larger than its third dynamical degree. In particular, the conjecture holds for birational maps on threefolds whose first dynamical is degree greater than $1$.</description>
