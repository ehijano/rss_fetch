      <title>The Computational Complexity of Factored Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational complexity is traditionally measured with respect to input size. For graphs, this is typically the number of vertices (or edges) of the graph. However, for large graphs even explicitly representing the graph could be prohibitively expensive. Instead, graphs with enough structure could admit more succinct representations. A number of previous works have considered various succinct representations of graphs, such as small circuits [Galperin, Wigderson '83].
  We initiate the study of the computational complexity of problems on factored graphs: graphs that are given as a formula of products and union on smaller graphs. For any graph problem, we define a parameterized version by the number of operations used to construct the graph. For different graph problems, we show that the corresponding parameterized problems have a wide range of complexities that are also quite different from most parameterized problems. We give a natural example of a parameterized problem that is unconditionally not fixed parameter tractable (FPT). On the other hand, we show that subgraph counting is FPT. Finally, we show that reachability for factored graphs is FPT if and only if $\mathbf{NL}$ is in some fixed polynomial time.</description>

      <title>NP-Completeness of Neighborhood Balanced Colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Neighborhood Balanced Coloring (NBC) of a graph is a red-blue coloring where each vertex has the same number of red and blue neighbors. This work proves that determining if a graph admits an NBC is NP-complete. We present a genetic algorithm to solve this problem, which we implemented and compared against exact and randomized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Constant-Cost Communication is not Reducible to k-Hamming Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every known communication problem whose randomized communication cost is constant (independent of the input size) can be reduced to $k$-Hamming Distance, that is, solved with a constant number of deterministic queries to some $k$-Hamming Distance oracle. We exhibit the first examples of constant-cost problems which cannot be reduced to $k$-Hamming Distance.
  To prove this separation, we relate it to a natural coding-theoretic question. For $f : \{2, 4, 6\} \to \mathbb{N}$, we say an encoding function $E : \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ is an $f$-code if it transforms Hamming distances according to $\mathrm{dist}(E(x), E(y)) = f(\mathrm{dist}(x, y))$ whenever $f$ is defined. We prove that, if there exist $f$-codes for infinitely many $n$, then $f$ must be affine: $f(4) = (f(2) + f(6))/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the work of Dominic Welsh (1938-2023), tracing his remarkable influence through his theorems, expository writing, students, and interactions. He was particularly adept at bringing different fields together and fostering the development of mathematics and mathematicians. His contributions ranged widely across discrete mathematics over four main career phases: discrete probability, matroids and graphs, computational complexity, and Tutte-Whitney polynomials. We give particular emphasis to his work in matroid theory and Tutte-Whitney polynomials.</description>

      <title>Anti-Concentration for the Unitary Haar Measure and Applications to Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Carbery-Wright style anti-concentration inequality for the unitary Haar measure, by showing that the probability of a polynomial in the entries of a random unitary falling into an $\varepsilon$ range is at most a polynomial in $\varepsilon$. Using it, we show that the scrambling speed of a random quantum circuit is lower bounded: Namely, every input qubit has an influence that is at least exponentially small in depth, on any output qubit touched by its lightcone.
  We give three applications of this new scrambling speed lower bound that apply to random quantum circuits with Haar random gates:
  $\bullet$ An optimal $\Omega(\log \varepsilon^{-1})$ depth lower bound for $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary designs;
  $\bullet$ A polynomial-time quantum algorithm that computes the depth of a bounded-depth circuit, given oracle access to the circuit;
  $\bullet$ A polynomial-time algorithm that learns log-depth circuits up to polynomially small diamond distance, given oracle access to the circuit.
  The first depth lower bound works against any architecture. The latter two algorithms apply to architectures defined over any geometric dimension, and can be generalized to a wide class of architectures with good lightcone properties.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum: Group-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves exponential speedups (polynomial runtime) over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Equality cases of the Stanley--Yan log-concave matroid inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{Stanley--Yan} (SY) \emph{inequality} gives the ultra-log-concavity for the numbers of bases of a matroid which have given sizes of intersections with $k$ fixed disjoint sets. The inequality was proved by Stanley (1981) for regular matroids, and by Yan (2023) in full generality. In the original paper, Stanley asked for equality conditions of the SY~inequality, and proved total equality conditions for regular matroids in the case $k=0$. In this paper, we completely resolve Stanley's problem. First, we obtain an explicit description of the equality cases of the SY inequality for $k=0$, extending Stanley's results to general matroids and removing the ``total equality'' assumption. Second, for $k\ge 1$, we prove that the equality cases of the SY inequality cannot be described in a sense that they are not in the polynomial hierarchy unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a finite level.</description>

      <title>Query maintenance under batch changes with small-depth circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Which dynamic queries can be maintained efficiently? For constant-size changes, it is known that constant-depth circuits or, equivalently, first-order updates suffice for maintaining many important queries, among them reachability, tree isomorphism, and the word problem for context-free languages. In other words, these queries are in the dynamic complexity class DynFO. We show that most of the existing results for constant-size changes can be recovered for batch changes of polylogarithmic size if one allows circuits of depth O(log log n) or, equivalently, first-order updates that are iterated O(log log n) times.</description>

      <title>Sparse juntas on the biased hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.09428v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a structure theorem for Boolean functions on the $p$-biased hypercube which are $\epsilon$-close to degree $d$ in $L_2$, showing that they are close to sparse juntas. Our structure theorem implies that such functions are $O(\epsilon^{C_d} + p)$-close to constant functions. We pinpoint the exact value of the constant $C_d$.
  We also give an analogous result for monotone Boolean functions on the biased hypercube which are $\epsilon$-close to degree $d$ in $L_2$, showing that they are close to sparse DNFs.
  Our structure theorems are optimal in the following sense: for every $d,\epsilon,p$, we identify a class $\mathcal{F}_{d,\epsilon,p}$ of degree $d$ sparse juntas which are $O(\epsilon)$-close to Boolean (in the monotone case, width $d$ sparse DNFs) such that a Boolean function on the $p$-biased hypercube is $O(\epsilon)$-close to degree $d$ in $L_2$ iff it is $O(\epsilon)$-close to a function in $\mathcal{F}_{d,\epsilon,p}$.</description>

      <title>Non-Clashing Teaching Maps for Balls in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kirkpatrick et al. [ALT 2019] and Fallat et al. [JMLR 2023] introduced non-clashing teaching and showed it is the most efficient machine teaching model satisfying the Goldman-Mathias collusion-avoidance criterion. A teaching map $T$ for a concept class $\mathcal{C}$ assigns a (teaching) set $T(C)$ of examples to each concept $C \in \mathcal{C}$. A teaching map is non-clashing if no pair of concepts are consistent with the union of their teaching sets. The size of a non-clashing teaching map (NCTM) $T$ is the maximum size of a teaching set $T(C)$, $C \in \mathcal{C}$. The non-clashing teaching dimension NCTD$(\mathcal{C})$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is the minimum size of an NCTM for $\mathcal{C}$. NCTM$^+$ and NCTD$^+(\mathcal{C})$ are defined analogously, except the teacher may only use positive examples.
  We study NCTMs and NCTM$^+$s for the concept class $\mathcal{B}(G)$ consisting of all balls of a graph $G$. We show that the associated decision problem B-NCTD$^+$ for NCTD$^+$ is NP-complete in split, co-bipartite, and bipartite graphs. Surprisingly, we even prove that, unless the ETH fails, B-NCTD$^+$ does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(\text{vc})}}\cdot n^{O(1)}$, nor a kernelization algorithm outputting a kernel with $2^{o(\text{vc})}$ vertices, where vc is the vertex cover number of $G$. We complement these lower bounds with matching upper bounds. These are extremely rare results: it is only the second problem in NP to admit such a tight double-exponential lower bound parameterized by vc, and only one of very few problems to admit such an ETH-based conditional lower bound on the number of vertices in a kernel. For trees, interval graphs, cycles, and trees of cycles, we derive NCTM$^+$s or NCTMs for $\mathcal{B}(G)$ of size proportional to its VC-dimension, and for Gromov-hyperbolic graphs, we design an approximate NCTM$^+$ of size 2.</description>

      <title>Complexity-Theoretic Implications of Multicalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present connections between the recent literature on multigroup fairness for prediction algorithms and classical results in computational complexity. Multiaccurate predictors are correct in expectation on each member of an arbitrary collection of pre-specified sets. Multicalibrated predictors satisfy a stronger condition: they are calibrated on each set in the collection. Multiaccuracy is equivalent to a regularity notion for functions defined by Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan (2009). They showed that, given a class $F$ of (possibly simple) functions, an arbitrarily complex function $g$ can be approximated by a low-complexity function $h$ that makes a small number of oracle calls to members of $F$, where the notion of approximation requires that $h$ cannot be distinguished from $g$ by members of $F$. This complexity-theoretic Regularity Lemma is known to have implications in different areas, including in complexity theory, additive number theory, information theory, graph theory, and cryptography. Starting from the stronger notion of multicalibration, we obtain stronger and more general versions of a number of applications of the Regularity Lemma, including the Hardcore Lemma, the Dense Model Theorem, and the equivalence of conditional pseudo-min-entropy and unpredictability. For example, we show that every boolean function (regardless of its hardness) has a small collection of disjoint hardcore sets, where the sizes of those hardcore sets are related to how balanced the function is on corresponding pieces of an efficient partition of the domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper looks at the intersection of algorithmic information theory and physics, namely quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and black holes. We discuss theorems which characterize the barrier between the quantum world and the classical realm. The notion of a "semi-classical subspace" is introduced. The No Synchronization Law is detailed, which says separate and isolated physical systems evolving over time cannot have thermodynamic algorithmic entropies that are in synch. We look at future work involving the Kolmogorov complexity of black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial State) conjecture of Freedman and Hastings [2014] posits that there exist families of Hamiltonians with all low energy states of non-trivial complexity (with complexity measured by the quantum circuit depth preparing the state). We prove this conjecture by showing that the recently discovered families of constant-rate and linear-distance QLDPC codes correspond to NLTS local Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the tasks of learning quantum states, measurements and channels generated by continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits. This family of circuits is suited to describe optical quantum technologies and in particular it includes state-of-the-art photonic processors capable of showing quantum advantage. We define classes of functions that map classical variables, encoded into the CV circuit parameters, to outcome probabilities evaluated on those circuits. We then establish efficient learnability guarantees for such classes, by computing bounds on their pseudo-dimension or covering numbers, showing that CV quantum circuits can be learned with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the circuit's size, i.e., the number of modes. Our results show that CV circuits can be trained efficiently using a number of training samples that, unlike their finite-dimensional counterpart, does not scale with the circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Two Graphs: Resolving the Periodic Reversibility of One-dimensional Finite Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite cellular automata (FCA) are widely used in simulating nonlinear complex systems, and their reversibility is closely related to information loss during the evolution. However, only a relatively small portion of their reversibility problems has been solved. In this paper, we perform calculations on two graphs and discover that the reversibility of any one-dimensional FCA exhibits periodicity as the number of cells increases. We also successfully provide a method to compute the reversibility sequence that encompasses the reversibility of one-dimensional FCA with any number of cells. Additionally, the calculations in this paper are applicable to FCA with various types of boundaries. This means that we will have an efficient method to determine the reversibility of almost all one-dimensional FCA, with a complexity independent of cell number.</description>
