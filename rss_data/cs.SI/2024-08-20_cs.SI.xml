      <title>Enhancing Community Detection in Networks: A Comparative Analysis of Local Metrics and Hierarchical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis and detection of communities in network structures are becoming increasingly relevant for understanding social behavior. One of the principal challenges in this field is the complexity of existing algorithms. The Girvan-Newman algorithm, which uses the betweenness metric as a measure of node similarity, is one of the most representative algorithms in this area. This study employs the same method to evaluate the relevance of using local similarity metrics for community detection. A series of local metrics were tested on a set of networks constructed using the Girvan-Newman basic algorithm. The efficacy of these metrics was evaluated by applying the base algorithm to several real networks with varying community sizes, using modularity and NMI. The results indicate that approaches based on local similarity metrics have significant potential for community detection.</description>

      <title>Uncovering multi-order Popularity and Similarity Mechanisms in Link Prediction by graphlet predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction has become a critical problem in network science and has thus attracted increasing research interest. Popularity and similarity are two primary mechanisms in the formation of real networks. However, the roles of popularity and similarity mechanisms in link prediction across various domain networks remain poorly understood. Accordingly, this study used orbit degrees of graphlets to construct multi-order popularity- and similarity-based network link predictors, demonstrating that traditional popularity- and similarity-based indices can be efficiently represented in terms of orbit degrees. Moreover, we designed a supervised learning model that fuses multiple orbit-degree-based features and validated its link prediction performance. We also evaluated the mean absolute Shapley additive explanations of each feature within this model across 550 real-world networks from six domains. We observed that the homophily mechanism, which is a similarity-based feature, dominated social networks, with its win rate being 91\%. Moreover, a different similarity-based feature was prominent in economic, technological, and information networks. Finally, no single feature dominated the biological and transportation networks. The proposed approach improves the accuracy and interpretability of link prediction, thus facilitating the analysis of complex networks.</description>

      <title>How Do Social Bots Participate in Misinformation Spread? A Comprehensive Dataset and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information spreads faster through social media platforms than traditional media, thus becoming an ideal medium to spread misinformation. Meanwhile, automated accounts, known as social bots, contribute more to the misinformation dissemination. In this paper, we explore the interplay between social bots and misinformation on the Sina Weibo platform. We propose a comprehensive and large-scale misinformation dataset, containing 11,393 misinformation and 16,416 unbiased real information with multiple modality information, with 952,955 related users. We propose a scalable weak-surprised method to annotate social bots, obtaining 68,040 social bots and 411,635 genuine accounts. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the largest dataset containing misinformation and social bots. We conduct comprehensive experiments and analysis on this dataset. Results show that social bots play a central role in misinformation dissemination, participating in news discussions to amplify echo chambers, manipulate public sentiment, and reverse public stances.</description>

      <title>Predicting Long-term Dynamics of Complex Networks via Identifying Skeleton in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental for understanding, modeling, and controlling real-world complex systems. Though great efforts have been made to predict the future states of nodes on networks, the capability of capturing long-term dynamics remains largely limited. This is because they overlook the fact that long-term dynamics in complex network are predominantly governed by their inherent low-dimensional manifolds, i.e., skeletons. Therefore, we propose the Dynamics-Invariant Skeleton Neural Net}work (DiskNet), which identifies skeletons of complex networks based on the renormalization group structure in hyperbolic space to preserve both topological and dynamics properties. Specifically, we first condense complex networks with various dynamics into simple skeletons through physics-informed hyperbolic embeddings. Further, we design graph neural ordinary differential equations to capture the condensed dynamics on the skeletons. Finally, we recover the skeleton networks and dynamics to the original ones using a degree-based super-resolution module. Extensive experiments across three representative dynamics as well as five real-world and two synthetic networks demonstrate the superior performances of the proposed DiskNet, which outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 10.18\% in terms of long-term prediction accuracy.

      <title>"EBK" : Leveraging Crowd-Sourced Social Media Data to Quantify How Hyperlocal Gang Affiliations Shape Personal Networks and Violence in Chicago's Contemporary Southside</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent ethnographic research reveals that gang dynamics in Chicago's Southside have evolved with decentralized micro-gang "set" factions and cross-gang interpersonal networks marking the contemporary landscape. However, standard police datasets lack the depth to analyze gang violence with such granularity. To address this, we employed a natural language processing strategy to analyze text from a Chicago gangs message board. By identifying proper nouns, probabilistically linking them to gang sets, and assuming social connections among names mentioned together, we created a social network dataset of 271 individuals across 11 gang sets. Using Louvain community detection, we found that these individuals often connect with gang-affiliated peers from various gang sets that are physically proximal. Hierarchical logistic regression revealed that individuals with ties to homicide victims and central positions in the overall gang network were at increased risk of victimization, regardless of gang affiliation. This research demonstrates that utilizing crowd-sourced information online can enable the study of otherwise inaccessible topics and populations.</description>

      <title>Recent Surge in Public Interest in Transportation: Sentiment Analysis of Baidu Apollo Go Using Weibo Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban mobility and transportation systems have been profoundly transformed by the advancement of autonomous vehicle technologies. Baidu Apollo Go, a pioneer robotaxi service from the Chinese tech giant Baidu, has recently been widely deployed in major cities like Beijing and Wuhan, sparking increased conversation and offering a glimpse into the future of urban mobility.
  This study investigates public attitudes towards Apollo Go across China using Sentiment Analysis with a hybrid BERT model on 36,096 Weibo posts from January to July 2024. The analysis shows that 89.56\% of posts related to Apollo Go are clustered in July. From January to July, public sentiment was mostly positive, but negative comments began to rise after it became a hot topic on July 21.
  Spatial analysis indicates a strong correlation between provinces with high discussion intensity and those where Apollo Go operates. Initially, Hubei and Guangdong dominated online posting volume, but by July, Guangdong, Beijing, and international regions had overtaken Hubei. Attitudes varied significantly among provinces, with Xinjiang and Qinghai showing optimism and Tibet and Gansu expressing concerns about the impact on traditional taxi services.
  Sentiment analysis revealed that positive comments focused on technology applications and personal experiences, while negative comments centered on job displacement and safety concerns. In summary, this study highlights the divergence in public perceptions of autonomous ride-hailing services, providing valuable insights for planners, policymakers, and service providers. The model is published on Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/wsqstar/bert-finetuned-weibo-luobokuaipao and the repository on GitHub at https://github.com/GIStudio/trb2024.</description>

      <title>GeneticPrism: Multifaceted Visualization of Scientific Impact Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of scholarly impact is essential for many real-life decision-making processes in academia, such as research planning, frontier exploration, and award selection. Popular platforms like Google Scholar and Web of Science rely on numerical indicators that are too abstract to convey the context and content of scientific impact, while most existing visualization approaches on mapping science do not consider the presentation of individual scholars' impact evolution using curated self-citation data. This paper builds on our previous work and proposes an integrated pipeline to visualize a scholar's impact evolution from multiple topic facets. A novel 3D prism-shaped visual metaphor is introduced as the overview of a scholar's impact, whilst their scientific evolution on each topic is displayed in a more structured manner. Additional designs by topic chord diagram, streamgraph visualization, and inter-topic flow map, optimized by an elaborate layout algorithm, assist in perceiving the scholar's scientific evolution across topics. A new six-degree-impact glyph metaphor highlights key interdisciplinary works driving the evolution. The proposed visualization methods are evaluated through case studies analyzing the careers of prestigious Turing award laureates and a major visualization venue.</description>

      <title>Bringing Leaders of Network Sub-Groups Closer Together Does Not Facilitate Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consensus formation is a complex process, particularly in networked groups. When individuals are incentivized to dig in and refuse to compromise, leaders may be essential to guiding the group to consensus. Specifically, the relative geodesic position of leaders (which we use as a proxy for ease of communication between leaders) could be important for reaching consensus. Additionally, groups searching for consensus can be confounded by noisy signals in which individuals are given false information about the actions of their fellow group members. We tested the effects of the geodesic distance between leaders (geodesic distance ranging from 1-4) and of noise (noise levels at 0%, 5%, and 10%) by recruiting participants (N=3,456) for a set of experiments (n=216 groups). We find that noise makes groups less likely to reach consensus, and the groups that do reach consensus take longer to find it. We find that leadership changes the behavior of both leaders and followers in important ways (for instance, being labeled a leader makes people more likely to 'go with the flow'). However, we find no evidence that the distance between leaders is a significant factor in the probability of reaching consensus. While other network properties of leaders undoubtedly impact consensus formation, the distance between leaders in network sub-groups appears not to matter.</description>

      <title>Improving and Assessing the Fidelity of Large Language Models Alignment to Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in representing individuals and communities, offering new ways to study complex social dynamics. However, effectively aligning LLMs with specific human groups and systematically assessing the fidelity of the alignment remains a challenge. This paper presents a robust framework for aligning LLMs with online communities via instruction-tuning and comprehensively evaluating alignment across various aspects of language, including authenticity, emotional tone, toxicity, and harm. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to online communities centered on dieting and body image. We administer an eating disorder psychometric test to the aligned LLMs to reveal unhealthy beliefs and successfully differentiate communities with varying levels of eating disorder risk. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs in automated moderation and broader applications in public health and social science research.</description>

      <title>Community-Centric Graph Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph unlearning technology has become increasingly important since the advent of the `right to be forgotten' and the growing concerns about the privacy and security of artificial intelligence. Graph unlearning aims to quickly eliminate the effects of specific data on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, most existing deterministic graph unlearning frameworks follow a balanced partition-submodel training-aggregation paradigm, resulting in a lack of structural information between subgraph neighborhoods and redundant unlearning parameter calculations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Graph Structure Mapping Unlearning paradigm (GSMU) and a novel method based on it named Community-centric Graph Eraser (CGE). CGE maps community subgraphs to nodes, thereby enabling the reconstruction of a node-level unlearning operation within a reduced mapped graph. CGE makes the exponential reduction of both the amount of training data and the number of unlearning parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets and three widely used GNN backbones have verified the high performance and efficiency of our CGE method, highlighting its potential in the field of graph unlearning.</description>

      <title>Regional and spatial dependence of poverty factors in Thailand, and its use into Bayesian hierarchical regression analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poverty is a serious issue that harms humanity progression. The simplest solution is to use one-shirt-size policy to alleviate it. Nevertheless, each region has its unique issues, which require a unique solution to solve them. In the aspect of spatial analysis, neighbor regions can provide useful information to analyze issues of a given region. In this work, we proposed inferred boundaries of regions of Thailand that can explain better the poverty dynamics, instead of the usual government administrative regions. The proposed regions maximize a trade-off between poverty-related features and geographical coherence. We use a spatial analysis together with Moran's cluster algorithms and Bayesian hierarchical regression models, with the potential of assist the implementation of the right policy to alleviate the poverty phenomenon. We found that all variables considered show a positive spatial autocorrelation. The results of analysis illustrate that 1) Northern, Northeastern Thailand, and in less extend Northcentral Thailand are the regions that require more attention in the aspect of poverty issues, 2) Northcentral, Northeastern, Northern and Southern Thailand present dramatically low levels of education, income and amount of savings contrasted with large cities such as Bangkok-Pattaya and Central Thailand, and 3) Bangkok-Pattaya is the only region whose average years of education is above 12 years, which corresponds (approx.) with a complete senior high school.</description>

Abstract: Humans cluster in social groups where they discuss their shared past, problems, and potential solutions; they learn collectively when they repeat activities; they synchronize when they sing or dance together; and they bond through social cohesion. Intuitively, a group is more cohesive if people are closer together in their network and are bonded by multiple connections. This intuition is made precise by the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of the group network, called the \textit{algebraic connectivity}. This measure is key to explaining and predicting the outcomes of said activities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Initially supported by Twitter, hashtags are now used on several social media platforms. Hashtags are helpful for tagging, tracking, and grouping posts on similar topics. In this paper, based on a hashtag stream regarding the hashtag #mybodymychoice, we analyze hashtag drifts over time using concepts from graph analysis and textual data streams using the Girvan-Newman method to uncover hashtag communities in annual snapshots between 2018 and 2022. In addition, we offer insights about some correlated hashtags found in the study. Our approach can be useful for monitoring changes over time in opinions and sentiment patterns about an entity on social media. Even though the hashtag #mybodymychoice was initially coupled with women's rights, abortion, and bodily autonomy, we observe that it suffered drifts during the studied period across topics such as drug legalization, vaccination, political protests, war, and civil rights. The year 2021 was the most significant drifting year, in which the communities detected and their respective sizes suggest that #mybodymychoice had a significant drift to vaccination and Covid-19-related topics.</description>

      <title>Temporal Interaction and its Role in the Evolution of Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the impact of dynamic, time-varying interactions on cooperative behaviour in social dilemmas. Traditional research has focused on deterministic rules governing pairwise interactions, yet the impact of interaction frequency and synchronization in groups on cooperation remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our work introduces two temporal interaction mechanisms to model the stochastic or periodic participation of individuals in public goods games, acknowledging real-life variances due to exogenous temporal factors and geographical time differences. We consider that the interaction state significantly influences both game payoff calculations and the strategy updating process, offering new insights into the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Our results indicate that maximum game participation frequency is suboptimal under a stochastic interaction mechanism. Instead, an intermediate activation probability maximizes cooperation, suggesting a vital balance between interaction frequency and inactivity security. Furthermore, local synchronization of interactions within specific areas is shown to be beneficial, as time differences hinder the spread of cross-structures but promote the formation of dense cooperative clusters with smoother boundaries. We also note that stronger clustering in networks, larger group sizes and lower noise increase cooperation. This research contributes to understanding the role of node-based temporality and probabilistic interactions in social dilemmas, offering insights into fostering cooperation.</description>

Abstract: We extend a recent model of temporal random hyperbolic graphs by allowing connections and disconnections to persist across network snapshots with different probabilities, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. This extension, while conceptually simple, poses analytical challenges involving the Appell $F_1$ series. Despite these challenges, we are able to analyze key properties of the model, which include the distributions of contact and intercontact durations, as well as the expected time-aggregated degree. The incorporation of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ enables more flexible tuning of the average contact and intercontact durations, and of the average time-aggregated degree, providing a finer control for exploring the effect of temporal network dynamics on dynamical processes. Overall, our results provide new insights into the analysis of temporal networks and contribute to a more general representation of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>CogErgLLM: Exploring Large Language Model Systems Design Perspective Using Cognitive Ergonomics</title>

Abstract: Integrating cognitive ergonomics with LLMs is essential for enhancing safety, reliability, and user satisfaction in human-AI interactions. Current LLM design often lacks this integration, leading to systems that may not fully align with human cognitive capabilities and limitations. Insufficient focus on incorporating cognitive science methods exacerbates biases in LLM outputs, while inconsistent application of user-centered design principles results in sub-optimal user experiences. To address these challenges, our position paper explores the critical integration of cognitive ergonomics principles into LLM design, aiming to provide a comprehensive framework and practical guidelines for ethical LLM development. Through our contributions, we seek to advance understanding and practice in integrating cognitive ergonomics into LLM systems, fostering safer, more reliable, and ethically sound human-AI interactions.</description>
