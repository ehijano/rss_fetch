      <title>Studying hard probe dynamics in QGP using effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An effective field theory framework is developed to study the interaction of heavy quarks in strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The latter is treated as a relativistic non-dissipative colorless fluid which can be studied using a derivatively coupled effective field theory based on previous work. Coupling this to heavy quarks provides systematic way to obtain the interaction between the heavy quark and phonons, excitations of the fluid. In particular we calculate the decay width of heavy quark to phonon and phonon-heavy quark scattering in a thermal medium.</description>

      <title>Probing Quadratically Coupled Ultralight Dark Matter with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter may couple quadratically to Standard Model particles. Such quadratic interactions give rise to both coherent and stochastic signals in pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. In this work, we characterize these signals, including the effects of dark matter propagation in a finite-density medium, and assess the sensitivity of current and upcoming PTA observations to their detection. For coherent signals, we find that the sensitivity of current PTA observations competes with and sometimes exceeds that of other probes, such as equivalence principle tests and atomic clocks. For stochastic signals, we find that PTA sensitivities underperform equivalence principle constraints for both existing and upcoming PTA data sets.</description>

      <title>Large Neutrino "Collider"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using current and future large-volume neutrino telescopes as ``Large Neutrino Colliders" (L$\nu$Cs) to explore TeV-scale physics beyond the Standard Model. Cosmic neutrinos with energies above 100 PeV colliding with nucleons in the detector reach center-of-mass energies beyond the 14 TeV limit of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Using recently predicted and measured high-energy and ultra-high-energy neutrino fluxes from IceCube and KM3NeT, we estimate mass-scale sensitivities for representative new physics scenarios at 1--30 km$^3$ L$\nu$Cs. Our results demonstrate that L$\nu$Cs provide a novel avenue to probe multi-TeV particles with sensitivities comparable to, or even surpassing, those of the LHC.</description>

      <title>Decoherence in high energy collisions as renormalization group flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unification of quantum information science and collider physics is opening a new frontier in high-energy experiments, making a systematic understanding of decoherence a critical challenge. We present a framework to systematically compute spin decoherence from final-state radiation by combining soft-collinear effective theory and open quantum system techniques. We demonstrate that the renormalization group (RG) evolution of the final-state spin density matrix constitutes a quantum channel, where the RG flow parameter, rather than time, drives a Markovian loss of quantum information. Our approach incorporates explicit detector resolution parameters, allowing a direct connection between experimental capabilities and the preservation of quantum coherence. Applying this formalism to a fermion pair ($f\bar{f}$) in the high-energy limit with QED-like final-state radiation, we provide the first systematically RG-improved prediction for decoherence as a function of experimental resolution, revealing the underlying decoherence mechanism to be a phase-flip channel. This work establishes an essential theoretical tool for future precision measurements of quantum phenomena in high-energy collisions and offers a new perspective on the interplay between RG flow and decoherence of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Positivity and partial wave unitarity bounds on ALP theories via amplitude methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the complete set of partial wave unitarity bounds on the most general Axion-Like Particle (ALP) effective interactions up to dimension 8 in the limit of large center-of-mass energy. Exploiting a recently developed formalism based on spinor-helicity techniques, we discuss the unitarity bounds for $N \to M$ (with $N, M \geq 2$) scattering amplitudes that can be relevant for ALP searches at colliders or in a variety of rare processes. Moreover, we compute positivity bounds on ALP interactions, emphasizing their complementarity with partial wave unitarity bounds. As a byproduct, we show that our results can be used to infer new positivity constraints in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory.</description>

      <title>No cosmological constraints on dark photon dark matter from resonant conversion: Impact of nonlinear plasma dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit and invalidate all dark photon dark matter constraints from resonant conversion of dark photons into photons (plasmons) in the early universe. These constraints rely on the resonant transfer of a substantial portion of the dark photon energy density into the SM plasma, heating the plasma in the process. We demonstrate that this resonant transfer saturates because of plasma nonlinearities. Dark photon dark matter resonantly converts into $k \simeq 0$ Langmuir waves in the early universe electron-ion plasma. Once the Langmuir-wave energy approaches the thermal energy of the plasma, nonlinear effects driven by the ponderomotive force become significant. In particular, we show using dedicated Particle-in-Cell simulations that large-amplitude $k = 0$ Langmuir waves excite higher-k Langmuir and ion acoustic waves, producing strong spatial variations in density and plasma frequency. These inhomogeneities suppress further resonant conversion, limiting the deposited energy to about the thermal energy of the electrons at the time of conversion, orders of magnitude below observable cosmological thresholds. Consequently, the dark photon dark matter constraints are weaker by factors of $3000$ to $10^7$ across ten orders of magnitude in dark photon mass.</description>

      <title>Light new physics and the $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ lepton dipole moments: prospects at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While electron and muon dipole moments are well-established precision probes of physics beyond the Standard Model, it is notoriously challenging to test realistic New-Physics (NP) scenarios for the $\tau$ lepton. Constructing suitable asymmetries in $e^+e^-\to\tau^+\tau^-$ has emerged as a promising such avenue, providing access to the electric and magnetic dipole moment once a polarized electron beam is available, e.g., with the proposed polarization upgrade of the SuperKEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. However, this interpretation relies on an effective-field-theory (EFT) argument that only applies if the NP scale is large compared to the center-of-mass energy. In this Letter we address the consequences of the asymmetry measurements in the case of light NP, using light spin-0 and spin-1 bosons as test cases, to show how results can again be interpreted as constraints on dipole moments, albeit in a model-dependent manner, and how the decoupling to the EFT limit proceeds in these cases. In particular, we observe that the imaginary parts generated by light new particles can yield non-vanishing asymmetries even without electron polarization, presenting opportunities for NP searches that can be realized already with present data at Belle II.</description>

      <title>Isospin-based EWP-tree Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1998, it was shown that, if flavor SU(3) symmetry [SU(3)$_F$] is assumed in charmless $B \to PP$ decays ($P$ is a light pseudoscalar meson), some reduced matrix elements involving electroweak penguin (EWP) operators are related to those involving tree operators. Similarly, EWP diagrams are related to tree diagrams. These SU(3)$_F$ EWP-tree relations were recently used in global analyses of $B \to PP$ decays. They have also been used over the years in analyses of the $B \to \pi K$ puzzle, even though the $B \to \pi K$ amplitudes are related by isospin symmetry [SU(2)$_I$], and not the full SU(3)$_F$. In this paper, we show that, even if only SU(2)$_I$ is assumed, there are still EWP-tree relations. In $\Delta S=0$ decays, these relations are similar to those of SU(3)$_F$, and can be used to take into account the EWP contributions in the extraction of the CP phase $\alpha$ from $B \to \pi\pi$ decays. In $\Delta S=1$ decays, the SU(2)$_I$ EWP-tree relations are quite different from those of SU(3)$_F$; when these are used to analyze the $B \to \pi K$ puzzle, one now finds a 4-5$\sigma$ discrepancy with the SM, much larger than what was previously found. We argue that, if one analyzes a set of hadronic $B$ decays whose amplitudes are related by isospin, one must use the SU(2)$_I$ EWP-tree relations for that set of decays in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Exploring Non-Standard Neutrino Properties with Argon-Based CEvNS Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) provides a powerful framework for testing the Standard Model (SM) and searching for new physics at low energies. In this work, we examine the prospects for argon-based CEvNS experiments at stopped-pion sources to perform precision measurements of weak interactions and probe non-standard neutrino properties. Our study focused on the CENNS-10 and CENNS-750 detectors at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Coherent Captain Mills (CCM) detector at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the proposed PIP2-BD detector at Fermilabs Facility for Dark Matter Discovery (F2D2). Using realistic neutrino fluxes and detector configurations corresponding to these facilities, we evaluate event rates and sensitivities to a range of observables. Within the SM, argon-based CEvNS detectors enable precision tests of electroweak parameters, including the weak mixing angle, at momentum transfers well below the electroweak scale. We also investigate the sensitivity of these experiments to neutrino electromagnetic properties, such as the magnetic moment and effective charge radius, as well as to possible non-standard neutrino interactions with quarks. Together, these studies highlight the potential of argon-based CEvNS experiments as a clean and versatile platform for precision exploration of non-standard neutrino properties.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of the color charge and of the confining electric part of QCD. Observation of this symmetry in the vacuum upon truncation of the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator implies that the hadron mass in the light quark sector is not due to the quark condensate of the vacuum and that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are not directly related. Observation of this symmetry above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover suggests that QCD is still in the confining regime with chirally symmetric quarks bound into the color-singlets by the confining electric field. This regime of QCD was called a stringy fluid. At a temperature T_d that is essentially above T_ch the chiral spin symmetry smoothly disappears suggesting that the confining electric field gets screened and one observes a very smooth crossover to the quark-gluon plasma. The three-regimes picture has been further substantiated by the analysis of the N_c scaling of the energy density, the pressure and the entropy density. In the hadron gas they scale as N_c^0, in the stringy fluid as N_c^1 and in the quark-gluon plasma as N_c^2. We have analyzed the fluctuations of conserved charges that scale as N_c^1 above T_ch thus indicating a transition from the hadron gas to the stringy fluid. When N_c gets sufficiently large the three-regimes picture transforms into the three-phases phase diagram. Finally we discuss a confining and chirally symmetric model in 3+1 dimensions. This model demonstrates the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime and a delocalization of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems that become very large at T &gt; T_ch. Consequently the stringy fluid matter is a very dense highly collective system of the overlapping very large color-singlet quark-antiquark "mesons" with a very small mean free path.</description>

      <title>The Good Qualities of the Weak Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a topological susceptibility in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model motivates the existence of a good quality weak axion $a_W$, associated with the spontaneous breaking of $B\!+\!L$. Its anomalous couplings and tiny mass, generated from electroweak instantons, render $a_W$ photophobic. We find that the strongest bound on the associated decay constant, $f_W$, stems from a loop-induced coupling to electrons, leading to $f_W \gtrsim 1000$ TeV from stellar cooling. Spontaneous breaking of the abelian ${B\!+\!L}$ symmetry induces proton decay via higher dimensional operators controlled by a new physics scale, $\Lambda$. Existing Super-Kamiokande limits on these decay channels constrain the new physics scale to be $\Lambda \gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV. The characteristic channel $p\to e^+ a_W$ and other possible operators mediating interactions with the Standard Model fields yield signals which are not detectable within the allowed parameter space. Future proton decay searches at the next-generation of neutrino experiments offer the most promising avenues to test the good qualities of the weak axion paradigm.</description>

      <title>Production cross sections of charm-beauty mesons in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we calculate the production cross sections of the 1S and 1P states of the $B_{c}$ meson for proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus colliding beam experiments at LHC and RHIC. We provide estimates for the Au nucleus at RHIC energies and for the Pb and Xe nuclei at LHC energies. Previous estimates of these cross sections have ignored quark anti-quark annihilation diagrams and are confined to S states for Pb and Au nuclei. The cross sections of the P states are also equally important as these states lie below the BD threshold and cascade into $B_{c}$ ground states with 100\% probability. In addition to calculating the $p_{T}$, rapidity, and pseudo-rapidity distributions of the cross sections, we also determine the nuclear modification factors $R_{pA}$ and $R_{AA}$ for $A=\textrm{Pb}$, $\textrm{Xe}$, and $\textrm{Au}$. The results provide a baseline for the upcoming experimental studies of $B_{c}$ mesons in pp, pA, and AA collisions in RUN III of LHC and could help develop experimental strategies for identification of hitherto undiscovered states of the $B_{c}$ meson.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Renormalization with Gradient Flow for Baryon Quasi-Distribution Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a factorization relation between baryon quasi-distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) defined with gradient flow and their counterparts renormalized in the $\overline{MS}\,$ scheme. Working beyond the small flow-time limit, we perform a complete one-loop calculation that yields the full matching kernel and the associated Wilson-line linear divergence for flowed quasi-DAs. Building on this relation, we formulate a hybrid renormalization scheme that combines ratio scheme with gradient-flow matching. The framework enables a systematic connection between lattice QCD matrix elements and continuum baryon quasi-DAs, with reduced renormalization uncertainties and clear guidance for practical lattice analyses.</description>

      <title>One loop corrections to the trilinear self coupling of the Higgs boson in the standard model with inclusion of singlet vector-like top quark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete one loop corrections to the trilinear self coupling of the Higgs boson is firstly evaluated in the Standard Model (SM) by employing the zero momentum approximation. Numerical results of the trilinear self coupling and its modifier $\kappa_{\lambda}$ are obtained. Then we extend the SM by including a singlet vector-like top partner and assume that the top partner only mixes with the top quark, combining with the latest value of the Higgs boson trilinear self coupling modifier $\kappa_{\lambda}$ reported by ATLAS Collaboration, the effects of the mass of the top partner and the mixing parameter on the modifier $\kappa_{\lambda}$ are systematically analyzed. Results indicate that the upper bound of the singlet top partner is about $2800$\,GeV.</description>

      <title>ALP couplings to muons and electrons: a comprehensive analysis of supernova bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenology of axion-like particles (ALPs) produced in core-collapse supernovae (ccSNe) through interactions with electrons and muons, both of which have a non-negligible abundance in the SN plasma. We identify and calculate six significant ALP-production channels, two of which are loop-level processes involving photons. We then examine several observational constraints on the ALP-electron and ALP-muon parameter spaces. Those include the bounds on anomalous cooling, energy deposition, decay into photons, diffuse gamma rays, and the 511 keV line. Our results provide updated and robust constraints on ALP couplings to electrons and muons from an improved treatment of production and absorption processes. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties of the results by using three state-of-the-art supernova models based on two independent simulation codes, finding that constraints vary by factors of O(2-10).</description>

      <title>Kinematic power corrections for TMD factorization theorem of semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the complete set of kinematic power corrections (KPCs) to the leading power (LP) term of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization theorem for semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) with a polarized target. This formulation restores the contributions of twist-two TMD distributions to all structure functions, including those that vanish at leading power, such as contributions of longitudinal photons. The resulting expressions are explicitly gauge- and frame-invariant, and inherit all key features of the standard TMD factorization framework, including the coefficient functions and the evolution equations. Numerical estimations show that KPCs contribute only a few percent at $Q\sim10$GeV, but can reach several tens of percents when $Q\sim 2$GeV. Consequently, accounting for kinematic power corrections can be vital for an accurate theoretical description of current SIDIS measurements.</description>

      <title>High-energy $\eta^{(\prime)}\pi$ photoproduction and the nature of exotic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of hybrid mesons in photoproduction experiments can provide essential insight into the inner workings of quantum chromodynamics in the strong coupling regime. In particular, the study of final $\eta^{(\prime)}\pi$ states is of great interest due to the presence of the lowest lying hybrid candidate with manifestly exotic quantum numbers, the $\pi_1(1600)$. In this work, a double-vector exchange model with Reggeized $\rho$ and $\omega$ trajectories is developed to describe the photoproduction of $\eta^{(\prime)}\pi$ in the high-mass region. Results are presented for the differential cross sections and forward-backward asymmetries in the energy region of interest to the GlueX experiment. The model contains no free parameters, and reproduces the magnitude and $t$-dependence of existing CLAS data at $E_\gamma=5$\gev. The model predicts a stronger asymmetry in the $\eta^\prime \pi$ channel than in the $\eta \pi$ channel, consistent with what has previously been observed in pion beam experiments. This suggests that the sizeable production of exotic odd waves in $\eta'\pi$ is not necessarily related to the presence of gluon-rich environments. Confirmation of these predicted asymmetries from forthcoming GlueX data would enable further predictions of the low-energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $J/\Psi$ Production and Gluon GPDs Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study of exclusive photoproduction of $J/\Psi$ mesons was carried out in a factorization approach. Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for gluons, which play an important role here, are constructed using the double distribution representation. The obtained cross sections of $J/\Psi$ production in a wide energy range are in good agreement with the experiment. The spin asymmetries in the $J/\Psi$ production were estimated. These calculations were extended to the of $J/\Psi$ mesons production in ultraperipherical $pp$ collisions. It was shown a good agreement of our results with the LHCb data. Predictions have been made for the NICA energy range. The model results can be used to study the gluon GPDs in future colliders.</description>

      <title>An insight into the rare $Z\rightarrow b \bar{b}\gamma$ at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies at the $Z$-pole have played an important role in developing our understanding of the Standard Model (SM). Continuing the explorations in this regime, we consider the possibility of the production of two $b$-quarks and a photon in proton-proton collisions at the HL-LHC. While such a final state is possible in the SM by means of the process $Z\rightarrow b\bar b$ decay with a radiated photon, the focus is on extracting its possible origins due to beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. The signal topology can be broadly identified as $Z\rightarrow \Phi\gamma\rightarrow b\bar b\gamma$, where $ \Phi$ can either be a spin-0 or spin-2 state with a mass less than that of the $Z$ boson.The analysis is characterised by two relatively low $p_T$ jets that are required to be $b$-tagged jets and an isolated photon. The study provides a quantitative framework for their identification and highlights the potential challenges associated with this final state. A range of machine learning architectures is employed to demonstrate the stability and reliability of the discriminating variables. This study highlights the importance of the low-$p_T$ objects in searches at the HL-LHC, hence the need to pay special attention to their identification and efficiencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gluon distribution in a proton at very low $x$, both integrated and transverse momentum dependent, using the Laplace transform technique. By accounting for leading and main next-to-leading contributions, we derive compact analytical expressions for the gluon densities valid in the asymptotic limit $x \to 0$. Our results closely match those from other analytical and numerical approaches, with the main advantage being the simplicity of the expressions, which capture the essential features of more complex calculations.</description>

Abstract: We compute the two-loop renormalisation group equation for the effective Higgs to gluon coupling in Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Concretely, we present the contributions generated by the operators belonging to class 3 and 7 in the Warsaw basis, completing the two-loop renormalization program of the Higgs-gluon coupling proportional to the top Yukawa coupling for potentially tree-level generated operators. We investigate the phenomenological impact of the contributions in fits to Higgs data both in a bottom-up approach and a top-down approach in terms of UV models with vector-like quarks.</description>

      <title>The exclusive photoproduction of $\chi_{c}\gamma$ pairs in the small-$x$ kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we analyze the exclusive photoproduction of the $\chi_{c}\gamma$ pairs. We focus on the small-$x$ kinematics and evaluate the cross-sections in the Color Glass Condensate framework. We found that in the leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_{s}$, this process is sensitive only to the forward color dipole scattering amplitude. We estimated numerically the cross-sections for different polarizations of $\chi_{c}$ mesons in the kinematics of the ultraperipheral collisions at LHC and the future Electron Ion Collider. We also analyzed the role of this process as a potential background to exclusive $\chi_{c}$ photoproduction, which has been recently suggested as an alternative channel for studies of odderons. According to our estimates, the cross-section of $\chi_{c}\gamma$ with undetected photons is comparable to that of odderons at small momentum transfer $|t|\lesssim1$ GeV$^{2}$, but becomes less relevant at larger $|t|$. We also found that a dominant background to odderon-mediated production of $\chi_{c}$ comes from the radiative decays of $\psi(2S)$ mesons, which potentially can present a challenge for odderon studies via $\chi_{c}$ photoproduction.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Electric Dipole Moments in Paramagnetic Molecules through Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric dipole moment (EDM) measurements using paramagnetic molecules have significantly advanced over the last decade. Traditionally, these experiments have been analyzed in terms of the electron EDM. However, paramagnetic molecules are also sensitive to hadronic sources of charge-parity (CP) violation, highlighting the need for a new framework to interpret the experimental results. In this Letter, we introduce an effective field theory framework to relate molecular EDMs to the EDMs of neutrons and protons. We identify the dominant contributions through power counting and pinpoint the necessary nuclear matrix elements. As a practical application, we employ the nuclear shell model to calculate these nuclear matrix elements for the polar molecule BaF. Finally, we estimate the limits on the nucleon EDMs set by current molecular EDM experiments.</description>

      <title>Invisible neutron decay and light BSM particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) invisible neutron
  decay arises from $d=12$ operators. Adding new, light particles to
  the field content of the SM, such as right-handed neutrinos, allows
  to construct operators for invisible neutron decay at much lower
  dimensions. Observing invisible neutron decay, if nucleon decays
  with charged leptons remain absent, would therefore point towards the
  existence of new neutral degrees of freedom. Here, we discuss four
  cases: (i) Adding right-handed neutrinos to the SM; (ii) a
  right-handed neutrino and an axion-like particle; (iii) a
  right-handed neutrino and a (nearly) massless singlet scalar; and
  (iv) a right-handed neutrino and a light $Z'$. We give the general
  tree-level decomposition for the resulting $d=(7-9)$ operators for
  invisible neutron decay. We also briefly discuss LHC searches
  related to the exotic states found in these UV completions.</description>

      <title>Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV. Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For square or triangular loops with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable photonic quantum extreme learning machines for fast collider-data selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study continuous-variable photonic quantum extreme learning machines as fast, low-overhead front-ends for collider data processing. Data is encoded in photonic modes through quadrature displacements and propagated through a fixed-time Gaussian quantum substrate. The final readout occurs through Gaussian-compatible measurements to produce a high-dimensional random feature map. Only a linear classifier is trained, using a single linear solve, so retraining is fast, and the optical path and detector response set the analytical and inference latency. We evaluate this architecture on two representative classification tasks, top-jet tagging and Higgs-boson identification, with parameter-matched multi-layer perceptron (MLP) baselines. Using standard public datasets and identical train, validation, and test splits, the photonic Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) outperforms an MLP with two hidden units for all considered training sizes, and matches or exceeds an MLP with ten hidden units at large sample sizes, while training only the linear readout. These results indicate that Gaussian photonic extreme-learning machines can provide compact and expressive random features at fixed latency. The combination of deterministic timing, rapid retraining, low optical power, and room temperature operation makes photonic QELMs a credible building block for online data selection and even first-stage trigger integration at future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Damping of Cosmological Shear: A New Prediction from Loop Quantum Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of the Bianchi I universe in modified loop quantum cosmology (Model I, or mLQC-I), uncovering a robust mechanism for isotropization. As in the standard LQC, the classical singularities are resolved by quantum bounce. Remarkably, mLQC-I exhibits a distinctive feature: following the bounce, the shear is dynamically suppressed and decays rapidly to zero within the deep quantum regime. This occurs independently of the collapsing matter fields, leading to a natural quantum isotropization. Consequently, the three spatial directions expand rapidly to macroscopic scales, producing a homogeneous and isotropic universe directly from the quantum epoch without fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that mLQC-I not only resolves singularities but also provides a more effective pathway for suppressing anisotropies than other models, thereby reinforcing its viability as a description of the early universe.</description>

      <title>FeynCraft: A Game of Feynman Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FeynCraft is a browser-based game that is designed to teach players the particle interactions of the Standard Model of particle physics, and how to link these interactions together to produce valid Feynman diagrams. It is primarily targeted at undergraduates and lecturers in introductory courses in particle physics, but we anticipate that it should also be useful for school pupils and teachers studying the basics of particle physics, and perhaps also current researchers. Users may draw particle lines and link them together to form vertices and complete diagrams, and FeynCraft determines invalid vertices using a sequence of simple rules, showing users which vertices are invalid and why. Diagrams may be drawn that involve both fundamental Standard Model particles and hadrons (where hadrons are represented by their constituent quark content). Users can also be presented with a process for which they must draw valid Feynman diagrams -- FeynCraft is able to generate such 'problems' at random, but there is also the facility to create, share, import and solve curated sets of problems. Alternatively, one is able to specify the process, and ask FeynCraft itself to generate the Feynman diagrams. Finally, we include several overlay options that give more information on a Feynman diagram (e.g. QCD colour flow, interaction strengths), and the option to export a drawn diagram as LaTeX code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework in Feynman-parameter space to determine constraints on the sequential discontinuities of Feynman integrals. Our method is based on tracking the deformation of the integration contour as external kinematics are analytically continued. This procedure imposes powerful constraints on the analytic structure of Feynman integrals, providing crucial inputs for their bootstrap. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by applying it to integrals in dimensional regularization, with higher propagator powers, and to examples with non-uniform transcendental weight. The method is illustrated with several one- and two-loop calculations.</description>

      <title>Effects of Subnucleonic Fluctuations on the Longitudinal Dynamics of Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well understood that subnuclear fluctuations in the initial state of heavy-ion collisions have an important impact on the creation of long-range correlations in the transverse plane. This is also true for the creation of particle correlations along the beam direction, which can be measured in particle detectors, e.g. through longitudinal decorrelation observables. In this work, we study the emergence of long-range rapidity structures in Pb+Pb collisions using a hybrid model connecting the 3D resolved {\Dipper} initial state model to a (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamics framework CLVisc. We include different sources of fluctuations at the (sub-)nucleon level and present the effects of their inclusion on the longitudinal structure of relevant observables, focusing in this proceedings paper on charged hadron multiplicities, baryon stopping, directed flow and flow decorrelation. We find remarkable agreement to the experimental data regarding directed flow and the rapidity resolved charge particle multiplicity.</description>

Abstract: The use of effective field theory offers a systematic way to improve calculations of nuclear reactions and the properties of atomic nuclei. Its successes have led to the widespread belief that the predictions of this approach are model independent. We explain why this is definitely not the case.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Schwinger Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a stochastic generalisation of the Schwinger effect, extending pair production to statistically fluctuating gauge-field backgrounds. Our approach captures realistic field configurations that are transient, inhomogeneous, and stochastic, as commonly encountered in cosmological and high-energy astrophysical settings. Using the effective action formalism, we compute the vacuum decay rate and number density of charged particles, obtaining closed-form analytical expressions for both scalar and fermionic cases. To isolate the essential physics, the analysis is performed in flat spacetime and at zero temperature, providing a controlled setting in which curvature and thermal effects can be neglected. As a proof of concept, we present representative phenomenological examples relevant to astrophysical plasmas and early-Universe-motivated scenarios.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Asymptotic Safety: A Review of Solutions and Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety offers a conservative and predictive framework for quantum gravity, based on the existence of a renormalization group fixed point that ensures ultraviolet completeness without introducing new degrees of freedom. Black holes provide a natural arena in which to explore the implications of this scenario, as they probe the strongest gravitational fields and highlight the shortcomings of classical general relativity. In recent years, a variety of quantum-corrected black-hole solutions have been constructed within the Asymptotic Safety approach, either by renormalization-group improvement of classical metrics or through effective actions inspired by the flow of couplings. This review summarizes the current status of these developments. We discuss the structure and properties of the proposed solutions, their thermodynamics and evaporation, and their dynamical aspects such as quasinormal modes and shadows.</description>

      <title>On the internal inconsistency of the Wess-Zumino model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the internal inconsistency of the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model. Our proof is based on three assumptions. The first assumption is that in the full theory the structure of counter temcs coincides with the structure of the counter terms in the perturbation theory. The second assumption is the positivity of norm states - no ghosts in the spectrum of the model. The third assumption is that the canonical commutation relations among generalized coordinates and momenta are valid in renormalized theory. The obtained results mean that there are negative norm states in the spectrum of the WZ model.</description>

      <title>Magnetic D-brane solitons: skyrmion strings ending on a N\'eel wall in chiral magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions extended to three dimensions form string-like objects whose fundamental role remains largely unexplored. We show that skyrmion strings can terminate on a N\'eel-type domain wall (DW), realizing a magnetic analogue of a Dirichlet(D)-brane soliton. While an isolated N\'eel DW tends to rotate into a Bloch DW, the N\'eel DW is stabilized when a skyrmion string ends on it. Unlike field-theory D-branes, the Bloch-type DMI produces linear rather than logarithmic DW bending, and the strings retain finite width far from the DW, circumventing singular behavior. Furthermore, the repulsive interaction between strings allows periodic multi-junction solutions, yielding a square lattice of alternating strings and local DW deformations. These results establish magnetic skyrmion strings as fundamental strings that can end on a D-brane.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical uncertainties challenge 21-cm forecasts: A primordial black hole case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe's thermal history and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.</description>

      <title>Non-Minimally Coupled Quintessence in Light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a model of quintessence governed by an exponential potential and non-minimally coupled to gravity, in light of recent datasets, including cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernovae distance moduli observations. Mainly focusing on the Palatini formulation of gravity, a phase space analysis reveals the existence of a late-time stable de Sitter attractor as long as the non-minimal coupling constant is negative, regardless of the value of the slope of the exponential. Fitting to CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we find strong evidence for our model over $\Lambda$CDM, with a Bayes factor $\log B = 5.52$. Furthermore, the data seem to prefer dynamical dark energy at $&gt;3\sigma$ C.L. and a phantom crossing in the barotropic parameter of dark energy at $2-3\sigma$ C.L.. We find that the scalar field dynamics in the Palatini formalism provides marginally better agreement to the data compared to the metric formalism.</description>

      <title>Phantom Mirage from Axion Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measures have recently provided hints that the dark energy is not only dynamical but apparently evolves from normal to phantom dark energy between redshifts $0&lt;z&lt;1$. A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$ and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage. We show that there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve the SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from $z\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts. With axions, raising the optical depth to reionization to $\tau \approx 0.1$ works essentially as well as $w_0-w_a$ phantom dark energy for all but the lowE CMB data, with a remaining $\Delta\chi^2\sim -16$ compared with $\Lambda$CDM, whereas a small spatial curvature of $\Omega_K \sim 0.003$ can largely relax the full SN-BAO-CMB tension with a total $\Delta\chi^2 \sim -12$.</description>

      <title>Flavor solitons in dense neutrino gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a dense neutrino gas in the "fast-flavor limit" (vanishing neutrino masses). For the first time, we identify exact solutions of the nonlinear wave equation in the form of solitons. They can propagate with both sub- or superluminal speed, the latter not violating causality. The soliton with infinite speed is a homogeneous solution and coincides with the usual fast-flavor pendulum except that it swings only once instead of being periodic. The subluminal soliton in the static limit corresponds to a one-swing "spatial pendulum". A necessary condition for such solutions to exist is a ``crossed'' neutrino angle distribution. Based on the Nyquist criterion, we derive a new sufficient condition without solving the dispersion relation. The solitons are very fragile: they are as unstable as the homogeneous neutrino gas alone. Moreover, in the presence of matter, only the solution survives that is homogeneous in a frame comoving with the matter current. Generally, the matter effect cannot be eliminated by transformations in flavor space, but instead has a real physical impact.</description>

      <title>Angular integrals with three denominators via IBP, mass reduction, dimensional shift, and differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18177v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angular integrals arise in a wide range of perturbative quantum field theory calculations. In this work we investigate angular integrals with three denominators in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions. We derive integration-by-parts relations for this class of integrals, leading to explicit recursion relations and a reduction to a small set of master integrals. Using a differential equation approach we establish results up to order $\varepsilon$ for general integer exponents and masses. Here, reduction identities for the number of masses, known results for two-denominator integrals, and a general dimensional-shift identity for angular integrals considerably reduce the required amount of work. For the first time we find for angular integrals a term contributing proportional to a Euclidean Gram determinant in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. This coefficient is expressed as a sum of Clausen functions with intriguing connections to Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry. The results of this manuscript are applicable to phase-space calculations with multiple observed final-state particles.</description>

      <title>Ultralight axion or axion-like particle dark matter and 21-cm absorption signals in new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hypothetical particle known as the axion holds the potential to resolve both the cosmic dark matter riddle and particle physics' long-standing, strong CP dilemma. An unusually strong 21-cm absorption feature associated with the initial star formation era, i.e., the dark ages, may be due to ultralight axion dark matter ($\sim$10$^{-22}$ eV) at this time. The radio wave observation's 21-cm absorption signal can be explained as either anomalous baryon cooling or anomalous cosmic microwave background photon heating. Shortly after the axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) thermalize among themselves and form a Bose--Einstein condensate, the cold dark matter ALPs make thermal contact with baryons, cooling them. ALPs are thought to be the source of some new evidence for dark matter, as the baryon temperature at cosmic dawn was lower than predicted based on presumptions. The detection of baryon acoustic oscillations is found to be consistent with baryon cooling by dark matter ALPs. Simultaneously, under the influence of the primordial black hole and/or intergalactic magnetic fields, the dark radiation composed of ALPs can resonantly transform into photons, significantly heating up the radiation in the frequency range relevant to the 21-cm tests. When examining the 21-cm cosmology at redshifts $z$ between 200 and 20, we see that, when taking into account both heating and cooling options at the same time, heating eliminated the theoretical excess number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, from the cooling effect.</description>

Abstract: We study dijet production in pA collisions at forward rapidities at next-to-eikonal accuracy. We restrict ourselves to the next-to-eikonal corrections that are induced by the quark background field of the target. We consider all possible channels, compute scattering amplitudes both in general kinematics and in the back-to-back limit. By using these results, we compute the back-to-back production cross section and obtain a factorized expression with a quark TMD times associated hard factor for each channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global QCD analysis of unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the proton, including new $W +$\,charm production data from $pp$ collisions at the LHC and semi-inclusive pion and kaon production data in lepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering, both of which have been suggested for constraining the strange quark PDF. Compared with a baseline global fit that does not include these datasets, the new analysis reduces the uncertainty on the strange quark distribution over the range $0.01 &lt; x &lt; 0.3$, and provides a consistent description of processes sensitive to strangeness in the proton. Including the new datasets, the ratio of strange to nonstrange sea quark distributions is $R_s = (s+\bar s)/(\bar u+\bar d) = \{0.72^{+0.52}_{-0.34},\, 0.46^{+0.30}_{-0.20},\, 0.32^{+0.23}_{-0.15}\}$ for $x = \{ 0.01, 0.04, 0.1 \}$ at $Q^2 = 4$~GeV$^2$. The data place more stringent constraints on the strange asymmetry $s-\bar s$, which is found to be consistent with zero in this range.</description>

      <title>Prospects of detecting cosmic ray up-scattered dark matter with DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection of sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles in direct detection experiments is inherently difficult, as their low kinetic energies in the galactic halo are insufficient to produce observable recoils of the heavy nuclei in the detectors. On the other hand, whenever DM particles interact with nucleons, they can be accelerated by scattering with galactic cosmic rays. These cosmic-ray-boosted DM particles can then interact not only through coherent elastic scattering with nuclei, but also through scattering with individual nucleons in the detectors and produce outgoing particles at MeV to GeV kinetic energies. The resulting signal spectrum overlaps with the detection capabilities of modern neutrino experiments. One future experiment is the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Sanford Underground Research Facility. Our study shows that DUNE has a unique ability to search for cosmic-ray boosted DM with sensitivity comparable to dedicated direct detection experiments in the case of spin-independent interactions. Importantly, DUNE's sensitivity reaches similar values of DM-nucleon cross sections also in the case of spin-dependent interactions, offering a key advantage over traditional direct detection experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We showcase the application of neural importance sampling for the evaluation of NNLO QCD scattering cross sections. We consider Normalizing Flows in the form of discrete Coupling Layers and time continuous flows for the integration of the various cross-section contributions when using the sector-improved residue subtraction scheme. We thereby consider the stratification of the integrands into their positive and negative contributions, and separately optimize the phase-space sampler. We exemplify the novel methods for the case of gluonic top-quark pair production at the LHC at NNLO QCD accuracy. We find significant gains with respect to the current default methods used in STRIPPER in terms of reduced cross-section variances and increased unweighting efficiencies. In turn, the computational costs for evaluations of the integrand needed to achieve a certain statistical uncertainty for the cross section can be reduced by a factor 8.</description>

      <title>Probing the sensitivity of anisotropic flow coefficients to the initial nuclear structure in pO and OO collisions at the LHC</title>

Abstract: RHIC and LHC have injected $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei in their accelerator complexes with a focus on investigating collectivity and the origin of quark-gluon plasma signatures in small collision systems. The $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei are known to possess clusters of $\alpha$-particles ($^{4}\rm He$) inside the nucleus. This paper attempts to study the clustered-nuclear-geometry dependence of anisotropic flow coefficients such as elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), which are sensitive to the nuclear geometry of colliding nuclei. The study is performed in pO and OO collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=9.61$~TeV and 7~TeV respectively, employing a hybrid model encompassing IP-Glasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD. The results of the clustered nuclear geometry are compared with those of the Woods\,--\,Saxon nuclear profile. Both initial and final state anisotropies are estimated. This study is thus one of its first kind, where the study of anisotropic flow coefficients for pO and OO collisions is presented using a hybrid hydrodynamics model. While the effect of $\alpha$-clustering in pO is found to be small, it is significant for each observable studied in OO collisions. It is also observed that the magnitude of this effect has a noteworthy dependence on the size of the \textsuperscript{4}He.</description>

      <title>Momentum fraction and hard scale dependence of double parton scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective cross section of double parton scattering in high-energy hadron collisions has been measured in proton--proton collisions, with significant variation among final-state observables, contrary to the idea of a universal value. Building upon our previous work, we incorporate the dependence on both the parton longitudinal momentum fraction $x$ and the process energy hard scale $\mu$ into the transverse part of the double parton distributions, using a Gaussian profile. Employing the experimental data from the LHC and Tevatron experiments (covering different processes, kinematic configurations, and center--of--mass energies), we perform a global fit of the model, extracting the parameters that describe the proton structure. With this result, it becomes possible to calculate the effective cross section for others observables, and we provide predictions for future measurements at the LHC.</description>

      <title>The impact of $\gamma N$ and $\gamma^* N$ interactions on our understanding of nucleon excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review recent progress in our understanding of the nucleon excitation spectrum. Thanks to dedicated efforts at facilities such as ELSA, MAMI and Jefferson Lab, several new nucleon resonances have been discovered, and evidence for previously elusive states has been significantly improved. Numerous decay channels have been observed for the first time, and resonance properties are being extracted from these data by several groups through coupled-channel analyses of varying complexity. Electroproduction experiments have provided further insights into the internal structure of light baryon resonances -- for example, the long-debated Roper resonance $N(1440)$ is observed as a three-quark state with a significant meson-cloud component.While the non-relativistic quark model remains a valuable tool for organizing the spectrum of nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances, a variety of theoretical frameworks have emerged to offer deeper understanding, including phenomenological quark models, holographic QCD, functional methods, effective field theories, and lattice QCD. We examine the interplay between these approaches, highlight their respective strengths and explore how they complement each other in shaping our knowledge of light baryon resonances. We address several open questions in baryon spectroscopy, including the nature of the enigmatic $\Lambda(1405)$, ongoing searches for exotic states such as hybrid baryons and pentaquarks, and the dichotomy between microscopic descriptions of baryons in terms of quarks and gluons versus effective hadronic descriptions based on meson-baryon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. By providing an analytical expression, even if it is mathematically redundant, we believe that $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ will be studied across a broader range of WI models in the future. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.</description>

Abstract: The future circular $e^+e^-$ collider (FCC-ee or CEPC) will provide unprecedented sensitivity to indirect new physics signals emerging as small deviations from the Standard Model predictions in electroweak precision tests. Assuming new physics scenarios containing a dark matter candidate and a $t$-channel mediator, we analyse the synergy and interplay of future Tera-$Z$ factories and non-collider tests conducted through direct and indirect searches of dark matter. Our results highlight the excellent prospect for a Tera-$Z$ run to indirectly probe the presence and nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>$\psi(2S)$ production in jets using NRQCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on recent data from LHCb, we study $\psi(2S)$ production in jets using non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) in conjunction with the Fragmenting Jet Function (FJF) and Gluon Fragmentation Improved Pythia (GFIP) formalisms. Similar to previous studies of $J/\psi$ production in jets, our results show that these formalisms offer a much better description of data than the default Pythia+NRQCD prediction. We compare and contrast the predictions from the FJF formalism and the GFIP approach. In addition, our results show that the distribution of $\psi(2S)$ in jets is an excellent discriminator to test different predictions for the $\psi(2S)$ LDMEs from various extractions. We find a large disparity between the predictions from three different collaborations, showing that a more precise extraction of the $\psi(2S)$ LDMEs may be necessary.</description>

      <title>Polarization analysis in $e^+e^-\rightarrow J/\psi\rightarrow$ baryon-antibaryon pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive polarization analysis for the process $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow J/\psi \rightarrow$ baryon-antibaryon pairs~$B_{1}\bar{B}_{2}$. All possible helicity amplitudes for $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow J/\psi$ and $J/\psi \rightarrow B_{1} \bar{B}_{2}$ are provided, along with their transformation properties under parity and $CP$ operations. Taking full account of beam polarization, we analyze the polarization of the $J/\psi$ produced in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation and show that all eight independent polarization components can be nonzero. By introducing a polarization transfer matrix, we propose a novel method to compute the polarization transfer in the decay $J/\psi \rightarrow B_{1} \bar{B}_{2}$. Considering both hadronic and radiative baryon decay models, we derive the joint angular distribution of the final-state particles. Focusing on the process $J/\psi \rightarrow \Lambda \bar{\Sigma}^{0}$, we provide statistical uncertainty estimates for probing $CP$ violation in associated production of different baryons. This work establishes a complete framework for studying the parity and $CP$ violations present in baryon productions and decays within the helicity formalism.</description>

      <title>Triple-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possible existence of triple-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquark states in the off-shell coupled-channel formalism. The open-charm meson-baryon $\bar{D}_s\Omega_c$, $\bar{D}_s\Omega_c^*$, $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c$, and $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c^*$ channels are considered, together with the hidden-charm $J/\psi\Omega$ channel. The two-body kernel Feynman amplitudes are constructed from an effective Lagrangian based on hidden local symmetry and heavy-quark spin symmetry. The coupled Blankenbecler-Sugar equation is solved in the partial-wave helicity basis. We observe two triple-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquark states: $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4787)$ and $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4841)$, both with $J^P=1/2^-$. The $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4787)$ couples dominantly to the $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c$ and $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c^*$ channels, while the $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4841)$ couples almost exclusively to the $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c^*$ channel. The total transition cross sections of $\bar{D}_s^{(\ast)}\Omega_c^{(\ast)}\to J/\psi\,\Omega$ indicate that the $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4787)$ is clearly visible in the $J/\psi\,\Omega$ invariant mass spectrum, whereas the $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4841)$ is obscured by cusp structures and background contributions.</description>

      <title>Could the 650 GeV Excess be a Pseudoscalar of a 3-Higgs Doublet Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the interpretation of a 650 GeV excess observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the CMS Collaboration in terms of the production of a CP-odd (or pseudoscalar) Higgs boson A, with mass around 650 GeV, decaying into the Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs state $h_{125}$ (in turn decaying into $\gamma\gamma$) and a Z boson (in turn decaying into $b\bar b$), within a 3-Higgs Doublet Model (3HDM) featuring two active and one inert doublet, known as the I(1+2)HDM. This theoretical structure features a spectrum with both the SM-like Higgs boson (with a 125 GeV mass) and a lighter CP-even (or scalar) Higgs state with mass around 95 GeV, $h_{95}$, which is present in this scenario for the purpose of simultaneously explaining anomalies seen in the $b\bar b$, $\gamma\gamma$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ final states in searches for additional light Higgs states at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider and LHC itself. It should be noted that, in the I(1+2)HDM, the inert sector presents loop-induced enhancements to the $h_{95} \to \gamma\gamma$ width via inert charged Higgs states, providing a viable mechanism to explain, in particular, the observed (and most significant) di-photon excess at 95 GeV. Taking into account both experimental and theoretical constraints, our results can not only explain the aforementioned anomalies (possibly, aside from the $\tau^+\tau^-$, which is the most marginal one) but also predict, as collateral signals, resonant production of the same CP-odd scalar A followed by the decays: (i) $A \to h_{95} \, Z$, leading to the same $\gamma\gamma b \bar{b}$ final state displaying the original 650 GeV anomaly and (ii) $A\to t\bar t$, leading to a well-known and studied signature.</description>

Abstract: Generative networks are perfect tools to enhance the speed and precision of LHC simulations. It is important to understand their statistical precision, especially when generating events beyond the size of the training dataset. We present two complementary methods to estimate the amplification factor without large holdout datasets. Averaging amplification uses Bayesian networks or ensembling to estimate amplification from the precision of integrals over given phase-space volumes. Differential amplification uses hypothesis testing to quantify amplification without any resolution loss. Applied to state-of-the-art event generators, both methods indicate that amplification is possible in specific regions of phase space, but not yet across the entire distribution.</description>

      <title>Strange Pentaquark Molecules in QCD Sum Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we systematically construct hidden- and open-strange pentaquarks in the hadronic molecular picture to search for possible partners of hadronic molecular state multiplets in the strange quark sector using QCD sum rules. Within this picture, 21 distinct currents are constructed with $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$. There is no bound state found from $J^P = 1/2^-$ currents, while three of them from $J^P = 3/2^-$ currents are bound-state solutions consistent with the $\Lambda(2050)3/2^-$, $\Xi(2250)$, and $N(2120)3/2^-$ states, which can be identified as $\Lambda\phi$, $\Xi\phi$, and $\Sigma K^\ast$ hadronic molecular states, respectively. Other constructions are interpreted as hadronic molecular states composed of excited states with the same quantum numbers, and some of these exhibit mass values that align with known resonances listed in the RPP(PDG). Our numerical results indicate that $\Lambda(2050)3/2^-$ and $\Xi(2250)$ should be the multiplet partner of each other. Additionally, although $\Sigma K^\ast$ bound state was identified under this framework, no corresponding partner states were found within the context of the currents we constructed. Alternative constructions may offer new possibilities for identifying such states.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the potential experimental relevance of magnetically affected heavy-quark diffusion, we consider here a five-dimensional nonlinear Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model to not only holographically model the QCD thermodynamics in a magnetic background, but also to probe the charged inner structure of a heavy quarkonium. The dual model's gravitational equations of motion can be solved in analytical form via the potential reconstruction method. Using a variety of tools -- spectral functions, hydrodynamic expansions or hanging strings -- we study the anisotropic diffusion constants and heavy-quark number susceptibility, each time reporting closed form expressions.</description>

      <title>Study of the $\Lambda \to p \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ semileptonic decay in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the $\Lambda \to N$ vector and axial-vector form factors, which are essential inputs for studying the semileptonic decay $\Lambda \to p \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$. This channel provides a clean, theoretically controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element $|V_{us}|$ from the baryon sector. Our analysis uses a gauge ensemble with physical light, strange, and charm quark masses and yields the most precise determination to date of the full set of transition form factors -- including second-class contributions -- as well as the associated couplings, radii, and the ratio of muon-to-electron decay rates, an observable sensitive to possible non-standard scalar and tensor interactions. We compare our non-perturbative results with next-to-next-to-leading order expansions in the small parameter $\delta = (m_\Lambda - m_N)/m_\Lambda \approx 0.16$. We find that the common phenomenological approximation of neglecting the $q^2$-dependence of the form factors leads to a $\sim 4\%$ deviation in the decay rate. This underscores the critical importance of precise, fully non-perturbative form factor inputs for achieving the sub-percent precision targets of upcoming experimental programs.</description>

      <title>Acausality-driven instabilities in transient relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-linear instabilities stemming from superluminal propagation of information in Israel-Stewart-like models of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics. In relativity, the characteristic speed of propagation of information, $w$, and the speed of the fluid, $v$, allow us to differentiate between regimes of the hydrodynamic equations that are acausal but stable ($w&gt;1$), unstable ($v^{2} w^{2} \geq 1$), and covariantly ill-posed ($w^{2} \leq 0$). As an analytical benchmark, we present a new solution that illustrates these distinct regimes. We compare this analytical solution to the result of a numerical relativistic viscous fluid dynamics solver, and confirm that the analytical result can be recovered numerically in the stable regime, whether causal or acausal. The onset of numerical instabilities is further found to occur in the regime predicted by the analytical solution.</description>

      <title>Study of chaos and scrambling in hairy AdS Soliton</title>

Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of the classical and quantum chaos in a candidate five-dimensional hairy AdS soliton. It is a horizonless geometry holographically dual to a confining field theory with finite scalar potential. We probe classical chaos by using particle geodesics and closed classical string. While the former shows no signature of chaos, the latter provides chaotic dynamics of the string using the Lyapunov exponent and the evolution of the Poincar\'e section. We perform an independent spectral analysis using the tools of the random matrix theory (RMT), namely the level space distributions and the Dyson-Mehta(DM) $\Delta_{3}$-statistics. We observe a clear transition from the low energy Wigner-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) distribution to the high energy Poisson distribution. This signifies a flow from quantum chaos in the infrared to integrability in the ultraviolet. We quantitatively characterize the inherent quantum scrambling in the dual theory by computing the butterfly velocity, the rate of spatial spread of the information scrambling, inside the bulk. We undergo two independent holographic methods -- entanglement wedge reconstruction and derivation of out-of-time-ordered correlators via shockwave analysis. In these methods, we heuristically consider the region near the soliton tip to provide the infrared physics of scrambling in analogy with the near-horizon region of a black hole. We find that the hair parameter controls various scrambling properties. Finally, we make comments on the interplay between insulator/superconductor phase transition in hairy soliton geometry and dynamical transition from integrability to chaos as both of these are affected by the presence of the hair parameter.</description>

      <title>Geodesics in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of test particles in quantum-gravitational backgrounds by introducing the concept of q--desics, quantum-corrected analogs of classical geodesics. Unlike standard approaches that rely solely on the expectation value of the spacetime metric, our formulation is based on the expectation value of quantum operators, such as the the affine connection-operator. This allows us to capture richer geometric information. We derive the q--desic equation using both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods and apply it to spherically symmetric static backgrounds obtained from canonical quantum gravity. Exemplary results include, light-like radial motion and circular motion with quantum gravitational corrections far above the Planck scale.
  This framework provides a refined description of motion in quantum spacetimes and opens new directions for probing the interface between quantum gravity and classical general relativity.</description>
