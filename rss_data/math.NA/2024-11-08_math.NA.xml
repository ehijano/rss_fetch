      <title>Bayesian inference for geophysical fluid dynamics using generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation plays a crucial role in numerical modeling, enabling the integration of real-world observations into mathematical models to enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of simulations. This approach is widely applied in fields such as meteorology, oceanography, and environmental science, where the dynamic nature of systems demands continuous updates to model states. However, the calibration of models in these high-dimensional, nonlinear systems poses significant challenges. In this paper, we explore a novel calibration methodology using diffusion generative models. We generate synthetic data that statistically aligns with a given set of observations (in this case the increments of the numerical approximation of a solution of a partial differential equation). This allows us to efficiently implement a model reduction and assimilate data from a reference system state modeled by a highly resolved numerical solution of the rotating shallow water equation of order 104 degrees of freedom into a stochastic system having two orders of magnitude less degrees of freedom. To do so, the new samples are incorporated into a particle filtering methodology augmented with tempering and jittering for dynamic state estimation, a method particularly suited for handling complex and multimodal distributions. This work demonstrates how generative models can be used to improve the predictive accuracy for particle filters, providing a more computationally efficient solution for data assimilation and model calibration.</description>

      <title>Tensor tomography using V-line transforms with vertices restricted to a circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of recovering symmetric $m$-tensor fields (including vector fields) supported in a unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ from a set of generalized V-line transforms, namely longitudinal, transverse, and mixed V-line transforms, and their integral moments. We work in a circular geometric setup, where the V-lines have vertices on a circle, and the axis of symmetry is orthogonal to the circle. We present two approaches to recover a symmetric $m$-tensor field from the combination of longitudinal, transverse, and mixed V-line transforms. With the help of these inversion results, we are able to give an explicit kernel description for these transforms. We also derive inversion algorithms to reconstruct a symmetric $m$-tensor field from its first $(m+1)$ moment longitudinal/transverse V-line transforms.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence rates of Galerkin finite element methods for SWEs with cubic polynomial nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, strong approximation errors are analyzed for both the spatial semi-discretization and the spatio-temporal fully discretization of stochastic wave equations (SWEs) with cubic polynomial nonlinearities and additive noises. The fully discretization is achieved by the standard Galerkin ffnite element method in space and a novel exponential time integrator combined with the averaged vector ffeld approach. The newly proposed scheme is proved to exactly satisfy a trace formula based on an energy functional. Recovering the convergence rates of the scheme, however, meets essential difffculties, due to the lack of the global monotonicity condition. To overcome this issue, we derive the exponential integrability property of the considered numerical approximations, by the energy functional. Armed with these properties, we obtain the strong convergence rates of the approximations in both spatial and temporal direction. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the previously theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Uniformly higher order accurate schemes for dynamics of charged particles under fast oscillating magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with the numerical approximation of plasmas which are confined by the effect of a fast oscillating magnetic field (see \cite{Bostan2012}) in the Vlasov model. The presence of this magnetic field induces oscillations (in time) to the solution of the characteristic equations. Due to its multiscale character, a standard time discretization would lead to an inefficient solver. In this work, time integrators are derived and analyzed for a class of highly oscillatory differential systems. We prove the uniform accuracy property of these time integrators, meaning that the accuracy does not depend on the small parameter $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we construct an extension of the scheme which degenerates towards an energy preserving numerical scheme for the averaged model, when $\varepsilon\to 0$. Several numerical results illustrate the capabilities of the method.</description>

      <title>Compatible finite element interpolated neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the finite element interpolated neural network (FEINN) framework from partial differential equations (PDEs) with weak solutions in $H^1$ to PDEs with weak solutions in $H(\textbf{curl})$ or $H(\textbf{div})$. To this end, we consider interpolation trial spaces that satisfy the de Rham Hilbert subcomplex, providing stable and structure-preserving neural network discretisations for a wide variety of PDEs. This approach, coined compatible FEINNs, has been used to accurately approximate the $H(\textbf{curl})$ inner product. We numerically observe that the trained network outperforms finite element solutions by several orders of magnitude for smooth analytical solutions. Furthermore, to showcase the versatility of the method, we demonstrate that compatible FEINNs achieve high accuracy in solving surface PDEs such as the Darcy equation on a sphere. Additionally, the framework can integrate adaptive mesh refinements to effectively solve problems with localised features. We use an adaptive training strategy to train the network on a sequence of progressively adapted meshes. Finally, we compare compatible FEINNs with the adjoint neural network method for solving inverse problems. We consider a one-loop algorithm that trains the neural networks for unknowns and missing parameters using a loss function that includes PDE residual and data misfit terms. The algorithm is applied to identify space-varying physical parameters for the $H(\textbf{curl})$ model problem from partial or noisy observations. We find that compatible FEINNs achieve accuracy and robustness comparable to, if not exceeding, the adjoint method in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Micro-Macro Decomposition-Based Asymptotic-Preserving Random Feature Method for Multiscale Radiative Transfer Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Asymptotic-Preserving Random Feature Method (APRFM) for the efficient resolution of multiscale radiative transfer equations. The APRFM effectively addresses the challenges posed by stiffness and multiscale characteristics inherent in radiative transfer equations through the application of a micro-macro decomposition strategy. This approach decomposes the distribution function into equilibrium and non-equilibrium components, allowing for the approximation of both parts through the random feature method (RFM) within a least squares minimization framework. The proposed method exhibits remarkable robustness across different scales and achieves high accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom and collocation points than the vanilla RFM. Additionally, compared to the deep neural network-based method, our approach offers significant advantages in terms of parameter efficiency and computational speed. These benefits have been substantiated through numerous numerical experiments conducted on both one- and two-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>A novel splitting strategy to accelerate solving generalized eigenvalue problem from Kohn--Sham density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel eigenpair-splitting method, inspired by the divide-and-conquer strategy, for solving the generalized eigenvalue problem arising from the Kohn-Sham equation. Unlike the commonly used domain decomposition approach in divide-and-conquer, which solves the problem on a series of subdomains, our eigenpair-splitting method focuses on solving a series of subequations defined on the entire domain. This method is realized through the integration of two key techniques: a multi-mesh technique for generating approximate spaces for the subequations, and a soft-locking technique that allows for the independent solution of eigenpairs. Numerical experiments show that the proposed eigenpair-splitting method can dramatically enhance simulation efficiency, and its potential towards practical applications is also demonstrated well through an example of the HOMO-LUMO gap calculation. Furthermore, the optimal strategy for grouping eigenpairs is discussed, and the possible improvements to the proposed method are also outlined.</description>

      <title>A high-order accurate moving mesh finite element method for the radial Kohn--Sham equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a highly accurate and efficient numerical solver for the radial Kohn--Sham equation. The equation is discretized using a high-order finite element method, with its performance further improved by incorporating a parameter-free moving mesh technique. This approach greatly reduces the number of elements required to achieve the desired precision. In practice, the mesh redistribution involves no more than three steps, ensuring the algorithm remains computationally efficient. Remarkably, with a maximum of $13$ elements, we successfully reproduce the NIST database results for elements with atomic numbers ranging from $1$ to $92$.</description>

      <title>A Practical Example of the Impact of Uncertainty on the One-Dimensional Single-Diode Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state of health of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is assessed by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) curves, which present a collection of three cardinal points: the short-circuit point, the open-circuit point, and the maximum power point. To understand the response of PV systems, the I-V curve is typically modeled using the well-known single-diode model (SDM), which involves five parameters. However, the SDM can be expressed as a function of one parameter when the information of the cardinal points is incorporated into the formulation. This paper presents a methodology to address the uncertainty of the cardinal points on the parameters of the single-diode model based on the mathematical theory. Utilizing the one-dimensional single-diode model as the basis, the study demonstrates that it is possible to include the uncertainty by solving a set of nonlinear equations. The results highlight the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach in accounting for uncertainties in the SDM parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to multi-modal optimization by enhancing the recently developed kinetic-based optimization (KBO) method with genetic dynamics (GKBO). The proposed method targets objective functions with multiple global minima, addressing a critical need in fields like engineering design, machine learning, and bioinformatics. By incorpo rating leader-follower dynamics and localized interactions, the algorithm efficiently navigates high-dimensional search spaces to detect multiple optimal solutions. After providing a binary description, a mean-field approximation is derived, and different numerical experiments are conducted to validate the results.</description>

      <title>The High-Order Magnetic Near-Axis Expansion: Ill-Posedness and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When analyzing stellarator configurations, it is common to perform an asymptotic expansion about the magnetic axis. This so-called near-axis expansion is convenient for the same reason asymptotic expansions often are, namely, it reduces the dimension of the problem. This leads to convenient and quickly computed expressions of physical quantities, such as quasisymmetry and stability criteria, which can be used to gain further insight. However, it has been repeatedly found that the expansion diverges at high orders, limiting the physics the expansion can describe. In this paper, we show that the near-axis expansion diverges in vacuum due to ill-posedness and that it can be regularized to improve its convergence. Then, using realistic stellarator coil sets, we show that the near-axis expansion can converge to ninth order in the magnetic field, giving accurate high-order corrections to the computation of flux surfaces. We numerically find that the regularization improves the solutions of the near-axis expansion under perturbation, and we demonstrate that the radius of convergence of the vacuum near-axis expansion is correlated with the distance from the axis to the coils.</description>

      <title>Precision-Aware Iterative Algorithms Based on Group-Shared Exponents of Floating-Point Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterative solvers are frequently used in scientific applications and engineering computations. However, the memory-bound Sparse Matrix-Vector (SpMV) kernel computation hinders the efficiency of iterative algorithms. As modern hardware increasingly supports low-precision computation, the mixed-precision optimization of iterative algorithms has garnered widespread attention. Nevertheless, existing mixed-precision methods pose challenges, including format conversion overhead, tight coupling between storage and computation representation, and the need to store multiple precision copies of data. This paper proposes a floating-point representation based on the group-shared exponent and segmented storage of the mantissa, enabling higher bit utilization of the representation vector and fast switches between different precisions without needing multiple data copies. Furthermore, a stepped mixed-precision iterative algorithm is proposed. Our experimental results demonstrate that, compared with existing floating-point formats, our approach significantly improves iterative algorithms' performance and convergence residuals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) for a dynamic description of the traffic behavior in road networks. These equations are coupled to a Hawkes process that models traffic accidents taking into account their self-excitation property which means that accidents are more likely in areas in which another accident just occurred. We discuss how both model components interact and influence each other. A data analysis reveals the self-excitation property of accidents and determines further parameters. Numerical simulations using risk measures underline and conclude the discussion of traffic accident effects in our model.</description>

      <title>On the rotational invariance and hyperbolicity of shallow water moment equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional extension of a recently introduced set of shallow water models based on a regularized moment expansion of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \cite{kowalski2017moment,koellermeier2020analysis}. We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and non-conservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in 2D is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in 1D. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in 2D is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>A priori error estimates of a diffusion equation with Ventcel boundary conditions on curved meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work is considered an elliptic problem, referred to as the Ventcel problem, involvinga second order term on the domain boundary (the Laplace-Beltrami operator). A variationalformulation of the Ventcel problem is studied, leading to a finite element discretization. Thefocus is on the construction of high order curved meshes for the discretization of the physicaldomain and on the definition of the lift operator, which is aimed to transform a functiondefined on the mesh domain into a function defined on the physical one. This lift is definedin a way as to satisfy adapted properties on the boundary, relatively to the trace operator.The Ventcel problem approximation is investigated both in terms of geometrical error and offinite element approximation error. Error estimates are obtained both in terms of the meshorder r $\ge$ 1 and to the finite element degree k $\ge$ 1, whereas such estimates usually have beenconsidered in the isoparametric case so far, involving a single parameter k = r. The numericalexperiments we led, both in dimension 2 and 3, allow us to validate the results obtained andproved on the a priori error estimates depending on the two parameters k and r. A numericalcomparison is made between the errors using the former lift definition and the lift defined inthis work establishing an improvement in the convergence rate of the error in the latter case.</description>

      <title>QGLAB: A MATLAB Package for Computations on Quantum Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe QGLAB, a new MATLAB package for analyzing partial differential equations on quantum graphs. The software is built on the existing, object-oriented MATLAB directed-graph class, inheriting its structure and adding additional easy-to-use features. The package allows one to construct a quantum graph and accurately compute the spectrum of elliptic operators, solutions to Poisson problems, the linear and nonlinear time evolution of a variety of PDEs, the continuation of branches of steady states (including locating and switching branches at bifurcations) and more. It overcomes the major challenge of discretizing quantum graphs -- the enforcement of vertex conditions -- using non-square differentiation matrices. It uses a unified framework to implement finite-difference and Chebyshev discretizations of differential operators on a quantum graph. For simplicity, the package overloads many built-in MATLAB functions to work on the class.</description>

      <title>An Immersed Interface Method for Incompressible Flows and Geometries with Sharp Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The immersed interface method (IIM) for models of fluid flow and fluid-structure interaction imposes jump conditions that capture stress discontinuities generated by forces that are concentrated along immersed boundaries. Most prior work using the IIM for fluid dynamic applications has focused on smooth interfaces, but boundaries with sharp features such as corners and edges can appear in practical analyses, particularly on engineered structures. The present study builds on our work to integrate finite element-type representations of interface geometries with the IIM. Initial realizations of this approach used a continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element discretization for the boundary, but as we show herein, these approaches generate large errors near sharp geometrical features. To overcome this difficulty, this study introduces an IIM approach using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) representation of the jump conditions. Numerical examples explore the impacts of different interface representations on accuracy for both smooth and sharp boundaries, particularly flows interacting with fixed interface configurations. We demonstrate that using a DG approach provides accuracy that is comparable to the CG method for smooth cases. Further, we identify a time step size restriction for the CG representation that is directly related to the sharpness of the geometry. In contrast, time step size restrictions imposed by DG representations are demonstrated to be insensitive to the presence of sharp features.</description>

      <title>Symmetric similarity 3D coordinate transformation based on dual quaternion algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, we have seen that dual quaternion algorithms are used in 3D coordinate transformation problems due to their advantages. 3D coordinate transformation problem is one of the important problems in geodesy. This transformation problem is encountered in many application areas other than geodesy. Although there are many coordinate transformation methods (similarity, affine, projective, etc.), similarity transformation is used because of its simplicity. The asymmetric transformation is preferred to the symmetric coordinate transformation because of its ease of use. In terms of error theory, the symmetric transformation should be preferred. In this study, the topic of symmetric similarity 3D coordinate transformation based on the dual quaternion algorithm is discussed, and the bottlenecks encountered in solving the problem and the solution method are discussed. A new iterative algorithm based on the dual quaternion is presented. The solution is implemented in two different models: with constraint equations and without constraint equations. The advantages and disadvantages of the two models compared to each other are also evaluated. Not only the transformation parameters but also the errors of the transformation parameters are determined. The detailed derivation of the formulas for estimating the symmetric similarity of 3D transformation parameters is presented step by step. Since symmetric transformation is the general form of asymmetric transformation, we can also obtain asymmetric transformation results with a simple modification of the model we developed for symmetric transformation. The proposed algorithm is capable of performing both 2D and 3D symmetric and asymmetric similarity transformations. For the 2D transformation, it is sufficient to replace the z and Z coordinates in both systems with zero.</description>

      <title>Computation of excited states for the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation: numerical and theoretical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our goal is to compute excited states for the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation in the radial setting. We introduce a new technique based on the Nehari manifold approach and give a comparison with the classical shooting method. We observe that the Nehari method allows to accurately compute excited states on large domains but is relatively slow compared to the shooting method.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as an unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks have attracted the scientific community's interest for the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behaviour in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work, we present the preliminary results of an IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels</description>

      <title>Reduced Data-Driven Turbulence Closure for Capturing Long-Term Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple, stochastic, a-posteriori, turbulence closure model based on a reduced subgrid scale term. This subgrid scale term is tailor-made to capture the statistics of a small set of spatially-integrate quantities of interest (QoIs), with only one unresolved scalar time series per QoI. In contrast to other data-driven surrogates the dimension of the "learning problem" is reduced from an evolving field to one scalar time series per QoI. We use an a-posteriori, nudging approach to find the distribution of the scalar series over time. This approach has the advantage of taking the interaction between the solver and the surrogate into account. A stochastic surrogate parametrization is obtained by random sampling from the found distribution for the scalar time series. Compared to an a-priori trained convolutional neural network, evaluating the new method is computationally much cheaper and gives similar long-term statistics.</description>

      <title>A Krasnoselskii-Mann Proximity Algorithm for Markowitz Portfolios with Adaptive Expected Return Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markowitz's criterion aims to balance expected return and risk when optimizing the portfolio. The expected return level is usually fixed according to the risk appetite of an investor, then the risk is minimized at this fixed return level. However, the investor may not know which return level is suitable for her/him and the current financial circumstance. It motivates us to find a novel approach that adaptively optimizes this return level and the portfolio at the same time. It not only relieves the trouble of deciding the return level during an investment but also gets more adaptive to the ever-changing financial market than a subjective return level. In order to solve the new model, we propose an exact, convergent, and efficient Krasnoselskii-Mann Proximity Algorithm based on the proximity operator and Krasnoselskii-Mann momentum technique. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in portfolio optimization. This finding may contribute a new perspective on the relationship between return and risk in portfolio optimization.</description>
