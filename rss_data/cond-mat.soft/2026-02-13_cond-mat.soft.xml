      <title>Solvothermal vapor annealing and environmental control setup with adjustable magnetic field module for GISAXS studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compact, modular environmental control and solvothermal vapor annealing chamber designed for maintaining a controlled atmosphere with regard to solvent humidity and temperature is presented. The setup allows ex situ and in situ grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) investigations of thin film self-assembly and reorganization. Its modular slotting system enables stable reconfiguration, including the integration of an adjustable magnetic field module. The temperature is maintained via a water-based heating and cooling loop supplemented by resistive elements, and the solvent vapor environment is regulated using a commercial controlled mixing and evaporation unit. The performance of the setup is validated through measurements of fill and quench times together with magnetic field mapping with Gauss meter measurements and finite element simulations. Further, the versatility of the setup is demonstrated with four research examples using the chamber for solvothermal vapor annealing of block copolymer thin films together with lab-based ex situ and in situ GISAXS measurements. The portable new design offers robust environmental control and flexibility for advanced thin film investigations both in the lab and at large scale facilities. The design can be adapted for grazing incidence small-angle neutron scattering, GISANS.</description>

      <title>Predicting the post-wildfire mudflow onset using machine learning models on multi-parameter experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-wildfire mudflows are increasingly hazardous due to the prevalence of wildfires, including those on the wildland-urban interface. Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes. Rainwater and eroded soil blanket the downslope, leading to catastrophic debris flows. Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. Results also show that the first 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure. These findings highlight the potential of ML for post-wildfire hazard assessment and emergency response planning.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed data-driven framework for modeling hyperelastic materials with progressive damage and failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a two-stage physics-informed, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for hyperelastic soft materials undergoing progressive damage and failure. The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic Magnetic Friction from Collective Rotor Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amontons' law postulates a monotonic relationship between frictional force and the normal load applied to a sliding contact. This empirical rule, however, fails in systems where internal degrees of freedom - such as structural or electronic order - play a central role. Here, we demonstrate that friction can emerge entirely from magnetically driven configurational dynamics in the absence of physical contact. Using a two-dimensional array of rotatable magnetic dipoles sliding over a commensurate magnetic substrate, we observe a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of friction on the interlayer separation, and thus on the effective load. The friction peaks at an intermediate distance where competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions induce dynamical frustration and hysteretic torque cycles during sliding. Molecular dynamics simulations and a simplified two-sublattice model confirm that energy dissipation is governed by collective magnetic reorientations and their hysteresis. Our results establish the occurrence of sliding-induced changes in collective magnetic order, which has a strong impact on friction, and thus open new possibilities for contactless friction control, magnetic sensing, and the design of reconfigurable, wear-free frictional interfaces and metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Chemically Regulated Conical Channel Synapse for Neuromorphic and Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluidic iontronics offer a unique capability for emulating the chemical processes found in neurons. We extract multiple distinct chemically regulated synaptic features from an experimentally accessible conical microfluidic channel carrying functionalized surface groups, using finite-element calculations of continuum transport equations. By modeling a Langmuir-type surface reaction on the channel wall we couple fast voltage-induced volumetric salt accumulation with a long-term channel surface charge modulation by means of fast charging and slow discharging. These nonlinear charging dynamics emerge across several orders of magnitude of reaction rates and equilibria, and are understood through an analytic approximation rooted in first-principles. We show how short-and long-term potentiation and depression, frequency-dependent plasticity, and chemical-electrical signal spike-timing dependence and coincidence detection (acting like a chemical-electrical AND logic gate), akin to the NMDA mechanism for Hebbian learning in biological synapses, can all be emulated.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic Newton-Cartan Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An application of the Newton-Cartan framework to the study of membranes is presented. Specifically, for membranes of co-dimension one in hydrostatic equilibrium embedded in a flat ambient Newton-Cartan spacetime. For such membranes, the corresponding equilibrium partition function at second order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion is shown. Equilibrium constraints and the corresponding set of equilibrium constitutive relations are found. For the generically non-constant elastic subset of thermodynamic coefficients, the Young-Laplace equation is presented for the case of two-dimensional axisymmetric closed membranes embedded in a flat three-dimensional spacetime with constant ambient vorticity. Some numerical solutions to this Young-Laplace equation are examined, and some analytic solutions for particular choices of the thermodynamic coefficients are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Entropy production in non-reciprocal polar active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The out-of-equilibrium character of active systems is often twofold, arising from both the activity itself and from non-reciprocal couplings between constituents. A well-established measure to quantify the system's distance from equilibrium is the informatic entropy production rate. Here, we ask the question whether and how the informatic entropy production rate reflects collective behaviors and transitions in an active mixture with non-reciprocal polar couplings. In such systems, non-reciprocal orientational couplings can induce chiral motion of particles. At the field-theoretical level, transitions to these time-dependent chiral states are marked by so-called critical exceptional points. Here, we show that at a particle level, the entropy production rate within the chiral states increases with the degree of non-reciprocity, provided it is sufficiently strong. Moreover, even at small degrees of non-reciprocity, the transitions via exceptional points leave clear signatures in the entropy production rate, which exhibits pronounced peaks at coupling strengths corresponding to the field-theoretical exceptional points. Overall, the increase and peaks of the entropy production rate mirror the susceptibility of the polarization vector at the particle level. This correspondence is supported by a field-theoretical analysis, which reveals that, in the long-wavelength limit, the entropy production rate scales with the susceptibilities of the polarization fields.</description>
