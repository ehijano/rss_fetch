      <title>Lectures on SL(3) foams and link homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are based on the three lectures that one of the authors gave at Tsinghua University in the summer of 2023 as part of the workshop on Geometric Representation Theory and Applications. They contain an introduction to the evaluation of $\mathsf{SL}(3)$ foams and the associated topological theory of trivalent planar graphs and foam cobordisms between them. A categorification of the Kuperberg quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ web and link invariant and the Robert-Wagner $\mathsf{SL}(N)$ foam evaluation are reviewed as well.</description>

      <title>Cochain valued TQFTs from nonsemisimple modular tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a vector space valued TQFT constructed in work of De Renzi et al. [DGGPR23] extends naturally to a topological field theory which takes values in the symmetric monoidal category of linear cochains. Specifically, we consider a bordism category whose objects are surfaces with markings from the category of cochains Ch(A) over a given modular tensor category (such as the category of small quantum group representations), and whose morphisms are 3-dimensional bordisms with embedded ribbon graphs traveling between such marked surfaces. We construct a symmetric monoidal functor from the aforementioned ribbon bordism category to the category of linear cochains. The values of this theory on surfaces are identified with Hom complexes for Ch(A), and the 3-manifold invariants are alternating sums of the renormalized Lyubashenko invariant from [DGGPR23].
  We show that our cochain valued TQFT furthermore preserves homotopies, and hence localizes to a theory which takes values in the derived $\infty$-category of dg vector spaces. The domain for this $\infty$-categorical theory is, up to some approximation, an $\infty$-category of ribbon bordism with labels in the homotopy $\infty$-category K(A). We suggest our localized theory as a starting point for the construction of a "derived TQFT" for the $\infty$-category of derived quantum group representations.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetries, anomalies, and crossed squares in lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine higher-form symmetries of quantum lattice gauge theories through the lens of homotopy theory and operator algebras. We show that in the operator-algebraic approach both higher-form symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies arise from considering restrictions of symmetry transformations to spatial regions. The data of these restrictions are naturally packaged into a higher group. For example, for gauge theories in two spatial dimensions, this information is encoded in a crossed square of groups, which is an algebraic model of a 3-group. In general, we propose that higher groups appear in lattice models and QFT as crossed n-cubes of groups via a nonabelian version of the Cech construction.</description>

      <title>Lie superalgebras in characteristic 2 and mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of a Lie superalgebra over a field $k$ of characteristic $2$ which unifies the two pre-existing ones - $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded Lie algebras with a squaring map and Lie algebras in the Verlinde category ${\rm Ver}_4^+(k)$, and prove the PBW theorem for this notion. We also do the same for the restricted version. Finally, discuss mixed characteristic deformation theory of such Lie superalgebras (for perfect $k$), introducing and studying a natural lift of our notion of Lie superalgebra to characteristic zero - the notion of a mixed Lie superalgebra over a ramified quadratic extension $R$ of the ring of Witt vectors $W(k)$.</description>

      <title>Obstruction theory for $A$-infinity bimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an obstruction theory for the extension of truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over truncated minimal $A$-infinity algebras. Obstructions live in far-away pages of a (truncated) fringed spectral sequence of Bousfield--Kan type. The second page of this spectral sequence is mostly given by a new cohomology theory associated to a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it. This new cohomology theory fits in a long exact sequence involving the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra and the self-extensions of the bimodule. We show that the second differential of this spectral sequence is given by the Gerstenhaber bracket with a bimodule analogue of the universal Massey product of a minimal $A$-infinity algebra. We also develop a closely-related obstruction theory for truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over (the truncation of) a fixed minimal $A$-infinity algebra; the second page of the corresponding spectral sequence is now mostly given by the vector spaces of self-extensions of the underlying graded bimodule and the second differential is described analogously to the previous one. We also establish variants of the above for graded algebras and graded bimodules that are $d$-sparse, that is they are concentrated in degrees that are multiples of a fixed integer $d\geq1$. These obstruction theories are used to establish intrinsic formality and almost formality theorems for differential graded bimodules over differential graded algebras. Our results hold, more generally, in the context of graded operads with multiplication equipped with an associative operadic ideal, examples of which are the endomorphism operad of a graded algebra and the linear endomorphism operad of a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it.</description>

      <title>Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct analogs of the Gelfand-Zetlin algebras in the Reflection Equation algebras, corresponding to Hecke symmetries, mainly to those coming from the quantum groups U_q(sl(N)). Corresponding semiclassical (i.e. Poisson) counterparts of the Gelfand-Zetlin algebras are described.</description>

      <title>Enumerative Geometry of Quantum Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We interpret the $q$-refined theta function $\vartheta_1$ of a log Calabi-Yau surface $(\mathbb{P},E)$ as a natural $q$-refinement of the open mirror map, defined by quantum periods of mirror curves for outer Aganagic-Vafa branes on the local Calabi-Yau $K_{\mathbb{P}}$. The series coefficients are all-genus logarithmic two-point invariants, directly extending the relation found in [GRZ]. Yet we find an explicit discrepancy at higher genus in the relation to open Gromov-Witten invariants of the Aganagic-Vafa brane. Using a degeneration argument, we express the difference in terms of relative invariants of an elliptic curve. With $\pi: \widehat{\mathbb{P}} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}$ the toric blow up of a point, we use the Topological Vertex [AKMV] to show a correspondence between open invariants of $K_{\mathbb{P}}$ and closed invariants of $K_{\widehat{\mathbb{P}}}$ generalizing a variant of [CLLT][LLW] to arbitrary genus and winding. We also equate winding-1, open-BPS invariants with closed Gopakumar-Vafa invariants.</description>
