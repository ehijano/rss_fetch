      <title>Additional dimensions of space and time in the region of deep inelastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the well-known Heisenberg uncertainty relations and Landau-Peierls uncertainty relations implicitly contain ``hidden'' angular variables, which belong to new uncertainty relations. Based on the obtained relations, we derive a formula for estimating the speed $U^*$ of a virtual particle in indirect measurements. We applied the theory of indirect measurements and the derived formula to estimate the module of the group velocity of virtual photons from the DIS HERA data. The HERA data indicate that the speed of virtual photons exceeds the speed of light $c$ in free space, $U^*&gt;c$. The properties of virtual photons and a hypothetical tachyon particle are almost identical. It is found that in the realm of particle interaction, the new angular parameters are closely related to the type of the phase-space geometry and dimensionality of the space-time continuum. It is suggested that the problem of the normalization condition $U^* =c$ at $Q^2=0\, \rm{GeV}^2$ can be solved naturally within the framework of ``Two-Time Physics'' developed by I. Bars. 2T-physics is the theory with local symplectic $\mathrm{Sp(2,R)}$ gauge symmetry in phase-space and the space-time geometry of signature $\mathrm{(1+1',d+1')}$ with one extra time-like and one extra space-like dimensions.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of Cosmic Ray Electron Boosted Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of boosted dark matter (DM), where a fraction of DM is upscattered to relativistic energies by cosmic ray electrons. Such interactions responsible for boosting the DM also attenuate its flux at the Earth. Considering a simple model of constant interaction cross-section, we make analytical estimates of the variation of the attenuation ceiling with the DM mass and confirm it numerically. We then extend our analysis to a $Z'$-mediated leptophilic DM model. We show that the attenuation ceiling remains nearly model-independent for DM and mediator particles heavier than the electron, challenging some previous discussions on this topic. Using the XENONnT direct detection experiment, we illustrate how constraints based on energy-dependent scattering can significantly differ from those based on an assumed constant cross-section. This highlights the importance of re-evaluating these constraints in the context of specific models.</description>

      <title>$U(1)$-charged Dark Matter in three-Higgs-doublet models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore three-Higgs-doublet models that may accommodate scalar Dark Matter where the stability is based on an unbroken $U(1)$-based symmetry, rather than the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Our aim is to classify all possible ways of embedding a $U(1)$ symmetry in a three-Higgs-doublet model. The different possibilities are presented and compared. All these models contain mass-degenerate pairs of Dark Matter candidates due to a $U(1)$ symmetry unbroken (conserved) by the vacuum. Most of these models preserve CP. In the CP-conserving case the pairs can be seen as one being even and the other being odd under CP or as having opposite charges under $U(1)$. Not all symmetries presented here were identified before in the literature, which points to the fact that there are still many open questions in three-Higgs-doublet models. We also perform a numerical exploration of the $U(1) \otimes U(1)$-symmetric 3HDM, this is the most general phase-invariant (real) three-Higgs-doublet model. The model contains a multi-component Dark Matter sector, with two independent mass scales. After imposing relevant experimental constraints we find that there are possible solutions throughout a broad Dark Matter mass range, 45-2000 GeV, the latter being a scan cutoff.</description>

      <title>KAN we improve on HEP classification tasks? Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks applied to an LHC physics example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as an alternative to multilayer perceptrons, suggesting advantages in performance and interpretability. We study a typical binary event classification task in high-energy physics including high-level features and comment on the performance and interpretability of KANs in this context. We find that the learned activation functions of a one-layer KAN resemble the log-likelihood ratio of the input features. In deeper KANs, the activations in the first KAN layer differ from those in the one-layer KAN, which indicates that the deeper KANs learn more complex representations of the data. We study KANs with different depths and widths and we compare them to multilayer perceptrons in terms of performance and number of trainable parameters. For the chosen classification task, we do not find that KANs are more parameter efficient. However, small KANs may offer advantages in terms of interpretability that come at the cost of only a moderate loss in performance.</description>

      <title>Factorization for energy-energy correlator in heavy ion collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a factorization formula for the energy-energy correlator in the collinear limit for the case of heavy ion collisions. Employing Soft Collinear Effective Theory, we provide a complete framework for jet production and evolution by separating the jet dynamics from the universal medium physics to all orders in perturbation theory in terms of gauge invariant operators. The EFT allows us to precisely define the domain of validity of different approximations and to systematically go beyond leading order results in the literature through radiative corrections. For this observable, we show where the leading order GLV and BDMPS-Z results are valid and infer that higher order radiative corrections lead to both DGLAP and BFKL evolutions. We further show the impact of BFKL resummation on the medium induced jet function for two point energy correlator. Crucially, the EFT approach enables us to evaluate the universality of the non-perturbative physics which is the key to predictive power in a strongly coupled medium.</description>

      <title>A new method to clarify contribution of chiral magnetic effect in small collision system $p^{\uparrow} + A$ involving a transversely polarized proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With experimental data of DIS involving transversely polarized proton, we have calculated the 3-D charge density inside the polarized proton, which is found to have a significant non-spherical symmetry. Then we have calculated the property of electromagnetic field (E-M field) generated by a single transversely polarized proton ($p^{\uparrow}$). Based on them, the E-M field generated in small collision system $p^{\uparrow}+A$ are studied. We find that the orientation of this E-M field has a significant dependence on the polarization direction of the proton, and the correlator ($\Delta\gamma$ ) has also significant dependence on the angle between reaction plane and polarization direction. This finding provides us a new method for probing the chiral magnetic effect (CME).</description>

      <title>Reconciling Cosmological Tensions with Inelastic Dark Matter and Dark Radiation in a $\boldsymbol{U(1)_D}$ Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel and comprehensive particle physics framework that addresses multiple cosmological tensions observed in recent measurements of the Hubble parameter, $S_8$, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. Our model, termed `{\bf SIDR+$\boldsymbol{z_t}$}' (Self Interacting Dark Radiation with transition redshift), is based on an inelastic dark matter (IDM) scenario coupled with dark radiation, governed by a $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry. This framework naturally incorporates cold dark matter (DM), SIDR, and the interactions between these components. The fluid-like behavior of the dark radiation component, effectively mitigates both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions by suppressing free-streaming effects. Simultaneously, the interacting DM-DR system attenuates the matter power spectrum at small scales, potentially reconciling discrepancies in Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly-$\alpha$) observations. The inelastic nature of DM provides a distinct temperature dependence for the DM-DR interaction rate determined by the mass-splitting between the inelastic dark fermions which is crucial for resolving the Ly-$\alpha$ discrepancies. We present a cosmologically consistent analysis of the model by solving the relevant Boltzmann equations to obtain the energy density and number density evolution of different species of the model. The DR undergoes two ``steps" of increased energy density when the heavier dark species freeze out and become non-relativistic, transferring their entropy to the dark radiation and enhancing $\Delta N{\rm eff}$. The analysis showcases the model's potential to uphold the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) prediction of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ but dominantly producing additional contributions prior to recombination, while simultaneously achieving correct relic density of DM though an hybrid of freeze-in and non-thermal production.</description>

      <title>$\eta_{_{c2}}(^1D_{_2})$ and its electromagnetic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-singlet state $\eta_{_{c2}}(^1D_{_2})$ has not been discovered in experiment and it is the only missing low-excited $D$-wave charmonium, so in this paper, we like to study its properties. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation method, we obtain its mass as $3828.2$ MeV and its electromagnetic decay widths as $\Gamma[\eta_{_{c2}}(1D)\rightarrow h_{_{c}}(1P)\gamma]=284$ keV, $\Gamma[\eta_{_{c2}}(1D)\rightarrow J/\psi\gamma]=1.04$ keV, $\Gamma[\eta_{_{c2}}(1D)\rightarrow\psi(2S)\gamma]=3.08$ eV, and $\Gamma[\eta_{_{c2}}(1D)\rightarrow\psi(3770)\gamma]=0.143$ keV. We estimate its full width to be about $366$ keV, and point out that the electromagnetic decay partial width is very sensitive to its mass and show the variation of the width along with the mass in the range of $3800\sim3872$ MeV. In our calculation, the emphasis is put on the relativistic corrections. Our results show that $\eta_{_{c2}}\rightarrow h_{_{c}}\gamma$ is the non-relativistic $E1$ transition dominated $E1+M2+E3$ decay, and $\eta_{_{c2}}\rightarrow \psi\gamma$ is the $M1+E2+M3+E4$ decay but the relativistic $E2$ transition contributes the most.</description>

      <title>Splitting amplitudes at N$^3$LO in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the limit where partons become collinear to each other, scattering amplitudes factorize into a product of universal, process-independent building blocks and scattering amplitudes involving fewer partons. We compute these universal building blocks -- known as splitting amplitudes -- for two collinear QCD partons up to third loop order in QCD. Our results describe arbitrary time-like splitting processes. Due to the violation of strict collinear factorization in space-like splitting processes, we specifically present space-like splitting amplitudes for three-parton QCD scattering amplitudes at third loop order. To achieve our results, we perform a collinear expansion of three-loop scattering amplitudes using a new expansion-by-subgraph technology, which is based on the method of regions.</description>

      <title>Valence Quark Distributions in Pions: Insights from Tsallis Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the valence quark distributions of pions at a low initial scale ($Q^2_0$) through the application of Tsallis entropy, a non-extensive measure adept at encapsulating long-range correlations among internal constituents. Utilizing the maximum entropy approach, we derive the valence quark distributions at elevated resolution scales via a modified DGLAP equation, which integrates GLR-MQ-ZRS corrections for the $Q^2$ evolution. Our findings indicate that the resulting $Q^2$-dependent valence quark distributions yield an optimal fit to experimental data, with an inferred parameter value of $q$ ($q = 0.91$), diverging from unity. This deviation highlights the significant role that correlations among valence quarks play in shaping our understanding of pion internal structure. Additionally, our computations of the first three moments of pion quark distributions at $ Q^2 = 4 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2$ display consistency with alternative theoretical models, thereby reinforcing the importance of incorporating valence quark correlations within this analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Hybrid approach to perfect and dissipative spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid framework of spin hydrodynamics is proposed that combines the results of kinetic theory for particles with spin 1/2 with the Israel-Stewart method of introducing non-equilibrium dynamics. The framework of kinetic theory is used to define the perfect-fluid description that conserves baryon number, energy, linear momentum and spin part of angular momentum. This leads to the entropy conservation although, in the presence of spin degrees of freedom, the perfect-fluid formalism includes extra terms whose structure is usually attributed to dissipation. The genuine dissipative terms appear from the condition of positive entropy production in non-equilibrium processes. They are responsible for the transfer between the spin and orbital parts of angular momentum, with the total angular momentum being conserved.</description>

      <title>Jet definition and TMD factorisation in SIDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the colour dipole picture of Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and the Colour Glass Condensate effective theory, we study semi-inclusive jet production in DIS at small $x$ in the limit where the photon virtuality $Q^2$ is much larger than the transverse momentum squared $P_\perp^2$ of the produced jet. In this limit, the cross-section is dominated by aligned jet configurations, that is, quark-antiquark pairs in which one of the fermions -- the would-be struck quark in the Breit frame -- carries most of the longitudinal momentum of the virtual photon. We show that physically meaningful jet definitions in DIS are such that the effective axis of the jet sourced by the struck quark is controlled by its virtuality rather than by its transverse momentum. For such jet definitions, we show that the next-to-leading order (NLO) cross-section admits factorisation in terms of the (sea) quark transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution, which in turn satisfies a universal DGLAP and Sudakov evolution.</description>

      <title>Finite beaming effect on QED cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum electrodynamic (QED) theory predicts the photon emission and pair creation involved in QED cascades occur mainly in a forward cone with finite angular spread $\Delta\theta \sim 1/\gamma_{i}$ along the momenta of incoming particles. This finite beaming effect has been assumed to be negligible because of the particles' ultra-relativistic Lorentz factor $\gamma_{i}\gg1$ in laser-driven QED cascades. We develop an energy- and angularly resolved particle-tracking code, resolving both the energy spectra and the momentum profile of the outgoing particles in each QED event, which improves substantially the agreement between the simulation and exact QED results. We investigate QED cascades driven by two counter-propagating circularly polarized laser pulses, and show that the narrow beaming could be accumulated to effectively suppress the long-term growth of cascades, even though it can hardly affect the early formation of cascades. For QED cascades longer than $10$ laser cycles, the finite beaming effect could decrease the final pair yield, especially at ultrahigh intensities $\xi&gt;600$, by more than $10\%$.</description>

      <title>$\rm{SU}(3)_F$ sum rules for CP asymmetry of $D_{(s)}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-parity (CP) asymmetries in charm decays are extremely suppressed in the Standard Model and may well be dominated by new-physics contributions. The LHCb collaboration reported the results of direct CP asymmetry measurements in $D^0\to K^+ K^-$ and $D^0\to \pi^+\pi^-$ decays with unprecedented accuracy: $a_{\rm{CP}}(K^+ K^-)=(7.7\pm5.7)\times 10^{-4}$ and $a_{\rm{CP}}(\pi^+\pi^-)=(23.2\pm6.1)\times 10^{-4}$, with the latter quantity inferred from the precise measurement of $\Delta a_{\rm{CP}} =\, a_{\rm{CP}}(K^+ K^-) -a_{\rm{CP}}(\pi^+\pi^-) =\, (-15.7\pm2.9)\times 10^{-4}$. When interpreted within the Standard Model, these values indicate a breakdown of the approximate $U$-spin symmetry of QCD. If, however, this symmetry holds and the data stem from new physics, other CP asymmetries should be enhanced as well. We derive CP asymmetry sum rules based on $\rm{SU}(3)$ flavor symmetry for $D$ meson decays into a pair of pseudoscalar mesons as well as a pair of a pseudoscalar and a vector meson for two generic scenarios, with $\Delta U=0$ and $|\Delta U|=1$ interactions, respectively. The correlations implied by the sum rules can be used to check the consistency between different measurements and to discriminate between these scenarios with future data. For instance, we find $a_{\mathrm{CP}}(\pi^{+}K^{* 0}) + a_{\mathrm{CP}}(K^{+}\overline{K}^{* 0}) = 0$ for $\Delta U=0$ new physics and the opposite relative sign for the $|\Delta U|=1$ case. One sum rule, connecting four decay modes, holds in both scenarios. We further extend our sum rules to certain differences of CP asymmetries from which the $D$ production asymmetries drop out.</description>

      <title>Overview of $B \to K^{(*)}\ell \ell$ Theoretical Calculations and Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for New Physics (NP) beyond the Standard Model (SM) has been a central focus of particle physics, including in the context of $B$-meson decays involving $b \to s \ell \ell$ transitions. These transitions, mediated by flavour-changing neutral currents, are highly sensitive to small NP effects due to their suppression in the SM. While direct searches at colliders have not yet led to NP discoveries, indirect probes through semi-leptonic decays have revealed anomalies in observables such as the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(B \to K \mu \mu)$ and the angular observable $P_5'(B \to K^* \mu \mu)$. In order to assess the observed tensions, it is essential to ensure an accurate SM prediction. In this review, we examine the theoretical basis of the $B \to K^{(*)} \ell \ell$ decays, addressing in particular key uncertainties arising from local and non-local form factors. We also discuss the impact of QED corrections to the Wilson coefficients, as well as the effect of CKM matrix elements on the predictions and the tension with the experimental measurements. We discuss the most recent results, highlighting ongoing efforts to refine predictions and to constrain potential signs of NP in these critical decay processes.</description>

      <title>Two-loop running effects in Higgs physics in Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the renormalization group equations within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory and compute two-loop contributions proportional to the top quark Yukawa coupling for the operator generating an effective Higgs-gluon coupling, focusing on the Yukawa-like operator. These two-loop running effects are relevant for processes where the effective Higgs-gluon coupling contributes at a lower loop order compared to the Standard Model contribution and where a dynamical scale choice is adopted. Such a situation arises, for instance, in the Higgs transverse momentum distribution and Higgs pair production. We investigate the phenomenological impact of our computations on these two processes and find that the two-loop contributions are significant and can lead to deviations of up to 20\% in the scenarios we consider.</description>

      <title>Minding the gap: testing natural anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking at high luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the minimal anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking model (mAMSB) seems ruled out by constraints on Higgs mass, naturalness and wino dark matter, a slightly generalized version dubbed natural AMSB (nAMSB) remains both viable and compelling. Like mAMSB, nAMSB features winos as the lightest gauginos, but unlike mAMSB, nAMSB allows a small mu parameter so that higgsinos are the lightest of electroweakinos (EWinos). nAMSB spectra depend on the input value of gravitino mass m_{3/2}, where the lower range of m_{3/2} is excluded by LHC gluino pair searches while a higher m_{3/2} band is excluded by LHC limits on wino pair production followed by boosted hadronic wino decays. A remaining intermediate gap in m_{3/2} values remains allowed by present LHC searches, but appears to be completely explorable by high luminosity ugrades of LHC (HL-LHC). We explore a variety of compelling discovery channels that may allow one to close the intermediate gap in m_{3/2} values: 1. same-sign diboson +MET (SSdB) production arising from wino pair production, leading to same-sign dileptons plus MET, 2. trilepton production arising from wino pair production and 3. soft dilepton plus jet events from higgsino pair production, 4. top-squark pair production. From our signal-to-background analysis along a nAMSB model line, we expect HL-LHC to either discover or rule out the nAMSB model with 3000 fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity.</description>

      <title>Parametrization sampling and the pion PDF in a phenomenological analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these proceedings, we extend the discussion of the pion PDF obtained by NLO QCD analysis in the Fant\^omas4QCD framework. Our pion analysis uses a state-of-the-art statistical methodology that accounts for the epistemic uncertainty. Fant\^omas4QCD, designed to handle multiple functional forms for solving the inverse problem, systematically explores a variety of solutions for PDFs, thereby improving estimates of epistemic uncertainty. Through this novel approach, we interpret our results for the valence sector, considering various non-perturbative methods available for predicting the pion PDF. We emphasize the distinctions between (global) QCD analyses and QFT-based calculations.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of thermal state in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our work, we perform a detailed study of the Krylov complexity of the thermal state across the entire early universe, encompassing the inflation, radiation-dominated period, and matter-dominated period, which is for the single field inflation. We utilize both the closed system's method and open system's method to achieve this goal. To accurately calculate the Krylov complexity, we purified the thermal state, resulting in a pure state with two modes. Our analysis with both methods indicates that the Krylov complexity will increase during inflation, but will saturate at constant values during the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods, where the generation of particles via preheating leads to this evolution. Furthermore, our findings reveal that inflation behaves as a strong dissipative system, while the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods act as weak dissipative systems. The chaotic feature during these periods follows a similar trend to the Krylov complexity. This research has the potential to provide new insights into the exploration of Krylov complexity in cosmology.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a new method for computing a finite quantum system's continuum states and observables by applying a subspace projection (or reduced basis) method used in model order reduction studies to ``discretize'' the system's continuous spectrum. The method extracts the continuum physics from solving Schr\"odinger equations with bound-state-like boundary conditions and emulates this extraction in the space of the input parameters. This parameter emulation can readily be adapted to emulate other continuum calculations as well, e.g., those based on complex energy or Lorentz integral transform methods. Here, I give an overview of the key aspects of the formalism and some informative findings from numerical experimentation with two- and three-body systems, which indicates the non-Hermitian quantum mechanics nature of the method. A potential connection with (near-)optimal rational approximation studied in Math literature is also discussed. Further details are provided in a separate paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the higher weak isospin $SU(3)_L$ manifestly unifies dark matter and normal matter in its isomultiplets for which dark matter carries a conserved dark charge while normal matter does not. The resultant gauge symmetry is given by $SU(3)_C\otimes SU(3)_L \otimes U(1)_X\otimes U(1)_G$, where the first factor is the color group, while the rest defines a theory of scotoelectroweak in which $X$ and $G$ determine electric charge $Q=T_3-1/\sqrt{3}T_8+X$ and dark charge $D=-2/\sqrt{3}T_8+G$. This setup provides both appropriate scotogenic neutrino masses and dark matter stability as preserved by a residual dark parity $P_D=(-1)^D$. Interpretation of the dark charge is further discussed, given that $SU(3)_L$ is broken at very high energy scale.</description>

      <title>Higgs interference effects in top-quark pair production in the 1HSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a next-to-leading-order (NLO) study of the process $pp \; ( \to \{ h_1, h_2 \}) \to t\bar{t} + X$ in the 1-Higgs-singlet extension of the Standard Model with an additional heavy Higgs boson $h_2$ that mixes with the light Higgs boson $h_1$. This process is subject to large interference effects between loop-induced Higgs-mediated amplitudes and the QCD continuum background which tend to overcompensate any resonance contributions. A reliable modelling of the resulting top-pair invariant mass shapes requires the inclusion of higher-order QCD corrections, which are presented here. The computation of these NLO corrections is exact in all contributions but in the class of non-factorisable two-loop diagrams which are included in an approximate way such that all infrared singular limits are preserved. We present numerical results for several benchmark points with heavy Higgs masses in the range $700$--$3000$ GeV considering the production of stable top quarks. We find that the interference effects dominate the BSM signal yielding sharp dip structures instead of resonance peaks. The significance and excludability of the BSM effect is explored for the LHC Run 2, Run 3 and HL-LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the axion-mediated scattering processes between dark matter (DM) and nucleus. Substantial contributions are made via the CP-odd gluonic current which induces the spin-dependent process. Since the QCD axion is too feebly coupled to the visible particles, non-QCD axions are necessary for the current DM experiments to accomplish the ample sensitivity. In the case of multi-component DM models, the inelastic scattering processes also make sizable contributions to the direct detection. The supersymmetry (SUSY) and clockwork (CW) mechanism provide a realistic model for the QCD and non-QCD axions and the axion-mediated DM scattering processes. In the SUSY CW axion model, the lightest axino is the DM particle and the axions mediate the elastic and inelastic scattering processes. We show that the current and future XENONnT can produce relevant constraints for some parameter space of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically study the electromagnetic properties of controversial states whose internal structure is not elucidated and we try to offer a different point of view to unravel the internal structure of these states. Inspired by the $\Omega_c$ states observed by the LHCb Collaboration, we study the electromagnetic properties of the $\Omega_c$ states as the compact diquark-diquark-antiquark pentaquarks with both $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$ and $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ in the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule model. From the obtained numerical results, we conclude that the magnetic dipole moments of the $\Omega_c$ states can reflect their inner structures, which can be used to distinguish their spin-parity quantum numbers. Measuring the magnetic moment of the $\Omega_c$ states in future experimental facilities can be very helpful for understanding the internal organization and identifying the quantum numbers of these states.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gravitational Waves: A New Window to Look for Heavy Non-annihilating Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sun-like stars can transmute into comparable mass black holes by steadily accumulating heavy non-annihilating dark matter particles over the course of their lives. If such stars form in binary systems, they could give rise to quasi-monochromatic, persistent gravitational waves, commonly known as continuous gravitational waves, as they inspiral toward one another. We demonstrate that next-generation space-based detectors, e.g., Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Big Bang Observer (BBO), can provide novel constraints on dark matter parameters (dark matter mass and its interaction cross-section with the nucleons) by probing gravitational waves from transmuted Sun-like stars that are in close binaries. Our projected constraints depend on several astrophysical uncertainties, nevertheless, are competitive with the existing constraints obtained from cosmological measurements as well as terrestrial direct searches, demonstrating a notable science-case for these space-based gravitational wave detectors as probes of particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Deriving Neutron Star Equation of State from AdS/QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars are among the main targets for gravitational wave observatories, however, their equation of state is still not well established. Mainly phenomenological models with many parameters are widely used by far, while theoretical models are not so practical. In arXiv:1902.08477, a theoretical equation of state with only one parameter is derived from Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, as an application of AdS/QCD, where pointlike instanton case is taken into consideration. When the tidal deformability constraint from gravitational wave event is satisfied, the maximum mass is about 1.7 solar masses. Now we upgrade this model to instanton gas, with one more variable, the instanton width. This is not naively a free parameter, but a function of the chemical potential. Thus we end up with a more complicated and accurate model, but still with only one adjustable parameter. In this case, we find the maximum mass becomes 1.85 solar masses. This is an encouraging result, as a theoretically derived model.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic $W$ Decay to the $B$ Meson with Lepton Pairs in Heavy Quark Effective Theory Factorization upto $\mathcal{O}$$(\alpha_s)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of heavy-light meson production within the framework of heavy quark effective theory (HQET) factorization, we extend the factorization formalism for a rather complicated process $W^+\to B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ in the limit of a non-zero invariant squared-mass of dilepton, $q^2$, at the lowest order in $1/m_b$ up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$. The purpose of the current study is to extend the HQET factorization formula for the $W^+\to B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ process and subsequently compute the form factors for this channel up to next-to-leading-order corrections in $\alpha_s$. We explicitly show the amplitude of the $W^+\to B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ process can also be factorized into a convolution between the perturbatively calculable hard-scattering kernel and the non-perturbative yet universal light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) defined in HQET. The validity of HQET factorization depends on the assumed scale hierarchy $m_W \sim m_b \gg \Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$. Within the HQET framework, we evaluate the form factors associated with the $W^+ \rightarrow B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ process, providing insights into its phenomenology. In addition, we also perform an exploratory phenomenological study on $W^+ \rightarrow B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ by employing an exponential model for the LCDAs for $B^+$ meson. Our findings reveal that the branching ratio for $W^+ \rightarrow B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ is below $10^{-10}$. Although the branching ratios are small, this channel in high luminosity LHC experiments may serve to further constraints the value of $\lambda_B$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Muonization by Active-Sterile Neutrino Mixing in Protoneutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\nu_\mu$-$\nu_s$ and $\bar\nu_\mu$-$\bar\nu_s$ mixing in the protoneutron star (PNS) created in a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We point out the importance of the feedback on the general composition of the PNS in addition to the obvious feedback on the $\nu_\mu$ lepton number. We show that for our adopted mixing parameters $\delta m^2\sim 10^2$~keV$^2$ and $\sin^2 2\theta$ consistent with the current constraints, sterile neutrino production is dominated by the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein conversion of $\bar\nu_\mu$ into $\bar\nu_s$ and that the subsequent escape of $\bar\nu_s$ increases the $\nu_\mu$ lepton number, which in turn enhances muonization of the PNS primarily through $\nu_\mu+n\to p+\mu^-$. While these results are qualitatively robust, their quantitative effects on the dynamics and active neutrino emission of CCSNe should be evaluated by including $\nu_\mu$-$\nu_s$ and $\bar\nu_\mu$-$\bar\nu_s$ mixing in the simulations.</description>

Abstract: We recently pointed out that power measurements of single quasiparticle devices can be used to detect dark matter. These devices have the lowest known energy thresholds, far surpassing standard direct detection experiments, requiring energy deposition above only about an meV. We calculate dark matter induced quasiparticle densities in transmon qubits, and use the latest transmon qubit measurements that provide one of the strongest existing lab-based bounds on dark matter-nucleon scattering below about 100 MeV. We strongly constrain sub-component dark matter, using both a dark matter population thermalized in the Earth as well as the dark matter wind from the Galactic halo. We demonstrate future potential sensitivities using devices with low quasiparticle densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantify the effects of light spin-zero particles with pseudoscalar couplings to leptons and scalar couplings to nucleons on the evolution of solar neutrinos. In this scenario the matter potential sourced by the nucleons in the Sun's matter gives rise to spin precession of the relativistic neutrino ensemble. As such the effects in the solar observables are different if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles. For Dirac neutrinos the spin-flavour precession results into left-handed neutrino to right-handed neutrino (i.e., active-sterile) oscillations, while for Majorana neutrinos it results into left-handed neutrino to right-handed antineutrino (i.e., active-active) oscillations. In both cases this leads to distortions in the solar neutrino spectrum which we use to derive constraints on the allowed values of the mediator mass and couplings via a global analysis of the solar neutrino data. In addition for Majorana neutrinos spin-flavour precession results into a potentially observable flux of solar electron antineutrinos at the Earth which we quantify and constrain with the existing bounds from Borexino and KamLAND.</description>

Abstract: We consider all magnetic monopoles that could have settled in the Standard Model after descending from a generic microscopic theory. These monopoles have Standard Model quantum numbers, are stable, and we also require that their magnetic fluxes are consistent with the electroweak symmetry breaking. Scattering processes involving quarks, leptons and protons on these monopoles are studied using partial waves decomposition. These processes in the lowest partial wave are known to be unsuppressed by the monopole mass and are relevant for monopole catalysis of proton decay. We provide estimates for scattering cross-sections and investigate and confirm the applicability of the twisted sector approach to scattering processes on these Standard Model monopoles. We find that the SM monopole catalysis processes are universal and model-independent.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis via QCD preheating with nonadiabatic baryon chemical potential</title>

Abstract: The chiral phase transition in QCD can be supercooled in the thermal history of the universe to be instantaneously out-of equilibrium, if QCD is coupled to a dark QCD sector exhibiting the dark chiral phase transition of the first order. In that case the QCD sigma meson field (as the chiral order parameter, or the light quark condensate) starts to roll in a nonadiabatic way down to the true QCD vacuum. Meanwhile a dynamic baryonic chemical potential can be generated solely within QCD, which is governed by the dynamic motion of the QCD sigma meson field, analogously to the spontaneous baryogenesis or the leptogenesis via the Higgs or axionlike relaxation scenario. When QCD is further allowed to communicate with a dark fermion with mass of order of 1 GeV and the baryon number violating coupling to neutron, the nonadiabatic QCD sigma motion along with the nonadiabatic baryon chemical potential can trigger the preheating and produce the baryon number asymmetry. We discuss this scenario in details to find that the QCD-induced dynamic baryon chemical potential plays a significant role for the QCD preheating and the baryogenesis, which yields the desired amount of the asymmetry today consistently with current astrophysical, cosmological, and terrestrial experimental constraints. Cosmological and phenomenological consequences characteristic to the present scenario are also addressed.</description>

Abstract: Positronium is the simplest bound state, built of an electron and a positron. Studies of positronium in vacuum and its decays in medium tell us about Quantum Electrodynamics, QED, and about the structure of matter and biological processes of living organisms at the nanoscale, respectively. Spectroscopic measurements constrain our understanding of QED bound state theory. Searches for rare decays and measurements of the effect of gravitation on positronium are used to look for new physics phenomena. In biological materials positronium decays are sensitive to the inter- and intra-molecular structure and to the metabolism of living organisms ranging from single cells to human beings. This leads to new ideas of positronium imaging in medicine using the fact that during positron emission tomography (PET) as much as 40% of positron annihilation occurs through the production of positronium atoms inside the patient's body. A new generation of the high sensitivity and multi-photon total-body PET systems opens perspectives for clinical applications of positronium as a biomarker of tissue pathology and the degree of tissue oxidation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing the applicability of hydrodynamic expansions close to phase transition points is crucial from either theoretical or phenomenological points of view. We explore this within the gauge/gravity duality, using the Einstein-Klein-Gordon model, a bottom-up string theory construction. This model incorporates a parameter, $B_4$, that simulates different types of phase transitions in the strongly coupled field theory existing at the boundary. We thoroughly examine the thermodynamics and dynamics of time-dependent, linearized perturbations in the spin-2, spin-1, and spin-0 sectors. Our findings suggest that "hydrodynamic series breakdown near transition points" is valid exclusively for second-order phase transitions, not for crossovers or first-order phase transitions. Additionally, we observe that the high-temperature and low-temperature limits of the radius of convergence for the hydrodynamic series ($q^2_c$) are equal. We also discover that the relationship $(\text{Max}\vert q^2_c \vert)_{\text{spin-2}} &lt; (\text{Max}\vert q^2_c\vert)_{\text{spin-0}} &lt; (\text{Max}\vert q^2_c \vert)_{\text{spin-1}}$ is consistent for different spin sectors, regardless of the phase transition type. At the chaos point, we observe the emergence of pole-skipping behavior for both gravity and scalar perturbations at $\omega_n = - 2\pi T n i$. Lastly, comparing the chaos momentum with $q^2_c$, we find that $q^2_{ps} &lt; q^2_c$, except for extremely high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Generalized Models for Inflationary Preheating: Oscillations and Symmetries</title>

Abstract: The paradigm of the inflationary universe provides a possible explanation for several observed cosmological properties. In order for such solutions to be successful, the universe must convert the energy stored in the inflaton potential into standard model particles through a process known as reheating. In this paper, we reconsider the reheating process for the case where the inflaton potential respects an approximate (but spontaneously broken) conformal symmetry during the reheating epoch. After reviewing the Effective Field Theory of Reheating, we present solutions for the nonlinear oscillations of the inflaton field, derive the corresponding Hill's equation for the coupled reheating field, and determine the stability diagram for parametric resonance. For this class of models -- the simplest realization being a scalar field with a quartic term -- the expansion of the universe drives the coupled field toward a more unstable part of parameter space, in contrast to the standard case. We also generalize this class of models to include quadratic breaking terms in the potential during the reheating epoch and address the process of stability in that universality class of models.</description>

      <title>Non-perpetual Eternal Inflation and the Emergent de Sitter Swampland Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel correlation, $n_s$ - $\Delta N$, connecting CMB parameters to the required total e-folds for eternal inflation. This correlation provides a robust tool for evaluating eternal (string) inflation models using CMB data and explores the impact of quantum fluctuations on non-attractor phases. By generalizing eternal inflation criteria, our parameterization simplifies rigorous testing of predictions and reveals a link between refined de Sitter conjecture parameters and the eternal nature of the cosmic landscape. This points to a general tendency towards eternal behavior in low-energy effective field theories within the landscape, opening the possibility for our cosmic stage to potentially embrace a 'multiverse' scenario.</description>

      <title>Brightest Cluster Galaxy Offsets in Cold Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of offsets between the brightest cluster galaxies of galaxy clusters and the centroid of their dark matter distributions is a promising probe of the underlying dark matter physics. In particular, since this distribution is sensitive to the shape of the potential in galaxy cluster cores, it constitutes a test of dark matter self-interaction on the largest mass scales in the universe. We examine these offsets in three suites of modern cosmological simulations; IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG and BAHAMAS. For clusters above $10^{14}\rm{M_\odot}$, we examine the dependence of the offset distribution on gravitational softening length, the method used to identify centroids, redshift, mass, baryonic physics, and establish the stability of our results with respect to various nuisance parameter choices. We find that offsets are overwhelmingly measured to be smaller than the minimum converged length scale in each simulation, with a median offset of $\sim1\rm{kpc}$ in the highest resolution simulation considered, TNG300-1, which uses a gravitational softening length of $1.48\rm{kpc}$. We also find that centroids identified via source extraction on smoothed dark matter and stellar particle data are consistent with the potential minimum, but that observationally relevant methods sensitive to cluster strong gravitational lensing scales, or those using gas as a tracer for the potential can overestimate offsets by factors of $\sim10$ and $\sim30$, respectively. This has the potential to reduce tensions with existing offset measurements which have served as evidence for a nonzero dark matter self-interaction cross section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow first-order phase transitions generate large inhomogeneities that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). We show that the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum then consists of a primary component sourced by bubble collisions and a secondary one induced by large perturbations. The latter gives the dominant peak if $\beta/H_0 &lt; 12$, impacting, in particular, the interpretation of the recent PTA data. The GW signal associated with a particular PBH population is stronger than in typical scenarios because of a negative non-Gaussianity of the perturbations and it has a distinguishable shape with two peaks.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the elastic scattering cross section between dark matter and protons using the DES Year 3 weak lensing data. This scattering induces a dark acoustic oscillation structure in the matter power spectra. To address non-linear effects at low redshift, we utilize principal component analysis alongside a limited set of $N$-body simulations, improving the reliability of our matter power spectrum prediction. We further perform a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to derive the upper bounds on the DM-proton elastic scattering cross-section, assuming different velocity dependencies. Our results, presented as the first Frequentist upper limits, are compared with the ones obtained by Bayesian approach. Compared with the upper limits derived from the Planck cosmic microwave background data, our findings from DES Year 3 data exhibit improvements of up to a factor of five. In addition, we forecast the future sensitivities of the China Space Station Telescope, the upcoming capabilities of this telescope could improve the current limits by approximately one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Constraining solar electron number density via neutrino flavor data at Borexino</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the deep solar interior, and the more exotic environs of core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) and binary neutron-star (NS) mergers, is of keen interest in many avenues of research. To date, this physics is based largely on simulations via forward integration. While these simulations provide valuable constraints, it could be insightful to adopt the "inverse approach" as a point of comparison. Within this paradigm, parameters of the solar interior are not output based on an assumed model, but rather are inferred based on real data. We take the specific case of solar electron number density, which historically is taken as output from the standard solar model. We show how one may arrive at an independent constraint on that density profile based on available neutrino flavor data from the Earth-based Borexino experiment. The inference technique's ability to offer a unique lens on physics can be extended to other datasets, and to analogous questions for CCSN and NS mergers, albeit with simulated data.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor potentials in loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform in this work an analysis of the background dynamics for $\alpha$-attractor models in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Particular attention is given to the determination of the duration of the inflationary phase that is preceded by the quantum bounce in these models. From an analysis of the general predictions for these models, it is shown that we can be able to put constraints in the parameter $\alpha$ of the potentials and also on the quantum model itself, especially the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. In particular, the constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral tilt of the cosmological perturbations limit the $\alpha$ parameter of the potentials to values such that $\alpha_{n=0} \lesssim 10$, $\alpha_{n=1} \lesssim 17$ and $\alpha_{n=2} \lesssim 67$, for the $\alpha$ attractors T, E, and $n=2$ models, respectively. Using the constraints on the minimal amount of e-folds of expansion from the quantum bounce up to the end of inflation leads to the upper bounds for the Barbero-Immirzi parameter for the $\alpha$-attractor models studied in this work: $\gamma_{n=0} \lesssim 51.2$, $\gamma_{n=1}\lesssim 63.4$ and $\gamma_{n=2} \lesssim 64.2$, which are obtained when fixing the parameter $\alpha$ in the potential at the values saturating the upper bounds given above for each model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the group formed by finite renormalizations as an infinite-dimensional Lie group. It is demonstrated that for the finite renormalization of the gauge coupling constant its generators $\hat L_n$ with $n\ge 1$ satisfy the commutation relations of the Witt algebra and, therefore, form its subalgebra. The commutation relations are also written for the more general case when finite renormalizations are made for both the coupling constant and matter fields. We also construct the generator of the Abelian subgroup corresponding to the changes of the renormalization scale. The explicit expressions for the renormalization group generators are written in the case when they act on the $\beta$-function and the anomalous dimension. It is explained how the finite changes of these functions under the finite renormalizations can be obtained with the help of the exponential map.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning method developed for the fast simulation of calorimeter detector response, adapting vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). Our model adopts a two-stage generation strategy: initially compressing geometry-aware calorimeter data into a discrete latent space, followed by the application of a sequence model to learn and generate the latent tokens. Extensive experimentation on the Calo-challenge dataset underscores the efficiency of our approach, showcasing a remarkable improvement in the generation speed compared with conventional method by a factor of 2000. Remarkably, our model achieves the generation of calorimeter showers within milliseconds. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative evaluations across various metrics are performed to validate physics performance of generation.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is represented by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <title>An indirect search for dark matter with a combined analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies from VERITAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature and identity of dark matter is a key goal in the physics community. In the case that TeV-scale dark matter particles decay or annihilate into standard model particles, very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays (greater than 100 GeV) will be present in the final state. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array that can indirectly detect VHE gamma rays in an energy range of 100 GeV to &gt; 30 TeV. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are ideal candidates in the search for dark matter due to their high dark matter content, high mass-to-light ratios, and their low gamma-ray fluxes from astrophysical processes. This study uses a legacy data set of 638 hours collected on 17 dSphs, built over 11 years with an observing strategy optimized according to the dark matter content of the targets. The study addresses a broad dark matter particle mass range, extending from 200 GeV to 30 PeV. In the absence of a detection, we set the upper limits on the dark matter velocity-weighted annihilation cross section.</description>

Abstract: In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31&lt;w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.</description>
