      <title>Moir\'e Periodic and Quasiperiodic Crystals in Heterostructures of Twisted Bilayer Graphene and Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacking two atomic crystals with a twist between their crystal axes produces moir\'e potentials that modify the electronic properties. Here we show that double moir\'e potentials generated by superposing three atomic crystals create a new class of tunable quasiperiodic structures that alter the symmetry and spatial distribution of the electronic wavefunctions. By using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to study twisted bilayer graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we unveil a moir\'e phase diagram defined by the lattice constants of the two moir\'e lattices (graphene-on-graphene and graphene-on-hBN), comprising both commensurate periodic and incommensurate quasiperiodic crystals. Remarkably, the 1:1 commensurate crystal, which should theoretically exist at only one point on this phase diagram, is observed over a wide range, demonstrating an unexpected self-alignment mechanism. The incommensurate crystals include quasicrystals, which are quasiperiodic and feature a Bravais-forbidden dodecagonal symmetry, and intercrystals, which are also quasiperiodic but lack forbidden symmetries. This rich variety of tunable double moir\'e structures offers a synthetic platform for exploring the unique electronic properties of quasiperiodic crystals, which are rarely found in nature.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal spin-wave dispersion in magnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal spin-wave propagation in bilayer ferromagnetic systems has attracted significant attention due to its potential to precisely quantify material parameters as well as for applications in magnonic logic and information processing. In this study we investigate the nonreciprocity of spin-wave dispersions in heterostructures consisting of two distinct ferromagnetic materials, focusing on the influence of saturation magnetization and thickness of the magnetic layers. We exploit Brillouin light scattering to confirm numerical calculations which are conducted with the finite element software TETRAX. An extensive numerical analysis reveals that the nonreciprocal behavior is strongly influenced by the changing material parameters, with asymmetry in the spin-wave propagation direction reaching several GHz under optimized conditions. Our findings demonstrate that tailoring the bilayer composition enables precise control over nonreciprocity, providing a pathway for engineering efficient unidirectional spin-wave devices. These results offer a deeper understanding of hybrid ferromagnetic systems and open avenues for designing advanced magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Geometric transport signatures of strained multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal coupling of strain to Dirac and Weyl semimetals, and its modeling as a pseudo-gauge field has been extensively studied, resulting in several proposed topological transport signatures. In this work, we study the effects of strain on higher winding number Weyl semimetals and show that strain is not a pseudo-gauge field for any winding number larger than one. We focus on the double-Weyl semimetal as an illustrative example to show that the application of strain splits the higher winding number Weyl nodes and produces an anisotropic Fermi surface. Specifically, the Fermi surface of the double-Weyl semimetal acquires nematic order. By extending chiral kinetic theory for such nematic fields, we determine the effective gauge fields acting on the system and show how strain induces anisotropy and affects the geometry of the semi-classical phase space of the double-Weyl semimetal. Further, the strain-induced deformation of the Weyl nodes results in transport signatures related to the covariant coupling of the strain tensor to the geometric tensor associated with the Weyl nodes giving rise to strain-dependent dissipative corrections to the longitudinal as well as the Hall conductance. Thus, by extension, we show that in multi-Weyl semimetals, strain produces geometric signatures rather than topological signatures. Further, we highlight that the most general way to view strain is as a symmetry-breaking field rather than a pseudo-gauge field.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Topological Phase Transition of the Bosonic Kitaev Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bosonic Kitaev chain, just like its fermionic counterpart, has extraordinary properties. For example, it displays the non-Hermitian skin effect even without dissipation when the system is Hermitian. This means that all eigenmodes are exponentially localized to the edges of the chain. This is possible since the $\hat{x}$ and $\hat p$ quadratures decouple such that each of them is governed by a non-Hermitian dynamical matrix. In the topological phase of the model, the modes conspire to lead to exponential amplification of coherent light that depends on its phase and direction. In this work, we study the robustness of this topological amplification to on-site dissipation. We look at uniform and non-uniform dissipation and study the effect of different configurations. We find remarkable resilience to dissipation in some configurations, while in others the dissipation causes a topological phase transition which eliminates the exponential amplification. For example, when the dissipation is placed on every other site, the system remains topological even for very large dissipation which exceeds the system's non-Hermitian gap and the exponential amplification persists. On the other hand, dividing the chain into unit cells of an odd number of sites and placing dissipation on the first site leads to a topological phase transition at some critical value of the dissipation. Our work thus provides insights into topological amplification of multiband systems and sets explicit limits on the bosonic Kitaev chain's ability to act as a multimode quantum sensor.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable spin Hall effect in trilayer graphene/group-IV monochalcogenide van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic devices require materials that facilitate effective spin transport, generation, and detection. In this regard, graphene emerges as an ideal candidate for long-distance spin transport owing to its minimal spin-orbit coupling, which, however, limits its capacity for effective spin manipulation. This problem can be overcome by putting spin-orbit coupling materials in close contact to graphene leading to spin-orbit proximity and, consequently, efficient spin-to-charge conversion through mechanisms such as the spin Hall effect. Here, we report and quantify the gate-dependent spin Hall effect in trilayer graphene proximitized with tin sulfide (SnS), a group-IV monochalcogenide which has recently been predicted to be a viable alternative to transition-metal dichalcogenides for inducing strong spin-orbit coupling in graphene. The spin Hall angle exhibits a maximum around the charge neutrality point of graphene up to room temperature. Our findings expand the library of materials that induce spin-orbit coupling in graphene to a new class, group-IV monochalcogenides, thereby highlighting the potential of two-dimensional materials to pave the way for the development of innovative spin-based devices and future technological applications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of DC Current-Biased Josephson Junctions with Arbitrary Transparencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic theory of DC current-biased Josephson junctions applicable to arbitrary junction transparencies, resolving long debates on subharmonic gap structure (SGS). Our approach extends beyond the existing theories relying on phenomenological models or the lowest order perturbation valid for opaque junctions. In discord with experiments, those theories fail to obtain all singularities of SGS at voltages equalling integer fractions of twice the superconducting gap. We address this limitation using a microscopic Floquet approach applicable to junctions with arbitrary transparencies, capturing all subharmonic singularities. We explain the origin of the subharmonics using two complementary pictures, in time domain exploiting the interference of non-equilibrium current pulses, and in frequency domain using a generalisation of multiple Andreev reflections.</description>

      <title>Emission and Coherent Control of Levitons in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flying qubits encode quantum information in propagating modes instead of stationary discrete states. Although photonic flying qubits are available, the weak interaction between photons limits the efficiency of conditional quantum gates. Conversely, electronic flying qubits can use Coulomb interactions, but the weaker quantum coherence in conventional semiconductors has hindered their realization. In this work, we engineered on-demand injection of a single electronic flying qubit state and its manipulation over the Bloch sphere. The flying qubit is a Leviton propagating in quantum Hall edge channels of a high-mobility graphene monolayer. Although single-shot qubit readout and two-qubit operations are still needed for a viable manipulation of flying qubits, the coherent manipulation of an itinerant electronic state at the single-electron level presents a highly promising alternative to conventional qubits.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and electronic properties of 1D hybrid nanoobjects composed of alternating polycyclic hydrocarbon regions and double carbon chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed recently that 1D hybrid nanoobjects consisting of alternating double carbon chains and polycyclic carbon regions can be obtained from graphene nanoribbons of alternating width by electron irradiation. Here, based on density functional theory calculations, we show that magnetic and electronic properties of such nanoobjects can be changed dramatically by modifying the chain length and edge structure of polycyclic regions and this opens wide possibilities for spintronic applications. Nanoobjects composed of polycyclic regions with dangling bonds and even chains are found to behave as magnetic semiconductors that can generate spin-polarized currents. Band gaps of nanoobjects with odd chains change considerably upon switching between magnetic states making them promising for magnetic tunnel junctions. We also demonstrate that use of a hybrid exchange-correlation functional is important to properly describe stability of magnetic states, band gaps and synergistic effects of nanoobject components leading, for example, to magnetism in even chains.</description>

      <title>Efficiency and Mechanism of heat flux rectification with non-reciprocal surface waves in Weyl-Semi-Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanism of near-field heat transfer rectification between two Weyl semimetal nanoparticles and a planar Weyl semimetal substrate via the coupling to non-reciprocal surface modes. We show that depending on the distance between the nanoparticles there can be a heat flux rectification with ratios of about 6000 which are much higher than previously predicted rectification ratio of 2673. Furthermore, we identify a previously overlooked range of forward rectification and a range of strong backward rectification with rectification ratios larger than 8000 for relatively small Weyl node separations. We investigate the mechanism behind this large heat flux rectification.</description>

      <title>Carrier localization in defected areas of (Cd, Mn)Te quantum well investigated via Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance employed in the microscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of carrier localization on three quantities sensitive to carrier gas density at the micrometer scale: charged exciton (X+) oscillator strength, local free carrier conductivity, and the Knight shift. The last two are observed in a micrometer-scale, spatially resolved optically detected magnetic resonance experiment (ODMR). On the surface of MBE-grown (Cd,Mn)Te quantum well we identify defected areas in the vicinity of dislocations. We find that these areas show a much lower conductivity signal while maintaining the same Knight shift values as the pristine areas of the quantum well. We attribute this behavior to carrier localization in the defected regions.</description>

      <title>Large trion binding energy in monolayer WS$_2$ via strain-enhanced electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides and related layered materials in their monolayer and a few layers thicknesses regime provide a promising optoelectronic platform for exploring the excitonic- and many-body physics. Strain engineering has emerged as a potent technique for tuning the excitonic properties favorable for exciton-based devices. We have investigated the effects of nanoparticle-induced local strain on the optical properties of exciton, $X^0$, and trion, $X^\text{-}$, in monolayer WS$_2$. Biaxial tensile strain up to 2.0% was quantified and verified by monitoring the changes in three prominent Raman modes of WS$_2$: E${^1_{2g}}$($\Gamma$), A$_{1g}$, and 2LA(M). We obtained a remarkable increase of 34 meV in $X^\text{-}$ binding energy with an average tuning rate of 17.5 $\pm$ 2.5 meV/% strain across all the samples irrespective of the surrounding dielectric environment of monolayer WS$_2$ and the sample preparation conditions. At the highest tensile strain of $\approx$2%, we have achieved the largest binding energy $\approx$100 meV for $X^\text{-}$, leading to its enhanced emission intensity and thermal stability. By investigating strain-induced linewidth broadening and deformation potentials of both $X^0$ and $X^\text{-}$ emission, we elucidate that the increase in $X^\text{-}$ binding energy is due to strain-enhanced electron-phonon coupling. This work holds relevance for future $X^\text{-}$-based nano-opto-electro-mechanical systems and devices.</description>

      <title>Curvature-induced skyrmion deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we perform a systematic analysis of equilibrium solutions for Neel and Bloch skyrmions on a cylindrical shell and demonstrate that both experience curvature-induced deformation. Considering the curvature as a small perturbation and applying the first-order perturbation theory we decompose the deformation on the radial symmetrical and elliptical parts. The orientation of the elliptically deformed skyrmion shape depends on the skyrmion type. For Neel skyrmion, the long semi-axis of the ellipse is oriented along or perpendicularly to the cylinder generatrix depending on the signs of the curvature and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. In contrast, the elliptical shape of the Bloch skyrmion makes an angle $\pm\pi/4$ with the generatrix. The theoretically predicted skyrmion shapes are compared to those obtained from the numerical spin-lattice simulations. Using simulations we also investigate the nonlinear regime beyond the applicability of the first-order perturbation theory. In particular, we demonstrate that Neel skyrmion can collapse for a large enough curvature.</description>

      <title>Tunable Josephson voltage source for quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy voltage sources can be a limiting factor for fundamental physics experiments as well as for device applications in quantum information, mesoscopic circuits, magnetometry, and other fields. The best commercial DC voltage sources can be programmed to approximately six digits and have intrinsic noise in the microvolt range. On the other hand the noise level in metrological Josephson-junction based voltage standards is sub-femtovolt. Although such voltage standards can be considered "noiseless," they are generally not designed for continuous tuning of the output voltage nor for supplying current to a load at cryogenic temperatures. We propose a Josephson effect based voltage source, as opposed to a voltage standard, operating in the 30-160 uV range which can supply over 100 nA of current to loads at milli-Kelvin temperatures. We describe the operating principle, the sample design, and the calibration procedure to obtain continuous tunability. We show current-voltage characteristics of the device, demonstrate how the voltage can be adjusted without DC control connections to room-temperature electronics, and showcase an experiment coupling the source to a mesoscopic load, a small Josephson junction. Finally we characterize the performance of our source by measuring the voltage noise at the load, 50 pV RMS, which is attributed to parasitic resistances in the cabling. This work establishes the use of the Josephson effect for voltage biasing extremely sensitive quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that formulating the composite-fermion theory of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect in terms of quaternions greatly expands its reach and opens the door into many interesting issues that were previously beyond the reach of quantitative theoretical investigation. As an illustration, we investigate the possibility of a nematic or a charge-density wave instability of the composite-fermion Fermi sea at half-filled Landau level and of the nearby FQH states by looking for a magneto-roton instability. Our quaternion formulation of the FQH effect has been inspired by mathematical developments in the theoretical analyses of gravitational wave modes and cosmic microwave background radiation, where an important role is played by spin-weighted spherical harmonics which are nothing but monopole harmonics appearing in the spherical geometry for the FQH effect.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Tunnel Diode Oscillator for Qubit Readout Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a tunnel diode oscillator and characterized its performance, highlighting its potential applications in the quantum state readout of electrons insemiconductors and electrons on liquid helium. This cryogenic microwave source demonstrates significant scalability potential for large-scale qubit readout systems due to its compact design and low power consumption of only 1 uW, making it suitable for integration on the 10 mK stage of a dilution refrigerator. The tunnel diode oscillator exhibits superior amplitude stability compared to commercial microwave sources. The output frequency is centered around 140 MHz, commonly used for qubit readout of electrons in semiconductors, with a frequency tunability of 20 MHz achieved using a varactor diode. Furthermore, the phase noise was significantly improved by replacing the commercially available voltage source with a lead-acid battery, achieving a measured phase noise of -115 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset.</description>

      <title>Thermomagnetic anomalies in quantum magnon transport caused by tunable junction geometries in cold atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study magnon-driven spin and heat transport in a magnetic linear junction (MLJ) formed by two ferromagnets in optical lattices linked via linearly aligned bonds. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we uncover that under weak effective Zeeman fields, where Bose-Einstein statistics of magnons dominate, magnonic criticality dramatically enhances spin and thermal conductances. These singular transport properties depend on the junction geometry, and the transport properties qualitatively differ between the linear junction in this study and the point contact in our previous work. The quantum-enhanced conductances result in the breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. In the classical regime at temperatures much lower than magnon energy gaps, we find that a magnonic Lorenz number becomes independent of temperature yet dependent on junction geometry, sharply contrasting with the universal WF law for Fermi liquids. We also find that the interface geometry of MLJ decouples spin and heat relaxations between ferromagnets with decay times insensitive to temperature and effective Zeeman fields. These dynamics reveal junction-geometry-sensitive magnon transport distinct from Fermi liquids, paving the way for new avenues in thermomagnetic research leveraging the tunability of cold atomic systems.</description>

Abstract: We analyze conductance of a two-leg ladder connected with fermionic reservoirs, focusing on the decoherence effect induced by the reservoirs. In the absence of decoherence the system exhibits both bound states in the continuum and Fano resonances. We found that the Fano resonances in transmittance are robust against decoherence, at the same time decoherence prevents collapse of resonances induced by bound states in the continuum.</description>

      <title>Dirac Fermions and Topological Phases in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Dirac fermion theory for topological phases in magnetic topological insulator films. The theory is based on exact solutions of the energies and the wave functions for an effective model of the three-dimensional topological insulator (TI) film. It is found that the TI film consists of a pair of massless or massive Dirac fermions for the surface states, and a series of massive Dirac fermions for the bulk states. The massive Dirac fermion always carries zero or integer quantum Hall conductance when the valence band is fully occupied while the massless Dirac fermion carries a one-half quantum Hall conductance when the chemical potential is located around the Dirac point for a finite range. The magnetic exchange interaction in the magnetic layers in the film can be used to manipulate either the masses or chirality of the Dirac fermions and gives rise to distinct topological phases, which cover the known topological insulating phases, such as quantum anomalous Hall effect, quantum spin Hall effect and axion effect, and also the novel topological metallic phases, such as half quantized Hall effect, half quantum mirror Hall effect, and metallic quantum anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Connecting Q to TCF for MEMS and piezoelectric resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two critical characteristics for any MEMS resonator are the quality factor ($Q$) and the temperature coefficient of frequency ($TCF$). The connection between $Q$ and $TCF$ is demonstrated here with a phenomenological anharmonic oscillator model. Specifically, it is shown that the same nonlinear terms responsible for the $TCF$ set an upper limit on the resonator's $Q$. A concise formula is found to estimate this loss and is shown to be closely related to Woodruff's formula for Akhiezer damping. The use of this formula is illustrated by extending the model to an important class of MEMS; piezoelectric resonators. Finally, the model is applied to published data for an AlN-on-diamond piezoelectric resonator. The focus here is on MEMS resonators, but the method should apply broadly to any resonance with non-zero $TCF$.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Two-dimensional Weyl Fermions in Air-Stable Monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weyl semimetals represent a distinct category of topological materials wherein the low-energy excitations appear as the long-sought Weyl fermions. Exotic transport and optical properties are expected because of the chiral anomaly and linear energy-momentum dispersion. While three-dimensional Weyl semimetals have been successfully realized, the quest for their two-dimensional (2D) counterparts is ongoing. Here, we report the realization of 2D Weyl fermions in monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$, which has strong spin-orbit coupling and lacks inversion symmetry, by combined angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, second harmonic generation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and first-principles calculations. The giant Rashba splitting and band inversion lead to the emergence of three pairs of critical Weyl cones. Moreover, monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$ exhibits excellent chemical stability in ambient conditions, which is critical for future device applications. The discovery of 2D Weyl fermions in monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$ opens up new possibilities for designing and fabricating novel spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Shift spin photocurrents in two-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of nonlinear spin photocurrents by circularly polarized light in two-dimensional systems is theoretically investigated by calculating the shift spin conductivities. In time-reversal symmetric systems, shift spin photocurrent can be generated under the irradiation of circularly polarized light , while the shift charge photoccurrent is forbidden by symmetry. We show that $k$-cubic Rashba-Dresselhaus system, the $k$-cubic Wurtzite system and Dirac surface states can support the shift spin photocurrent. By symmetry analysis, it is found that in the Rashba type spin-orbit coupled systems, mirror symmetry requires that the spin polarization and the moving direction of the spin photocurrent are parallel, which we name as longitudinal shift spin photocurrent. The Dirac surface states with warping term exhibit mirror symmetry, similar to the Rashba type system, and support longitudinal shift spin photocurrent. In contrast, in the Dresselhaus type spin-orbit coupled systems, the parity-mirror symmetry requires that the spin polarization and the moving direction of the spin photocurrent are perpendicular, which we dub as transverse shift spin photocurrent. Furthermore, we find that the shift spin photocurrent always vanishes in any $k$-linear spin-orbit coupled system unless the Zeeman coupling is turned on. We find that the splitting of degenerate energy bands due to Zeeman coupling $\mu_z$ causes the van Hove singularity. The resulting shift spin conductivity has a significant peak at optical frequency $\omega=2\mu_z/\hbar$.</description>

      <title>Analytical model for the frequency behavior of two distinct modes in nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nano-constriction spin-Hall nano-oscillators (NC-SHNOs) have garnered considerable interest due to their potential use as efficient and adjustable nano-sized sources of microwave signals, with high-frequency tunability, adaptable design layout, and CMOS compatibility. In order to facilitate system- and circuit-level designs based on the NC-SHNOs, it is essential to have an analytical model capable of predicting the behavior of the NC-SHNO. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model to describe the frequency behavior of a single NC-SHNO in an in-plane magnetic field while considering the Oersted field. The model is divided into two regions based on the direct current value: the "linear-like" and "bullet" modes. Each region is characterized by distinct concepts and equations. The first region, the "linear-like mode," emerges from the nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area of the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized "bullet mode," exhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a decrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO, and the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the ``pair-breaking scattering interference" as a general source of coherence peak modulations in superconductors. Assuming this mechanism, we present a simple physical picture for the coherence peak modulations in overdoped cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi-2223), ferromagnetic iron pnictide EuRbFe$_4$As$_4$ (Eu-1144), and kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, and Cs). Specifically, we explain the wavevectors, the particle-hole symmetry, and the dependence on the internal or external Zeeman-field of the coherence peak modulations. This work is intended as a cautious reminder to the scientific community when asserting the existence of a pair density wave phenomenon in the absence of tunneling conductance modulations in the normal state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, following the early developments on maximally localized Wannier functions, an ecosystem of electronic-structure simulation techniques and software packages leveraging the Wannier representation has flourished. This environment includes codes to obtain Wannier functions and interfaces with first-principles simulation software, as well as an increasing number of related post-processing packages. Wannier functions can be obtained for isolated or extended systems (both crystalline and disordered), and can be used to understand chemical bonding, to characterize electric polarization, magnetization, and topology, or as an optimal basis set, providing very accurate interpolations in reciprocal space or large-scale Hamiltonians in real space. In this review, we summarize the current landscape of techniques, materials properties and simulation codes based on Wannier functions that have been made accessible to the research community, and that are now well integrated into what we term a \emph{Wannier function software ecosystem}. First, we introduce the theory and practicalities of Wannier functions, starting from their broad domains of applicability to advanced minimization methods using alternative approaches beyond maximal localization. Then we define the concept of a Wannier ecosystem and its interactions and interoperability with many quantum simulations engines and post-processing packages. We focus on some of the key properties and capabilities that are empowered by such ecosystem\textemdash from band interpolations and large-scale simulations to electronic transport, Berryology, topology, electron-phonon couplings, dynamical mean-field theory, embedding, and Koopmans functionals\textemdash concluding with the current status of interoperability and automation.

      <title>Exact quantization of nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a consistent geometrical description previously introduced in Parra-Rodriguez et al. (2024), we present an exact method for obtaining canonically quantizable Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear, nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks. We identify and classify singularities arising in the quest for Hamiltonian descriptions of general quasi-lumped element networks via the Faddeev-Jackiw technique. We offer systematic solutions to cases previously considered singular--a major challenge in the context of canonical circuit quantization. The solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced classical circuit-state manifold, i.e., a mix of flux and charge fields and functions. Starting from the geometrical description of the transmission line, we provide a complete program including lines coupled to one-port lumped-element networks, as well as multiple lines connected to multiport nonreciprocal lumped-element networks, with intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff. On the way we naturally extend the canonical quantization of transmission lines coupled through frequency-dependent, nonreciprocal linear systems, such as practical circulators. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method seamlessly facilitates the characterization of general nonreciprocal, dissipative linear environments. This is achieved by extending the Caldeira-Leggett formalism, using continuous limits of series of immittance matrices. We provide a tool in the analysis and design of electrical circuits and of special interest in the context of canonical quantization of superconducting networks. For instance, this work will provide a solid ground for a precise non-divergent input-output theory in the presence of nonreciprocal devices, e.g., within (chiral) waveguide QED platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized many fields, including materials science. However, predicting properties of crystalline materials using machine learning faces challenges in input encoding, output versatility, and interpretability. We introduce CrystalBERT, an adaptable transformer-based framework integrating space group, elemental, and unit cell information. This novel structure can seamlessly combine diverse features and accurately predict various physical properties, including topological properties, superconducting transition temperatures, dielectric constants, and more. CrystalBERT provides insightful interpretations of features influencing target properties. Our results indicate that space group and elemental information are crucial for predicting topological and superconducting properties, underscoring their intricate nature. By incorporating these features, we achieve 91\% accuracy in topological classification, surpassing prior studies and identifying previously misclassified materials. This research demonstrates that integrating diverse material information enhances the prediction of complex material properties, paving the way for more accurate and interpretable machine learning models in materials science.</description>

Abstract: We study active steering protocols for weakly measured qubits in the presence of error channels due to amplitude and phase noise. If the error rate is sufficiently small, the protocol approaches and stabilizes a predesignated pure target state with high fidelity and high purity, and thus implements autonomous state stabilization. We present numerical simulation results for one and two qubits, taking Andreev qubit circuits as example. As function of the error rate, a sharp threshold separates an error-correcting weak-damping regime from a strong-damping regime where the target state cannot be reached anymore. At the threshold, the purity gap closes.</description>

      <title>Quantum impurities in finite-temperature Bose gases: Detecting vortex proliferation across the BKT and BEC transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting vortices in neutral superfluids represents an outstanding experimental challenge. Using stochastic classical-field methods, we theoretically show that a quantum impurity repulsively coupled to a weakly-interacting Bose gas at finite temperature carries direct spectroscopic signatures of vortex proliferation. In two dimensions, we find that a low-energy (attractive) branch in the excitation spectrum becomes prominent when the temperature is tuned across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. We explain this red-shifted resonance as originating from the binding of the impurity to vortices, where the bosons density (and hence, the repulsive Hartree energy) is reduced. This mechanism could be exploited to spectroscopically estimate the BKT transition in excitonic insulators. In contrast, in three dimensions, the impurity spectra reflect the presence of vortex rings well below the condensation temperature, and herald the presence of a thermal gas above the Bose-Einstein condensation transition. Importantly, we expect our results to have impact on the understanding of Bose-polaron formation at finite temperatures.</description>
