      <title>Robustness of the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism against symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how strongly broken spatial symmetries affect the Kohn--Luttinger (KL) mechanism, in which superconductivity emerges purely from repulsive interactions. While the original KL argument assumes continuous rotational symmetry, real materials possess only discrete point-group symmetries, raising a central question: can sufficiently strong symmetry breaking suppress or eliminate KL superconductivity? Using controlled perturbation theory and explicit two-dimensional models with Ising and Rashba spin--orbit coupling (SOC), we find that KL superconductivity is broadly robust and exhibits qualitatively universal behavior across models: the transition temperature $T_c$ is nonmonotonic in the symmetry-breaking field, shows a pronounced maximum at scales of the order of the Fermi energy, and decays exponentially toward zero at asymptotically large fields. However, the physical mechanisms determining this suppression may differ between models. Overall, these results demonstrate that KL-type superconductivity can persist across a wide class of spin--orbit-coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Reentrant superconductivity and Stoner boundaries in twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin-valley instabilities and their connection to the reentrant superconducting states recently observed in the twisted bilayer dichalcogenide WSe$_2$ at a $5^o$ twist angle. Starting from an effective three-orbital faithful Wannier model for the spin-locked moir\'e bands, combined with orbital-dependent Hubbard interactions, we analyze the evolution of magnetic instabilities as a function of carrier density using the matrix random phase approximation (mRPA) approach. By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moir\'e valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moir\'e orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results. As such, our results suggest spin-valley fluctuations near the van-Hove line as the microscopic origin of the reentrant superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic superconductivity with a single-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes--Ginzburg-Landau framework and charge-4e couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recast spinful superconductivity as a quaternion field theory -- where a quaternion is a four-component hypercomplex number with units $(\boldsymbol{i},\boldsymbol{j},\boldsymbol{k})$ -- that encodes the spin-singlet/triplet gap in a single field $q(\mathbf{k})$. This yields a compact Bogoliubov--de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian $H_{\rm BdG}=\xi_{\mathbf{k}}\tau_z+\tau_{+}q+\tau_{-}\,\overline{q}$ and keeps time-reversal symmetry, Altland-Zirnbauer classification, and topological diagnostics in the same variables. We introduce a quarteting field $Q\propto\mathrm{Sc}(q^2)$ and a minimal Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional with covariant derivatives $(\nabla-2ie\mathbf{A})q$ and $(\nabla-4ie\mathbf{A})Q$. Analytically, a one-loop evaluation of the fluctuation bubble $\Pi(0)$ (with prefactors) gives a quantitative vestigial charge-$4e$ criterion $\mu_{\rm eff}=\mu-g^2\Pi(0)&lt;0$. Numerically, we verify: (i) a two-dimensional (2D) class-DIII lattice model whose $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, computed directly from $q(\mathbf{k})$ using the matrix Pfaffian of an antisymmetric sewing matrix at time-reversal-invariant momenta (TRIM), matches helical edge spectra; (ii) a GL simulation of a pure-$Q$ vortex carrying $hc/4e$ flux within $\sim2\%$ and exhibiting $\xi_Q\propto\sqrt{\eta/|\mu_{\rm eff}|}$; and (iii) a short-junction current-phase relation with a controlled window where the second harmonic dominates ($I_2\gg I_1$), together with doubled alternating-current (ac) Josephson emission and even-only Shapiro steps. The framework provides a compact, symmetry-faithful route from microscopic pairing to device-level charge-$4e$ signatures.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral superconductivity is a time reversal symmetry breaking superconducting phase that has attracted broad interest as a potential platform for topological quantum computation. A fundamental consequence of this symmetry breaking is orbital magnetization, yet a clear microscopic formulation of this quantity has remained elusive. This difficulty arises because Bogoliubov quasiparticles do not carry a definite electric charge, precluding a simple interpretation of orbital magnetization in terms of circulating quasiparticle currents. Moreover, superconductivity and ferromagnetism rarely coexist, and in the few materials where they do (e.g. uranium-based compounds), strong spin-orbit coupling obscures the orbital contribution to the magnetization. The recent report of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which has negligible spin-orbit coupling, therefore provides a unique opportunity to develop and test a microscopic theory of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors. Here we develop such a theory, unifying the interband coherence effects underlying normal-state orbital magnetization with the intrinsic orbital moments of the Cooper-pair condensate. Applying our theory to rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, we find that the onset of superconductivity can either enhance or suppress the normal-state orbital magnetization, depending sensitively on the bandstructure. We further identify a generalized clapping mode corresponding to coherent fluctuations between the two opposite chiral windings of the p-wave order parameter, with a gap set by the sublattice winding form factor. This collective mode is unique to chiral superconductors and contributes to the orbital magnetization through its role in dressing the photon vertex. Experimental measurements of the orbital magnetization relative to the quarter-metal phase would provide a direct test of our theory.</description>

      <title>Correlation between superfluid density and transition temperature in infinite-layer nickelate superconductor $Nd_{1-x}Sr_xNiO_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong correlation between zero-temperature superfluid density ($\rho_{s0}$) and transition temperature ($T_c$) is considered as a hallmark of unconventional superconductivity. However, their relationship has yet to be unveiled in nickelates due to sample inhomogeneity. Here we perform local susceptometry on an infinite-layer nickelate superconductor $Nd_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}NiO_2$. The sample shows inhomogeneous superfluid density and $T_c$ on micron-scale. The spatial statistics for different scan areas reveal a linear dependence of local $T_c$ on $\rho_{s0}$ for $T_c$&gt;8 K and a sub-linear one for $T_c$&lt;8 K. Remarkably, the overall relationship is reminiscent of that reported in overdoped cuprate superconductors, hinting at a close connection between them.</description>

      <title>Unusual antiferromagnetic order and fluctuations in RbMn$_{6}$Bi$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional RbMn$_{6}$Bi$_{5}$, the first pressure-induced ternary Mn-based superconductor, exhibits a phase diagram analogous to those of cuprate and iron-based superconductors, with superconductivity neighboring antiferromagnetic order. Here, we use $^{55}$Mn and $^{87}$Rb nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to unravel its magnetic structure and fluctuations. Above the N\'eel temperature ($T_{\rm N}$), strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations dominate, characteristic of a paramagnetic state with pronounced spin-lattice relaxation rate enhancement. Below $T_{\rm N}$, a first-order phase transition establishes a commensurate antiferromagnetic order, where Mn atoms at the pentagon corners exhibit distinct magnetic moments with different orientations, while the central Mn atom carries no magnetic moment. The complex magnetic architecture, revealed by zero-field and high-magnetic-field NMR spectra, contrasts with earlier neutron diffraction models proposing uniform spin density waves, instead supporting localized moments ordering with charge rearrangement. The proximity of robust antiferromagnetic fluctuations to the high-pressure superconducting phase suggests a potential role for magnetic excitations in mediating unconventional Cooper pairing, akin to paradigmatic high-$T_c$ systems. These findings provide critical insights into the interplay between geometric frustration, magnetic order, and superconductivity in manganese-based materials.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum bound pairs of two electrons in an altermagnetic metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the two-electron problem on a square lattice with $d$-wave altermagnetism, considering both on-site and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions. The altermagnetic spin-splitting in the single-particle dispersion naturally gives rise to a ground state of two-electron bound pairs with nonzero center-of-mass momentum. This finite-momentum pairing can be interpreted as a two-body mechanism underlying the recently proposed altermagnetism-induced Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state. Additionally, when the nearest-neighbor attraction is strong, the resulting finite-momentum bound pairs exhibit a mixture of both spin-singlet and spin-triplet characteristics, suggesting the possibility of unconventional superconductors, where spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairings coexist.</description>

      <title>Correlation lengths of flat-band superconductivity from quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-band superconductors provide a regime in which kinetic energy is quenched, so that pairing is governed primarily by interactions and quantum geometry. We investigate characteristic superconducting length scales in all-flat-band systems under the assumptions of time-reversal symmetry and spatially-uniform pairing, focusing on the size of the lowest-lying two-body bound state, the average Cooper-pair size, and the zero-temperature coherence length in two-band Hubbard models. Using the Creutz ladder and the $\chi$ lattice as representative examples, we show that both the two-body bound-state size and the many-body Cooper-pair size remain finite and small in the weak-coupling limit, being controlled by the quantum metric of the flat bands. By contrast, the coherence length exhibits qualitatively distinct behavior, diverging in the dilute limit and in the vicinity of insulating regimes. These results demonstrate that, in flat-band superconductors, the pair size and the coherence length are fundamentally distinct physical quantities and highlight the central role of band geometry in shaping superconducting length scales when kinetic energy is quenched.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of stripe order and superconductivity in NaAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report a scanning tunneling microscopy study on an s-wave superconductor NaAlSi, revealing the coexistence of stripe order and superconductivity. This stripe order manifests as a unidirectional spatial charge modulation with a commensurate period of four times the lattice constant. This modulation undergoes a phase shift in the differential conductance maps under opposite bias voltages, while its period remains approximately constant over an energy range of $\pm$50 meV. These features suggest that this stripe is likely a static charge order. Furthermore, we find that the stripe order imposes a periodic modulation on the intensity of the superconducting coherence peaks. This work provides new perspectives on the intricate interplay between stripe order and s-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Strong-Coupling Kohn-Luttinger Superconductivity in 2D Van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kohn-Luttinger (KL) mechanism of pairing, which describes superconductivity emergent from repulsive interactions, typically yields Cooper pairs at high angular-momentum ($\ell &gt; 0$) and extremely low transition temperatures ($T_c$). Here, we reveal an inter-layer s-wave ($\ell=0$) KL superconductivity with greatly elevated $T_c$ in a multi-layer Hubbard model, which prototypes stacked two-dimensional (2D) electrons in layered van der Waals materials. By employing determinant quantum Monte Carlo and dynamical mean-field theory simulations, we show that a strong pairing attraction $V^{*}$, without the mediation of collective modes, can emerge between inter-layer electrons in the system. As inter-layer repulsion $U$ increases, $V^{*}$ evolves from a conventional KL relation of $V^{*} \propto -U^2$, to a linear strong-coupling scaling of $V^{*} \propto -U$, resulting in enhanced superconductivity at large $U$. This strong-coupling KL pairing is robust against changes in lattice geometries and dimensionalities, and it can persist, in the presence of a large remnant Coulomb repulsion $U^{*}$ between pairing electrons. Using \textit{ab initio} calculations, we propose a few 2D layered van der Waals materials that can potentially realize and control this unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Weakly anisotropic superconductivity of Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity, studying the upper critical field and its anisotropy has been crucial for understanding superconducting mechanism and guiding applications. Here we perform in situ high-pressure angular-dependent electrical transport measurements on Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals using a custom diamond anvil cell (DAC) rotator and confirming its anisotropic superconductivity. The anisotropy parameter is approximately 1.6, decreasing with increasing temperature and approaches 1 near Tc. Comparing effective mass anisotropy and inter-block distance in cuprates and iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) reveals that Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals superconductors are consistent with a two-band model, where intralayer quantum confinement within the unit cell induces interlayer coherence, thereby leading to three-dimensional (3D) superconductivity. This study not only establishes the existence of anisotropic superconductivity in bulk Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, but also provide critical insight into the role of dimensionality in high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spin-density-wave transition in monolayer-trilayer La3Ni2O7 single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates stimulated intense research into their correlated electron physics. Establishing the diversity of ground states across different Ruddlesden-Popper phases is crucial for elucidating the superconducting mechanisms in these nickelates. Motivated by the recent report of superconductivity in hybrid 1212-type La5Ni3O11, we synthesized and investigated the long-range-ordered hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7. In contrast to its bilayer counterpart, the 1313-type La3Ni2O7 exhibits characteristic semiconducting behavior at ambient pressure, displaying a distinct anomaly at 170 K. This behavior is consistently evidenced by measurements of both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy unambiguously indicates a spin-density-wave transition occurring at 170 K. High-pressure electrical transport measurements demonstrate the induction of metallization under pressure, yet reveal no discernible traces of superconductivity up to 65 GPa. Our findings establish hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7 as a new member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family exhibiting a distinct spin-density-wave transition, and offers a new platform for investigating the interplay among crystal structure, electronic orders, and superconductivity in hybrid nickelates.</description>

Abstract: Polycrystalline thin films of $\mathrm{Nb}_{1-x}\mathrm{U}_{x}$ solid solutions with $0.15\leq x \leq 0.40$ were prepared via d.c. magnetron sputtering at ambient conditions. X-ray characterisation of the samples revealed a systematic shift of the (110) Nb Bragg reflection with U concentration, consistent with substitutional replacement of the Nb by U. Superconductivity was observed in all samples below $2$ K. Analysis of the superconducting critical fields revealed a direct scaling of the spin-orbit scattering and transport scattering times, indicating Elliott-Yafet-type spin relaxation in the system. Magnetoresistivity measurements showed a feature in the range $4$ K $\leq T \leq30$ K suggesting a possible a complex interplay between electron-electron interaction and localisation physics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-broken superconducting configurations from density functional theory for bcc and hcp metals and Nb3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently proposed a unified theoretical framework for superconductivity that broadens the applicability of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory to both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Within this framework, superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) generated by atomic perturbations of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). The SCC emerges through electron-phonon interaction and gives rise to distinct straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) in the charge density difference of electrons and/or holes. These SODTs originate from regular and systematic atomic displacements between the SCC and NCC, a phenomenon revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To further verify this framework, we performed DFT-based calculations for 12 hexagonal close-packed (hcp) elements (Be, Mg, Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, Tc, Re, Ru, Os, and Zn), 5 body-centered cubic (bcc) elements (V, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W), and the compound Nb3Sn. Our results indicate that all these materials exhibit superconductivity at 0 K and 0 GPa, as evidenced by the predicted SODTs. Notably, Mg, Sc, and Y are predicted to be superconducting under ambient pressure, a finding that awaits experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>Towards reliable electrical measurements of superconducting devices inside a transmission electron microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlating structure with electronic functionality is central to the engineering of quantum materials and devices whose properties depend sensitively on disorder. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers high spatial resolution together with access to structural, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom. However, electrical transport measurements on functional quantum devices remain rare, particularly at liquid helium temperature. Here, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements of niobium nitride (NbN) devices inside a TEM using a continuous-flow liquid-helium-cooled sample holder. By optimizing a thermal radiation shield to limit radiation from the nearby pole pieces of the objective lens, we achieve an estimated base sample temperature of 8-9 K, as inferred from the superconducting transition temperatures of our devices. We find that both electron beam imaging and the magnetic field of the objective lens perturb the superconducting state, because the base sample temperature is close to the superconducting transition temperature of NbN. Finally, we perform calculations that underscore the importance of cryo-shielding for minimizing thermal radiation onto the device. This capability enables correlative low-temperature TEM studies, in which structural, spectroscopic, and electrical transport data can be obtained from the same device, thereby providing a platform for probing the microscopic origins of quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Superconductor-insulator transitions in infinite-layer nickelates controlled via ${operando}$ monitored reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nickelates represent an emerging class of superconductors that demand innovative approaches for structural and electronic phase modulations. Continuous control over superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in nickelates remains particularly challenging, hindering both fundamental understanding and potential applications. Here, we demonstrate SIT in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors utilizing multiple techniques, including an ${operando}$ monitored reduction (OMR) method. OMR enables ultrawide-range continuous modulation of the Ni 3${d}$ orbital electron occupancy from ~3${d}^7$ to ~3${d}^9$. The 3${d}$ occupancy is calibrated through systematic synchrotron X-ray absorption (XAS), combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) annular bright field (ABF) analysis of oxygen atoms. SIT is further modulated via ionic liquid gating and magnetic field. Strikingly different from cuprates, our Nernst effect measurements show that pairing initiates at the onset of the resistive drop. The subsequent emergence of the Meissner effect at zero resistance marks the establishment of global phase coherence. Angle-dependent magnetotransport within the transition temperature regime indicates a mixture of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) superconducting characters, suggesting the observed SIT deviates from the canonical 2D model. Our results provide a unique perspective on the interplay of structural and electronic phase transitions in the infinite-layer nickelates across the oxygen content-magnetic field-temperature parameter space.</description>

      <title>Sparse Statistical Modeling in Condensed Matter Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore the possibility of using sparse statistical modeling in condensed matter physics. The procedure is employed to two well known problems: elemental superconductors and heavy fermions, and was shown that in most cases performs better than other AI methods, such as machine or deep learning. More importantly, sparse modeling has two major advantages over other methods: the ability to deal with small data sets and in particular its interpretabilty. Namely, sparse modeling can provide insight into the calculation process and allow the users to give physical interpretation of their results. We argue that many other problems in condensed matter physics would benefit from these properties of sparse statistical modeling.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of dynamical blockade between transmon qubits via ZZ interaction engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of strong longitudinal (ZZ) coupling between two superconducting transmon qubits achieved solely through capacitive engineering. By systematically varying the qubit frequency detuning, we measure cross-Kerr inter-qubit interaction strengths ranging from 10 MHz up to 350 MHz, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously observed in similar capacitively coupled systems. In this configuration, the qubits enter a strong-interaction regime in which the excitation of one qubit inhibits that of its neighbor, demonstrating a dynamical blockade mediated entirely by the engineered ZZ coupling. Circuit quantization simulations accurately reproduce the experimental results, while perturbative models confirm the theoretical origin of the energy shift as a hybridization between the computational states and higher-excitation manifolds. We establish a robust and scalable method to access interaction-dominated physics in superconducting circuits, providing a pathway towards solid-state implementations of globally controlled quantum architectures and cooperative many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observation of correlated plasmons in low-valence nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of nickelate superconductors has opened a new arena for studying the behavior of correlated electron liquids that give rise to unconventional superconductivity. While critical information about a material's charge dynamics is encoded in its plasmons, collective modes of the electron gas, these excitations have not yet been observed in nickelate materials. Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to detect plasmons in the metallic, low-valence nickelate Pr4Ni3O8. Although qualitatively similar to those in cuprates, the nickelate plasmons are more heavily damped and have a lower velocity than those in a cuprate at comparable doping, which we attribute to reduced electronic hopping and enhanced screening of the long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, the plasmons in Pr4Ni3O8 soften with increasing temperature, in contrast to the cuprate, where plasmons remain at nearly fixed energy but become more strongly damped. Taken together, these results reveal a distinct charge-screening landscape in nickelates and place quantitative constraints on analogies to cuprates.</description>

      <title>Using Andreev bound states and spin to remove domain walls in a Kitaev chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dot-superconductor hybrids have been established as a suitable platform for realizing Kitaev chains hosting Majorana bound states. Implementing these structures in a qubit architecture is expected to result in coherence times that scale exponentially with the lengths of the chains. To scale to longer systems, the phase differences between all superconducting segments in the chain need to be controlled. While this control has been demonstrated by using an external magnetic flux, ideally it can be achieved with control over intrinsic system parameters. In this work, we investigate whether the relevant phase differences can be tuned through the spin degree of freedom in each QD, or the chemical potential of the discrete bound states in the hybrid sections. We confirm that both these tuning knobs allow for controlling the phase difference in the couplings between neighbouring QDs, bypassing the requirement to tune an external flux. However, we find that the amplitude of the phase shifts can deviate from a discrete $\pi$-shift. We introduce a spatial variation in the spin-orbit field as a possible mechanism to explain the observed behaviour and comment on the consequences for experimentally creating long Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped symmetric mass generation insulator: a quantum Monte-Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding unconventional superconductivity (SC) driven by strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this work, we employ sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to systematically investigate a bilayer fermionic model featuring strong interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange and on-site repulsive Hubbard interactions. This system serves as a prototypical model for realizing a symmetric mass generation (SMG) insulator. Our numerically exact results unambiguously demonstrate that robust superconducting pairing emerges upon doping the SMG phase. Remarkably, we find that the SC order is significantly enhanced by the repulsive Hubbard interaction. Given its potential relevance to the essential features of the high-$T_c$ superconductor $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ under pressure, our study establishes a new paradigm for superconductivity arising from a doped SMG parent state and provides key theoretical guidance for future experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of quartet superfluid state: Quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and generalized Nambu-Gor'kov formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a quartet superfluid state in fermionic matter by using the quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) variational theory and the Green's function method. We demonstrate that the quartet BCS theory with the multiple-infinite-product ansatz successfully reproduces an exact four-body result in a one-dimensional four-component Fermi gas at the dilute limit, in contrast to the single-infinite-product ansatz. To see the validity of the quartet BCS state, we derive the self-consistent equation for the quartet superfluid order parameter within the generalized imaginary-time Nambu-Gor'kov formalism, which is found to be consistent with the quartet BCS variational equation. Moreover, by numerically computing the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function in a one-dimensional system, we discuss how the single-particle spectra evolve with increasing the strength of the four-body cluster formation. We show that a coherent BCS-like quasiparticle branch on the weak-coupling side evolves into a strongly damped, continuum-dominated spectrum in the strong-coupling side, while nonzero quartet superfluid order parameter persists throughout the crossover regime. Our results would be useful for understanding beyond-BCS pairing effects and four-body cluster formations in fermionic systems in an interdisciplinary way.</description>

      <title>Pressure Induced 18 K Superconductivity and Two Superconducting Phases in CuIr2S4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04407v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report pressure-induced superconductivity in the spinel CuIr$_{2}$S$_{4}$ with a transition temperature ($T_{\text{c}}$) reaching \textbf{18.2 K}, establishing a new record for this class of materials and surpassing the decades-old limit of 13.7 K. Our electrical transport and synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies up to 224 GPa reveal the emergence of \textbf{two distinct superconducting phases} from a charge-ordered insulating state. The first phase (SC-I) appears around 18 GPa, and forms a dome-shaped superconducting region in which the resistivity exhibits a pronounced, field- and current-sensitive drop without reaching strict zero above our base temperature. Above 111.8 GPa, a second, lower-$T_{\text{c}}$ phase (SC-II) emerges and coexists with SC-I over a broad pressure range, and SC-II ultimately develops a true zero-resistance state above 122.2 GPa. These superconducting phases are intimately linked to a cascade of structural transitions that systematically distort the frustrated pyrochlore lattice of Ir atoms. Our results expand the potential for superconductivity in spinels and demonstrate a pathway to high-$T_{\text{c}}$ pairing directly from a correlated insulating state driven by lattice tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has provided new perspectives on the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase, so the discovery of new superconducting RP nickelates is highly desirable to reveal their generality. Here we report that high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal is grown with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure. High-pressure transport measurements show that the superconducting state arises above 10 GPa, and the maximum Tc reaches 39 K without saturation, significantly exceeding the value of 25-30 K of La4Ni3O10. Ultrasensitive d.c. magnetic susceptibility measurements under high pressure indicate bulk superconductivity with appreciable superconducting volume fractions. By performing in situ high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements at 16 K, a structural transition is found from monoclinic to tetragonal. Unlike La4Ni3O10, the electronic structure of the high-pressure phase of Pr4Ni3O10 from density functional theory exhibits a dramatic metallization of the sigma-bonding band consisting of three dz2 orbitals and van Hove singularity of coupled bands of dx2-y2 orbitals near the Fermi level, similar to the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7. These findings reveal some generic features of both crystal and electronic structures for high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates and multi-layer cuprates.</description>

      <title>Optical probes of two-component pairing states in transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signatures of unconventional superconductivity have been recently observed in certain transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), including 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ and monolayer 2H-NbSe$_2$. While the pairing channel remains unknown, it has been argued that spin fluctuations can stabilize pairing in the two-component $E'$ channel, a $p$-wave spin-triplet state which could be consistent with some of the reported signatures. Exploiting the particular multi-orbital character of the Fermi surface and the presence of Ising spin-orbit coupling, which enable finite optical conductivity in the clean limit, in this work we predict clear-cut optical signatures to detect and distinguish the chiral and nematic ground states of the $E'$ pairing. We quantify how nematic $E'$ states produce a diagonal anisotropy $\sigma_{xx}\!\neq\!\sigma_{yy}$ due to the broken threefold symmetry ($C_3$), while chiral $E'$ states yield a finite optical Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}^H$ due to broken time-reversal symmetry, and find both signals could be detected in current experiments. For instance, for realistic gaps in the meV range, we predict a relative anisotropy $\Delta\sigma/\sigma\sim10^{-5}$ in the nematic states, and a polar Kerr rotation of $\theta_K\!\sim\!10^{-5}$ rad in the chiral states. These symmetry fingerprints provide a practical route to distinguish nematic and chiral superconducting order in TMD superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Controlling nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials requires ultrafast probes with spectral selectivity. We report femtosecond reflectivity measurements on the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ using free-electron laser extreme-ultraviolet (23.5--177~eV) and near-infrared (1.5~eV) pump pulses. EUV pulses access deep electronic states, while NIR light excites valence-band transitions. Despite these distinct channels, both schemes produce nearly identical dynamics: above $T_c$, excitations relax through fast (100--300~fs) and slower (1--5~ps) channels; below $T_c$, a delayed component signals quasiparticle recombination and condensate recovery. We find that when electronic excitations are involved, the ultrafast response is governed mainly by absorbed energy rather than by the microscopic nature of the excitation. In contrast, bosonic driving in the THz or mid-infrared produces qualitatively different dynamics. By demonstrating that EUV excitation of a correlated superconductor yields macroscopic dynamics converging with those from optical pumping, this work defines a new experimental paradigm: FEL pulses at core-level energies provide a powerful means to probe and control nonequilibrium electronic states in quantum materials on their intrinsic femtosecond timescales. This establishes FEL-based EUV pumping as a new capability for ultrafast materials science, opening routes toward soft X-ray and attosecond studies of correlated dynamics.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion-vortex pairing and vortex-drag induced Skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orders, to be realized in a two dimensional ferromagnetic superconductor, is proposed obeying necessary symmetry principles. This interaction allows us to formulate a duality, similar to the Boson-vortex duality in 2+1 dimensional superfluid. In the dual theory the Skyrmion and the vortex excitations interact with each other via an emergent gauge field. The static interaction potential is attractive for a Skyrmion and a vortex with opposite topological charges. This interaction can lead to formation of bound pairs of the mentioned topological excitations. Furthermore, we argue that such pairing implies that a Magnus force acting on the vortex induces a transverse, Hall-like drift motion of the Skyrmion, which we term the vortex-drag induced Skyrmion Hall effect. Possible experimental manifestations of this effect are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A unified model for underdoped and overdoped cuprate superconductors based on a spinodal transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many years of intense research on cuprate superconductors have led to several discoveries, such as the pseudogap and charge density waves (CDW), yet a complete theory is still lacking. By analyzing some experiments and performing calculations, we provide a full interpretation of their properties; from the undoped insulator to the overdoped metallic compounds. The variation of the anomalous Hall coefficient ($R_{\rm H}(T)$) with temperature at half-filling ($n = 1$) and, combinations of undoped ($p = 0$) insulators and metallic films, which, among other things, are indicative of a thermodynamic transition. On the overdoped side, recent experiments near the superconducting-to-metal transition detecting superconducting puddles and a considerable degree of charge disorder, suggest that a similar thermodynamic transition operates at all doping levels. We propose a spinodal or charge-separation transition starting near the pseudogap temperature $T^*(p)$, which among other things generates the CDW domains with a typical double-well Landau free-energy functional. Thus, from the half-filled to the overdoped region, the free energy forms an array of wells with $n = 1$ {\it static} holes. With doping, {\it mobile} holes tend to occupy these wells with alternating high and low densities, generating the CDW pattern. The confined holes in small regions develop local superconducting amplitudes, giving rise to a mesoscopic granular superconductor. Similar to the XY model, the grains develop correlation effects mediated by Josephson coupling, which is proportional to the local superfluid density. This approach yields a unified theory of cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Two-Level System Microwave Losses in Chemically Pure Bulk Niobium Oxide Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting resonators in quantum information science and precision measurements. Niobium resonators are widely used for these purposes, yet niobium's natural oxide stack contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits TLS-like power and temperature dependence. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels</description>

      <title>Cascades in transport and optical conductivity of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18969v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, we find that the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</description>

      <title>Overcoming disorder in superconducting globally driven quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of static disorder on a globally-controlled superconducting quantum computing architecture based on a quasi-two-dimensional ladder geometry [R. Menta et al., Phys. Rev. Research 7, L012065 (2025)]. Specifically, we examine how fabrication-induced inhomogeneities in qubit resonant frequencies and coupling strengths affect quantum state propagation and the fidelity of fundamental quantum operations. Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow. These findings highlight pulse optimization as a powerful strategy to enhance the resilience to disorder of solid-state globally-driven quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Coherent-state path integrals in quantum thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these notes, we elucidate some subtle aspects of coherent-state path integrals, focusing on their application to the equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-particle systems. These subtleties emerge when evaluating path integrals in the continuum, either in imaginary time or in Matsubara-frequency space. Our central message is that, when handled with due care, the path integral yields results identical to those obtained from the canonical Hamiltonian approach. We illustrate this through a pedagogical treatment of several paradigmatic systems: the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillators, the single-site Bose-Hubbard and Hubbard models, the weakly-interacting Bose gas with finite-range interactions, and the BCS superconductor with finite-range interactions.</description>
