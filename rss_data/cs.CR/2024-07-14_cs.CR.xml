      <title>ProxyGPT: Enabling Anonymous Queries in AI Chatbots with (Un)Trustworthy Browser Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-powered chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) require users to create an account using their email and phone number, thereby linking their personally identifiable information to their conversational data and usage patterns. As these chatbots are increasingly being used for tasks involving sensitive information, privacy concerns have been raised about how chatbot providers handle user data. To address these concerns, we present ProxyGPT, a privacy-enhancing system that enables anonymous queries in popular chatbot platforms. ProxyGPT leverages volunteer proxies to submit user queries on their behalf, thus providing network-level anonymity for chatbot users. The system is designed to support key security properties such as content integrity via TLS-backed data provenance, end-to-end encryption, and anonymous payment, while also ensuring usability and sustainability. We provide a thorough analysis of the privacy, security, and integrity of our system and identify various future research directions, particularly in the area of private chatbot query synthesis. Our human evaluation shows that ProxyGPT offers users a greater sense of privacy compared to traditional AI chatbots, especially in scenarios where users are hesitant to share their identity with chatbot providers. Although our proof-of-concept has higher latency than popular chatbots, our human interview participants consider this to be an acceptable trade-off for anonymity. To the best of our knowledge, ProxyGPT is the first comprehensive proxy-based solution for privacy-preserving AI chatbots. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/dzungvpham/proxygpt.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Meet Elliptic Curve Cryptography: A Novel Approach to Secure Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, neural networks have been used to implement symmetric cryptographic functions for secure communications. Extending this domain, the proposed approach explores the application of asymmetric cryptography within a neural network framework to safeguard the exchange between two communicating entities, i.e., Alice and Bob, from an adversarial eavesdropper, i.e., Eve. It employs a set of five distinct cryptographic keys to examine the efficacy and robustness of communication security against eavesdropping attempts using the principles of elliptic curve cryptography. The experimental setup reveals that Alice and Bob achieve secure communication with negligible variation in security effectiveness across different curves. It is also designed to evaluate cryptographic resilience. Specifically, the loss metrics for Bob oscillate between 0 and 1 during encryption-decryption processes, indicating successful message comprehension post-encryption by Alice. The potential vulnerability with a decryption accuracy exceeds 60\%, where Eve experiences enhanced adversarial training, receiving twice the training iterations per batch compared to Alice and Bob.</description>

      <title>A Survey on the Application of Generative Adversarial Networks in Cybersecurity: Prospective, Direction and Open Research Scopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence, there has been a massive increase in the amount of data required to be accumulated and disseminated digitally. As the data are available online in digital landscapes with complex and sophisticated infrastructures, it is crucial to implement various defense mechanisms based on cybersecurity. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are deep learning models, have emerged as powerful solutions for addressing the constantly changing security issues. This survey studies the significance of the deep learning model, precisely on GANs, in strengthening cybersecurity defenses. Our survey aims to explore the various works completed in GANs, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Mobile and Network Trespass, BotNet Detection, and Malware Detection. The focus is to examine how GANs can be influential tools to strengthen cybersecurity defenses in these domains. Further, the paper discusses the challenges and constraints of using GANs in these areas and suggests future research directions. Overall, the paper highlights the potential of GANs in enhancing cybersecurity measures and addresses the need for further exploration in this field.</description>

      <title>TensorTEE: Unifying Heterogeneous TEE Granularity for Efficient Secure Collaborative Tensor Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous collaborative computing with NPU and CPU has received widespread attention due to its substantial performance benefits. To ensure data confidentiality and integrity during computing, Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) is considered a promising solution because of its comparatively lower overhead. However, existing heterogeneous TEE designs are inefficient for collaborative computing due to fine and different memory granularities between CPU and NPU. 1) The cacheline granularity of CPU TEE intensifies memory pressure due to its extra memory access, and 2) the cacheline granularity MAC of NPU escalates the pressure on the limited memory storage. 3) Data transfer across heterogeneous enclaves relies on the transit of non-secure regions, resulting in cumbersome re-encryption and scheduling.
  To address these issues, we propose TensorTEE, a unified tensor-granularity heterogeneous TEE for efficient secure collaborative tensor computing. First, we virtually support tensor granularity in CPU TEE to eliminate the off-chip metadata access by detecting and maintaining tensor structures on-chip. Second, we propose tensor-granularity MAC management with predictive execution to avoid computational stalls while eliminating off-chip MAC storage and access. Moreover, based on the unified granularity, we enable direct data transfer without re-encryption and scheduling dilemmas. Our evaluation is built on enhanced Gem5 and a cycle-accurate NPU simulator. The results show that TensorTEE improves the performance of Large Language Model (LLM) training workloads by 4.0x compared to existing work and incurs only 2.1% overhead compared to non-secure training, offering a practical security assurance for LLM training.</description>

      <title>Disassembling Obfuscated Executables with LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disassembly is a challenging task, particularly for obfuscated executables containing junk bytes, which is designed to induce disassembly errors. Existing solutions rely on heuristics or leverage machine learning techniques, but only achieve limited successes. Fundamentally, such obfuscation cannot be defeated without in-depth understanding of the binary executable's semantics, which is made possible by the emergence of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present DisasLLM, a novel LLM-driven dissembler to overcome the challenge in analyzing obfuscated executables. DisasLLM consists of two components: an LLM-based classifier that determines whether an instruction in an assembly code snippet is correctly decoded, and a disassembly strategy that leverages this model to disassemble obfuscated executables end-to-end. We evaluated DisasLLM on a set of heavily obfuscated executables, which is shown to significantly outperform other state-of-the-art disassembly solutions.</description>

      <title>Distributed Backdoor Attacks on Federated Graph Learning and Certified Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FedGL) is an emerging federated learning (FL) framework that extends FL to learn graph data from diverse sources. FL for non-graph data has shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which inject a shared backdoor trigger into the training data such that the trained backdoored FL model can predict the testing data containing the trigger as the attacker desires. However, FedGL against backdoor attacks is largely unexplored, and no effective defense exists.
  In this paper, we aim to address such significant deficiency. First, we propose an effective, stealthy, and persistent backdoor attack on FedGL. Our attack uses a subgraph as the trigger and designs an adaptive trigger generator that can derive the effective trigger location and shape for each graph. Our attack shows that empirical defenses are hard to detect/remove our generated triggers. To mitigate it, we further develop a certified defense for any backdoored FedGL model against the trigger with any shape at any location. Our defense involves carefully dividing a testing graph into multiple subgraphs and designing a majority vote-based ensemble classifier on these subgraphs. We then derive the deterministic certified robustness based on the ensemble classifier and prove its tightness. We extensively evaluate our attack and defense on six graph datasets. Our attack results show our attack can obtain &gt; 90% backdoor accuracy in almost all datasets. Our defense results show, in certain cases, the certified accuracy for clean testing graphs against an arbitrary trigger with size 20 can be close to the normal accuracy under no attack, while there is a moderate gap in other cases. Moreover, the certified backdoor accuracy is always 0 for backdoored testing graphs generated by our attack, implying our defense can fully mitigate the attack.

      <title>PriRoAgg: Achieving Robust Model Aggregation with Minimum Privacy Leakage for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has recently gained significant momentum due to its potential to leverage large-scale distributed user data while preserving user privacy. However, the typical paradigm of FL faces challenges of both privacy and robustness: the transmitted model updates can potentially leak sensitive user information, and the lack of central control of the local training process leaves the global model susceptible to malicious manipulations on model updates. Current solutions attempting to address both problems under the one-server FL setting fall short in the following aspects: 1) designed for simple validity checks that are insufficient against advanced attacks (e.g., checking norm of individual update); and 2) partial privacy leakage for more complicated robust aggregation algorithms (e.g., distances between model updates are leaked for multi-Krum). In this work, we formalize a novel security notion of aggregated privacy that characterizes the minimum amount of user information, in the form of some aggregated statistics of users' updates, that is necessary to be revealed to accomplish more advanced robust aggregation. We develop a general framework PriRoAgg, utilizing Lagrange coded computing and distributed zero-knowledge proof, to execute a wide range of robust aggregation algorithms while satisfying aggregated privacy. As concrete instantiations of PriRoAgg, we construct two secure and robust protocols based on state-of-the-art robust algorithms, for which we provide full theoretical analyses on security and complexity. Extensive experiments are conducted for these protocols, demonstrating their robustness against various model integrity attacks, and their efficiency advantages over baselines.</description>

      <title>DeCE: Deceptive Cross-Entropy Loss Designed for Defending Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code Language Models (CLMs), particularly those leveraging deep learning, have achieved significant success in code intelligence domain. However, the issue of security, particularly backdoor attacks, is often overlooked in this process. The previous research has focused on designing backdoor attacks for CLMs, but effective defenses have not been adequately addressed. In particular, existing defense methods from natural language processing, when directly applied to CLMs, are not effective enough and lack generality, working well in some models and scenarios but failing in others, thus fall short in consistently mitigating backdoor attacks. To bridge this gap, we first confirm the phenomenon of ``early learning" as a general occurrence during the training of CLMs. This phenomenon refers to that a model initially focuses on the main features of training data but may become more sensitive to backdoor triggers over time, leading to overfitting and susceptibility to backdoor attacks. We then analyze that overfitting to backdoor triggers results from the use of the cross-entropy loss function, where the unboundedness of cross-entropy leads the model to increasingly concentrate on the features of the poisoned data. Based on this insight, we propose a general and effective loss function DeCE (Deceptive Cross-Entropy) by blending deceptive distributions and applying label smoothing to limit the gradient to be bounded, which prevents the model from overfitting to backdoor triggers and then enhances the security of CLMs against backdoor attacks. To verify the effectiveness of our defense method, we select code synthesis tasks as our experimental scenarios. Our experiments across various code synthesis datasets, models, and poisoning ratios demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of DeCE in enhancing the security of CLMs.</description>

      <title>Detect Llama -- Finding Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we test the hypothesis that although OpenAI's GPT-4 performs well generally, we can fine-tune open-source models to outperform GPT-4 in smart contract vulnerability detection. We fine-tune two models from Meta's Code Llama and a dataset of 17k prompts, Detect Llama - Foundation and Detect Llama - Instruct, and we also fine-tune OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model (GPT-3.5FT). We then evaluate these models, plus a random baseline, on a testset we develop against GPT-4, and GPT-4 Turbo's, detection of eight vulnerabilities from the dataset and the two top identified vulnerabilities - and their weighted F1 scores.
  We find that for binary classification (i.e., is this smart contract vulnerable?), our two best-performing models, GPT-3.5FT and Detect Llama - Foundation, achieve F1 scores of $0.776$ and $0.68$, outperforming both GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo, $0.66$ and $0.675$. For the evaluation against individual vulnerability identification, our top two models, GPT-3.5FT and Detect Llama - Foundation, both significantly outperformed GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo in both weighted F1 for all vulnerabilities ($0.61$ and $0.56$ respectively against GPT-4's $0.218$ and GPT-4 Turbo's $0.243$) and weighted F1 for the top two identified vulnerabilities ($0.719$ for GPT-3.5FT, $0.674$ for Detect Llama - Foundation against GPT-4's $0.363$ and GPT-4 Turbo's $0.429$).</description>

      <title>Soft Prompts Go Hard: Steering Visual Language Models with Hidden Meta-Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of indirect injection vulnerabilities in language models that operate on images: hidden "meta-instructions" that influence how the model interprets the image and steer the model's outputs to express an adversary-chosen style, sentiment, or point of view.
  We explain how to create meta-instructions by generating images that act as soft prompts. Unlike jailbreaking attacks and adversarial examples, the outputs resulting from these images are plausible and based on the visual content of the image, yet follow the adversary's (meta-)instructions. We describe the risks of these attacks, including misinformation and spin, evaluate their efficacy for multiple visual language models and adversarial meta-objectives, and demonstrate how they can "unlock" the capabilities of the underlying language models that are unavailable via explicit text instructions. Finally, we discuss defenses against these attacks.</description>

      <title>CURE: Privacy-Preserving Split Learning Done Right</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks often requires large-scale datasets, necessitating storage and processing on cloud servers due to computational constraints. The procedures must follow strict privacy regulations in domains like healthcare. Split Learning (SL), a framework that divides model layers between client(s) and server(s), is widely adopted for distributed model training. While Split Learning reduces privacy risks by limiting server access to the full parameter set, previous research has identified that intermediate outputs exchanged between server and client can compromise client's data privacy. Homomorphic encryption (HE)-based solutions exist for this scenario but often impose prohibitive computational burdens.
  To address these challenges, we propose CURE, a novel system based on HE, that encrypts only the server side of the model and optionally the data. CURE enables secure SL while substantially improving communication and parallelization through advanced packing techniques. We propose two packing schemes that consume one HE level for one-layer networks and generalize our solutions to n-layer neural networks. We demonstrate that CURE can achieve similar accuracy to plaintext SL while being 16x more efficient in terms of the runtime compared to the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving alternatives.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Genomic Research: A Real-Life Deployment and Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data revolution holds significant promise for the health sector. Vast amounts of data collected from individuals will be transformed into knowledge, AI models, predictive systems, and best practices. One area of health that stands to benefit greatly is the genomic domain. Progress in AI, machine learning, and data science has opened new opportunities for genomic research, promising breakthroughs in personalized medicine. However, increasing awareness of privacy and cybersecurity necessitates robust solutions to protect sensitive data in collaborative research. This paper presents a practical deployment of a privacy-preserving framework for genomic research, developed in collaboration with Lynx.MD, a platform for secure health data collaboration. The framework addresses critical cybersecurity and privacy challenges, enabling the privacy-preserving sharing and analysis of genomic data while mitigating risks associated with data breaches. By integrating advanced privacy-preserving algorithms, the solution ensures the protection of individual privacy without compromising data utility. A unique feature of the system is its ability to balance trade-offs between data sharing and privacy, providing stakeholders tools to quantify privacy risks and make informed decisions. Implementing the framework within Lynx.MD involves encoding genomic data into binary formats and applying noise through controlled perturbation techniques. This approach preserves essential statistical properties of the data, facilitating effective research and analysis. Moreover, the system incorporates real-time data monitoring and advanced visualization tools, enhancing user experience and decision-making. The paper highlights the need for tailored privacy attacks and defenses specific to genomic data. Addressing these challenges fosters collaboration in genomic research, advancing personalized medicine and public health.</description>

      <title>Refusing Safe Prompts for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have become the cornerstone of today's generative AI ecosystem, sparking intense competition among tech giants and startups. In particular, an MLLM generates a text response given a prompt consisting of an image and a question. While state-of-the-art MLLMs use safety filters and alignment techniques to refuse unsafe prompts, in this work, we introduce MLLM-Refusal, the first method that induces refusals for safe prompts. In particular, our MLLM-Refusal optimizes a nearly-imperceptible refusal perturbation and adds it to an image, causing target MLLMs to likely refuse a safe prompt containing the perturbed image and a safe question. Specifically, we formulate MLLM-Refusal as a constrained optimization problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. Our method offers competitive advantages for MLLM model providers by potentially disrupting user experiences of competing MLLMs, since competing MLLM's users will receive unexpected refusals when they unwittingly use these perturbed images in their prompts. We evaluate MLLM-Refusal on four MLLMs across four datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in causing competing MLLMs to refuse safe prompts while not affecting non-competing MLLMs. Furthermore, we explore three potential countermeasures -- adding Gaussian noise, DiffPure, and adversarial training. Our results show that they are insufficient: though they can mitigate MLLM-Refusal's effectiveness, they also sacrifice the accuracy and/or efficiency of the competing MLLM. The code is available at https://github.com/Sadcardation/MLLM-Refusal.</description>

      <title>TAPFixer: Automatic Detection and Repair of Home Automation Vulnerabilities based on Negated-property Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigger-Action Programming (TAP) is a popular end-user programming framework in the home automation (HA) system, which eases users to customize home automation and control devices as expected. However, its simplified syntax also introduces new safety threats to HA systems through vulnerable rule interactions. Accurately fixing these vulnerabilities by logically and physically eliminating their root causes is essential before rules are deployed. However, it has not been well studied. In this paper, we present TAPFixer, a novel framework to automatically detect and repair rule interaction vulnerabilities in HA systems. It extracts TAP rules from HA profiles, translates them into an automaton model with physical and latency features, and performs model checking with various correctness properties. It then uses a novel negated-property reasoning algorithm to automatically infer a patch via model abstraction and refinement and model checking based on negated-properties. We evaluate TAPFixer on market HA apps (1177 TAP rules and 53 properties) and find that it can achieve an 86.65% success rate in repairing rule interaction vulnerabilities. We additionally recruit 23 HA users to conduct a user study that demonstrates the usefulness of TAPFixer for vulnerability repair in practical HA scenarios.</description>

      <title>UserBoost: Generating User-specific Synthetic Data for Faster Enrolment into Behavioural Biometric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioural biometric authentication systems entail an enrolment period that is burdensome for the user. In this work, we explore generating synthetic gestures from a few real user gestures with generative deep learning, with the application of training a simple (i.e. non-deep-learned) authentication model. Specifically, we show that utilising synthetic data alongside real data can reduce the number of real datapoints a user must provide to enrol into a biometric system. To validate our methods, we use the publicly available dataset of WatchAuth, a system proposed in 2022 for authenticating smartwatch payments using the physical gesture of reaching towards a payment terminal. We develop a regularised autoencoder model for generating synthetic user-specific wrist motion data representing these physical gestures, and demonstrate the diversity and fidelity of our synthetic gestures. We show that using synthetic gestures in training can improve classification ability for a real-world system. Through this technique we can reduce the number of gestures required to enrol a user into a WatchAuth-like system by more than 40% without negatively impacting its error rates.</description>

      <title>Securing Confidential Data For Distributed Software Development Teams: Encrypted Container File</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of modern software engineering, there is a trend towards Cloud-native software development involving international teams with members from all over the world. Cloud-based version management services like GitHub are commonly used for source code and other files. However, a challenge arises when developers from different companies or organizations share the platform, as sensitive data should be encrypted to restrict access to certain developers only. This paper discusses existing tools addressing this issue, highlighting their shortcomings. The authors propose their own solution, Encrypted Container Files, designed to overcome the deficiencies observed in other tools.</description>

      <title>TAPI: Towards Target-Specific and Adversarial Prompt Injection against Code LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely and successfully used to simplify and facilitate code programming. With these tools, developers can easily generate desired complete functional codes based on incomplete code and natural language prompts. However, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are also vulnerable, e.g., against backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former could induce LLMs to respond to triggers to insert malicious code snippets by poisoning the training data or model parameters, while the latter can craft malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of generated codes. However, both attack methods have underlying limitations: backdoor attacks rely on controlling the model training process, while adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes.
  To inherit the advantages of both backdoor and adversarial attacks, this paper proposes a new attack paradigm, i.e., target-specific and adversarial prompt injection (TAPI), against Code LLMs. TAPI generates unreadable comments containing information about malicious instructions and hides them as triggers in the external source code. When users exploit Code LLMs to complete codes containing the trigger, the models will generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at specific locations. We evaluate our TAPI attack on four representative LLMs under three representative malicious objectives and seven cases. The results show that our method is highly threatening (achieving an attack success rate of up to 89.3\%) and stealthy (saving an average of 53.1\% of tokens in the trigger design). In particular, we successfully attack some famous deployed code completion integrated applications, including CodeGeex and Github Copilot. This further confirms the realistic threat of our attack.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although highly valuable for a variety of applications, urban mobility data is rarely made openly available as it contains sensitive personal information. Synthetic data aims to solve this issue by generating artificial data that resembles an original dataset in structural and statistical characteristics, but omits sensitive information. For mobility data, a large number of corresponding models have been proposed in the last decade. This systematic review provides a structured comparative overview of the current state of this heterogeneous, active field of research. A special focus is put on the applicability of the reviewed models in practice.</description>

      <title>On the Design and Security of Collective Remote Attestation Protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective remote attestation (CRA) is a security service that aims to efficiently identify compromised (often low-powered) devices in a (heterogeneous) network. The last few years have seen an extensive growth in CRA protocol proposals, showing a variety of designs guided by different network topologies, hardware assumptions and other functional requirements. However, they differ in their trust assumptions, adversary models and role descriptions making it difficult to uniformly assess their security guarantees. In this paper we present Catt, a unifying framework for CRA protocols that enables them to be compared systematically, based on a comprehensive study of 40 CRA protocols and their adversary models. Catt characterises the roles that devices can take and based on these we develop a novel set of security properties for CRA protocols. We then classify the security aims of all the studied protocols. We illustrate the applicability of our security properties by encoding them in the tamarin prover and verifying the SIMPLE+ protocol against them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study sheds light on the imperative need to bolster safety and privacy measures in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, by identifying and mitigating their vulnerabilities through explainable analysis of prompt attacks. We propose Counterfactual Explainable Incremental Prompt Attack (CEIPA), a novel technique where we guide prompts in a specific manner to quantitatively measure attack effectiveness and explore the embedded defense mechanisms in these models. Our approach is distinctive for its capacity to elucidate the reasons behind the generation of harmful responses by LLMs through an incremental counterfactual methodology. By organizing the prompt modification process into four incremental levels: (word, sentence, character, and a combination of character and word) we facilitate a thorough examination of the susceptibilities inherent to LLMs. The findings from our study not only provide counterfactual explanation insight but also demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the effectiveness of attack prompts.</description>

      <title>Security Matrix for Multimodal Agents on Mobile Devices: A Systematic and Proof of Concept Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress in the reasoning capability of the Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has triggered the development of autonomous agent systems on mobile devices. MLLM-based mobile agent systems consist of perception, reasoning, memory, and multi-agent collaboration modules, enabling automatic analysis of user instructions and the design of task pipelines with only natural language and device screenshots as inputs. Despite the increased human-machine interaction efficiency, the security risks of MLLM-based mobile agent systems have not been systematically studied. Existing security benchmarks for agents mainly focus on Web scenarios, and the attack techniques against MLLMs are also limited in the mobile agent scenario. To close these gaps, this paper proposes a mobile agent security matrix covering 3 functional modules of the agent systems. Based on the security matrix, this paper proposes 4 realistic attack paths and verifies these attack paths through 8 attack methods. By analyzing the attack results, this paper reveals that MLLM-based mobile agent systems are not only vulnerable to multiple traditional attacks, but also raise new security concerns previously unconsidered. This paper highlights the need for security awareness in the design of MLLM-based systems and paves the way for future research on attacks and defense methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hash algorithms are fundamental tools in cryptography, offering irreversible and sensitive transformations of input data for various security purposes. As computing architectures evolve towards heterogeneous systems, efficiently harnessing diverse computing resources for hash encryption algorithms becomes crucial. This paper presents HETOCompiler, a novel cryptography compilation framework designed for heterogeneous systems. Leveraging Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR), HETOCompiler abstracts syntax and semantics for cryptographic primitives and heterogeneous computing models, facilitating efficient compilation of high-level hash encryption algorithms into executable programs compatible with diverse devices. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing OpenSSL library, with average enhancements of 49.3x, 1.5x, and 23.4x for SHA-1, MD5, and SM3 algorithms respectively.</description>

      <title>Private Blockchain-based Procurement and Asset Management System with QR Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The developed system aims to incorporate a private blockchain technology in the procurement process for the supply office. The procurement process includes the canvassing, purchasing, delivery and inspection of items, inventory, and disposal. The blockchain-based system includes a distributed ledger technology, peer-to-peer network, Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism, and SHA3-512 cryptographic hash function algorithm. This will ensure trust and proper accountability to the custodian of the property while safeguarding sensitive information in the procurement records. The extreme prototyping model will be used as software development life cycle. It is mostly used for web-based applications and has an increased user involvement. The prototype version of the system allows the users get a better understanding of the system being developed. It also reduces the time and cost, has quicker user feedback, missing and difficult functions can be recognized, and confusing processes can be addressed on an early stage. The implementation of a private blockchain technology has an increased privacy, enhanced security, improved efficiency, and reduced complexity over traditional blockchain network. The use of SHA3-512 as cryptographic hash function algorithm is much faster than its predecessors when cryptography is handled by hardware components. Furthermore, it is not vulnerable to length extension attacks making it reliable in terms of security of data. The study recommends the use of private blockchain-based technology with the procurement and asset management system in the supply office. The procurement records will be protected against tampering using this technology. This will promote trust and confidence of the stakeholders. The implementation of blockchain technology in developing a system served as advancement and innovation in terms of securing data.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Network Anomaly Detection under Data Contamination: Evaluating Robustness and Mitigating Performance Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a crucial tool in network anomaly detection (NAD) for cybersecurity. While DL models for anomaly detection excel at extracting features and learning patterns from data, they are vulnerable to data contamination -- the inadvertent inclusion of attack-related data in training sets presumed benign. This study evaluates the robustness of six unsupervised DL algorithms against data contamination using our proposed evaluation protocol. Results demonstrate significant performance degradation in state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms when exposed to contaminated data, highlighting the critical need for self-protection mechanisms in DL-based NAD models. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose an enhanced auto-encoder with a constrained latent representation, allowing normal data to cluster more densely around a learnable center in the latent space. Our evaluation reveals that this approach exhibits improved resistance to data contamination compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for more robust NAD systems.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Guided Response for Security Operation Centers with Microsoft Copilot for Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security operation centers contend with a constant stream of security incidents, ranging from straightforward to highly complex. To address this, we developed Copilot Guided Response (CGR), an industry-scale ML architecture that guides security analysts across three key tasks -- (1) investigation, providing essential historical context by identifying similar incidents; (2) triaging to ascertain the nature of the incident -- whether it is a true positive, false positive, or benign positive; and (3) remediation, recommending tailored containment actions. CGR is integrated into the Microsoft Defender XDR product and deployed worldwide, generating millions of recommendations across thousands of customers. Our extensive evaluation, incorporating internal evaluation, collaboration with security experts, and customer feedback, demonstrates that CGR delivers high-quality recommendations across all three tasks. We provide a comprehensive overview of the CGR architecture, setting a precedent as the first cybersecurity company to openly discuss these capabilities in such depth. Additionally, we GUIDE, the largest public collection of real-world security incidents, spanning 13M evidences across 1M annotated incidents. By enabling researchers and practitioners to conduct research on real-world data, GUIDE advances the state of cybersecurity and supports the development of next-generation machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>Revealing the True Cost of Locally Differentially Private Protocols: An Auditing Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the existing literature on Differential Privacy (DP) auditing predominantly focuses on the centralized model (e.g., in auditing the DP-SGD algorithm), we advocate for extending this approach to audit Local DP (LDP). To achieve this, we introduce the LDP-Auditor framework for empirically estimating the privacy loss of locally differentially private mechanisms. This approach leverages recent advances in designing privacy attacks against LDP frequency estimation protocols. More precisely, through the analysis of numerous state-of-the-art LDP protocols, we extensively explore the factors influencing the privacy audit, such as the impact of different encoding and perturbation functions. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the domain size and the theoretical privacy loss parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ on local privacy estimation. In-depth case studies are also conducted to explore specific aspects of LDP auditing, including distinguishability attacks on LDP protocols for longitudinal studies and multidimensional data. Finally, we present a notable achievement of our LDP-Auditor framework, which is the discovery of a bug in a state-of-the-art LDP Python package. Overall, our LDP-Auditor framework as well as our study offer valuable insights into the sources of randomness and information loss in LDP protocols. These contributions collectively provide a realistic understanding of the local privacy loss, which can help practitioners in selecting the LDP mechanism and privacy parameters that best align with their specific requirements. We open-sourced LDP-Auditor in \url{https://github.com/hharcolezi/ldp-audit}.</description>

      <title>Instruction Tuning for Secure Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) have gained widespread acceptance in everyday and professional contexts, particularly in programming. An essential procedure enabling this adoption is instruction tuning, which substantially enhances LMs' practical utility by training them to follow user instructions and human preferences. However, existing instruction tuning schemes overlook a crucial aspect: the security of generated code. As a result, even the state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LMs frequently produce unsafe code, posing significant security risks. In this work, we introduce SafeCoder to address this gap. SafeCoder performs security-centric fine-tuning using a diverse and high-quality dataset that we collected using an automated pipeline. We integrate the security fine-tuning with standard instruction tuning, to facilitate a joint optimization of both security and utility. Despite its simplicity, we show that SafeCoder is effective across a variety of popular LMs and datasets. It is able to drastically improve security (by about 30%), while preserving utility.</description>

      <title>SoK: What don't we know? Understanding Security Vulnerabilities in SNARKs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15293v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have evolved from being a theoretical concept providing privacy and verifiability to having practical, real-world implementations, with SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) emerging as one of the most significant innovations. Prior work has mainly focused on designing more efficient SNARK systems and providing security proofs for them. Many think of SNARKs as "just math," implying that what is proven to be correct and secure is correct in practice. In contrast, this paper focuses on assessing end-to-end security properties of real-life SNARK implementations. We start by building foundations with a system model and by establishing threat models and defining adversarial roles for systems that use SNARKs. Our study encompasses an extensive analysis of 141 actual vulnerabilities in SNARK implementations, providing a detailed taxonomy to aid developers and security researchers in understanding the security threats in systems employing SNARKs. Finally, we evaluate existing defense mechanisms and offer recommendations for enhancing the security of SNARK-based systems, paving the way for more robust and reliable implementations in the future.</description>

      <title>Budget Recycling Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms usually {force} reduction in data utility by producing "out-of-bound" noisy results for a tight privacy budget. We introduce the Budget Recycling Differential Privacy (BR-DP) framework, designed to provide soft-bounded noisy outputs for a broad range of existing DP mechanisms. By "soft-bounded," we refer to the mechanism's ability to release most outputs within a predefined error boundary, thereby improving utility and maintaining privacy simultaneously. The core of BR-DP consists of two components: a DP kernel responsible for generating a noisy answer per iteration, and a recycler that probabilistically recycles/regenerates or releases the noisy answer. We delve into the privacy accounting of BR-DP, culminating in the development of a budgeting principle that optimally sub-allocates the available budget between the DP kernel and the recycler. Furthermore, we introduce algorithms for tight BR-DP accounting in composition scenarios, and our findings indicate that BR-DP achieves reduced privacy leakage post-composition compared to DP. Additionally, we explore the concept of privacy amplification via subsampling within the BR-DP framework and propose optimal sampling rates for BR-DP across various queries. We experiment with real data, and the results demonstrate BR-DP's effectiveness in lifting the utility-privacy tradeoff provided by DP mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Alistair: Efficient On-device Budgeting for Differentially-Private Ad-Measurement Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16719</link>

Abstract: With the impending removal of third-party cookies from major browsers and the introduction of new privacy-preserving advertising APIs, the research community has a timely opportunity to assist industry in qualitatively improving the Web's privacy. This paper discusses our efforts, within a W3C community group, to enhance existing privacy-preserving advertising measurement APIs. We analyze designs from Google, Apple, Meta and Mozilla, and augment them with a more rigorous and efficient differential privacy (DP) budgeting component. Our approach, called Alistair, enforces well-defined DP guarantees and enables advertisers to conduct more private measurement queries accurately. By framing the privacy guarantee in terms of an individual form of DP, we can make DP budgeting more efficient than in current systems that use a traditional DP definition. We incorporate Alistair into Chrome and evaluate it on microbenchmarks and advertising datasets. Across all workloads, Alistair significantly outperforms baselines in enabling more advertising measurements under comparable DP protection.</description>

      <title>It Takes Two: A Peer-Prediction Solution for Blockchain Verifier's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the process of content verification is essential to keep the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a secure blockchain system with few or no cheaters could not provide sufficient incentive for verifiers to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could severely undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems. While existing works have attempted to insert deliberate errors to disincentivize lazy verification, the decentralized environment makes it impossible to judge the correctness of verification or detect malicious verifiers directly.
  In this paper, we initiate the research that leverages the peer prediction approach towards the design of Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification game among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations in the verification process. With theoretically guaranteed truthfulness of our mechanism for the verification game, our work provides a framework of verification mechanisms that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain and potentially other decentralized systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Statistical Estimation: Differentially Private Individual Computation via Shuffling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In data-driven applications, preserving user privacy while enabling valuable computations remains a critical challenge. Technologies like Differential Privacy (DP) have been pivotal in addressing these concerns. The shuffle model of DP requires no trusted curators and can achieve high utility by leveraging the privacy amplification effect yielded from shuffling. These benefits have led to significant interest in the shuffle model. However, the computation tasks in the shuffle model are limited to statistical estimation, making the shuffle model inapplicable to real-world scenarios in which each user requires a personalized output. This paper introduces a novel paradigm termed Private Individual Computation (PIC), expanding the shuffle model to support a broader range of permutation-equivariant computations. PIC enables personalized outputs while preserving privacy, and enjoys privacy amplification through shuffling. We propose a concrete protocol that realizes PIC. By using one-time public keys, our protocol enables users to receive their outputs without compromising anonymity, which is essential for privacy amplification. Additionally, we present an optimal randomizer, the Minkowski Response, designed for the PIC model to enhance utility. We formally prove the security and privacy properties of the PIC protocol. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate PIC's capability in handling non-statistical computation tasks, and the efficacy of PIC and the Minkowski randomizer in achieving superior utility compared to existing solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With increasingly sophisticated large language models (LLMs), the potential for abuse rises drastically. As a submission to the Swiss AI Safety Prize, we present a novel type of metamorphic malware leveraging LLMs for two key processes. First, LLMs are used for automatic code rewriting to evade signature-based detection by antimalware programs. The malware then spreads its copies via email by utilizing an LLM to socially engineer email replies to encourage recipients to execute the attached malware. Our submission includes a functional minimal prototype, highlighting the risks that LLMs pose for cybersecurity and underscoring the need for further research into intelligent malware.</description>

      <title>The Emperor is Now Clothed: A Secure Governance Framework for Web User Authentication through Password Managers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to facilitate the interaction between password managers and web applications fall short of providing adequate functionality and mitigation strategies against prominent attacks. HTML Autofill is not sufficiently expressive, Credential Management API does not support browser extension password managers, and other proposed solutions do not conform to established user mental models. In this paper, we propose Berytus, a browser-based governance framework that mediates the interaction between password managers and web applications. Two APIs are designed to support Berytus acting as an orchestrator between password managers and web applications. An implementation of the framework in Firefox is developed that fully supports registration and authentication processes. As an orchestrator, Berytus is able to authenticate web applications and facilitate authenticated key exchange between web applications and password managers, which as we show, can provide effective mitigation strategies against phishing, cross-site scripting, inline code injection (e.g., by a malicious browser extension), and TLS proxy in the middle attacks, whereas existing mitigation strategies such as Content Security Policy and credential tokenisation are only partially effective. The framework design also provides desirable functional properties such as support for multi-step, multi-factor, and custom authentication schemes. We provide a comprehensive security and functionality evaluation and discuss possible future directions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Privacy of Spatiotemporal Federated Learning against Gradient Inversion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal federated learning has recently raised intensive studies due to its ability to train valuable models with only shared gradients in various location-based services. On the other hand, recent studies have shown that shared gradients may be subject to gradient inversion attacks (GIA) on images or texts. However, so far there has not been any systematic study of the gradient inversion attacks in spatiotemporal federated learning. In this paper, we explore the gradient attack problem in spatiotemporal federated learning from attack and defense perspectives. To understand privacy risks in spatiotemporal federated learning, we first propose Spatiotemporal Gradient Inversion Attack (ST-GIA), a gradient attack algorithm tailored to spatiotemporal data that successfully reconstructs the original location from gradients. Furthermore, we design an adaptive defense strategy to mitigate gradient inversion attacks in spatiotemporal federated learning. By dynamically adjusting the perturbation levels, we can offer tailored protection for varying rounds of training data, thereby achieving a better trade-off between privacy and utility than current state-of-the-art methods. Through intensive experimental analysis on three real-world datasets, we reveal that the proposed defense strategy can well preserve the utility of spatiotemporal federated learning with effective security protection.</description>

      <title>DISTINQT: A Distributed Privacy Aware Learning Framework for QoS Prediction for Future Mobile and Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond 5G and 6G networks are expected to support new and challenging use cases and applications that depend on a certain level of Quality of Service (QoS) to operate smoothly. Predicting the QoS in a timely manner is of high importance, especially for safety-critical applications as in the case of vehicular communications. Although until recent years the QoS prediction has been carried out by centralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, a number of privacy, computational, and operational concerns have emerged. Alternative solutions have surfaced (e.g. Split Learning, Federated Learning), distributing AI tasks of reduced complexity across nodes, while preserving the privacy of the data. However, new challenges rise when it comes to scalable distributed learning approaches, taking into account the heterogeneous nature of future wireless networks. The current work proposes DISTINQT, a novel multi-headed input privacy-aware distributed learning framework for QoS prediction. Our framework supports multiple heterogeneous nodes, in terms of data types and model architectures, by sharing computations across them. This enables the incorporation of diverse knowledge into a sole learning process that will enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the final QoS prediction model. DISTINQT also contributes to data privacy preservation by encoding any raw input data into highly complex, compressed, and irreversible latent representations before any transmission. Evaluation results showcase that DISTINQT achieves a statistically identical performance compared to its centralized version, while also proving the validity of the privacy preserving claims. DISTINQT manages to achieve a reduction in prediction error of up to 65% on average against six state-of-the-art centralized baseline solutions presented in the Tele-Operated Driving use case.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Graph Backdoor Attacks: A Distribution-Preserving Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks. However, recent works reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Generally, backdoor attack poisons the graph by attaching backdoor triggers and the target class label to a set of nodes in the training graph. A GNN trained on the poisoned graph will then be misled to predict test nodes attached with trigger to the target class. Despite their effectiveness, our empirical analysis shows that triggers generated by existing methods tend to be out-of-distribution (OOD), which significantly differ from the clean data. Hence, these injected triggers can be easily detected and pruned with widely used outlier detection methods in real-world applications. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of unnoticeable graph backdoor attacks with in-distribution (ID) triggers. To generate ID triggers, we introduce an OOD detector in conjunction with an adversarial learning strategy to generate the attributes of the triggers within distribution. To ensure a high attack success rate with ID triggers, we introduce novel modules designed to enhance trigger memorization by the victim model trained on poisoned graph. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating in distribution triggers that can by-pass various defense strategies while maintaining a high attack success rate.</description>
