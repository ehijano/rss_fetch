      <title>Floer homology, clasp-braids and detection results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Martin showed that link Floer homology detects braid axes. In this paper we extend this result to give a topological characterisation of links which are almost braided from the point of view of link Floer homology. The result is inspired by work of Baldwin-Sivek and Li-Ye on nearly fibered knots. Applications include that Khovanov homology detects the Whitehead link and $L7n2$, as well as infinite families of detection results for link Floer homology and annular Khovanov homology.</description>

      <title>Integer surgeries rational homology cobordant to lens spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cyclic Surgery Theorem and Moser's work on surgeries on torus knots imply that for any non-trivial knot in $S^3$, there are at most two integer surgeries that produce a lens space. This paper investigates how many positive integer surgeries on a given knot in $S^3$ can produce a manifold rational homology cobordant to a lens space. Tools include Greene and McCoy's work on changemaker lattices which come from Heegaard Floer $d$-invariants, and Aceto-Celoria-Park's work on rational cobordisms and integral homology which is based on Lisca's work on lens spaces.</description>

      <title>Atoroidal surface bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there is a type-preserving homomorphism from the fundamental group of the figure-eight knot complement to the mapping class group of the thrice-punctured torus. As a corollary, we obtain infinitely many commensurability classes of purely pseudo-Anosov surface subgroups of mapping class groups of closed surfaces. This gives the first examples of compact atoroidal surface bundles over surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a conjecture of Mirzakhani about the statistical behavior of certain expanding families of ``twist tori'' in the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces, showing that they equidistribute to a certain Lebesgue-class measure along almost all sequences. We also identify a number of other expanding families of twist tori whose limiting distributions are mutually singular to Lebesgue.</description>

      <title>On spherical Deligne complexes of type $D_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta$ be the Artin complex of the Artin group of type $D_n$. This complex is also called the spherical Deligne complex of type $D_n$. We show certain types of 6-cycles in the 1-skeleton of $\Delta$ either have a center, which is a vertex adjacent to each vertex of the 6-cycle, or a quasi-center, which is a vertex adjacent to three of the alternating vertices of the 6-cycle. This will be a key ingredient in proving $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for several classes of Artin groups in a companion article.
  As a consequence, we also deduce that certain 2-dimensional relative Artin complex inside the $D_n$-type Artin complex, endowed with the induced Moussong metric, is CAT$(1)$.</description>

      <title>Linear Singer-Hopf conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $X$ is a closed $2n$-dimensional aspherical manifold, i.e., the universal cover of $X$ is contractible, then the Singer-Hopf conjecture predicts that $(-1)^n\chi(X)\geq 0$. We prove this conjecture when $X$ is a complex projective manifold whose fundamental group admits an almost faithful linear representation over any field. In fact, we prove a much stronger statement that if $X$ is a complex projective manifold with large fundamental group and $\pi_1(X)$ admits an almost faithful linear representation, then $\chi(X, {P})\geq 0$ for any perverse sheaf ${P}$ on $X$.
  To prove the main result, we introduce a vanishing cycle functor of multivalued one-forms. Then using techniques from non-abelian Hodge theories in both archimedean and non-archimedean settings, we deduce the desired positivity from the geometry of pure and mixed period maps.</description>

      <title>Cycles in spherical Deligne complexes and application to $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for Artin groups whose Dynkin diagrams are complete bipartite (edge labels are allowed to be arbitrary), answering a question of J. McCammond. Along the way, we treat several related families of hyperbolic type Artin groups, namely the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for all 3-dimensional hyperbolic type Artin groups, except one single example with Dynkin diagram $[3,5,3]$; and the conjecture holds for all quasi-Lann\'er hyperbolic type Artin groups up to dimension 4. We also treat several higher dimensional families.
  Most of the article is about developing new methods of understanding combinatorial minimal fillings of certain types of cycles in spherical Deligne complexes or relative Artin complexes, via non-positive curvature geometry. Then we combine this with an approached to the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture introduced by a previous article of the author to settle new cases of $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture.
  In the appendix we list some related open questions and conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply sutured Floer homology techniques to study the knot and link Floer homologies of various links with annuli embedded in their exteriors. Our main results include, for large $m$, characterizations of links with the same link Floer homology as $(n,nm)$-cables of $L$-space knots or the same knot Floer homology as $(2,2m)$-cables of $L$-space knots. Note that Knot Floer homology carries less grading data than Link Floer homology, so the latter characterizations are stronger than former. These characterizations yield some new link detection results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the antipodal subsets of the full flag manifolds $\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. As a consequence, for natural numbers $d \ge 2$ such that $d\ne 5$ and $d \not\equiv 0,\pm1 \mod 8$, we show that Borel Anosov subgroups of ${\rm SL}(d,\mathbb{R})$ are virtually isomorphic to either a free group or the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic surface. This gives a partial answer to a question asked by Andr\'es Sambarino. Furthermore, we show restrictions on the hyperbolic spaces admitting uniformly regular quasi-isometric embeddings into the symmetric space $X_d$ of ${\rm SL}(d,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Papadima and Suciu proved an inequality between the ranks of the cohomology groups of the Aomoto complex with finite field coefficients and the twisted cohomology groups, and conjectured that they are actually equal for certain cases associated with the Milnor fiber of the arrangement. Recently, an arrangement (the icosidodecahedral arrangement) with the following two peculiar properties was found: (i) the strict version of Papadima-Suciu's inequality holds, and (ii) the first integral homology of the Milnor fiber has a non-trivial $2$-torsion. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between these two properties for double covering spaces. We prove that (i) and (ii) are actually equivalent.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic curves in Stein domains and the tau-invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scope of the paper is threefold. First, we build on recent work by Hayden to compute Hedden's tau-invariant $\tau_{\xi}(L)$ in the case when $\xi$ is a Stein fillable contact structure, and $L$ is a transverse link arising as the boundary of a $J$-holomorphic curve. This leads to a new proof of the relative Thom conjecture for Stein domains. Secondly, we compare the invariant $\tau_\xi$ to the Grigsby-Ruberman-Strle topological tau-invariant $\tau_{\mathfrak s}$, associated to the $\text{Spin}^c$-structure $\mathfrak s=\mathfrak s_\xi$ of the contact structure, to admit topological obstructions for a link type to contain a holomorphically fillable transverse representative. We combine the latter with a result of Mark and Tosun to confirm a conjecture of Gompf: no standardly-oriented Brieskorn homology sphere bounds a rational homology four-ball Stein filling, with any contact structure. Finally, we use our main result together with methods from lattice cohomology to compute the $\tau_{\mathfrak s}$-invariants of certain links in lens spaces, and estimate their PL slice genus.</description>

      <title>An algorithm to construct one-vertex triangulations of Heegaard splittings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following work of Jaco and Rubinstein (2006), which (non-constructively) proved that any 3-manifold admits a one-vertex layered triangulation, we present an algorithm, with implementation using Regina, that uses a combinatorial presentation of a Heegaard diagram to construct a generalised notion of a layered triangulation. We show that work of Husz\'ar and Spreer (2019) extends to our construction: given a genus-$g$ Heegaard splitting, our algorithm generates a triangulation with cutwidth bounded above by $4g-2$. Beyond Heegaard splittings, our construction actually extends to a natural generalisation of Dehn fillings: given a one-vertex triangulation with a genus-$g$ boundary component $B$, we can construct a one-vertex triangulation of any 3-manifold obtained by filling $B$ with a handlebody. To demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm, we present findings from preliminary computer searches using this algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A degree one element of the Orlik-Solomon algebra of a hyperplane arrangement defines a cochain complex known as the Aomoto complex. The Aomoto complex can be considerd as the ``linear approximation'' of the twisted cochain complex with coefficients in a complex rank one local system.
  In this paper, we discuss $q$-deformations of the Aomoto complex. The $q$-deformation is defined by replacing the entries of representation matrices of the coboundary maps with their $q$-analogues. While the resulting maps do not generally define cochain complexes, for certain special basis derived from real structures, the $q$-deformation becomes again a cochain complex. Moreover, it exhibits universality in the sense that any specialization of $q$ to a complex number yields the cochain complex computing the corresponding local system cohomology group.</description>

      <title>Zimmer's conjecture for non-uniform lattices: escape of mass and growth of cocycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.14541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish finiteness of low-dimensional actions of lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups and establish Zimmer's conjecture for many such groups. This builds on previous work of the authors handling the case of actions by cocompact lattices and of actions by $\Sl(n,\Z)$. While the results are not sharp in all cases, they do dramatically improve all known results. The key difficulty overcome in this paper concerns escape of mass when taking limits of sequences of measures. Due to a need to control Lyapunov exponents for unbounded cocycles when taking such limits, quantitative controls on the concentration of mass at infinity are need and novel techniques are introduced to avoid ``escape of Lyapunov exponent."</description>

Abstract: Knot contact homology is an ambient isotopy invariant of knots and links in $\mathbb R^3$. The purpose of this paper is to extend this definition to an ambient isotopy invariant of tangles and prove that gluing of tangles gives a gluing formula for knot contact homology. As a consequence of the gluing formula we obtain that the tangle contact homology detects triviality of tangles.</description>

      <title>New examples and partial classification of 15-vertex triangulations of the quaternionic projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brehm and K\"uhnel (1992) constructed three 15-vertex combinatorial 8-manifolds `like the quaternionic projective plane' with symmetry groups $\mathrm{A}_5$, $\mathrm{A}_4$, and $\mathrm{S}_3$, respectively. Gorodkov (2016) proved that these three manifolds are in fact PL homeomorphic to $\mathbb{HP}^2$. Note that 15 is the minimal number of vertices of a combinatorial 8-manifold that is not PL homeomorphic to $S^8$. In the present paper we construct a lot of new 15-vertex triangulations of $\mathbb{HP}^2$. A surprising fact is that such examples are found for very different symmetry groups, including those not in any way related to the group $\mathrm{A}_5$. Namely, we find 19 triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_7$, one triangulation with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_6\times\mathrm{C}_2$, 14 triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_6$, 26 triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_5$, one new triangulation with symmetry group $\mathrm{A}_4$, and 11 new triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{S}_3$. Further, we obtain the following classification result. We prove that, up to isomorphism, there are exactly 75 triangulations of $\mathbb{HP}^2$ with 15 vertices and symmetry group of order at least 4: the three Brehm-K\"uhnel triangulations and the 72 new triangulations listed above. On the other hand, we show that there are plenty of triangulations with symmetry groups $\mathrm{C}_3$ and $\mathrm{C}_2$, as well as the trivial symmetry group.</description>
