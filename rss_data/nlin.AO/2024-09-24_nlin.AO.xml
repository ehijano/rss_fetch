      <title>Asymmetry underlies stability in power grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavioral homogeneity is often critical for the functioning of network systems of interacting entities. In power grids, whose stable operation requires generator frequencies to be synchronized--and thus homogeneous--across the network, previous work suggests that the stability of synchronous states can be improved by making the generators homogeneous. Here, we show that a substantial additional improvement is possible by instead making the generators suitably heterogeneous. We develop a general method for attributing this counterintuitive effect to converse symmetry breaking, a recently established phenomenon in which the system must be asymmetric to maintain a stable symmetric state. These findings constitute the first demonstration of converse symmetry breaking in real-world systems, and our method promises to enable identification of this phenomenon in other networks whose functions rely on behavioral homogeneity.</description>

      <title>The Efficiency of Synchronization Dynamics and the Role of Network Syncreactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is a fundamental process in both natural and artificial networks. While much work has investigated the asymptotic stability of the synchronous solution, the fundamental question of the transient behavior toward synchronization has received far less attention. In this work, we present the transverse reactivity as a metric to quantify the instantaneous rate of growth or decay of desynchronizing perturbations. We first use the transverse reactivity to design a coupling-efficient and energy-efficient synchronization strategy that involves varying the coupling strength dynamically according to the current state of the system. We find that our synchronization strategy is able to synchronize networks in both simulation and experiment over a significantly larger (often by orders of magnitude) range of coupling strengths than is possible when the coupling strength is constant. Then, we characterize the effects of network topology on the transient dynamics towards synchronization by introducing the concept of network syncreactivity: A network with a larger syncreactivity has a larger transverse reactivity at every point on the synchronization manifold, independent of the oscillator dynamics. We classify real-world examples of complex networks in terms of their syncreactivity.</description>
