      <title>A Replica for our Democracies? On Using Digital Twins to Enhance Deliberative Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deliberative democracy depends on carefully designed institutional frameworks, such as participant selection, facilitation methods, and decision-making mechanisms, that shape how deliberation occurs. However, determining which institutional design best suits a given context often proves difficult when relying solely on real-world observations or laboratory experiments, which can be resource intensive and hard to replicate. To address these challenges, this paper explores Digital Twin (DT) technology as a regulatory sandbox for deliberative democracy. DTs enable researchers and policymakers to run "what if" scenarios on varied deliberative designs in a controlled virtual environment by creating dynamic, computer based models that mirror real or synthetic data. This makes systematic analysis of the institutional design possible without the practical constraints of real world or lab-based settings. The paper also discusses the limitations of this approach and outlines key considerations for future research.</description>

      <title>Multi-Object Tracking for Collision Avoidance Using Multiple Cameras in Open RAN Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the multi-object detection and tracking problem, within the scope of open Radio Access Network (RAN), for collision avoidance in vehicular scenarios. To this end, a set of distributed intelligent agents collocated with cameras are considered. The fusion of detected objects is done at an edge service, considering Open RAN connectivity. Then, the edge service predicts the objects trajectories for collision avoidance. Compared to the related work a more realistic Open RAN network is implemented and multiple cameras are used.</description>

      <title>Self-organisation of common good usage and an application to Internet services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural and human-made common goods present key challenges due to their susceptibility to degradation, overuse, or congestion. We explore the self-organisation of their usage when individuals have access to several available commons but limited information on them. We propose an extension of the Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS) strategy for such systems, under which individuals use a resource iteratively until they are unsuccessful and then shift randomly. This simple strategy leads to a distribution of the use of commons with an improvement against random shifting. Selective individuals who retain information on their usage and accordingly adapt their tolerance to failure in each common good improve the average experienced quality for an entire population. Hybrid systems of selective and non-selective individuals can lead to an equilibrium with equalised experienced quality akin to the ideal free distribution. We show that these results can be applied to the server selection problem faced by mobile users accessing Internet services and we perform realistic simulations to test their validity. Furthermore, these findings can be used to understand other real systems such as animal dispersal on grazing and foraging land, and to propose solutions to operators of systems of public transport or other technological commons.</description>

      <title>Modeling Response Consistency in Multi-Agent LLM Systems: A Comparative Analysis of Shared and Separate Context Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in multi-agent systems (MAS) to enhance collaborative problem-solving and interactive reasoning. Recent advancements have enabled LLMs to function as autonomous agents capable of understanding complex interactions across multiple topics. However, deploying LLMs in MAS introduces challenges related to context management, response consistency, and scalability, especially when agents must operate under memory limitations and handle noisy inputs. While prior research has explored optimizing context sharing and response latency in LLM-driven MAS, these efforts often focus on either fully centralized or decentralized configurations, each with distinct trade-offs.
  In this paper, we develop a probabilistic framework to analyze the impact of shared versus separate context configurations on response consistency and response times in LLM-based MAS. We introduce the Response Consistency Index (RCI) as a metric to evaluate the effects of context limitations, noise, and inter-agent dependencies on system performance. Our approach differs from existing research by focusing on the interplay between memory constraints and noise management, providing insights into optimizing scalability and response times in environments with interdependent topics. Through this analysis, we offer a comprehensive understanding of how different configurations impact the efficiency of LLM-driven multi-agent systems, thereby guiding the design of more robust architectures.</description>

      <title>Achilles Heel of Distributed Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent system (MAS) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in addressing complex challenges, largely due to the integration of multiple large language models (LLMs). However, the heterogeneity of LLMs, the scalability of quantities of LLMs, and local computational constraints pose significant challenges to hosting these models locally. To address these issues, we propose a new framework termed Distributed Multi-Agent System (DMAS). In DMAS, heterogeneous third-party agents function as service providers managed remotely by a central MAS server and each agent offers its services through API interfaces. However, the distributed nature of DMAS introduces several concerns about trustworthiness. In this paper, we study the Achilles heel of distributed multi-agent systems, identifying four critical trustworthiness challenges: free riding, susceptibility to malicious attacks, communication inefficiencies, and system instability. Extensive experiments across seven frameworks and four datasets reveal significant vulnerabilities of the DMAS. These attack strategies can lead to a performance degradation of up to 80% and attain a 100% success rate in executing free riding and malicious attacks. We envision our work will serve as a useful red-teaming tool for evaluating future multi-agent systems and spark further research on trustworthiness challenges in distributed multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>What Contributes to Affective Polarization in Networked Online Environments? Evidence from an Agent-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affective polarization, or, inter-party hostility, is increasingly recognized as a pervasive issue in democracies worldwide, posing a threat to social cohesion. The digital media ecosystem, now widely accessible and ever-present, has often been implicated in accelerating this phenomenon. However, the precise causal mechanisms responsible for driving affective polarization have been a subject of extensive debate. While the concept of echo chambers, characterized by individuals ensconced within like-minded groups, bereft of counter-attitudinal content, has long been the prevailing hypothesis, accumulating empirical evidence suggests a more nuanced picture. This study aims to contribute to the ongoing debate by employing an agent-based model to illustrate how affective polarization is either fostered or hindered by individual news consumption and dissemination patterns based on ideological alignment. To achieve this, we parameterize three key aspects: (1) The affective asymmetry of individuals' engagement with in-party versus out-party content, (2) The proportion of in-party members within one's social neighborhood, and (3) The degree of partisan bias among the elites within the population. Subsequently, we observe macro-level changes in affective polarization within the population under various conditions stipulated by these parameters. This approach allows us to explore the intricate dynamics of affective polarization within digital environments, shedding light on the interplay between individual behaviors, social networks, and information exposure.</description>

      <title>Anytime Single-Step MAPF Planning with Anytime PIBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PIBT is a popular Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) method at the core of many state-of-the-art MAPF methods including LaCAM, CS-PIBT, and WPPL. The main utility of PIBT is that it is a very fast and effective single-step MAPF solver and can return a collision-free single-step solution for hundreds of agents in less than a millisecond. However, the main drawback of PIBT is that it is extremely greedy in respect to its priorities and thus leads to poor solution quality. Additionally, PIBT cannot use all the planning time that might be available to it and returns the first solution it finds. We thus develop Anytime PIBT, which quickly finds a one-step solution identically to PIBT but then continuously improves the solution in an anytime manner. We prove that Anytime PIBT converges to the optimal solution given sufficient time. We experimentally validate that Anytime PIBT can rapidly improve single-step solution quality within milliseconds and even find the optimal single-step action. However, we interestingly find that improving the single-step solution quality does not have a significant effect on full-horizon solution costs.</description>

      <title>Dual Engines of Thoughts: A Depth-Breadth Integration Framework for Open-Ended Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Dual Engines of Thoughts (DEoT), an analytical framework for comprehensive open-ended reasoning. While traditional reasoning frameworks primarily focus on finding "the best answer" or "the correct answer" for single-answer problems, DEoT is specifically designed for "open-ended questions," enabling both broader and deeper analytical exploration. The framework centers on three key components: a Base Prompter for refining user queries, a Solver Agent that orchestrates task decomposition, execution, and validation, and a Dual-Engine System consisting of a Breadth Engine (to explore diverse impact factors) and a Depth Engine (to perform deep investigations). This integrated design allows DEoT to balance wide-ranging coverage with in-depth analysis, and it is highly customizable, enabling users to adjust analytical parameters and tool configurations based on specific requirements. Experimental results show that DEoT excels in addressing complex, multi-faceted questions, achieving a total win rate of 77-86% compared to existing reasoning models, thus highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Event-Triggered Integrated Communication and Control with Graph Information Bottleneck Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated communication and control serves as a critical ingredient in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. However, partial observability limitations will impair collaboration effectiveness, and a potential solution is to establish consensus through well-calibrated latent variables obtained from neighboring agents. Nevertheless, the rigid transmission of less informative content can still result in redundant information exchanges. Therefore, we propose a Consensus-Driven Event-Based Graph Information Bottleneck (CDE-GIB) method, which integrates the communication graph and information flow through a GIB regularizer to extract more concise message representations while avoiding the high computational complexity of inner-loop operations. To further minimize the communication volume required for establishing consensus during interactions, we also develop a variable-threshold event-triggering mechanism. By simultaneously considering historical data and current observations, this mechanism capably evaluates the importance of information to determine whether an event should be triggered. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and adaptability.</description>

      <title>SigmaRL: A Sample-Efficient and Generalizable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source, decentralized framework named SigmaRL, designed to enhance both sample efficiency and generalization of multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) for motion planning of connected and automated vehicles. Most RL agents exhibit a limited capacity to generalize, often focusing narrowly on specific scenarios, and are usually evaluated in similar or even the same scenarios seen during training. Various methods have been proposed to address these challenges, including experience replay and regularization. However, how observation design in RL affects sample efficiency and generalization remains an under-explored area. We address this gap by proposing five strategies to design information-dense observations, focusing on general features that are applicable to most traffic scenarios. We train our RL agents using these strategies on an intersection and evaluate their generalization through numerical experiments across completely unseen traffic scenarios, including a new intersection, an on-ramp, and a roundabout. Incorporating these information-dense observations reduces training times to under one hour on a single CPU, and the evaluation results reveal that our RL agents can effectively zero-shot generalize.

      <title>Reinforcing Clinical Decision Support through Multi-Agent Systems and Ethical AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the age of data-driven medicine, it is paramount to include explainable and ethically managed artificial intelligence in explaining clinical decision support systems to achieve trustworthy and effective patient care. The focus of this paper is on a new architecture of a multi-agent system for clinical decision support that uses modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and the clinical context and then integrates these results to drive predictions and validate outcomes. We describe our implementation with the eICU database to run lab-analysis-specific agents, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners and then run the prediction module and a validation agent. Everything is a transparent implementation of business logic, influenced by the principles of ethical AI governance such as Autonomy, Fairness, and Accountability. It provides visible results that this agent-based framework not only improves on interpretability and accuracy but also on reinforcing trust in AI-assisted decisions in an intensive care setting.</description>
