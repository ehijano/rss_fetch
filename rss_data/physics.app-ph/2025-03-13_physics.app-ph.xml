      <title>Scalable solution chemical synthesis and comprehensive analysis of Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) materials can directly convert heat into electrical energy. However, they sustain costly production procedures and batch-to-batch performance variations. Therefore, developing scalable synthetic techniques for large-scale and reproducible quality TE materials is critical for advancing TE technology. This study developed a facile, high throughput, solution-chemical synthetic technique. Microwave-assisted thermolysis process, providing energy-efficient volumetric heating, was used for the synthesis of bismuth and antimony telluride (Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3). As-made materials were characterized using various techniques, including XRPD, SEM, TEM, XAS, and XPS. Detailed investigation of the local atomic structure of the synthesized Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 powder samples was conducted through synchrotron radiation XAS experiments. The sintered TE materials exhibited low thermal conductivity, achieving the highest TE figure-of-merit values of 0.7 (573 K) and 0.9 (523 K) for n-type Bi2Te3 and p-type Sb2Te3, respectively, shifted significantly to the high-temperature region when compared to earlier reports, highlighting their potential for power generation applications. The scalable, energyand time-efficient synthetic method developed, along with the demonstration of its potential for TE materials, opens the door for a wider application of these materials with minimal environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics optomechanical sensing of a liquid on the micron scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optomechanical device platform for characterization of optical, thermal, and rheological properties of fluids on the micron scale. A suspended silicon microdisk resonator with a vibrating mass of 100 fg and an effective measurement volume of less than a pL is used to monitor properties of different fluids at rest. By employing analytical models for thermo-optical effects, thermal diffusion and fluid-structure interactions, our platform determines the refractive index, thermal conductivity, viscosity, density and compressibility of the fluid, in a compact measurement setup. A single measurement takes as short as 70 microseconds, and the employed power can be less than 100 microwatts, guaranteeing measurement at rest and in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Fast-response low power atomic oven for integration into an ion microchip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel microfabricated neutral atom source for quantum technologies that can be easily integrated onto microchip devices using well-established MEMS fabrication techniques, and contrast this to conventional off-chip ion loading mechanisms. The heating filament of the device is shown to be as small as 90$\times$90 $\mu$m$^2$. Testing of the $^{171}$Yb fluorescence response is found to be in the low tens of milliseconds, two orders of magnitude faster compared to previous literature at a power of milliwatts making it desirable for low-power device packages. We demonstrate how the evaporation material can be capped in vacuum to work with materials such as Ba that oxidise easily in air, which can avoid the need for ablation lasers in the loading process. We calculate oven lifetimes to be over 10 years of continuous use for commonly used ion species in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Institutional Free Market in Accredited Medical Physics Graduate Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical Physics education is delivered through accredited programs with admissions and funding for students determined by individual institutions providing the educational experiences. Public data from accredited graduate programs, along with funding data, were used to analyze institutional trends in this educational market. Temporal trends from 2017 to 2023 show robust growth in MS graduates, increasing at an average of 17.7 per year, as compared to steady but modest growth in PhDs, increasing by 3.6 per year. The current status is there are nearly two MS graduates for every PhD graduate. Trends in funding show self-funding of students is a dominant pathway in domestic programs. Those programs dominated by accredited MS education have their largest fraction of faculty in radiation oncology departments, whereas those dominated by PhD education have their largest fraction of faculty in radiology departments. Overall NIH funding in the space of radiation diagnostics and therapeutics has been largely static over this timeframe, but with a notable 5 year rise in NCI funding. This can be contrasted to a substantial 5X-6X rise in NIH funding for engineering research in this same period, with significant increases in trainee funding there. Taken as a whole, this survey shows that growth in the field of medical physics education is dominated by MS graduates, presumably servicing the expanded growth needs for well-trained clinical physicists. However, the research infrastructure that supports PhD training in medical physics seems likely to be growing modestly and missing the growth trend of NIH funding that appears to show substantially more growth in non-accredited programs such as biomedical engineering. This data is useful to informing accreditation guidance on numbers of graduates to match the workforce needs or for inter-institutional planning around education goals.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Terahertz Spectral Bands for Next Generation of Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-increasing demand for high-speed data transmission continues to motivate research and development efforts towards the sixth generation (6G) of wireless communication technologies and beyond. The use of terahertz (THz) carrier frequencies is considered to achieve faster data transmission rates, with the potential to reach terabits per second. However, there is a necessity to study the impact of environmental factors affecting the signal transmission at these frequencies. One key challenge of THz signal propagation through air is water vapor absorption, which can severely limit the broadcast distance of THz wireless communications. In this work, we investigate the propagation distance of several THz channels under 35 % relative humidity atmospheric conditions using a table-top THz spectroscopy apparatus equipped with a sensitive THz detection system based on nonlinear parametric upconversion. Our results show seven transmission bands between 1 and 3 THz with negligible signal absorption at different propagation lengths with potential application in short-, mid- and long-range wireless communications.</description>

      <title>A high-speed heterogeneous lithium tantalate silicon photonics platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has driven the demand for faster optical components in data centres to unprecedented levels. A key advancement in this field is the integration of multiple photonic components onto a single chip, enhancing the performance of optical transceivers. Here, silicon photonics, benefiting from mature fabrication processes, has gained prominence. The platform combines modulators, switches, photodetectors and low-loss waveguides on a single chip. However, emerging standards like 1600ZR+ potentially exceed the capabilities of silicon-based modulators. To address these limitations, thin-film lithium niobate has been proposed as an alternative to silicon photonics, offering a low voltage-length product and exceptional high-speed modulation properties. More recently, the first demonstrations of thin-film lithium tantalate circuits have emerged, addressing some of the disadvantages of lithium niobate enabling a reduced bias drift and enhanced resistance to optical damage. As such, making it a promising candidate for next-generation photonic platforms. However, a persistent drawback of such platforms is the lithium contamination, which complicates integration with CMOS fabrication processes. Here, we present for the first time the integration of lithium tantalate onto a silicon photonics chip. This integration is achieved without modifying the standard silicon photonics process design kit. Our device achieves low half-wave voltage (3.5 V), low insertion loss (2.9 dB) and high-speed operation (&gt; 70 GHz), paving the way for next-gen applications. By minimising lithium tantalate material use, our approach reduces costs while leveraging existing silicon photonics technology advancements, in particular supporting ultra-fast monolithic germanium photodetectors and established process design kits.</description>

      <title>Compact dose delivery of laser-accelerated high-energy electron beams towards radiotherapy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of very high energy electron (VHEE) beams for radiotherapy has been actively studied for over two decades due to their advantageous dose distribution, deep penetration depth and great potential of ultra-high dose-rate irradiation. Recently, laser-plasma wakefield accelerator (LWFA) has emerged as a promising method for the compact generation of VHEE beams, due to its substantially higher accelerating gradients compared to traditional radio-frequency accelerators. However, how to compactly deliver the LWFA-based VHEE beams of relatively large energy spread and create a maximum dose deeply inside the body remains very challenging. In this article, we present a simple dose delivery scheme utilizing only two dipole magnets for LWFA-based VHEE treatment. By adjusting the magnet strengths, the electron beams can be guided along different angular trajectories towards a precise position as deep as 20 cm within a water phantom, creating a maximum dose over the target region and significantly reducing the entrance dose. Supported by Monte Carlo simulations, such a beam delivery approach is demonstrated to be insensitive to the beam energy spread and meanwhile capable of controlling precisely the dose-peak position in both lateral and longitudinal directions. As such, a uniform dose peak can be generated by the weighted sum of VHEE beams that reach different dose-peak depths. These results demonstrate that LWFA-based VHEE beams can be compactly delivered into a deep-seated tumor region in a controllable manner, thus advancing the development of the VHEE radiotherapy towards the practical clinical applications in the near future.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modulation of dual-band nonreciprocal radiation in a graphene-Weyl semimetal plasmonic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop a hybrid structure combining graphene and Weyl semimetal, capable of achieving dynamically adjustable dual-band nonreciprocal radiation. The results reveal that the nonreciprocal radiation can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between resonance mode excitation and the unique properties of Weyl materials, with the electric field distribution providing further insights into the graphene plasmon modes involved. By exploiting the resonant characteristics of graphene plasmons, we demonstrate that strong nonreciprocal radiation can be effectively regulated through adjusting the grating's geometric parameters, while maintaining robustness over a wide range. Notably, substantial dynamic tuning of the resonant wavelength for nonreciprocal radiation is achievable by modulating the Fermi level of graphene. Our research results offer promising prospects for the developing of complex energy harvesting and conversion systems within advanced thermal frameworks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced multichannel dual-comb spectroscopy of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multichannel dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) approach for high-resolution, broadband spectral measurements is presented, demonstrating its effectiveness in studying complex atomic systems. By implementing a photodetector array, we enhance DCS capabilities, addressing the fundamental trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral coverage. To resolve ambiguities in frequency conversion, we introduced a relative offset in the radio frequency (RF) comb teeth, ensuring accurate spectral reconstruction. As a proof of concept, the absorption spectrum of samarium (Sm) vapor is investigated over a 52nm range, and several previously unreported absorption lines are detected. This is a step toward "Spectroscopy 2.0", enabling massively parallel spectroscopic measurements (including those at &gt;100 T magnetic fields) crucial for atomic physics and fundamental interactions research.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Massless Excitons and Linear Exciton Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons -- elementary excitations formed by bound electron-hole pairs -- govern the optical properties and excited-state dynamics of materials. In two-dimensions (2D), excitons are theoretically predicted to have a linear energy-momentum relation with a non-analytic discontinuity in the long wavelength limit, mimicking the dispersion of a photon. This results in an exciton that behaves like a massless particle, despite the fact that it is a composite boson composed of massive constituents. However, experimental observation of massless excitons has remained elusive. In this work, we unambiguously experimentally observe the predicted linear exciton dispersion in freestanding monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The experimental result is in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction based on ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Additionally, we identify the lowest dipole-allowed transition in monolayer hBN to be at 6.6 eV, illuminating a long-standing debate about the band gap of monolayer hBN. These findings provide critical insights into 2D excitonic physics and open new avenues for exciton-mediated superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and high-efficiency optoelectronic applications.</description>
