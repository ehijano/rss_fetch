      <title>New Interval Calculus with Application to Interval Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of the calculus of interval-valued functions and its application to interval differential equations. To this end, first, we introduce new interval arithmetic operations. Under new operations, the space of interval numbers becomes a strict linear space, and indeed a Hilbert space, whereas the traditional interval arithmetic yields only a semilinear space with a defective algebraic structure. Secondly, by basing derivative and integral of interval-valued functions on the proposed operations, we retain every essential property of classical calculus while seamlessly incorporating ideas from the multiplicative calculus. The resulting unified hybrid framework eliminates the tedious case-by-case inspection of switching points required by the gH-derivative, leading to a markedly streamlined computational procedure. Finally, we establish an existence theorem for solutions of interval differential equations within the new calculus and corroborate its validity and practicality through representative examples. In contrast to the gH-derivative approach, the number of potential solutions does not explode doubly with additional switching points, ensuring robustness in both theory and computation.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Elements of Sequence Space $Seq(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21751v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequence space of all real-valued sequences, denoted $Seq(\mathbb{R})$, is typically investigated through the lens of infinite-dimensional vector spaces, utilizing Banach space norms or Schauder bases. This work proposes a complementary, constructive classification based instead on the asymptotic limit profile encoded by the pair $(\liminf a_n, \limsup a_n)$. We demonstrate that this perspective naturally partitions $Seq(\mathbb{R})$ into seven mutually disjoint macroscale blocks, covering behaviors from finite convergence to bounded and unbounded oscillation. For each block, we provide explicit closed-form representative sequences and establish that every constituent class possesses the cardinality of the continuum. Furthermore, we investigate the structural relationships between these blocks at two distinct levels of granularity. At the macroscale, we employ injective mappings to define an idealized connectivity graph, while at the microscale, we introduce a connection relation governed by the Hadamard (pointwise) product. This dual analysis reveals a rich directed graph structure where the block of finite convergent sequences functions both as the only block subspace and as a global attractor with no outgoing connections. Statistical comparisons between the idealized and realized adjacency matrices indicate that the pointwise product structure realizes approximately two-thirds of the theoretically possible macroscale relations. Ultimately, this partition-based framework endows the seemingly chaotic space $Seq(\mathbb{R})$ with a transparent, geometrically interpretable internal structure.</description>

      <title>Luxemburg Norm Localisation for Nonlocal Differential Equations in Variable Exponent Lebesgue Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of variable growth nonlocal differential equations of Kirchhoff-type having the general form \(-A\!\left(\int_0^1 b(1-s)\,\big(u(s)\big)^{p(s)}\,ds\right)\,u''(t) = \lambda\,f(t,u(t))\) for \(t\in(0,1)\), where \(A\) is a possibly sign-changing function. Our analysis is carried out in the variable-exponent Lebesgue space \(L^{p(\cdot)}([0,1])\) under the standing hypothesis \(p(t)&gt;1\). We demonstrate that using the Luxemburg norm allows for a much sharper localisation of the solution to the nonlocal problem. Moreover, the conditions imposed on both \(\lambda\) and \(f\) are appreciably weakened when the problem is analysed within the Luxemburg norm framework. An example explicitly demonstrates both the qualitative and quantitative advantages over earlier techniques.</description>

      <title>A proof of irrationality of $\pi$ based on nested radicals with roots of $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider four theorems that can be used to prove the irrationality of $\pi$. These theorems are related to nested radicals with roots of $2$ of kind $c_k = \sqrt{2 + c_{k - 1}} $ and $c_0 = 0$. Sample computations showing how the rational approximation tend to $\pi$ with increasing the integer $k$ are presented.</description>

      <title>Infinite integrals in terms of series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19867v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we derive and evaluate some infinite integrals involving the product of a generalized logarithm and polynomial functions in the denominator. These integrals are expressed in terms of finite series involving the Hurwitz-Lerch zeta function. We produce special cases of these integrals in terms of other special functions and fundamental constants.</description>
