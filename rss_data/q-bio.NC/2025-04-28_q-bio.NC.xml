      <title>Seizure duration is associated with multiple timescales in interictal iEEG band power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background Seizure severity can change from one seizure to the next within individual people with epilepsy. It is unclear if and how seizure severity is modulated over longer timescales. Characterising seizure severity variability over time could lead to tailored treatments. In this study, we test if continuously-recorded interictal intracranial EEG (iEEG) features encapsulate signatures of such modulations.
  Methods We analysed 20 subjects with iEEG recordings of at least one day. We identified cycles on timescales of hours to days embedded in long-term iEEG band power and associated them with seizure severity, which we approximated using seizure duration. In order to quantify these associations, we created linear-circular statistical models of seizure duration that incorporated different band power cycles within each subject.
  Findings In most subjects, seizure duration was weakly to moderately correlated with individual band power cycles. Combinations of multiple band power cycles significantly explained most of the variability in seizure duration. Specifically, we found 70% of the models had a higher than 60% adjusted $R^2$ across all subjects. From these models, around 80% were deemed to be above chance-level (p-value &lt; 0.05) based on permutation tests. Models included cycles of ultradian, circadian and slower timescales in a subject-specific manner.
  Interpretation These results suggest that seizure severity, as measured by seizure duration, may be modulated over timescales of minutes to days by subject-specific cycles in interictal iEEG signal properties. These cycles likely serve as markers of seizure modulating processes. Future work can investigate biological drivers of these detected fluctuations and may inform novel treatment strategies that minimise seizure severity.</description>

      <title>A computational model of infant sensorimotor exploration in the mobile paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational model of the mechanisms that may determine infants' behavior in the "mobile paradigm". This paradigm has been used in developmental psychology to explore how infants learn the sensory effects of their actions. In this paradigm, a mobile (an articulated and movable object hanging above an infant's crib) is connected to one of the infant's limbs, prompting the infant to preferentially move that "connected" limb. This ability to detect a "sensorimotor contingency" is considered to be a foundational cognitive ability in development. To understand how infants learn sensorimotor contingencies, we built a model that attempts to replicate infant behavior. Our model incorporates a neural network, action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, preferred activity level, and biologically-inspired motor control. We find that simulations with our model replicate the classic findings in the literature showing preferential movement of the connected limb. An interesting observation is that the model sometimes exhibits a burst of movement after the mobile is disconnected, casting light on a similar occasional finding in infants. In addition to these general findings, the simulations also replicate data from two recent more detailed studies using a connection with the mobile that was either gradual or all-or-none. A series of ablation studies further shows that the inclusion of mechanisms of action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, and biologically-inspired motor control was essential for the model to correctly replicate infant behavior. This suggests that these components are also involved in infants' sensorimotor learning.</description>

      <title>Better artificial intelligence does not mean better models of biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate perception and neural responses as they improved on vision benchmarks, raising hopes that advances in AI would yield better models of biological vision. However, we show across three benchmarks that this alignment is now plateauing - and in some cases worsening - as DNNs scale to human or superhuman accuracy. This divergence may reflect the adoption of visual strategies that differ from those used by primates. These findings challenge the view that progress in artificial intelligence will naturally translate to neuroscience. We argue that vision science must chart its own course, developing algorithms grounded in biological visual systems rather than optimizing for benchmarks based on internet-scale datasets.</description>
