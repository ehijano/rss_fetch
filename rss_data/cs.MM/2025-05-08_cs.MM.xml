      <title>RFNNS: Robust Fixed Neural Network Steganography with Popular Deep Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image steganography is a technique that conceals secret information in a cover image to achieve covert communication. Recent research has demonstrated that Fixed Neural Network Steganography (FNNS) exhibits significant practical advantages, as it enables stable and efficient steganographic embedding and extraction without requiring neural network training. However, the stego image generated by existing FNNS methods suffers from considerable distortion and exhibits poor robustness, severely reducing the security and practicality of steganography. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Robust Fixed Neural Network Steganography (RFNNS). In RFNNS, we introduce a texture-aware localization technique to add perturbations carrying secret image information to complex texture areas that are less perceptible to the human eye, thereby ensuring the quality of the stego image. To enhance robustness, a robust steganographic perturbation generation (RSPG) strategy is designed, which enables slight perturbations to be accurately decoded even after common image attacks. Subsequently, the generated robust perturbations are combined with the AI-generated cover image to produce the stego image. The receiver only needs to share the secret key and employ the same decoding network structure to accurately extract the secret image from the attacked stego image. Experimental results demonstrate that RFNNS achieves enhanced performance in terms of security, including imperceptibility and anti-steganalysis performance. Furthermore, RFNNS demonstrates superior robustness against common image attacks, such as JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and contrast adjustment, across diverse embedding capacities, outperforming existing SOTA FNNS methods.</description>

      <title>Securing Immersive 360 Video Streams through Attribute-Based Selective Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delivering high-quality, secure 360{\deg} video content introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the high bitrates and interactive demands of immersive media. Traditional HTTPS-based methods, although widely used, face limitations in computational efficiency and scalability when securing these high-resolution streams. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel framework integrating Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) with selective encryption techniques tailored specifically for tiled 360{\deg} video streaming. Our approach employs selective encryption of frames at varying levels to reduce computational overhead while ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access.
  Moreover, we explore viewport-adaptive encryption, dynamically encrypting more frames within tiles occupying larger portions of the viewer's field of view. This targeted method significantly enhances security in critical viewing areas without unnecessary overhead in peripheral regions. We deploy and evaluate our proposed approach using the CloudLab testbed, comparing its performance against traditional HTTPS streaming. Experimental results demonstrate that our ABE-based model achieves reduced computational load on intermediate caches, improves cache hit rates, and maintains comparable visual quality to HTTPS, as assessed by Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF).</description>

      <title>HDiffTG: A Lightweight Hybrid Diffusion-Transformer-GCN Architecture for 3D Human Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose HDiffTG, a novel 3D Human Pose Estimation (3DHPE) method that integrates Transformer, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and diffusion model into a unified framework. HDiffTG leverages the strengths of these techniques to significantly improve pose estimation accuracy and robustness while maintaining a lightweight design. The Transformer captures global spatiotemporal dependencies, the GCN models local skeletal structures, and the diffusion model provides step-by-step optimization for fine-tuning, achieving a complementary balance between global and local features. This integration enhances the model's ability to handle pose estimation under occlusions and in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce lightweight optimizations to the integrated model and refine the objective function design to reduce computational overhead without compromising performance. Evaluation results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that HDiffTG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset while excelling in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, the model exhibits exceptional robustness in noisy and occluded environments. Source codes and models are available at https://github.com/CirceJie/HDiffTG</description>

      <title>Automatic Music Transcription using Convolutional Neural Networks and Constant-Q transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic music transcription (AMT) is the problem of analyzing an audio recording of a musical piece and detecting notes that are being played. AMT is a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to polyphonic music. The goal of AMT is to produce a score representation of a music piece, by analyzing a sound signal containing multiple notes played simultaneously. In this work, we design a processing pipeline that can transform classical piano audio files in .wav format into a music score representation. The features from the audio signals are extracted using the constant-Q transform, and the resulting coefficients are used as an input to the convolutional neural network (CNN) model.</description>

      <title>"I Can See Forever!": Evaluating Real-time VideoLLMs for Assisting Individuals with Visual Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The visually impaired population, especially the severely visually impaired, is currently large in scale, and daily activities pose significant challenges for them. Although many studies use large language and vision-language models to assist the blind, most focus on static content and fail to meet real-time perception needs in dynamic and complex environments, such as daily activities. To provide them with more effective intelligent assistance, it is imperative to incorporate advanced visual understanding technologies. Although real-time vision and speech interaction VideoLLMs demonstrate strong real-time visual understanding, no prior work has systematically evaluated their effectiveness in assisting visually impaired individuals. In this work, we conduct the first such evaluation. First, we construct a benchmark dataset (VisAssistDaily), covering three categories of assistive tasks for visually impaired individuals: Basic Skills, Home Life Tasks, and Social Life Tasks. The results show that GPT-4o achieves the highest task success rate. Next, we conduct a user study to evaluate the models in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, further exploring the practical challenges of applying VideoLLMs in assistive contexts. One key issue we identify is the difficulty current models face in perceiving potential hazards in dynamic environments. To address this, we build an environment-awareness dataset named SafeVid and introduce a polling mechanism that enables the model to proactively detect environmental risks. We hope this work provides valuable insights and inspiration for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Score Distillation Sampling for Audio: Source Separation, Synthesis, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Audio-SDS, a generalization of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to text-conditioned audio diffusion models. While SDS was initially designed for text-to-3D generation using image diffusion, its core idea of distilling a powerful generative prior into a separate parametric representation extends to the audio domain. Leveraging a single pretrained model, Audio-SDS enables a broad range of tasks without requiring specialized datasets. In particular, we demonstrate how Audio-SDS can guide physically informed impact sound simulations, calibrate FM-synthesis parameters, and perform prompt-specified source separation. Our findings illustrate the versatility of distillation-based methods across modalities and establish a robust foundation for future work using generative priors in audio tasks.</description>

      <title>EchoInk-R1: Exploring Audio-Visual Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced perception across text, vision, and audio, yet they often struggle with structured cross-modal reasoning, particularly when integrating audio and visual signals. We introduce EchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in MLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice question answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we curate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with multiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves 85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which scores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy, EchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial interpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs. These results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning enhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to unify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning via reinforcement learning. Code and data are publicly released to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>EEmo-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-modal Large Language Models on Image Evoked Emotion Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The furnishing of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has led to the emergence of numerous benchmark studies, particularly those evaluating their perception and understanding capabilities. Among these, understanding image-evoked emotions aims to enhance MLLMs' empathy, with significant applications such as human-machine interaction and advertising recommendations. However, current evaluations of this MLLM capability remain coarse-grained, and a systematic and comprehensive assessment is still lacking. To this end, we introduce EEmo-Bench, a novel benchmark dedicated to the analysis of the evoked emotions in images across diverse content categories. Our core contributions include: 1) Regarding the diversity of the evoked emotions, we adopt an emotion ranking strategy and employ the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) as emotional attributes for emotional assessment. In line with this methodology, 1,960 images are collected and manually annotated. 2) We design four tasks to evaluate MLLMs' ability to capture the evoked emotions by single images and their associated attributes: Perception, Ranking, Description, and Assessment. Additionally, image-pairwise analysis is introduced to investigate the model's proficiency in performing joint and comparative analysis. In total, we collect 6,773 question-answer pairs and perform a thorough assessment on 19 commonly-used MLLMs. The results indicate that while some proprietary and large-scale open-source MLLMs achieve promising overall performance, the analytical capabilities in certain evaluation dimensions remain suboptimal. Our EEmo-Bench paves the path for further research aimed at enhancing the comprehensive perceiving and understanding capabilities of MLLMs concerning image-evoked emotions, which is crucial for machine-centric emotion perception and understanding.</description>

      <title>JEN-1: Text-Guided Universal Music Generation with Omnidirectional Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music generation has attracted growing interest with the advancement of deep generative models. However, generating music conditioned on textual descriptions, known as text-to-music, remains challenging due to the complexity of musical structures and high sampling rate requirements. Despite the task's significance, prevailing generative models exhibit limitations in music quality, computational efficiency, and generalization. This paper introduces JEN-1, a universal high-fidelity model for text-to-music generation. JEN-1 is a diffusion model incorporating both autoregressive and non-autoregressive training. Through in-context learning, JEN-1 performs various generation tasks including text-guided music generation, music inpainting, and continuation. Evaluations demonstrate JEN-1's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in text-music alignment and music quality while maintaining computational efficiency.

      <title>Diverse Audio Embeddings-- Bringing Features Back Outperforms CLAP !</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of modern AI architectures, a shift has happened towards end-to-end architectures. This pivot has led to neural architectures being trained without domain-specific biases/knowledge, optimized according to the task. We in this paper, learn audio embeddings via diverse feature representations, in this case, domain-specific. For the case of audio classification over hundreds of categories of sound, we learn robust separate embeddings for diverse audio properties such as pitch, timbre, and neural representation, along with also learning it via an end-to-end architecture. We observe handcrafted embeddings, e.g., pitch and timbre-based, although on their own, are not able to beat a fully end-to-end representation, yet adding these together with end-to-end embedding helps us, significantly improve performance. This work would pave the way to bring some domain expertise with end-to-end models to learn robust, diverse representations, surpassing the performance of just training end-to-end models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study music generation conditioned solely on the video. First, we present a large-scale dataset comprising 360K video-music pairs, including various genres such as movie trailers, advertisements, and documentaries. Furthermore, we propose VidMuse, a simple framework for generating music aligned with video inputs. VidMuse stands out by producing high-fidelity music that is both acoustically and semantically aligned with the video. By incorporating local and global visual cues, VidMuse enables the creation of musically coherent audio tracks that consistently match the video content through Long-Short-Term modeling. Through extensive experiments, VidMuse outperforms existing models in terms of audio quality, diversity, and audio-visual alignment. The code and datasets are available at https://vidmuse.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04388v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents question-answering on dense video events, a novel task that answers and grounds dense-event questions in long videos, thus challenging MLLMs to faithfully comprehend and reason about multiple events over extended periods of time. To facilitate the study, we construct DeVE-QA -- a dataset featuring 78K questions about 26K events on 10.6K long videos. Our benchmarking shows that state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle on DeVE-QA. For improvement, we propose DeVi, a novel training-free MLLM approach that highlights a hierarchical captioning module, a temporal event memory module, and a self-consistency checking module to respectively detect, contextualize and memorize, and ground dense-events in long videos for question answering. Extensive experiments show that DeVi is superior at answering dense-event questions and grounding relevant video moments. Compared with existing MLLMs, it achieves a remarkable increase of 4.8% and 2.1% for G(round)QA accuracy on DeVE-QA~and NExT-GQA, respectively. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Weakly-supervised Audio Temporal Forgery Localization via Progressive Audio-language Co-learning Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio temporal forgery localization (ATFL) aims to find the precise forgery regions of the partial spoof audio that is purposefully modified. Existing ATFL methods rely on training efficient networks using fine-grained annotations, which are obtained costly and challenging in real-world scenarios. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose a progressive audio-language co-learning network (LOCO) that adopts co-learning and self-supervision manners to prompt localization performance under weak supervision scenarios. Specifically, an audio-language co-learning module is first designed to capture forgery consensus features by aligning semantics from temporal and global perspectives. In this module, forgery-aware prompts are constructed by using utterance-level annotations together with learnable prompts, which can incorporate semantic priors into temporal content features dynamically. In addition, a forgery localization module is applied to produce forgery proposals based on fused forgery-class activation sequences. Finally, a progressive refinement strategy is introduced to generate pseudo frame-level labels and leverage supervised semantic contrastive learning to amplify the semantic distinction between real and fake content, thereby continuously optimizing forgery-aware features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LOCO achieves SOTA performance on three public benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation technology is widely used in human-computer interaction, and the emergence of diffusion models has further advanced its development. Currently, most methods rely on multi-stage generation and intermediate representations, resulting in long inference time and issues with generation quality in specific foreground regions and audio-motion consistency. These shortcomings are primarily due to the lack of localized fine-grained supervised guidance. To address above challenges, we propose PAHA, an end-to-end audio-driven upper-body human animation framework with diffusion model. We introduce two key methods: Parts-Aware Re-weighting (PAR) and Parts Consistency Enhancement (PCE). PAR dynamically adjusts regional training loss weights based on pose confidence scores, effectively improving visual quality. PCE constructs and trains diffusion-based regional audio-visual classifiers to improve the consistency of motion and co-speech audio. Afterwards, we design two novel inference guidance methods for the foregoing classifiers, Sequential Guidance (SG) and Differential Guidance (DG), to balance efficiency and quality respectively. Additionally, we build CNAS, the first public Chinese News Anchor Speech dataset, to advance research and validation in this field. Extensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that PAHA significantly outperforms existing methods in audio-motion alignment and video-related evaluations. The codes and CNAS dataset will be released upon acceptance.</description>
