      <title>Streaming problems as (multi-issue) claims problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating the revenues raised via paid subscriptions to music streaming platforms among participating artists. We show that the main methods to solve streaming problems (pro-rata, user-centric and families generalizing them) can be seen as specific (well-known) rules to solve (multi-issue) claims problems. Our results permit to provide strong links between the well-established literature on claims problems and the emerging literature on streaming problems.</description>

      <title>Using Ordinal Voting to Compare the Utilitarian Welfare of a Status Quo and A Proposed Policy: A Simple Nonparametric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship of policy choice by majority voting and by maximization of utilitarian welfare has long been discussed. I consider choice between a status quo and a proposed policy when persons have interpersonally comparable cardinal utilities taking values in a bounded interval, voting is compulsory, and each person votes for a policy that maximizes utility. I show that knowledge of the attained status quo welfare and the voting outcome yields an informative bound on welfare with the proposed policy. The bound contains the value of status quo welfare, so the better utilitarian policy is not known. The minimax-regret decision and certain Bayes decisions choose the proposed policy if its vote share exceeds the known value of status quo welfare. This procedure differs from majority rule, which chooses the proposed policy if its vote share exceeds 1/2.</description>

      <title>Market allocations under conflation of goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study competitive equilibria in exchange economies when a continuum of goods is conflated into a finite set of commodities. The design of conflation choices affects the allocation of scarce resources among agents, by constraining trading opportunities and shifting competitive pressures. We demonstrate the consequences on relative prices, trading positions, and welfare.</description>

      <title>A Certain Notion of Strategy Freedom under Retail Competition in Claims Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new axiom for rules for claims problems is introduced. It strengthens a condition studied in supply chain literature, which forces rules to disincentivize order inflation under capacity allocation and retail competition. The relevance of the axiom is further demonstrated by one of the main results of the present article: it characterizes the weighted constrained equal awards rule together with known natural axioms.</description>

      <title>Eliciting and Distinguishing Between Weak and Incomplete Preferences: Theory, Experiment and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14431v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering and distinguishing between the strict-preference, indifference and/or indecisiveness parts of a decision maker's preferences is a challenging task but also important for testing theory and conducting welfare analysis. This paper contributes towards this goal by reporting on data from a lab experiment on riskless choice that were analyzed with novel theory-guided computational methods. The experiment included both Forced- and Free-Choice treatments. Its primary novelty consisted of allowing all subjects to select multiple alternatives at each menu. Based on a non-parametric goodness-of-fit criterion that we introduce, which generalizes intuitively a widely used pre-existing method to environments of multi-valued choices, each subjects' decision data were tested against three structured general-choice models that feature maximization of stable but potentially weak and/or incomplete preferences. Nearly 60% of all subjects' are well-explained by one of these models, typically with a unique model-optimal preference relation per subject. Importantly, preferences usually (80%) had a non-trivial indifference part and, where applicable, a clearly distinct indecisiveness part. The achieved uncoupling of revealed indifference and indecisiveness is documented empirically for the first time.</description>

      <title>Random Assignment of Indivisible Goods under Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of random assignment of indivisible goods, in which each agent has an ordinal preference and a constraint. Our goal is to characterize the conditions under which there always exists a random assignment that simultaneously satisfies efficiency and envy-freeness. The probabilistic serial mechanism ensures the existence of such an assignment for the unconstrained setting. In this paper, we consider a more general setting in which each agent can consume a set of items only if the set satisfies her feasibility constraint. Such constraints must be taken into account in student course placements, employee shift assignments, and so on. We demonstrate that an efficient and envy-free assignment may not exist even for the simple case of partition matroid constraints, where the items are categorized, and each agent demands one item from each category. We then identify special cases in which an efficient and envy-free assignment always exists. For these cases, the probabilistic serial cannot be naturally extended; therefore, we provide mechanisms to find the desired assignment using various approaches.</description>

      <title>Maximum Flow is Fair: A Network Flow Approach to Committee Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the committee voting setting, a subset of $k$ alternatives is selected based on the preferences of voters. In this paper, our goal is to efficiently compute $\textit{ex-ante}$ fair probability distributions over committees. We introduce a new axiom called $\textit{group resource proportionality}$, which strengthens other fairness notions in the literature. We characterize our fairness axiom by a correspondence with max flows on a network formulation of committee voting. Using the connection to flow networks revealed by this characterization, we introduce two voting rules which achieve fairness in conjunction with other desiderata. The first rule - the $\textit{redistributive utilitarian rule}$ - satisfies ex-ante efficiency in addition to our fairness axiom. The second rule - Generalized CUT - reduces instances of our problem to instances of the minimum-cost maximum flow problem. We show that Generalized CUT maximizes social welfare subject to our fairness axiom and additionally satisfies an incentive compatibility property known as $\textit{excludable strategyproofness}$. Lastly, we show our fairness property can be obtained in tandem with strong $\textit{ex-post}$ fairness properties - an approach known as $\textit{best-of-both-worlds}$ fairness. We strengthen existing best-or-both-worlds fairness results in committee voting and resolve an open question posed by Aziz et al. [2023].</description>
