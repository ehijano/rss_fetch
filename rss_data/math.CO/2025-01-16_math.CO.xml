      <title>On Lattice Tilings of Asymmetric Limited-Magnitude Balls $\cB(n,2,m,m-1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited-magnitude errors modify a transmitted integer vector in at most $t$ entries, where each entry can increase by at most $\kp$ or decrease by at most $\km$. This channel model is particularly relevant to applications such as flash memories and DNA storage. A perfect code for this channel is equivalent to a tiling of $\Z^n$ by asymmetric limited-magnitude balls $\cB(n,t,\kp,\km)$. In this paper, we focus on the case where $t=2$ and $\km=\kp-1$, and we derive necessary conditions on $m$ and $n$ for the existence of a lattice tiling of $\cB(n,2,m,m-1)$. Specifically, we prove that for each $m$, there are only finitely many $n$ for which such a lattice tiling is possible. Moreover, for $m=2$, we show that no lattice tiling of $\cB(n,2,2,1)$ exists for any $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Matching Cut and Variants on Bipartite Graphs of Bounded Radius and Diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Matching Cut problem we ask whether a graph $G$ has a matching cut, that is, a matching which is also an edge cut of $G$. We consider the variants Perfect Matching Cut and Disconnected Perfect Matching where we ask whether there exists a matching cut equal to, respectively contained in, a perfect matching. Further, in the problem Maximum Matching Cut we ask for a matching cut with a maximum number of edges. The last problem we consider is $d$-Cut where we ask for an edge cut where each vertex is incident to at most $d$ edges in the cut.
  We investigate the computational complexity of these problems on bipartite graphs of bounded radius and diameter. Our results extend known results for Matching Cut and Disconnected Perfect Matching. We give complexity dichotomies for $d$-Cut and Maximum Matching Cut and solve one of two open cases for Disconnected Perfect Matching. For Perfect Matching Cut we give the first hardness result for bipartite graphs of bounded radius and diameter and extend the known polynomial cases.</description>

      <title>Theoretical results for Perfect Location signed Roman domination problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Roman domination has evolved to encompass a variety of challenging extensions, each contributing to the broader understanding of domination problems in graph theory. This paper explores the Perfect Location Signed Roman Domination (PLSRD) problem, a novel combination of the Perfect Roman, Locating Roman, and Signed Roman Domination paradigms. In PLSRD, each weak vertex, assigned the label -1, must be protected by exactly one strong vertex, with additional limitation that two weak vertices cannot share the same strong vertex, while the total sum of labels in the closed neighborhood of each vertex must remain positive. This paper provides exact values for the PLSRD number in several well-known graph classes, including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, wheels, paths, cycles, ladders, prism graphs, and 3 x n grids. Additionally, we establish a lower bound for a general 3 regular graph, as well as the upper bounds for flower snarks graphs, highlighting the intricate interplay between the PLSRD constraints and the structural properties of these graph families.</description>

      <title>The Jacobian of a regular orthogonal matroid and torsor structures on spanning quasi-trees of ribbon graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work of Chan--Church--Grochow and Baker--Wang shows that the set of spanning trees in a plane graph $G$ is naturally a torsor for the Jacobian group of $G$. Informally, this means that the set of spanning trees of $G$ naturally forms a group, except that there is no distinguished identity element. We generalize this fact to graphs embedded on orientable surfaces of arbitrary genus, which can be identified with ribbon graphs. In this generalization, the set of spanning trees of $G$ is replaced by the set of spanning quasi-trees of the ribbon graph, and the Jacobian group of $G$ is replaced by the Jacobian group of the associated regular orthogonal matroid $M$ (along with an associated regular representation of $M$). Our proof shows, more generally, that the family of "BBY torsors" constructed by Backman--Baker--Yuen and later generalized by Ding admit natural generalizations to (regular representations of) regular orthogonal matroids. In addition to shedding light on the role of planarity in the earlier work mentioned above, our results represent one of the first substantial applications of orthogonal matroids (also called "even delta-matroids" or "Lagrangian orthogonal matroids") to a natural combinatorial problem about graphs.</description>

      <title>Waring and Waring-Goldbach subbases with prescribed representation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study representations of integers as sums of $h$ elements from subsets of $k$-th powers $\mathbb{N}^k$ and $k$-th powers of primes $\mathbb{P}^k$ for $k \geq 1$. Extending work by Vu, Wooley, and others, we show that for $h \geq h_k = O(8^k k^2)$, if $F$ is a regularly varying function satisfying $\lim_{n\to\infty} F(n)/\log n = \infty$ and certain growth conditions, then there exists $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}^k$ such that $r_{A,h}(n) \sim \mathfrak{S}_{k,h}(n)F(n)$, where $\mathfrak{S}_{k,h}(n)$ is the singular series from Waring's problem.
  For $h \geq 2^k + 1$, we show the existence of $A \subseteq \mathbb{P}^k$ with $r_{A,h}(n) \sim \mathfrak{S}^*_{k,h}(n) c n^\kappa$ for $0 &lt; \kappa &lt; h/k - 1$ and $c &gt; 0$, where $\mathfrak{S}^*_{k,h}(n)$ is the singular series from Waring-Goldbach's problem. Additionally, for $0 \leq \kappa \leq h/k - 1$ and functions $\psi$ satisfying $\psi(x) \asymp_{\lambda} \psi(x^{\lambda})$ for every $\lambda&gt;0$, if $\log x \ll x^{\kappa} \psi(x) \ll x^{h/k-1}/(\log x)^h$, then there exists $A \subseteq \mathbb{P}^k$ with $r_{A,h}(n) \asymp n^\kappa \psi(n)$ for $n$ satisfying certain congruence conditions, producing thin subbases of prime powers when $\kappa = 0$, $\psi = \log$.</description>

      <title>On the generalized coloring numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08698v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{coloring number} $\mathrm{col}(G)$ of a graph $G$, which is equal to the \emph{degeneracy} of $G$ plus one, provides a very useful measure for the uniform sparsity of $G$. The coloring number is generalized by three series of measures, the \emph{generalized coloring numbers}. These are the \emph{$r$-admissibility} $\mathrm{adm}_r(G)$, the \emph{strong $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{col}_r(G)$ and the \emph{weak $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)$, where $r$ is an integer parameter. The generalized coloring numbers measure the edge density of bounded-depth minors and thereby provide an even more uniform measure of sparsity of graphs. They have found many applications in graph theory and in particular play a key role in the theory of bounded expansion and nowhere dense graph classes introduced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez. We overview combinatorial and algorithmic applications of the generalized coloring numbers, emphasizing new developments in this area. We also present a simple proof for the existence of uniform orders and improve known bounds, e.g., for the weak coloring numbers on graphs with excluded topological minors.</description>

      <title>Yet another note on notation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Back in 1755, Euler explored an interesting array of numbers that now frequently appears in polynomial identities, combinatorial problems, and finite calculus, among other places. These numbers share a strong connection with well-known number families, such as those of Stirling, Bernoulli, and Fubini. Despite their importance, they often go unnoticed because of the lack of a specific name and standard notation. This paper aims to address this oversight by proposing an appropriate name and notation, aligned with established mathematical conventions, and supported by (we hope) strong enough arguments to facilitate their acceptance from the mathematical community.</description>

      <title>Fermions and Zeta Function on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08803v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel fermionic model on the graphs. The Dirac operator of the model consists of deformed incidence matrices on the graph and the partition function is given by the inverse of the graph zeta function. We find that the coefficients of the inverse of the graph zeta function, which is a polynomial of finite degree in the coupling constant, count the number of fermionic cycles on the graph. We also construct the model on grid graphs by using the concept of the covering graph and the Artin-Ihara $L$-function. In connection with this, we show that the fermion doubling is absent, and the overlap fermions can be constructed on a general graph. Furthermore, we relate our model to statistical models by introducing the winding number around cycles, where the distribution of the poles of the graph zeta function (the zeros of the partition function) plays a crucial role. Finally, we formulate gauge theory including fermions on the graph from the viewpoint of the covering graph derived from the gauge group in a unified way.</description>

      <title>The Hurt-Sada Array and Zeckendorf Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wesley Ivan Hurt and Ali Sada both independently proposed studying an infinite array where the $0$'th row consists of the non-negative integers $0,1,2,\ldots$ in increasing order. Thereafter the $n$'th row is formed from the $(n-1)$'th row by "jumping" the single entry $n$ by $n$ places to the right. Sada also defined a sequence $s(n)$ defined to be the first number that $n$ jumps over. In this note I show how the Hurt-Sada array and Sada's sequence are intimately connected with the golden ratio $\varphi$ and Zeckendorf representation. I also consider a number of related sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial ideas are developed in this article to study Chern numbers on ample and numerically effective vector bundles. An effective lower bound for Chern numbers of ample vector bundles is established, which makes some progress towards a long-standing question. Along this line we prove that Chern numbers on nef vector bundles obey reverse dominance ordering, which improves upon some classical and recent results. We propose a simultaneous positivity question on (signed) Chern numbers of compact complex or K\"{a}hler manifolds whose (co)tangent bundles are semipositive in various senses, and show that it holds true for compact homogeneous complex manifolds.</description>

      <title>Profile and neighbourhood complexity of graphs with excluded minors and tree-structured graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $r$-neighbourhood complexity of a graph $G$ is the function counting, for a given integer $k$, the largest possible number, over all vertex-subsets $A$ of size $k$, of subsets of $A$ realized as the intersection between the $r$-neighbourhood of some vertex and $A$. A refinement of this notion is the $r$-profile complexity, that counts the maximum number of distinct distance-vectors from any vertex to the vertices of $A$, ignoring distances larger than $r$. Typically, in structured graph classes such as graphs of bounded VC-dimension or chordal graphs, these functions are bounded, leading to insights into their structural properties and efficient algorithms.
  We improve existing bounds on the $r$-profile complexity (and thus on the $r$-neighbourhood complexity) for graphs in several structured graph classes. We show that the $r$-profile complexity of graphs excluding $K_h$ as a minor is in $O_h(r^{3h-3}k)$. For graphs of treewidth at most $t$ we give a bound in $O_t(r^{t+1}k)$, which is tight up to a function of $t$ as a factor. These bounds improve results and answer a question of Joret and Rambaud [Combinatorica, 2024].
  For outerplanar graphs, we can improve our treewidth bound by a factor of $r$ and conjecture that a similar improvement holds for graphs with bounded simple treewidth. For graphs of treelength at most $\ell$, we give the upper bound in $O(k(r^2(\ell+1)^k))$.
  Our bounds also imply relations between the order, diameter and metric dimension of graphs in these classes, improving results from [Beaudou et al., SIDMA 2017].</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representation via Axis-Aligned Point-Subspace Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new representation of $k$-partite, $k$-uniform hypergraphs, that is, a hypergraph with a partition of vertices into $k$ parts such that each hyperedge contains exactly one vertex of each type; we call them $k$-hypergraphs for short. Given positive integers $\ell, d$, and $k$ with $\ell\leq d-1$ and $k={d\choose\ell}$, any finite set $P$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ represents a $k$-hypergraph $G_P$ as follows. Each point in $P$ is covered by $k$ many axis-aligned affine $\ell$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$, which we call $\ell$-subspaces for brevity and which form the vertex set of $G_P$. We interpret each point in $P$ as a hyperedge of $G_P$ that contains each of the covering $\ell$-subspaces as a vertex. The class of \emph{$(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs} is the class of $k$-hypergraphs that can be represented in this way. The resulting classes of hypergraphs are fairly rich: Every $k$-hypergraph is a $(k,k-1)$-hypergraph. On the other hand, $(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs form a proper subclass of the class of all $k$-hypergraphs for $\ell&lt;d-1$.
  In this paper we give a natural structural characterization of $(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs based on vertex cuts. This characterization leads to a poly\-nomial-time recognition algorithm that decides for a given $k$-hypergraph whether or not it is a $(d,\ell)$-hypergraph and that computes a representation if existing. We assume that the dimension $d$ is constant and that the partitioning of the vertex set is prescribed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n \times m$ array with nonnegative entries is called doubly stochastic if the sum of its entries at each row is $m$ and at each column is $n$. The set of all $n \times m$ doubly stochastic arrays is a convex polytope with finitely many extremal points. The main result of this paper characterizes the possible sizes of the supports of all extremal $n \times m$ doubly stochastic arrays. In particular we prove that the minimal size of the support of an $n \times m$ doubly stochastic array is $n + m - \gcd(n,m)$. Moreover, for $m=kn+1$ we also characterize the structure of the support of the extremal arrays.</description>

      <title>Multigraph edge-coloring with local list sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a multigraph and $L\,:\,E(G) \to 2^\mathbb{N}$ be a list assignment on the edges of $G$. Suppose additionally, for every vertex $x$, the edges incident to $x$ have at least $f(x)$ colors in common. We consider a variant of local edge-colorings wherein the color received by an edge $e$ must be contained in $L(e)$. The locality appears in the function $f$, i.e., $f(x)$ is some function of the local structure of $x$ in $G$. Such a notion is a natural generalization of traditional local edge-coloring. Our main results include sufficient conditions on the function $f$ to construct such colorings. As corollaries, we obtain local analogs of Vizing and Shannon's theorems, recovering a recent result of Conley, Greb\'ik and Pikhurko.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to the coarse Menger conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Menger's well-known theorem from 1927 characterizes when it is possible to find $k$ vertex-disjoint paths between two sets of vertices in a graph $G$. Recently, Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu and, independently, Albrechtsen, Huynh, Jacobs, Knappe and Wollan conjectured a coarse analogue of Menger's theorem, when the $k$ paths are required to be pairwise at some distance at least $d$. The result is known for $k\le 2$, but we will show that it is false for all $k\ge 3$, even if $G$ is constrained to have maximum degree at most three. We also give a simpler proof of the result when $k=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the composition method, we establish the $e$-positivity of spider graphs of the form $S(4m+2,\, 2m,\, 1)$, which was conjectured by Aliniaeifard, Wang and van Willigenburg. We expand chromatic symmetric functions in terms of $e_I$ for compositions $I$. Following the divide-and-conquer strategy, we group one or two $e_J$-terms that have positive coefficients with each $e_I$-term that has a negative coefficient, where the compositions $J$ are selected to be distinct compositions obtained by rearranging the parts of $I$, and show the positivity of the sum of those coefficients.</description>

Abstract: Balister, the second author, Groenland, Johnston and Scott recently showed that there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{3/4}$ many unordered sequences that occur as degree sequences of graphs. Combining limit theory for infinitely divisible distributions with a new bijective connection between a class of random walk trajectories and a subset counting formula from additive number theory, we describe $C$ in terms of Walkup's number of rooted plane trees. The bijection is related to an instance of the L\'evy-Khintchine formula. Our main result complements a result of Stanley, that ordered graphical sequences are related to quasi-forests.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Perspective on the Noncommutative Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The noncommutative symmetric functions $\textbf{NSym}$ were first defined abstractly by Gelfand et al. in 1995 as the free associative algebra generated by noncommuting indeterminants $\{\boldsymbol{e}_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ that were taken as a noncommutative analogue of the elementary symmetric functions. The resulting space was thus a variation on the traditional symmetric functions $\Lambda$. Giving noncommutative analogues of generating function relations for other bases of $\Lambda$ allowed Gelfand et al. to define additional bases of $\textbf{NSym}$ and then determine change-of-basis formulas using quasideterminants. In this paper, we aim for a self-contained exposition that expresses these bases concretely as functions in infinitely many noncommuting variables and avoids quasideterminants. Additionally, we look at the noncommutative analogues of two different interpretations of change-of-basis in $\Lambda$: both as a product of a minimal number of matrices, mimicking Macdonald's exposition of $\Lambda$ in Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials, and as statistics on brick tabloids, as in work by E\u{g}ecio\u{g}lu and Remmel, 1990.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a short proof of a recent result of Claesson, Dukes, Frankl\'in and Stef\'ansson, connecting the number $S_n$ of score sequences and the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv numbers $N_n$ from additive number theory. Our proof utilizes the lattice path representation of score sequences by Erd\H{o}s and Moser, and remarks by Kleitman added to an article of Moser regarding cyclic shifts of such paths. The connection between $S_n$ and $N_n$ is an instance of the L\'evy-Khintchine formula from probability theory. We highlight the utility of such formulas, by giving a short proof of Moser's conjecture that $S_n\sim C4^n/n^{5/2}$, where $C$ is described in terms of $N_n$.</description>

      <title>A resolution of the Aharoni-Korman conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A poset $P$ is said to satisfy the finite antichain condition, or FAC for short, if it has no infinite antichain. It was conjectured by Aharoni and Korman in 1992 that any FAC poset $P$ possesses a chain $C$ and a partition into antichains such that $C$ meets every antichain of the partition. Our main results are twofold. We provide a counterexample to the conjecture in full generality, but, despite this, we also prove that the conjecture does hold true for a broad class of posets. In particular, we prove that the Aharoni-Korman conjecture holds for countable posets avoiding intervals $I$ such that either $I$ or its reverse $I^*$ is of the form $\bigoplus_{x\in\omega} Q_x$, where each $Q_x$ is infinite and co-wellfounded.
  In pursuit of these goals, we also investigate other facets of the structure of FAC posets. In particular, we consider strongly maximal chains in FAC posets, proving some results, and posing several questions and conjectures.</description>

      <title>A contribution to the characterization of finite minimal automorphic posets of width three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of the finite minimal automorphic posets of width three is still an open problem. Niederle has shown that this task can be reduced to the characterization of the nice sections of width three having a non-trivial tower of nice sections as retract. We solve this problem for a sub-class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ of the finite nice sections of width three. On the one hand, we characterize the posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a retract of width three being a non-trivial tower of nice sections, and on the other hand we characterize the posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a 4-crown stack as retract. The latter result yields a recursive approach for the determination of posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a 4-crown stack as retract. With this approach, we determine all posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ with height up to six having such a retract. For each integer $n \geq 2$, the class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ contains $2^{n-2}$ different isomorphism types of posets of height $n$.</description>

Abstract: This survey provides a detailed exposition of the R\'{e}dei-Berge symmetric function $\mathcal{U}_D$ for digraphs $D$, a specialization of Chow's path-cycle symmetric function. Through the lens of matrix algebra, we consolidate and expand on the work of Chow, Grinberg and Stanley, and Lass concerning the resolution of $\mathcal{U}_D$ in the power sum and Schur bases. Along the way we also revisit various results on Hamiltonian paths in digraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $n\geq 2$, we show that the class of all finite $n$-dimensional partial orders, when expanded with $n$ linear orders which realize the partial order, forms a Fra\"iss\'e class and identify its Fra\"iss\'e limit $(D_n,&lt;,&lt;_1,\ldots,&lt;_n)$. We give a finite axiomatization of this limit which specifies it uniquely up to isomorphism among countable structures. We then show that the aforementioned class of finite structures satisfies the Ramsey property and conclude, by the Kechris-Pestov-Todor\v{c}evi\'{c} correspondence, that the automorphism group of its Fra\"iss\'e limit is extremely amenable. Finally, we identify the universal minimal flow of the automorphism group of the reduct $(D_n,&lt;)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss matching extendability of optimal $1$-projective plane graphs (abbreviated as O1PPG), which are drawn on the projective plane $P^2$ so that every edge crosses another edge at most once, and has $n$ vertices and exactly $4n- 4$ edges. We first show that every O1PPG of even order is $1$-extendable. Next, we characterize $2$-extendable O1PPG's in terms of a separating cycle consisting of only non-crossing edges. Moreover, we characterize O1PPG's having connectivity exactly $5$. Using the characterization, we further identify three independent edges in those graphs that are not extendable.</description>

Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytope of graphs with respect to the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$ applied to the fractional stable set polytope. In particular, we show that for every positive integer $\ell$, the smallest possible graph with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $\ell$ contains $3\ell$ vertices. This result is sharp and settles a conjecture posed by Lipt\'{a}k and the second author in 2003, as well as answers a generalization of a problem posed by Knuth in 1994. We also show that for every positive integer $\ell$ there exists a vertex-transitive graph on $4\ell+12$ vertices with $\text{LS}_+$-rank at least $\ell$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The largest balanced element in signed graphs plays a vital role in helping researchers understand the fundamental structure of the graph, as it reveals valuable information about the complex relationships between vertices in the network. The challenge is an NP-hard problem; there is no current baseline to evaluate state-of-the-art signed graphs derived from real networks. In this paper, we propose a scalable state-of-the-art approach for the maximum balanced sub-graph detection in the network of any size. The proposed approach finds the largest balanced sub-graph by considering only the top $K$ balanced states with the lowest frustration index. We show that the ABCD method selects a subset from an extensive signed network with millions of vertices and edges, and the size of the discovered subset is double that of the state-of-the-art in a similar time frame.</description>

      <title>Scaling Frustration Index and Corresponding Balanced State Discovery for Real Signed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural balance modeling for signed graph networks presents how to model the sources of conflicts. The state-of-the-art focuses on computing the frustration index of a signed graph, a critical step toward solving problems in social and sensor networks and scientific modeling. The proposed approaches do not scale to large signed networks of tens of millions of vertices and edges. This paper proposes two efficient algorithms, a tree-based \emph{graphBpp} and a gradient descent-based \emph{graphL}. We show that both algorithms outperform state-of-art in terms of efficiency and effectiveness for discovering the balanced state for \emph{any} network size. We introduce the first comparison for large graphs for the exact, tree-based, and gradient descent-based methods. The speedup of the methods is around \emph{300+ times faster} than the state-of-the-art for large signed graphs. We find that the exact method excels at optimally finding the frustration for small graphs only. \emph{graphBpp} scales this approximation to large signed graphs at the cost of accuracy. \emph{graphL} produces a state with a lower frustration at the cost of selecting a proper variable initialization and hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in zero-error function computation with side information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of zero-error function computation with side information. Alice and Bob have correlated sources $X,Y$ with joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot, \cdot)$. Bob wants to calculate $f(X,Y)$ with zero error. Alice communicates $m$-length blocks $(m \geq 1)$ with Bob over error-free channels: classical or quantum. In the classical setting, the minimum communication rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the chromatic number of an appropriately defined $m$-instance ``confusion graph'' $G^{(m)}$. In the quantum setting, it depends on the asymptotic growth of the orthogonal rank of the complement of $G^{(m)}$. The behavior of the quantum advantage (ratio of classical and quantum rates) depends critically on $G^{(m)}$ which is shown to be sandwiched between $G^{\boxtimes m}$ ($m$-times strong product) and $G^{\lor m}$ ($m$-times OR product) respectively. Our work presents necessary and sufficient conditions on the function $f(\cdot, \cdot)$ and joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot,\cdot)$ such that $G^{(m)}$ equals either $G^{\boxtimes m}$ or $G^{\lor m}$. We study the behavior of the quantum advantage in the single-instance case and the asymptotic (in $m$) case for several classes of confusion graphs and demonstrate, e.g., that there exist problems where there is a quantum advantage in the single-instance rate but no quantum advantage in the asymptotic rate.</description>

      <title>The pinning ideal of a multiloop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A loop is a generic immersion of the circle in a surface, considered up to isotopy. A loop is taut when it is minimally intersecting in its homotopy class. A pinning set of a loop is a set of points $P$ in the surface avoiding the loop, such that the loop is taut in the surface punctured at $P$. The collection of pinning sets forms a poset under inclusion, endowed with the cardinal function: its minimum defines the pinning number of the loop.
  We show that the decision problem associated to computing the pinning number of a plane loop is NP-complete. First, we implement a polynomial algorithm to check if a point-set is pinning, adapting a method of Birman--Series for computing intersection numbers of curves in surfaces. Then we reduce the problem to a boolean formula whose solutions correspond to pinning sets: for this we study immersed discs in detail to improve a theorem of Hass--Scott characterising taut loops, and apply an algorithm of Blank and Frisch. Finally, we reduce the vertex-cover problem for graphs to the pinning problem for plane loops.</description>

      <title>IBIS primitive groups of almost simple type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite permutation group on $\Omega$. An ordered sequence
  $(\omega_1\ldots,\omega_\ell)$ of elements of $\Omega$ is an irredundant base for $G$ if the pointwise stabilizer is trivial and no point is fixed by the stabilizer of its predecessors. The minimal cardinality of a base is said to be the base size of $G$. If all irredundant bases of $G$ have the same cardinality, $G$ is said to be an IBIS group.
  In this paper, we classify the finite almost simple primitive IBIS groups whose base size is at least $6$.</description>

      <title>Borel fractional perfect matchings in quasi-transitive amenable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if a locally finite Borel graph with quasitransitive amenable components admits a fractional perfect matching, it will admit a Borel fractional perfect matching. In particular, if a countable amenable quasitransitive graph admits a fractional perfect matching then its Bernoulli graph admits a Borel fractional perfect matching.</description>
