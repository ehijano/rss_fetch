      <title>Kinetic theories of state- and generation-dependent cell populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a general, high-dimensional kinetic theory describing the internal state (such as gene expression or protein levels) of cells in a stochastically evolving population. The resolution of our kinetic theory also allows one to track subpopulations associated with each generation. Both intrinsic noise of the cell's internal attribute and randomness in a cell's division times (demographic stochasticity) are fundamental to the development of our model. Based on this general framework, we are able to marginalize the high-dimensional kinetic PDEs in a number of different ways to derive equations that describe the dynamics of marginalized or "macroscopic" quantities such as structured population densities, moments of generation-dependent cellular states, and moments of the total population. We also show how nonlinear "interaction" terms in lower-dimensional integrodifferential equations can arise from high-dimensional linear kinetic models that contain rate parameters of a cell (birth and death rates) that depend on variables associated with other cells, generating couplings in the dynamics. Our analysis provides a general, more complete mathematical framework that resolves the coevolution of cell populations and cell states. The approach may be tailored for studying, e.g., gene expression in developing tissues, or other more general particle systems which exhibit Brownian noise in individual attributes and population-level demographic noise.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spatial Segregation Induced by Competition Avoidance as Driving Mechanism for Emergent Coexistence in Microbial Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17048v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the role of spatial segregation, prompted by competition avoidance, as a key mechanism for emergent coexistence within microbial communities. Recognizing these communities as complex adaptive systems, we challenge the sufficiency of mean-field pairwise interaction models and consider the impact of spatial dynamics. We developed an individual-based spatial simulation depicting bacterial movement through a pattern of random walks influenced by competition avoidance, leading to the formation of spatially segregated clusters. This model was integrated with a Lotka-Volterra metapopulation framework focused on competitive interactions. Our findings reveal that spatial segregation combined with low diffusion rates and high compositional heterogeneity among patches can lead to emergent coexistence in microbial communities. This reveals a novel mechanism underpinning the formation of stable, coexisting microbe clusters, which is nonetheless incapable of promoting coexistence in the case of isolated pairs of species. This study underscores the importance of considering spatial factors in understanding the dynamics of microbial ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of the centrality of the Huanan market among early COVID-19 cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The centrality of Wuhan's Huanan market in maps of December 2019 COVID-19 case residential locations, established by Worobey et al. (2022a), has recently been challenged by Stoyan and Chiu (2024, SC2024). SC2024 proposed a statistical test based on the premise that the measure of central tendency (hereafter, "centre") of a sample of case locations must coincide with the exact point from which local transmission began. Here we show that this premise is erroneous. SC2024 put forward two alternative centres (centroid and mode) to the centre-point which was used by Worobey et al. for some analyses, and proposed a bootstrapping method, based on their premise, to test whether a particular location is consistent with it being the point source of transmission. We show that SC2024's concerns about the use of centre-points are inconsequential, and that use of centroids for these data is inadvisable. The mode is an appropriate, even optimal, choice as centre; however, contrary to SC2024's results, we demonstrate that with proper implementation of their methods, the mode falls at the entrance of a parking lot at the market itself, and the 95% confidence region around the mode includes the market. Thus, the market cannot be rejected as central even by SC2024's overly stringent statistical test. Our results directly contradict SC2024's and -- together with myriad additional lines of evidence overlooked by SC2024, including crucial epidemiological information -- point to the Huanan market as the early epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

      <title>Partner selection and evolution of out-group avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preferential treatment of in-group members is widely observed. This study examines this phenomenon in the domain of cooperation in social dilemmas using evolutionary agent-based models that consider the role of partner selection. The model considers a repeated prisoner's dilemma game, in which agents belong to one of two groups that are distinguished by the continuation probability of pair interactions. On the basis of the behavior in the last round and the group affiliation of the partner, each individual selects to cooperate, defect, or stop interactions and search for a different partner. The results of simulation demonstrated that agents adopt cooperative strategies, including tit-for-tat and out-for-tat, toward in-group members. By contrast, agents stop interactions immediately after pair formation without observing their partner's behavior when they are paired with an out-group individual. Higher continuation probability with in-group partners hinders interaction with out-group individuals. Our results imply the importance of avoidance in intergroup interactions in social dilemmas and might explain in-group favoritism without enmity toward out-groups.</description>

      <title>The coalescent in finite populations with arbitrary, fixed structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coalescent is a stochastic process representing ancestral lineages in a population undergoing neutral genetic drift. Originally defined for a well-mixed population, the coalescent has been adapted in various ways to accommodate spatial, age, and class structure, along with other features of real-world populations. To unify and further generalize these variants, we introduce an abstract formulation of the coalescent that applies to a broad class of neutral drift models. Our formalism allows for arbitrary -- but fixed -- spatial, age, sex, and class structure, with haploid or diploid genetics and any fixed mating pattern. We represent the coalescent as a random sequence of mappings $\mathcal{C} = \left(C_t\right)_{t=0}^\infty$ from a finite set $G$ to itself, representing the ancestry of alleles at a single genetic locus. $G$ represents the ``sites'' (in individuals, in particular locations and/or classes) at which these alleles can live. The state $C_t:G \to G$ maps each site $g \in G$ to the site containing $g$'s ancestor, $t$ time-steps into the past. Using this representation, we define and analyze coalescence time, coalescence branch length, mutations prior to coalescence, and stationary probabilities of identity-by-descent and identity-by-state. For low mutation, we provide a recipe for computing identity-by-descent and identity-by-state probabilities via the coalescent. Applying our results to a diploid population with arbitrary sex ratio $r$, we find that measures of genetic dissimilarity, among any set of sites, are scaled by $4r(1-r)$ relative to the even sex ratio case.</description>

      <title>XXAI: Explicitly Explainable AI provides transparency in automatic decision-making by overcoming the limitations of symbolic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are concerns about the reliability and safety of sub-symbolic neural network AI because its decisions cannot be explained explicitly. This is the black box problem of modern AI. At the same time, symbolic AI has the nature of a white box and is able to ensure the reliability and safety of its decisions. However, several problems prevent the widespread use of symbolic AI: the opacity of mathematical models and natural language terms, the lack of a unified ontology, and the combinatorial explosion of search capabilities. To solve the black-box problem of AI, we propose Explicitly Explainable AI (XXAI) - a fully transparent white-box AI based on deterministic logical cellular automata whose rules are derived from the first principles of the general theory of the relevant domain. In this case, the general theory of the domain plays the role of a knowledge base for deriving the inferences of the cellular automata. A cellular automaton implements parallel multi-level logical inference at all levels of organization - from local interactions of the element base to the system as a whole. Our verification of several ecological hypotheses sets a precedent for the successful implementation of the proposed solution. XXAI can automatically verify the reliability, safety, and ethicality of sub-symbolic neural network AI decisions during both the final and training phases. This paper presents the theoretical and methodological foundations for creating XXAI and discusses the prospects for this direction.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion models of biological invasion: Open source computational tools, key concepts and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01667v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review provides open-access computational tools that support a range of mathematical approaches to analyse three related scalar reaction-diffusion models used to study biological invasion. Starting with the classic Fisher-Kolmogorov (Fisher-KPP) model, we illustrate how computational methods can be used to explore time-dependent partial differential equation (PDE) solutions in parallel with phase plane and regular perturbation techniques to explore invading travelling wave solutions moving with dimensionless speed $c \ge 2$. To overcome the lack of a well-defined sharp front in solutions of the Fisher-KPP model, we also review two alternative modeling approaches. The first is the Porous-Fisher model where the linear diffusion term is replaced with a degenerate nonlinear diffusion term. Using phase plane and regular perturbation methods, we explore the distinction between sharp- and smooth-fronted invading travelling waves that move with dimensionless speed $c \ge 1/\sqrt{2}$. The second alternative approach is to reformulate the Fisher-KPP model as a moving boundary problem on $0 &lt; x &lt; L(t)$, leading to the Fisher-Stefan model with sharp-fronted travelling wave solutions arising from a PDE model with a linear diffusion term. Time-dependent PDE solutions and phase plane methods show that travelling wave solutions of the Fisher-Stefan model can describe both biological invasion $(c &gt; 0)$ and biological recession $(c &lt; 0)$. Open source Julia code to replicate all computational results in this review is available on GitHub; we encourage researchers to use this code directly or to adapt the code as required for more complicated models.</description>
