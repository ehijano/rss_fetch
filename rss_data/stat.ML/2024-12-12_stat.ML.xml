      <title>Score-Optimal Diffusion Schedules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) offer a flexible framework for sampling from high dimensional data distributions. DDMs generate a path of probability distributions interpolating between a reference Gaussian distribution and a data distribution by incrementally injecting noise into the data. To numerically simulate the sampling process, a discretisation schedule from the reference back towards clean data must be chosen. An appropriate discretisation schedule is crucial to obtain high quality samples. However, beyond hand crafted heuristics, a general method for choosing this schedule remains elusive. This paper presents a novel algorithm for adaptively selecting an optimal discretisation schedule with respect to a cost that we derive. Our cost measures the work done by the simulation procedure to transport samples from one point in the diffusion path to the next. Our method does not require hyperparameter tuning and adapts to the dynamics and geometry of the diffusion path. Our algorithm only involves the evaluation of the estimated Stein score, making it scalable to existing pre-trained models at inference time and online during training. We find that our learned schedule recovers performant schedules previously only discovered through manual search and obtains competitive FID scores on image datasets.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Correction for Quantized LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of model compression for Large Language Models (LLMs) at post-training time, where the task is to compress a well-trained model using only a small set of calibration input data. In this work, we introduce a new low-rank approach to correct for quantization errors of \emph{activations} in LLMs: we propose to add low-rank weight matrices in full precision that act on the \emph{unquantized} activations. We then solve a joint optimization problem over the quantized representation of the weights and additional low-rank weight matrices to quantize both weights and activations. We focus on the case of 4-bit weight-and-activation quantization (W4A4). Using ranks equivalent to 10\% of the original weight matrix size, our approach reduces the accuracy gap with the original model by more than 50\%. Using ranks equivalent to 30\% of the original weight matrix, the accuracy gap is closed completely. We demonstrate our results on four recent LLMs, namely Llama-2, Llama-3, Phi-3 and Mixtral models.</description>

      <title>An Optimistic Algorithm for Online Convex Optimization with Adversarial Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Online Convex Optimization (OCO) with adversarial constraints, where an online algorithm must make repeated decisions to minimize both convex loss functions and cumulative constraint violations. We focus on a setting where the algorithm has access to predictions of the loss and constraint functions. Our results show that we can improve the current best bounds of $ O(\sqrt{T}) $ regret and $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative constraint violations to $ O(\sqrt{E_T(f)}) $ and $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{E_T(g)}) $, respectively, where $ E_T(f) $ and $ E_T(g) $ represent the cumulative prediction errors of the loss and constraint functions. In the worst case, where $ E_T(f) = O(T) $ and $ E_T(g) = O(T) $ (assuming bounded loss and constraint functions), our rates match the prior $ O(\sqrt{T}) $ results. However, when the loss and constraint predictions are accurate, our approach yields significantly smaller regret and cumulative constraint violations. Notably, if the constraint function remains constant over time, we achieve $ \tilde{O}(1) $ cumulative constraint violation, aligning with prior results.</description>

      <title>Spectral Differential Network Analysis for High-Dimensional Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral networks derived from multivariate time series data arise in many domains, from brain science to Earth science. Often, it is of interest to study how these networks change under different conditions. For instance, to better understand epilepsy, it would be interesting to capture the changes in the brain connectivity network as a patient experiences a seizure, using electroencephalography data. A common approach relies on estimating the networks in each condition and calculating their difference. Such estimates may behave poorly in high dimensions as the networks themselves may not be sparse in structure while their difference may be. We build upon this observation to develop an estimator of the difference in inverse spectral densities across two conditions. Using an L1 penalty on the difference, consistency is established by only requiring the difference to be sparse. We illustrate the method on synthetic data experiments, on experiments with electroencephalography data, and on experiments with optogentic stimulation and micro-electrocorticography data.</description>

      <title>Phase-aware Training Schedule Simplifies Learning in Flow-Based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the training of a two-layer autoencoder used to parameterize a flow-based generative model for sampling from a high-dimensional Gaussian mixture. Previous work shows that the phase where the relative probability between the modes is learned disappears as the dimension goes to infinity without an appropriate time schedule. We introduce a time dilation that solves this problem. This enables us to characterize the learned velocity field, finding a first phase where the probability of each mode is learned and a second phase where the variance of each mode is learned. We find that the autoencoder representing the velocity field learns to simplify by estimating only the parameters relevant to each phase. Turning to real data, we propose a method that, for a given feature, finds intervals of time where training improves accuracy the most on that feature. Since practitioners take a uniform distribution over training times, our method enables more efficient training. We provide preliminary experiments validating this approach.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis Testing for High-Dimensional Matrix-Valued Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses hypothesis testing for the mean of matrix-valued data in high-dimensional settings. We investigate the minimum discrepancy test, originally proposed by Cragg (1997), which serves as a rank test for lower-dimensional matrices. We evaluate the performance of this test as the matrix dimensions increase proportionally with the sample size, and identify its limitations when matrix dimensions significantly exceed the sample size. To address these challenges, we propose a new test statistic tailored for high-dimensional matrix rank testing. The oracle version of this statistic is analyzed to highlight its theoretical properties. Additionally, we develop a novel approach for constructing a sparse singular value decomposition (SVD) estimator for singular vectors, providing a comprehensive examination of its theoretical aspects. Using the sparse SVD estimator, we explore the properties of the sample version of our proposed statistic. The paper concludes with simulation studies and two case studies involving surveillance video data, demonstrating the practical utility of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Fast Mixing of Data Augmentation Algorithms: Bayesian Probit, Logit, and Lasso Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of the data augmentation (DA) algorithm, the theoretical understanding of its convergence behavior remains incomplete. We prove the first non-asymptotic polynomial upper bounds on mixing times of three important DA algorithms: DA algorithm for Bayesian Probit regression (Albert and Chib, 1993, ProbitDA), Bayesian Logit regression (Polson, Scott, and Windle, 2013, LogitDA), and Bayesian Lasso regression (Park and Casella, 2008, Rajaratnam et al., 2015, LassoDA). Concretely, we demonstrate that with $\eta$-warm start, parameter dimension $d$, and sample size $n$, the ProbitDA and LogitDA require $\mathcal{O}\left(nd\log \left(\frac{\log \eta}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ steps to obtain samples with at most $\epsilon$ TV error, whereas the LassoDA requires $\mathcal{O}\left(d^2(d\log d +n \log n)^2 \log \left(\frac{\eta}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ steps. The results are generally applicable to settings with large $n$ and large $d$, including settings with highly imbalanced response data in the Probit and Logit regression. The proofs are based on the Markov chain conductance and isoperimetric inequalities. Assuming that data are independently generated from either a bounded, sub-Gaussian, or log-concave distribution, we improve the guarantees for ProbitDA and LogitDA to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n+d)$ with high probability, and compare it with the best known guarantees of Langevin Monte Carlo and Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm. We also discuss the mixing times of the three algorithms under feasible initialization.</description>

      <title>Of Dice and Games: A Theory of Generalized Boosting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cost-sensitive loss functions are crucial in many real-world prediction problems, where different types of errors are penalized differently; for example, in medical diagnosis, a false negative prediction can lead to worse consequences than a false positive prediction. However, traditional PAC learning theory has mostly focused on the symmetric 0-1 loss, leaving cost-sensitive losses largely unaddressed. In this work, we extend the celebrated theory of boosting to incorporate both cost-sensitive and multi-objective losses. Cost-sensitive losses assign costs to the entries of a confusion matrix, and are used to control the sum of prediction errors accounting for the cost of each error type. Multi-objective losses, on the other hand, simultaneously track multiple cost-sensitive losses, and are useful when the goal is to satisfy several criteria at once (e.g., minimizing false positives while keeping false negatives below a critical threshold). We develop a comprehensive theory of cost-sensitive and multi-objective boosting, providing a taxonomy of weak learning guarantees that distinguishes which guarantees are trivial (i.e., can always be achieved), which ones are boostable (i.e., imply strong learning), and which ones are intermediate, implying non-trivial yet not arbitrarily accurate learning. For binary classification, we establish a dichotomy: a weak learning guarantee is either trivial or boostable. In the multiclass setting, we describe a more intricate landscape of intermediate weak learning guarantees. Our characterization relies on a geometric interpretation of boosting, revealing a surprising equivalence between cost-sensitive and multi-objective losses.</description>

      <title>GLL: A Differentiable Graph Learning Layer for Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard deep learning architectures used for classification generate label predictions with a projection head and softmax activation function. Although successful, these methods fail to leverage the relational information between samples in the batch for generating label predictions. In recent works, graph-based learning techniques, namely Laplace learning, have been heuristically combined with neural networks for both supervised and semi-supervised learning (SSL) tasks. However, prior works approximate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the graph learning algorithm or decouple the processes; end-to-end integration with neural networks is not achieved. In this work, we derive backpropagation equations, via the adjoint method, for inclusion of a general family of graph learning layers into a neural network. This allows us to precisely integrate graph Laplacian-based label propagation into a neural network layer, replacing a projection head and softmax activation function for classification tasks. Using this new framework, our experimental results demonstrate smooth label transitions across data, improved robustness to adversarial attacks, improved generalization, and improved training dynamics compared to the standard softmax-based approach.</description>

      <title>Criteria and Bias of Parameterized Linear Regression under Edge of Stability Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical optimization theory requires a small step-size for gradient-based methods to converge. Nevertheless, recent findings challenge the traditional idea by empirically demonstrating Gradient Descent (GD) converges even when the step-size $\eta$ exceeds the threshold of $2/L$, where $L$ is the global smooth constant. This is usually known as the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon. A widely held belief suggests that an objective function with subquadratic growth plays an important role in incurring EoS. In this paper, we provide a more comprehensive answer by considering the task of finding linear interpolator $\beta \in R^{d}$ for regression with loss function $l(\cdot)$, where $\beta$ admits parameterization as $\beta = w^2_{+} - w^2_{-}$. Contrary to the previous work that suggests a subquadratic $l$ is necessary for EoS, our novel finding reveals that EoS occurs even when $l$ is quadratic under proper conditions. This argument is made rigorous by both empirical and theoretical evidence, demonstrating the GD trajectory converges to a linear interpolator in a non-asymptotic way. Moreover, the model under quadratic $l$, also known as a depth-$2$ diagonal linear network, remains largely unexplored under the EoS regime. Our analysis then sheds some new light on the implicit bias of diagonal linear networks when a larger step-size is employed, enriching the understanding of EoS on more practical models.</description>

      <title>Two-way Node Popularity Model for Directed and Bipartite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been extensive research on community detection in directed and bipartite networks. However, these studies often fail to consider the popularity of nodes in different communities, which is a common phenomenon in real-world networks. To address this issue, we propose a new probabilistic framework called the Two-Way Node Popularity Model (TNPM). The TNPM also accommodates edges from different distributions within a general sub-Gaussian family. We introduce the Delete-One-Method (DOM) for model fitting and community structure identification, and provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis with novel technical skills dealing with sub-Gaussian generalization. Additionally, we propose the Two-Stage Divided Cosine Algorithm (TSDC) to handle large-scale networks more efficiently. Our proposed methods offer multi-folded advantages in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency, as demonstrated through extensive numerical studies. We apply our methods to two real-world applications, uncovering interesting findings.</description>

      <title>CANDOR: Counterfactual ANnotated DOubly Robust Off-Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) provides safety guarantees by estimating the performance of a policy before deployment. Recent work introduced IS+, an importance sampling (IS) estimator that uses expert-annotated counterfactual samples to improve behavior dataset coverage. However, IS estimators are known to have high variance; furthermore, the performance of IS+ deteriorates when annotations are imperfect. In this work, we propose a family of OPE estimators inspired by the doubly robust (DR) principle. A DR estimator combines IS with a reward model estimate, known as the direct method (DM), and offers favorable statistical guarantees. We propose three strategies for incorporating counterfactual annotations into a DR-inspired estimator and analyze their properties under various realistic settings. We prove that using imperfect annotations in the DM part of the estimator best leverages the annotations, as opposed to using them in the IS part. To support our theoretical findings, we evaluate the proposed estimators in three contextual bandit environments. Our empirical results show that when the reward model is misspecified and the annotations are imperfect, it is most beneficial to use the annotations only in the DM portion of a DR estimator. Based on these theoretical and empirical insights, we provide a practical guide for using counterfactual annotations in different realistic settings.</description>

      <title>Statistical Convergence Rates of Optimal Transport Map Estimation between General Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the convergence rates of optimal transport (OT) map estimators, a topic of growing interest in statistics, machine learning, and various scientific fields. Despite recent advancements, existing results rely on regularity assumptions that are very restrictive in practice and much stricter than those in Brenier's Theorem, including the compactness and convexity of the probability support and the bi-Lipschitz property of the OT maps. We aim to broaden the scope of OT map estimation and fill this gap between theory and practice. Given the strong convexity assumption on Brenier's potential, we first establish the non-asymptotic convergence rates for the original plug-in estimator without requiring restrictive assumptions on probability measures. Additionally, we introduce a sieve plug-in estimator and establish its convergence rates without the strong convexity assumption on Brenier's potential, enabling the widely used cases such as the rank functions of normal or t-distributions. We also establish new Poincar\'e-type inequalities, which are proved given sufficient conditions on the local boundedness of the probability density and mild topological conditions of the support, and these new inequalities enable us to achieve faster convergence rates for the Donsker function class. Moreover, we develop scalable algorithms to efficiently solve the OT map estimation using neural networks and present numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Classification of Latent Disease Progression with Auxiliary Surrogate Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disease progression prediction based on patients' evolving health information is challenging when true disease states are unknown due to diagnostic capabilities or high costs. For example, the absence of gold-standard neurological diagnoses hinders distinguishing Alzheimer's disease (AD) from related conditions such as AD-related dementias (ADRDs), including Lewy body dementia (LBD). Combining temporally dependent surrogate labels and health markers may improve disease prediction. However, existing literature models informative surrogate labels and observed variables that reflect the underlying states using purely generative approaches, limiting the ability to predict future states. We propose integrating the conventional hidden Markov model as a generative model with a time-varying discriminative classification model to simultaneously handle potentially misspecified surrogate labels and incorporate important markers of disease progression. We develop an adaptive forward-backward algorithm with subjective labels for estimation, and utilize the modified posterior and Viterbi algorithms to predict the progression of future states or new patients based on objective markers only. Importantly, the adaptation eliminates the need to model the marginal distribution of longitudinal markers, a requirement in traditional algorithms. Asymptotic properties are established, and significant improvement with finite samples is demonstrated via simulation studies. Analysis of the neuropathological dataset of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) shows much improved accuracy in distinguishing LBD from AD.</description>

      <title>Modeling Latent Non-Linear Dynamical System over Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08114v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of modeling a non-linear dynamical system when given a time series by deriving equations directly from the data. Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</description>

      <title>How to Weight Multitask Finetuning? Fast Previews via Bayesian Model-Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When finetuning multiple tasks altogether, it is important to carefully weigh them to get a good performance, but searching for good weights can be difficult and costly. Here, we propose to aid the search with fast previews to quickly get a rough idea of different reweighting options. We use model merging to create previews by simply reusing and averaging parameters of models trained on each task separately (no retraining required). To improve the quality of previews, we propose a Bayesian approach to design new merging strategies by using more flexible posteriors. We validate our findings on vision and natural-language transformers. Our work shows the benefits of model merging via Bayes to improve multitask finetuning.</description>

      <title>Edge-Splitting MLP: Node Classification on Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs without Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node classification on homophilic graphs. It has been shown that they do not solely rely on homophily but on neighborhood distributions of nodes, i.e., consistency of the neighborhood label distribution within the same class. MLP-based models do not use message passing, \eg Graph-MLP incorporates the neighborhood in a separate loss function. These models are faster and more robust to edge noise. Graph-MLP maps adjacent nodes closer in the embedding space but is unaware of the neighborhood pattern of the labels, i.e., relies solely on homophily. Edge Splitting GNN (ES-GNN) is a model specialized for heterophilic graphs and splits the edges into task-relevant and task-irrelevant, respectively. To mitigate the limitations of Graph-MLP on heterophilic graphs, we propose ES-MLP that combines Graph-MLP with an edge-splitting mechanism from ES-GNN. It incorporates the edge splitting into the loss of Graph-MLP to learn two separate adjacency matrices based on relevant and irrelevant feature pairs. Our experiments on seven datasets with six baselines show that ES-MLP is on par with homophilic and heterophilic models on all datasets without using edges during inference. We show that ES-MLP is robust to multiple types of edge noise during inference and that its inference time is two to five times faster than that of commonly used MPNNs.

      <title>Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present \textsc{Proceed}, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. \textsc{Proceed} first operates by estimating the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, \textsc{Proceed} is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models. The empirical study demonstrates that our proposed \textsc{Proceed} brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.</description>

      <title>On best approximation by multivariate ridge functions with applications to generalized translation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp upper and lower bounds for the approximation of Sobolev functions by sums of multivariate ridge functions, i.e., functions of the form $\mathbb{R}^d \ni x \mapsto \sum_{k=1}^n h_k(A_k x) \in \mathbb{R}$ with $h_k : \mathbb{R}^\ell \to \mathbb{R}$ and $A_k \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell \times d}$. We show that the order of approximation asymptotically behaves as $n^{-r/(d-\ell)}$, where $r$ is the regularity of the Sobolev functions to be approximated. Our lower bound even holds when approximating $L^\infty$-Sobolev functions of regularity $r$ with error measured in $L^1$, while our upper bound applies to the approximation of $L^p$-Sobolev functions in $L^p$ for any $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. These bounds generalize well-known results about the approximation properties of univariate ridge functions to the multivariate case. Moreover, we use these bounds to obtain sharp asymptotic bounds for the approximation of Sobolev functions using generalized translation networks and complex-valued neural networks.</description>

      <title>Sparse Signature Coefficient Recovery via Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Central to rough path theory is the signature transform of a path, an infinite series of tensors given by the iterated integrals of the underlying path. The signature poses an effective way to capture sequentially ordered information, thanks both to its rich analytic and algebraic properties as well as its universality when used as a basis to approximate functions on path space. Whilst a truncated version of the signature can be efficiently computed using Chen's identity, there is a lack of efficient methods for computing a sparse collection of iterated integrals contained in high levels of the signature. We address this problem by leveraging signature kernels, defined as the inner product of two signatures, and computable efficiently by means of PDE-based methods. By forming a filter in signature space with which to take kernels, one can effectively isolate specific groups of signature coefficients and, in particular, a singular coefficient at any depth of the transform. We show that such a filter can be expressed as a linear combination of suitable signature transforms and demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of our approach. To conclude, we give an example use case for sparse collections of signature coefficients based on the construction of N-step Euler schemes for sparse CDEs.</description>

      <title>Preference Discerning with LLM-Enhanced Generative Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems aim to provide personalized recommendations for users based on their interaction history. To achieve this, they often incorporate auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and auxiliary tasks, like predicting user preferences and intent. Despite numerous efforts to enhance these models, they still suffer from limited personalization. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm, which we term preference discerning. In preference dscerning, we explicitly condition a generative sequential recommendation system on user preferences within its context. To this end, we generate user preferences using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on user reviews and item-specific data. To evaluate preference discerning capabilities of sequential recommendation systems, we introduce a novel benchmark that provides a holistic evaluation across various scenarios, including preference steering and sentiment following. We assess current state-of-the-art methods using our benchmark and show that they struggle to accurately discern user preferences. Therefore, we propose a new method named Mender ($\textbf{M}$ultimodal Prefer$\textbf{en}$ce $\textbf{d}$iscern$\textbf{er}$), which improves upon existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark. Our results show that Mender can be effectively guided by human preferences even though they have not been observed during training, paving the way toward more personalized sequential recommendation systems. We will open-source the code and benchmarks upon publication.</description>

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN) is a powerful model studied broadly in various graph structural data learning tasks. However, to mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon, and deal with heterogeneous graph structural data, the design of GCN model remains a crucial issue to be investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel GCN called SStaGCN (Simplified stacking based GCN) by utilizing the ideas of stacking and aggregation, which is an adaptive general framework for tackling heterogeneous graph data. Specifically, we first use the base models of stacking to extract the node features of a graph. Subsequently, aggregation methods such as mean, attention and voting techniques are employed to further enhance the ability of node features extraction. Thereafter, the node features are considered as inputs and fed into vanilla GCN model. Furthermore, theoretical generalization bound analysis of the proposed model is explicitly given. Extensive experiments on $3$ public citation networks and another $3$ heterogeneous tabular data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art GCNs. Notably, the proposed SStaGCN can efficiently mitigate the over-smoothing problem of GCN.</description>

      <title>Dual-Directed Algorithm Design for Efficient Pure Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider pure-exploration problems in the context of stochastic sequential adaptive experiments with a finite set of alternatives. The central objective is to answer a query regarding the alternatives with high confidence while minimizing measurement efforts. One canonical example is identifying the best-performing alternative, a problem known as ranking and selection in simulation or best-arm identification in machine learning. We formulate the problem complexity measure as a maximin optimization problem for the static fixed-budget, fixed-confidence, and posterior convergence rate settings. By incorporating dual variables directly into the analysis, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for an allocation's optimality. The introduction of dual variables allows us to sidestep the combinatorial complexity that arises when considering only primal variables. These optimality conditions enable the extension of the top-two algorithm design principle to more general pure-exploration problems. Moreover, our analysis yields a straightforward and effective information-directed selection rule that adaptively chooses from a candidate set based on the informational value of the candidates. We demonstrate the broad range of contexts in which our design principle can be implemented. In particular, when combined with information-directed selection, top-two Thompson sampling achieves asymptotic optimality in Gaussian best-arm identification, resolving a notable open question in the pure-exploration literature. Our algorithm attains optimality in $\varepsilon$-best-arm identification (or ranking and selection with a probability of good selection guarantee) and thresholding bandits. Our results provide a general principle for adapting Thompson sampling to general pure-exploration problems. Numerical experiments highlight the efficiency of our proposed algorithms compared to existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is the act of embedding proximity information about a set of $n$ objects in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. As originally conceived by the psychometric community, MDS was concerned with embedding a fixed set of proximities associated with a fixed set of objects. Modern concerns, e.g., that arise in developing asymptotic theories for statistical inference on random graphs, more typically involve studying the limiting behavior of a sequence of proximities associated with an increasing set of objects. Here we are concerned with embedding dissimilarities by minimizing Kruskal's (1964) raw stress criterion. Standard results from the theory of point-to-set maps can be used to establish that, if $n$ is fixed and a sequence of dissimilarity matrices converges, then the limit of their embedded structures is the embedded structure of the limiting dissimilarity matrix. But what if $n$ increases? It then becomes necessary to reformulate MDS so that the entire sequence of embedding problems can be viewed as a sequence of optimization problems in a fixed space. We present such a reformulation, {\em continuous MDS}. Within the continuous MDS framework, we derive two $L^p$ consistency results, one for embedding without constraints on the configuration, the other for embedding subject to {\em approximate Lipschitz constraints}\/ that encourage smoothness of the embedding function. The latter approach, {\em Approximate Lipschitz Embedding}\/ (ALE) is new. Finally, we demonstrate that embedded structures produced by ALE can be interpolated in a way that results in uniform convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a popular framework for efficiently tackling black-box search problems. As a rule, these algorithms operate by iteratively choosing what to evaluate next until some predefined budget has been exhausted. We investigate replacing this de facto stopping rule with criteria based on the probability that a point satisfies a given set of conditions. We focus on the prototypical example of an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-criterion: stop when a solution has been found whose value is within $\epsilon &gt; 0$ of the optimum with probability at least $1 - \delta$ under the model. For Gaussian process priors, we show that Bayesian optimization satisfies this criterion under mild technical assumptions. Further, we give a practical algorithm for evaluating Monte Carlo stopping rules in a manner that is both sample efficient and robust to estimation error. These findings are accompanied by empirical results which demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: Transfer learning enhances prediction accuracy on a target distribution by leveraging data from a source distribution, demonstrating significant benefits in various applications. This paper introduces a novel dissimilarity measure that utilizes vicinity information, i.e., the local structure of data points, to analyze the excess error in classification under covariate shift, a transfer learning setting where marginal feature distributions differ but conditional label distributions remain the same. We characterize the excess error using the proposed measure and demonstrate faster or competitive convergence rates compared to previous techniques. Notably, our approach is effective in the support non-containment assumption, which often appears in real-world applications, holds. Our theoretical analysis bridges the gap between current theoretical findings and empirical observations in transfer learning, particularly in scenarios with significant differences between source and target distributions.</description>

Abstract: Conditional validity and length efficiency are two crucial aspects of conformal prediction (CP). Conditional validity ensures accurate uncertainty quantification for data subpopulations, while proper length efficiency ensures that the prediction sets remain informative. Despite significant efforts to address each of these issues individually, a principled framework that reconciles these two objectives has been missing in the CP literature. In this paper, we develop Conformal Prediction with Length-Optimization (CPL) - a novel and practical framework that constructs prediction sets with (near-) optimal length while ensuring conditional validity under various classes of covariate shifts, including the key cases of marginal and group-conditional coverage. In the infinite sample regime, we provide strong duality results which indicate that CPL achieves conditional validity and length optimality. In the finite sample regime, we show that CPL constructs conditionally valid prediction sets. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior prediction set size performance of CPL compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse real-world and synthetic datasets in classification, regression, and large language model-based multiple choice question answering.

      <title>Toward Model-Agnostic Detection of New Physics Using Data-Driven Signal Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the search for new particles in high-energy physics, it is crucial to select the Signal Region (SR) in such a way that it is enriched with signal events if they are present. While most existing search methods set the region relying on prior domain knowledge, it may be unavailable for a completely novel particle that falls outside the current scope of understanding. We address this issue by proposing a method built upon a model-agnostic but often realistic assumption about the localized topology of the signal events, in which they are concentrated in a certain area of the feature space. Considering the signal component as a localized high-frequency feature, our approach employs the notion of a low-pass filter. We define the SR as an area which is most affected when the observed events are smeared with additive random noise. We overcome challenges in density estimation in the high-dimensional feature space by learning the density ratio of events that potentially include a signal to the complementary observation of events that closely resemble the target events but are free of any signals. By applying our method to simulated $\mathrm{HH} \rightarrow 4b$ events, we demonstrate that the method can efficiently identify a data-driven SR in a high-dimensional feature space in which a high portion of signal events concentrate.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Uncertainty Quantification of Factual Estimand of Efficacy from Before-and-After Treatment Repeated Measures Randomized Controlled Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ideal estimand for comparing a new treatment $Rx$ with a control $C$ is the $\textit{counterfactual}$ efficacy $Rx:C$, the expected differential outcome between $Rx$ and $C$ if each patient were given $\textit{both}$. While counterfactual $\textit{point estimation}$ from $\textit{factual}$ Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) has been available, this article shows $\textit{counterfactual}$ uncertainty quantification (CUQ), quantifying uncertainty for factual point estimates but in a counterfactual setting, is surprisingly achievable. We achieve CUQ whose variability is typically smaller than factual UQ, by creating a new statistical modeling principle called ETZ which is applicable to RCTs with $\textit{Before-and-After}$ treatment Repeated Measures, common in many therapeutic areas.
  We urge caution when estimate of the unobservable true condition of a patient before treatment has measurement error, because that violation of standard regression assumption can cause attenuation in estimating treatment effects. Fortunately, we prove that, for traditional medicine in general, and for targeted therapy with efficacy defined as averaged over the population, counterfactual point estimation is unbiased. However, for targeted therapy, both Real Human and Digital Twins approaches should respect this limitation, lest predicted treatment effect in $\textit{subgroups}$ will have bias.</description>

      <title>Dense ReLU Neural Networks for Temporal-spatial Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09961v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on fully connected deep neural networks utilizing the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for nonparametric estimation. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</description>

      <title>Causal thinking for decision making on Electronic Health Records: why and how</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate predictions, as with machine learning, may not suffice to provide optimal healthcare for every patient. Indeed, prediction can be driven by shortcuts in the data, such as racial biases. Causal thinking is needed for data-driven decisions. Here, we give an introduction to the key elements, focusing on routinely-collected data, electronic health records (EHRs) and claims data. Using such data to assess the value of an intervention requires care: temporal dependencies and existing practices easily confound the causal effect. We present a step-by-step framework to help build valid decision making from real-life patient records by emulating a randomized trial before individualizing decisions, eg with machine learning. Our framework highlights the most important pitfalls and considerations in analysing EHRs or claims data to draw causal conclusions. We illustrate the various choices in studying the effect of albumin on sepsis mortality in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database (MIMIC-IV). We study the impact of various choices at every step, from feature extraction to causal-estimator selection. In a tutorial spirit, the code and the data are openly available.</description>

      <title>Multiple Physics Pretraining for Physical Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce multiple physics pretraining (MPP), an autoregressive task-agnostic pretraining approach for physical surrogate modeling of spatiotemporal systems with transformers. In MPP, rather than training one model on a specific physical system, we train a backbone model to predict the dynamics of multiple heterogeneous physical systems simultaneously in order to learn features that are broadly useful across systems and facilitate transfer. In order to learn effectively in this setting, we introduce a shared embedding and normalization strategy that projects the fields of multiple systems into a shared embedding space. We validate the efficacy of our approach on both pretraining and downstream tasks over a broad fluid mechanics-oriented benchmark. We show that a single MPP-pretrained transformer is able to match or outperform task-specific baselines on all pretraining sub-tasks without the need for finetuning. For downstream tasks, we demonstrate that finetuning MPP-trained models results in more accurate predictions across multiple time-steps on systems with previously unseen physical components or higher dimensional systems compared to training from scratch or finetuning pretrained video foundation models. We open-source our code and model weights trained at multiple scales for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Learning Variational Inequalities from Data: Fast Generalization Rates under Strong Monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational inequalities (VIs) are a broad class of optimization problems encompassing machine learning problems ranging from standard convex minimization to more complex scenarios like min-max optimization and computing the equilibria of multi-player games. In convex optimization, strong convexity allows for fast statistical learning rates requiring only $\Theta(1/\epsilon)$ stochastic first-order oracle calls to find an $\epsilon$-optimal solution, rather than the standard $\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)$ calls. In this paper, we explain how one can similarly obtain fast $\Theta(1/\epsilon)$ rates for learning VIs that satisfy strong monotonicity, a generalization of strong convexity. Specifically, we demonstrate that standard stability-based generalization arguments for convex minimization extend directly to VIs when the domain admits a small covering, or when the operator is integrable and suboptimality is measured by potential functions; such as when finding equilibria in multi-player games.</description>

      <title>Geometry of fibers of the multiplication map of deep linear neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the algebraic set of tuples of composable matrices which multiply to a fixed matrix, using tools from the theory of quiver representations. In particular, we determine its codimension $C$ and the number $\theta$ of its top-dimensional irreducible components. Our solution is presented in three forms: a Poincar\'e series in equivariant cohomology, a quadratic integer program, and an explicit formula. In the course of the proof, we establish a surprising property: $C$ and $\theta$ are invariant under arbitrary permutations of the dimension vector. We also show that the real log-canonical threshold of the function taking a tuple to the square Frobenius norm of its product is $C/2$. These results are motivated by the study of deep linear neural networks in machine learning and Bayesian statistics (singular learning theory) and show that deep linear networks are in a certain sense ``mildly singular".</description>

      <title>Practical Performative Policy Learning with Strategic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performative policy learning problem, where agents adjust their features in response to a released policy to improve their potential outcomes, inducing an endogenous distribution shift. There has been growing interest in training machine learning models in strategic environments, including strategic classification and performative prediction. However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive parametric assumptions: micro-level utility models in strategic classification and macro-level data distribution maps in performative prediction, severely limiting scalability and generalizability. We approach this problem as a complex causal inference task, relaxing parametric assumptions on both micro-level agent behavior and macro-level data distribution. Leveraging bounded rationality, we uncover a practical low-dimensional structure in distribution shifts and construct an effective mediator in the causal path from the deployed model to the shifted data. We then propose a gradient-based policy optimization algorithm with a differentiable classifier as a substitute for the high-dimensional distribution map. Our algorithm efficiently utilizes batch feedback and limited manipulation patterns. Our approach achieves high sample efficiency compared to methods reliant on bandit feedback or zero-order optimization. We also provide theoretical guarantees for algorithmic convergence. Extensive and challenging experiments on high-dimensional settings demonstrate our method's practical efficacy.</description>

      <title>Rate-In: Information-Driven Adaptive Dropout Rates for Improved Inference-Time Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial for deploying neural networks in risk-sensitive applications such as medical diagnosis. Monte Carlo Dropout is a widely used technique for approximating predictive uncertainty by performing stochastic forward passes with dropout during inference. However, using static dropout rates across all layers and inputs can lead to suboptimal uncertainty estimates, as it fails to adapt to the varying characteristics of individual inputs and network layers. Existing approaches optimize dropout rates during training using labeled data, resulting in fixed inference-time parameters that cannot adjust to new data distributions, compromising uncertainty estimates in Monte Carlo simulations.
  In this paper, we propose Rate-In, an algorithm that dynamically adjusts dropout rates during inference by quantifying the information loss induced by dropout in each layer's feature maps. By treating dropout as controlled noise injection and leveraging information-theoretic principles, Rate-In adapts dropout rates per layer and per input instance without requiring ground truth labels. By quantifying the functional information loss in feature maps, we adaptively tune dropout rates to maintain perceptual quality across diverse medical imaging tasks and architectural configurations. Our extensive empirical study on synthetic data and real-world medical imaging tasks demonstrates that Rate-In improves calibration and sharpens uncertainty estimates compared to fixed or heuristic dropout rates without compromising predictive performance. Rate-In offers a practical, unsupervised, inference-time approach to optimizing dropout for more reliable predictive uncertainty estimation in critical applications.</description>
