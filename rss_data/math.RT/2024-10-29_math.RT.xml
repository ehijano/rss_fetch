      <title>A note on characters and endoscopy for $p$-adic $\mathrm{SL}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the depth-zero supercuspidal $L$-packets of $\mathrm{SL}_2$. With the aid of the classical character formulas of Sally-Shalika, we prove the endoscopic character identities. For the depth-zero $L$-packet of cardinality $4$, we find that, in order to comply with the Sally-Shalika formulas, the three endoscopic groups must be paired carefully with semisimple elements in the dual group $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Fuks cohomology of vector fields on algebraic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an affine algebraic variety, we introduce algebraic Gelfand-Fuks cohomology of polynomial vector fields with coefficients in differentiable $AV$-modules. Its complex is given by cochains that are differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck. Using the jets of vector fields, we compute this cohomology for varieties with uniformizing parameters. We prove that in this case, Gelfand-Fuks cohomology with coefficients in a tensor module decomposes as a tensor product of the de Rham cohomology of the variety and the cohomology of the Lie algebra of vector fields on affine space, vanishing at the origin. We explicitly compute this cohomology for affine space, the torus, and Krichever-Novikov algebras.</description>

      <title>The McKay Conjecture on character degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: McKay's conjecture (1971) on character degrees was reduced by Isaacs-Malle-Navarro (2007) to a so-called inductive condition on characters of finite quasisimple groups [IMN07], thus opening the way to a proof of McKay's conjecture using the classification of finite simple groups. After [Ma07], [Ma08], [S12], [CS13], [KS16], [MS16], [CS17a], [CS17b], [CS19], [S23a], [S23b], we complete here the last step of a proof with an analysis of the representations of certain normalizers ${\mathrm N}_G({\mathbf S})$ in $G={\mathbf G}^F$ of maximal $d$-tori ${\mathbf S}$ ($d\geq 3$) of the ambient simple simply-connected algebraic group ${\mathbf G}$ of type ${\mathrm D}_l$ ($l\geq 4$) for which $F$ is a Frobenius endomorphism. To establish the so-called local conditions A$(d)$ and B$(d)$, we introduce a certain class of $F$-stable reductive subgroups ${\mathbf M}\leq {\mathbf G}$ of maximal rank where ${\mathbf M}^\circ$ is of type ${\mathrm D}_{l_1}\times {\mathrm D}_{l-l_1}$ with ${\mathbf M}/{\mathbf M}^\circ$ of order 2. They are an efficient substitute for ${\mathrm N}_G({\mathbf S})$ or the local subgroups in non-defining characteristic relevant to McKay's abstract statement. For a general class of those subgroups ${\mathbf M}^F$ we describe their characters and the action of $\operatorname {Aut}({\mathbf G}^F)_{{\mathbf M}^F}$ on them, showing in particular that $\mathrm{Irr}({\mathbf M}^F)$ and $\mathrm {Irr}({\mathbf G}^F)$ share some key features in that regard.
  With this established, McKay's conjecture is now a theorem stating $\textit{McKay's equality}$: For any prime $\ell$, any finite group has as many irreducible complex characters of degree prime to $\ell$ as the normalizers of its Sylow $\ell$-subgroups.</description>

      <title>Around Hikita-Nakajima conjecture for nilpotent orbits and parabolic Slodowy varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a complex reductive algebraic group. In arxiv:2108.03453 Ivan Losev, Lucas mason-Brown and the third-named author suggested a symplectic duality between nilpotent Slodowy slices in $\mathfrak{g}^\vee$ and affinizations of certain $G$-equivariant covers of special nilpotent orbits. In this paper, we study the various versions of Hikita conjecture for this pair. We show that the original statement of the conjecture does not hold for the pairs in question and propose a refined version. We discuss the general approach towards the proof of the refined Hikita conjecture and prove this refined version for the parabolic Slodowy varieties, which includes many of the cases considered in arxiv:2108.03453 and more. Applied to the setting of arxiv:2108.03453, the refined Hikita conjecture explains the importance of special unipotent ideals from the symplectic duality point of view.
  We also discuss applications of our results. In the appendices, we discuss some classical questions in Lie theory that relate the refined version and the original version. We also explain how one can use our results to simplify some proofs of known results in the literature. As a combinatorial application of our results we observe an interesting relation between the geometry of Springer fibers and left Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in the corresponding Weyl group.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we present a combinatorial formula for computing the Wedderburn decomposition of the rational group algebra associated with an ordinary metacyclic $p$-group $G$, where $p$ is any prime. We also provide a formula for counting irreducible rational representations of $G$ with distinct degrees and derive a method to explicitly obtain all inequivalent irreducible rational matrix representations of $G$.</description>

      <title>Holonomic $A\mathcal{V}$-modules for the affine space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the growth of representations of the Lie algebra of vector fields on the affine space that admit a compatible action of the polynomial algebra. We establish the Bernstein inequality for these representations, enabling us to focus on modules with minimal growth, known as holonomic modules. We show that simple holonomic modules are isomorphic to the tensor product of a holonomic module over the Weyl algebra and a finite-dimensional $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-module. We also prove that holonomic modules have a finite length and that the representation map associated with a holonomic module is a differential operator. Finally, we present examples illustrating our results.</description>

Abstract: These lecture notes are devoted to the recent progress in the geometric aspects of quantum integrable systems based on quantum groups solved using the Bethe ansatz technique. One part is devoted to their enumerative geometry realization through the quantum K-theory of Nakajima quiver varieties. The other part describes a recently studied $q$-deformation of the correspondence between oper connections and Gaudin models. The notes are based on a minicourse at C.I.M.E. Summer School ``Enumerative geometry, quantisation and moduli spaces," September 04-08, 2023.</description>

      <title>Completing hearts of triangulated categories via weight-exact localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a weight-exact localization pi of a well generated triangulated category C along with the embedding of the hearts of adjacent t-structures coming from the functor right adjoint to pi. We prove that the functors relating the corresponding four hearts are completely determined by the heart Hw of the weight structure on C along with the set of Hw-morphisms that we invert via pi; it also suffices to know the corresponding embedding of the hearts of t-structures. Our results generalize the description of non-commutative localizations of rings in terms of weight-exact localizations given in an earlier paper of the first author. That paper was essentially devoted to weight-exact localizations by compactly generated subcategories, whereas in the current text we focus on "more complicated" localizations.
  We recall that two types of localizations of the sort we are interested in were studied by several authors. They took C=D(R-mod); the heart of the first t-structure was equivalent to R-mod, and the second heart was equivalent to the exact abelian category $U_{contra}\subset R-mod$ of U-contramodules (corresponding to a set of Proj R-mod-morphisms U related either to a homological ring epimorphism $u:R\to UU$ or to an ideal of I of R). The functor $R-mod\to U_{contra}$ induced by pi is a certain completion one. Consequently, the hearts of the corresponding weight structures are equivalent to Proj R-mod and to the subcategory of projective objects of U_{contra}, respectively. Moreover, the connecting functors between these categories are isomorphic to ones coming from any weight structure class-generated by a single compact object whose endomorphism ring is R^{op}; in particular, one can take R=Z and C=SH and re-prove some important statements due to Bousfield.</description>

      <title>Extended Weyl groups, Hurwitz transitivity and weighted projective lines I: Generalities and the tubular case</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.05083v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We start the systematic study of extended Weyl groups, and continue the combinatorial description of thick subcategories in hereditary categories started by Ingalls-Thomas, Igusa-Schiffler-Thomas and Krause. We show that for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ there exists an order preserving bijection between the thick subcategories of $\mathrm{coh}(\mathbb{X})$ generated by an exceptional sequence and a subposet of the interval poset of a Coxeter transformation $c$ in the Weyl group of a simply-laced extended root system if the Hurwitz action is transitive on the reduced reflection factorizations of $c$ that generate the Weyl group. By using combinatorial and group theoretical tools we show that this assumption on the transitivity of the Hurwitz action is fulfilled for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ of tubular type.</description>

Abstract: We generalise Gelfand-Graev characters to $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$-graded Lie algebras and lift them to produce new test functions to probe the local character expansion in positive depth. We show that these test functions are well adapted to compute the leading terms of the local character expansion and relate their determination to the asymptotic cone of elements in $\mathbb Z/n$-graded Lie algebras. As an illustration, we compute the geometric wave front set of certain toral supercuspidal representations in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify globally irreducible representations of alternating groups and double covers of symmetric and alternating groups. In order to achieve this classification we also completely characterise irreducible representations of such groups which reduce almost homogeneously in every characteristic. This also allows us to classify irreducible representations that remain irreducible in every characteristic as well as irreducible representations of these groups that can appear as composition factors of globally irreducible representations of groups containing $\mathfrak{A}_n$ or $\hat{\mathfrak{A}}_n$ as normal subgroups. In particular we show that, apart from finitely many exceptions, for any of these questions such representations are either $1$-dimensional or basic spin representations.</description>

Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{C}, i^{*}, i_{\ast}, i^{!},j_!, j^\ast, j_\ast)$ be a recollement of extriangulated categories. We show that there is a bijection between thick subcategories in $\mathcal{C}$ and thick subcategories in $\mathcal{B}$ containing $i_{\ast}\mathcal{A}$. Futhermore, the thick subcategories $\mathcal{V}$ in $\mathcal{B}$ containing $i_{\ast}\mathcal{A}$ can induce a new recollement relative to $\mathcal{A}$ and $j^{\ast}\mathcal{V}$. We also prove that silting subcategories in $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ can be glued to get silting subcategories in $\mathcal{B}$ and the converse holds under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Chromatic symmetric functions via the group algebra of $S_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.05470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove some Schur positivity results for the chromatic symmetric function $X_G$ of a (hyper)graph $G$, using connections to the group algebra of the symmetric group. The first such connection works for (hyper)forests $F$: we describe the Schur coefficients of $X_F$ in terms of eigenvalues of a product of Hermitian idempotents in the group algebra, one factor for each edge (a more general formula of similar shape holds for all chordal graphs). Our main application of this technique is to prove a conjecture of Taylor on the Schur positivity of certain $X_F$, which implies Schur positivity of the formal group laws associated to various combinatorial generating functions. We also introduce the pointed chromatic symmetric function $X_{G,v}$ associated to a rooted graph $(G,v)$. We prove that if $X_{G,v}$ and $X_{H,w}$ are positive in the generalized Schur basis of Strahov, then the chromatic symmetric function of the wedge sum of $(G,v)$ and $(H,w)$ is Schur positive.</description>

Abstract: We consider representations of quivers taking values in monads or comonads over a Grothendieck category $\mathcal C$. We treat these as scheme like objects whose ``structure sheaf'' consists of monads or comonads. By using systems of adjoint functors between Eilenberg-Moore categories, we obtain a categorical framework of modules over monad quivers, and of comodules over comonad quivers. Our main objective is to give conditions for these to be Grothendieck categories, which play the role of noncommutative spaces. As with usual ringed spaces, we have to study two kinds of module categories over a monad quiver. The first behaves like a sheaf of modules over a ringed space. The second consists of modules that are cartesian, which resemble quasi-coherent sheaves. We also obtain an extension of the classical quasi-coherator construction to modules over a monad quiver with values in Eilenberg-Moore categories. We establish similar results for comodules over a comonad quiver. One of our key steps is finding a modulus like bound for an endofunctor $U:\mathcal C\longrightarrow \mathcal C$ in terms of $\kappa(G)$, where $G$ is a generator for $\mathcal C$ and $\kappa(G)$ is a cardinal such that $G$ is $\kappa(G)$-presentable. Another feature of our paper is that we study modules over a monad quiver in two different orientations, which we refer to as ``cis-modules'' and ``trans-modules.'' We conclude with rational pairings of a monad quiver with a comonad quiver, which relate comodules over a comonad quiver to coreflective subcategories of modules over monad quivers.</description>

      <title>Ordinary parts and local-global compatibility at $\ell=p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove local-global compatibility results at $\ell=p$ for the torsion automorphic Galois representations constructed by Scholze, generalising the work of Caraiani--Newton. In particular, we verify, up to a nilpotent ideal, the local-global compatibility conjecture at $\ell=p$ of Gee--Newton in the case of imaginary CM fields under some technical assumptions. The key new ingredient is a local-global compatibility result for $Q$-ordinary self-dual automorphic representations for arbitrary parabolic subgroups.</description>

      <title>Huppert's Conjecture for finite simple exceptional groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\textrm{cd}(G)$ be the set of all complex irreducible character degrees of $G.$ In this paper, we show that if $\textrm{cd}(G)=\textrm{cd}(H),$ where $H$ is a finite simple exceptional group of Lie type, then $G\cong H\times A,$ where $A$ is an abelian group. This completes the verification of Huppert's Conjecture for all finite simple exceptional groups of Lie type.</description>
