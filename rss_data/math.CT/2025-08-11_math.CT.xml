      <title>Double-functorial representation of regular structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that bicategories of spans capture the Beck-Chevalley relationship underlying the adjunctions suitable for the semantics of existential quantification. By viewing hyperdoctrines from a double-categorical lens, this paper shows that we can also characterise the Frobenius property: (generalised) regular hyperdoctrines correspond to those lax symmetric monoidal double pseudofunctors from spans to quintets whose monoidal laxators provide companion commuter cells (in the sense of Par\'e). This suggests a new notion of regular double hyperdoctrine. As an application, we discuss how we can recover a form of graphical regular logic suitable for modelling specifications of systems (e.g., port-plugging systems) that compose operadically.</description>

      <title>Filter Quotient Model Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The filter quotient construction is a particular instance of a filtered colimit of categories. It has primarily been considered in the context of categorical logic, where it has been used effectively to construct non-trivial models, for example new models of set theory.
  In this work we prove that given a model category and a suitable notion of filter of subterminal objects, the filter quotient construction will preserve the model structure. We also show that this new model structure inherits certain important properties (such as being simplicial or proper), but not all (such as being cofibrantly generated). Finally, we show it is compatible with the construction of filter quotient $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Models of Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homotopy type theory is a modern foundation for mathematics that introduces the univalence axiom and is particularly suitable for the study of homotopical mathematics and its formalization via proof assistants. In order to better comprehend the mathematical implications of homotopy type theory, a variety of models have been constructed and studied. Here a model is understood as a model category with suitable properties implementing the various type theoretical constructors and axioms. A first example is the simplicial model due to Kapulkin--Lumsdaine--Voevodsky. By now, many other models have been constructed, due to work of Arndt, Kapulkin, Lumsdaine, Warren and particularly Shulman, culminating in a proof that every Grothendieck $\infty$-topos can be obtained as the underlying $\infty$-category of a model category that models homotopy type theory.
  In this paper we propose the filter quotient construction as a new method to construct further models of homotopy type theory. Concretely, we prove that with minor assumptions, the filter quotient construction preserves all model categorical properties individually that implement various type theoretical constructors and axioms. On the other hand, the filter quotient construction does not preserve many external properties that are of set theoretical nature, such as cocompleteness, local presentability or cofibrant generation. Combining these, the filter quotient construction preserves models of homotopy type theory and can result in models that have not been considered before and exhibit behaviors that diverge from any of the established models.</description>

      <title>Simplicial Homotopy Type Theory is not just Simplicial: What are $\infty$-Categories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\infty$-category theory was originally developed in the context of classical homotopy theory using standard set theoretical assumptions, but has since been extended to a variety of mathematical foundations. One such successful effort, primarily due to Martini and Wolf, introduced a theory of $\infty$-categories internal to the foundation of an arbitrary Grothendieck $\infty$-topos, meaning they used categorical foundations. Another approach, due to Riehl and Shulman, developed a theory of $\infty$-categories internal to their own type theory: simplicial homotopy type theory (sHoTT), meaning they employed a (homotopy) type theoretic foundation.
  One aspect of developing a theory of $\infty$-categories in different foundations consists of introducing ways to translate from one foundation to another. Concretely, as part of their work, Riehl and Shulman prove that $\infty$-categories internal to Grothendieck $\infty$-topoi give us categorical models of sHoTT. In fact the name ``simplicial'' in sHoTT suggests that all categorical models of sHoTT should be given by simplicial objects in suitable $\infty$-categories. In this paper we prove that contrary to this expectation, there are models of sHoTT that are not simply simplicial objects. This suggests that in a general foundations, the notion of $\infty$-category is more general than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Convexity in tensor triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the dualizable localizing ideals of rigidly-compactly generated tt-$\infty$-categories that are cohomologically stratified. By definition, these are the localizing ideals that are dualizable with respect to the Lurie tensor product. We prove that these ideals correspond to the convex subsets of the Balmer spectrum. More generally, we establish this classification for categories which are locally cohomologically stratified and whose Balmer spectrum is noetherian. The classification thus applies to many categories arising in algebra and topology, including derived categories of noetherian schemes. Our result generalizes, and is motivated by, a recent theorem of Efimov which establishes this classification for derived categories of commutative noetherian rings.</description>

      <title>Coinductive Streams in Monoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14494v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce monoidal streams. Monoidal streams are a generalization of causal stream functions, which can be defined in cartesian monoidal categories, to arbitrary symmetric monoidal categories. In the same way that streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with pure functions, monoidal streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with theories of processes represented by a symmetric monoidal category. Monoidal streams also form a feedback monoidal category. In the same way that we can use a coinductive stream calculus to reason about signal flow graphs, we can use coinductive string diagrams to reason about feedback monoidal categories. As an example, we study syntax for a stochastic dataflow language, with semantics in stochastic monoidal streams.</description>

      <title>Contraderived categories of CDG-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any CDG-ring $B^\bullet=(B^*,d,h)$, we show that the homotopy category of graded-projective (left) CDG-modules over $B^\bullet$ is equivalent to the quotient category of the homotopy category of graded-flat CDG-modules by its full triangulated subcategory of flat CDG-modules. The contraderived category (in the sense of Becker) $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is the common name for these two triangulated categories. We also prove that the classes of cotorsion and graded-cotorsion CDG-modules coincide, and the contraderived category of CDG-modules is equivalent to the homotopy category of graded-flat graded-cotorsion CDG-modules. Assuming the graded ring $B^*$ to be graded right coherent, we show that the contraderived category $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is compactly generated and its full subcategory of compact objects is anti-equivalent to the full subcategory of compact objects in the coderived category of right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bco}}(\mathbf{Mod}{-}B^\bullet)$. Specifically, the latter triangulated category is the idempotent completion of the absolute derived category of finitely presented right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{abs}}(\mathbf{mod}{-}B^\bullet)$.</description>

      <title>Infinitary combinatorics in condensed math and strong homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in our understanding of higher derived limits carry multiple implications in the fields of condensed and pyknotic mathematics, as well as for the study of strong homology. These implications are thematically diverse, pertaining, for example, to the sheaf theory of extremally disconnected spaces, to Banach--Smith duality, to the productivity of compact projective condensed anima, and to the structure of the derived category of condensed abelian groups. Underlying each of these implications are the combinatorics of multidimensionally coherent families of functions of small infinite cardinal height, and it is for this reason that we convene accounts of them together herein.</description>
