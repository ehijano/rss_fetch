      <title>A note on stable Kim-forking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define weak stable Kim-forking, a notion that generalizes stable forking to the context of NSOP1 theories. We adapt some of the known results on stable forking to this context.</description>

      <title>Compactness for small cardinals in mathematics: principles, consequences, and limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss some well-known compactness principles for uncountable structures of small regular sizes ($\omega_n$ for $2 \le n&lt;\omega$, $\aleph_{\omega+1}$, $\aleph_{\omega^2+1}$, etc.), consistent from weakly compact (the size-restricted versions) or strongly compact or supercompact cardinals (the unrestricted versions). We divide the principles into logical principles (various tree properties) and mathematical principles, which directly postulate compactness for structures like groups, graphs, or topological spaces (for instance, countable chromatic and color compactness of graphs, compactness of abelian groups, $\Delta$-reflection, Fodor-type reflection principle, and Rado's Conjecture).
  We focus on indestructibility, or preservation, of these principles in forcing extensions. Using the existing preservation results we observe that many traditional problems such as Suslin Hypothesis, Whitehead's Conjecture, Kaplansky's Conjecture, and Baumagartner's Axiom, are independent from some of the strongest forms of compactness at $\omega_2$. Additionally, we observe that Rado's Conjecture plus $2^\omega = \omega_2$ is consistent with the negative solutions of some of these conjectures (as they hold in $V = L$), verifying that they hold in suitable Mitchell models.
  Finally, we comment on whether the compactness principles under discussion are good candidates for axioms. We consider their consequences and the existence or non-existence of convincing unifications (such as Martin's Maximum or Rado's Conjecture). This part is a modest follow-up to the articles by Foreman ``Generic large cardinals: new axioms for mathematics?'' (1998) and Feferman et al. ``Does mathematics need new axioms?'' (2000).</description>

      <title>Cut-free Deductive System for Continuous Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop propositional continuous intuitionistic logic and propositional continuous affine logic via complete algebraic semantics. Our approach centres on AC-algebras, which are algebras $USC(\mathcal{L})$ of sup-preserving functions from $[0,1]$ to an integral commutative residuated complete lattice $\mathcal{L}$ (in the intuitionistic case, $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale). We give an algebraic axiomatisation of AC-algebras in the language of continuous logic and prove, using the Macneille completion, that every Archimedean model embeds into some AC-algebra. We also show that (i) $USC(\mathcal{L})$ satisfies $v \dot + v = 2v$ exactly when $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale, (ii) involutiveness of negation in $USC(\mathcal{L})$ corresponds to that in $\mathcal{L} $, and that (iii) adding those conditions recovers classical continuous logic. For each variant -affine, intuitionistic, involutive, classical -we provide a sequent style deductive system and prove completeness and cut admissibility. This yields the first sequent style formulation of classical continuous logic enjoying cut admissibility.</description>

      <title>Borel Combinatorics of Schreier Graphs of $\mathbb{Z}$-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Borel combinatorics of Schreier graphs of $\mathbb{Z}$-actions with arbitrary finite generating sets. We formulate the Borel combinatorics in terms of existence of Borel equivariant maps from $F(2^{\mathbb{Z}})$ to subshifts of finite type. We then show that the Borel combinatorics and the continuous combinatorics coincide, and both are decidable. This is in contrast with the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-actions. We then turn to the problem of computing Borel chromatic numbers for such graphs. We give an algorithm for this problem which runs in exponential time. We then prove some bounds for the Borel chromatic numbers and give a formula for the case where the generating set has size 4.</description>

      <title>Elekes-Szab\'o for collinearity on cubic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the orchard problem on cubic surfaces. We classify possibly reducible cubic surfaces $X\subseteq \mathbb{P}^3(\C)$ with smooth components on which there exist families of finite sets (of unbounded size) with quadratically many 3-rich lines which do not concentrate (in a natural sense) on any projective plane. Namely, we prove that such a family exists precisely when $X$ is a union of three planes sharing a common line.
  Along the way, we obtain a general result about nilpotency of groups admitting an algebraic action satisfying an Elekes-Szab\'o condition, and we prove the following purely algebrogeometric statement: if the composition of four Geiser involutions through sufficiently generic points $a,b,c,d$ on a smooth irreducible cubic surface has infinitely many fixed points, then a single plane contains $a,b,c,d$ and all but finitely many of the fixed points.</description>

      <title>The barrier Ramsey theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a very general finite Ramsey theorem, where both the sets being colored and the homogeneous set must satisfy some largeness notion. For the homogeneous set this has already been done using the notion of $\alpha$-largeness, where $\alpha$ is a countable ordinal equipped with a system of fundamental sequences. To extend this approach the more appropriate notion is barrier largeness. Since the complexity of barriers can be measured by countable ordinals, we define Ramsey ordinals and, using appropriate iterations of the Veblen functions, we are able to compute them.</description>

      <title>Forbidden cycles in metrically homogeneous graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.05177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper by a superset of the authors it was proved that for every primitive 3-constrained space $\Gamma$ of finite diameter $\delta$ from Cherlin's catalogue of metrically homogeneous graphs, there exists a finite family $\mathcal F$ of $\{1,\ldots, \delta\}$-edge-labelled cycles such that a $\{1,\ldots, \delta\}$-edge-labelled graph is a subgraph of $\Gamma$ if and only if it contains no homomorphic images of cycles from $\mathcal F$. However, the cycles in the families $\mathcal F$ were not described explicitly as it was not necessary for the analysis of Ramsey expansions and the extension property for partial automorphisms.
  This paper fills this gap by providing an explicit description of the cycles in the families $\mathcal F$, heavily using the previous result in the process. Additionally, we explore the potential applications of this result, such as interpreting the graphs as semigroup-valued metric spaces or homogenizations of $\omega$-categorical $\{1,\delta\}$-edge-labelled graphs.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"odl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"iss\'e classes, and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>
