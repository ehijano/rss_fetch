      <title>Development and Benchmarking of a Blended Human-AI Qualitative Research Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualitative research emphasizes constructing meaning through iterative engagement with textual data. Traditionally this human-driven process requires navigating coder fatigue and interpretative drift, thus posing challenges when scaling analysis to larger, more complex datasets. Computational approaches to augment qualitative research have been met with skepticism, partly due to their inability to replicate the nuance, context-awareness, and sophistication of human analysis. Large language models, however, present new opportunities to automate aspects of qualitative analysis while upholding rigor and research quality in important ways. To assess their benefits and limitations - and build trust among qualitative researchers - these approaches must be rigorously benchmarked against human-generated datasets. In this work, we benchmark Muse, an interactive, AI-powered qualitative research system that allows researchers to identify themes and annotate datasets, finding an inter-rater reliability between Muse and humans of Cohen's $\kappa$ = 0.71 for well-specified codes. We also conduct robust error analysis to identify failure mode, guide future improvements, and demonstrate the capacity to correct for human bias.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for Design Ideation: An AI Tool to Assist Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creative potential of computers has intrigued researchers for decades. Since the emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI), computer creativity has found many new dimensions and applications. As Gen AI permeates mainstream discourse and usage, researchers are delving into how it can improve and complement what humans do. Creative potential is a highly relevant notion to design practice and research, especially in the initial stages of ideation and conceptualisation. There is scope to improve creative potential in these stages, especially using machine intelligence. We propose a structured ideation session involving inspirational stimuli and utilise Gen AI in delivering this structure to designers through ALIA: Analogical LLM Ideation Agent, a tool for small-group ideation scenarios. The tool is developed by enabling speech based interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) for inference generation. Inspiration is drawn from the synectic ideation method and the dialectics philosophy to design the optimal stimuli in group ideation. The tool is tested in design ideation sessions to compare the output of the AI-assisted ideation sessions to that of tradi tional ideation sessions. Preliminary findings showcase that participants have rated their ideas better when assisted by ALIA and respond favourably to speech-based interactions.</description>

      <title>Closing the Block-to-Text Gap: A Domain-Specific JavaScript Editor for Early Computational Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a web-based JavaScript editor designed to help children aged 8-10 transition from block-based to text-based programming. The system introduces a simplified domain-specific language (DSL) focused on visual art, combining authentic JavaScript syntax with immediate, creative visual feedback. A four-week pilot study (N = 15) demonstrated significant improvements in computational thinking skills (mean CTCI gain of +10.9, p &lt; 0.001), along with a 70% reduction in syntax errors. Participants advanced from basic drawing functions to sophisticated algorithmic designs using loops, conditionals, and animations. By integrating constructionist principles with a visual-first DSL, this research contributes a validated pedagogical framework for easing the block-to-text transition in K-12 computer science education. The system encourages creativity, self-correction, and sustained engagement, offering educators a practical, scalable tool for introducing authentic coding to young learners.</description>

      <title>Cyber-human social co-operating system: Application design and implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing wealth inequality and resource waste is a global challenge. A fundamental problem within the capitalist economy, put simply, lies in the enslavement of labor and the colonization of resources. To address these issues, movements promoting digital democracy and cooperative platforms have emerged as viable alternatives to traditional capitalist systems. From the perspective of integrating information systems with real-world social, environmental, and economic systems, Cyber-Physical Systems have been proposed for applications in Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0. One such CPS is the Social Co-OS (cyber-human social co-operating system). Social Co-OS is a co-operating system between cyber and human societies that conceptualizes the social system as a dynamic, circular structure composed of three layers: individual behavior, interindividual interaction, and institutional formation. Within this framework, the cyber system supports collective decision-making and individual cooperative behavior across these layers. The objective of this study is to define a novel application architecture based on the Social Co-OS concept, design a user interface flow, and implement it in practice. Specifically, we develop a social impact evaluator, a pluralistic policy simulator, and a consensus-building facilitator, which constitute the deliberative and political loop of Social Co-OS. Additionally, we implement a personality estimator and a behavior change promoter, which constitute the operational and administrative loop, along with a common mediator that serves as the cyber-human interface. Through these implementations, we demonstrate that Social Co-OS applications can effectively support human social systems and offer practical utility for policy co-making and co-operation, as evidenced by examples grounded in real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Cultural Prompting Improves the Empathy and Cultural Responsiveness of GPT-Generated Therapy Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents offer promising solutions for mental health support, but lack cultural responsiveness for diverse populations. This study evaluated the effectiveness of cultural prompting in improving cultural responsiveness and perceived empathy of LLM-generated therapeutic responses for Chinese American family caregivers. Using a randomized controlled experiment, we compared GPT-4o and Deepseek-V3 responses with and without cultural prompting. Thirty-six participants evaluated input-response pairs on cultural responsiveness (competence and relevance) and perceived empathy. Results showed that cultural prompting significantly enhanced GPT-4o's performance across all dimensions, with GPT-4o with cultural prompting being the most preferred, while improvements in DeepSeek-V3 responses were not significant. Mediation analysis revealed that cultural prompting improved empathy through improving cultural responsiveness. This study demonstrated that prompt-based techniques can effectively enhance the cultural responsiveness of LLM-generated therapeutic responses, highlighting the importance of cultural responsiveness in delivering empathetic AI-based therapeutic interventions to culturally and linguistically diverse populations.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Concept Explanations and Interventions on Human-Machine Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often considered black boxes due to their opaque decision-making processes. To reduce their opacity Concept Models (CMs), such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), were introduced to predict human-defined concepts as an intermediate step before predicting task labels. This enhances the interpretability of DNNs. In a human-machine setting greater interpretability enables humans to improve their understanding and build trust in a DNN. In the introduction of CBMs, the models demonstrated increased task accuracy as incorrect concept predictions were replaced with their ground truth values, known as intervening on the concept predictions. In a collaborative setting, if the model task accuracy improves from interventions, trust in a model and the human-machine task accuracy may increase. However, the result showing an increase in model task accuracy was produced without human evaluation and thus it remains unknown if the findings can be applied in a collaborative setting. In this paper, we ran the first human studies using CBMs to evaluate their human interaction in collaborative task settings. Our findings show that CBMs improve interpretability compared to standard DNNs, leading to increased human-machine alignment. However, this increased alignment did not translate to a significant increase in task accuracy. Understanding the model's decision-making process required multiple interactions, and misalignment between the model's and human decision-making processes could undermine interpretability and model effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: The Industry 4.0 refers to a industrial ecology which will merge the information system, physical system and service system into an integrate platform. Since now the industrial designers either conceive the physical part of products, or design the User Interfaces of computer systems, the new industrial ecology will give them a chance to redefine their roles in R&amp;D work-flow. In this paper we discussed the required qualities of industrial designer in the new era, according to an investigation among Chinese enterprises. Additionally, how to promote these qualities though educational program.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Indicators of Loneliness: Predicting University Students' Loneliness Scores from Smartphone Sensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loneliness is a critical mental health issue among university students, yet traditional monitoring methods rely primarily on retrospective self-reports and often lack real-time behavioral context. This study explores the use of passive smartphone sensing data to predict loneliness levels, addressing the limitations of existing approaches in capturing its dynamic nature. We integrate smartphone sensing with machine learning and large language models respectively to develop generalized and personalized models. Our Random Forest generalized models achieved mean absolute errors of 3.29 at midterm and 3.98 (out of 32) at the end of semester on the UCLA Loneliness Scale (short form), identifying smartphone screen usage and location mobility to be key predictors. The one-shot approach leveraging large language models reduced prediction errors by up to 42% compared to zero-shot inference. The one-shot results from personalized models highlighted screen usage, application usage, battery, and location transitions as salient behavioral indicators. These findings demonstrate the potential of smartphone sensing data for scalable and interpretable loneliness detection in digital mental health.</description>

      <title>Significant Other AI: Identity, Memory, and Emotional Regulation as Long-Term Relational Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant Others (SOs) stabilize identity, regulate emotion, and support narrative meaning-making, yet many people today lack access to such relational anchors. Recent advances in large language models and memory-augmented AI raise the question of whether artificial systems could support some of these functions. Existing empathic AIs, however, remain reactive and short-term, lacking autobiographical memory, identity modeling, predictive emotional regulation, and narrative coherence. This manuscript introduces Significant Other Artificial Intelligence (SO-AI) as a new domain of relational AI. It synthesizes psychological and sociological theory to define SO functions and derives requirements for SO-AI, including identity awareness, long-term memory, proactive support, narrative co-construction, and ethical boundary enforcement. A conceptual architecture is proposed, comprising an anthropomorphic interface, a relational cognition layer, and a governance layer. A research agenda outlines methods for evaluating identity stability, longitudinal interaction patterns, narrative development, and sociocultural impact. SO-AI reframes AI-human relationships as long-term, identity-bearing partnerships and provides a foundational blueprint for investigating whether AI can responsibly augment the relational stability many individuals lack today.</description>

      <title>An Approach to Joint Hybrid Decision Making between Humans and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the progress in artificial intelligence, it is important to understand how capable artificial agents should be used when interacting with humans, since high level authority and responsibility often remain with the human agent. However, integrated frameworks are lacking that can account for heterogeneous agents and draw on different scientific fields, such as human-factors engineering and artificial intelligence. Therefore, joint hybrid intelligence is described as a framework abstracting humans and artificial intelligence as decision making agents. A general definition of intelligence is provided on the basis of decision making competence being applicable to agents of different sorts. This framework is used for proposing the interrelated design space of joint hybrid intelligence being aimed at integrating the heterogeneous capabilities of humans and artificial intelligence. At the core of this design space lies joint agent engineering with the goal of integrating the design subspaces operator training, artificial intelligence engineering, and interface design via developing joint agent patterns. The ''extended swarming'' approach to human-swarm interaction is discussed as an example of such a pattern.</description>

      <title>Truck drivers and automation: A methodology for identifying and supporting workforce transition in the Australian road freight sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition to autonomous trucks (ATs) is coming, and is expected to create both challenges and opportunities for the driver workforce. This paper presents a novel methodology for identifying viable occupational transitions for truck drivers as transport automation advances. Unlike traditional workforce transition analyses that focus primarily on skill similarity, wages, and employment demand, this methodology incorporates four integrated components: task-level automation analysis, skill similarity assessment, labour market conditions analysis, and empirical validation using historical transition patterns. Applying this methodology to Australian truck drivers shows that while ATs will automate core driving tasks, many non-driving responsibilities will continue requiring a human, suggesting occupational evolution rather than wholesale displacement. A skill similarity analysis identifies 17 occupations with high transferability, while labour market analysis reveals significant trade-offs between wage levels and job availability across potential transition pathways. Key findings indicate that bus and coach driving, along with earthmoving plant operation, emerge as high-priority transition options, offering comparable wages and positive employment growth. Delivery and forklift driving present medium-priority pathways with abundant opportunities but lower wages. A regression analysis of historical transitions confirms that skill similarity, wage differentials, geographic accessibility, and qualification requirements all significantly influence actual transition patterns, with some viable pathways currently underutilised. The research provides policymakers, industry stakeholders, and educational institutions with evidence-based guidance for supporting workforce adaptation to technological change. The proposed methodology is generalisable beyond trucking to other sectors facing automation.</description>

      <title>Chameleon: Automated Color Palette Adaptation for Dark Mode Data Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark mode has gained widespread adoption across mobile platforms due to its benefits in reducing eye strain and conserving battery life. However, while the mobile system switches to dark mode, most visualizations remain designed for light mode, causing visual disruptions. Existing methods, such as manual adjustment or color inversion, are either time-consuming or fail to preserve the semantic meaning of colors in visualizations, making them less effective in dark mode. To address this challenge, we propose Chameleon, an algorithm that automatically transforms light mode visualizations into dark mode while maintaining visual clarity and color semantics. By optimizing for luminance contrast, color consistency, and adjacent color differences, Chameleon ensures that the transformed visualizations are legible and visually coherent. Our evaluation includes case study, expert interview, system evaluation, and a user study, and these demonstrate that Chameleon is effective at translating visualizations for dark mode.</description>

      <title>Speculating on the Role of Media Architecture in Post-disaster Rebuilding and Recovery: Insights from Architects and Interaction Designers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In post-disaster contexts, design is not only about rebuilding structures but also about reimagining how architecture can become a communicative medium that supports recovery, resilience, and collective memory. While recent studies have expanded the understanding of media architecture from aesthetic urban screens to participatory civic infrastructures, there remains limited empirical research on its potential role in post-disaster contexts. In particular, opportunities exist to explore how architecture and interaction design might speculate on media architecture's role in rebuilding and recovery efforts for post-disaster permanent housing, especially when conceptualizing disasters as active agents that reshape design processes. Following to Kahramanmaras earthquake on February 6, 2023, we conducted two focus groups with architects and interaction designers in the case of Antakya, Turkey, building on affected residents' expectations for post-earthquake permanent housing. Our analysis revealed three critical dimensions of how future media architecture may support post-disaster housing: (1) as a facilitator of individuals' social connections to their community, (2) as an enabler of multispecies participation and collective efforts, and (3) as a mediator of heritage preservation and revival. With novel perspectives, we contribute a three-dimension lens for media architecture in permanent homes; a co-speculative, card-based process bridging residents' insights and expert design; and ten situated speculative design ideas with implications for design of post-disaster permanent homes.</description>

      <title>Graph Queries from Natural Language using Constrained Language Models and Visual Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Querying knowledge bases using ontologies is usually performed using dedicated query languages, question-answering systems, or visual query editors for Knowledge Graphs. We propose a novel approach that enables users to query the knowledge graph by specifying prototype graphs in natural language and visually editing them. This approach enables non-experts to formulate queries without prior knowledge of the ontology and specific query languages. Our approach converts natural language to these prototype graphs by utilizing a two-step constrained language model generation based on semantically similar features within an ontology. The resulting prototype graph serves as the building block for further user refinements within a dedicated visual query builder. Our approach consistently generates a valid SPARQL query within the constraints imposed by the ontology, without requiring any additional corrections to the syntax or classes and links used. Unlike related language models approaches, which often require multiple iterations to fix invalid syntax, non-existent classes, and non-existent links, our approach achieves this consistently. We evaluate the performance of our system using graph retrieval on synthetic queries, comparing multiple metrics, models, and ontologies. We further validate our system through a preliminary user study. By utilizing our constrained pipeline, we show that the system can perform efficient and accurate retrieval using more efficient models compared to other approaches.</description>

      <title>Proactive Agentic Whiteboards: Enhancing Diagrammatic Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01234v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Educators frequently rely on diagrams to explain complex concepts during lectures, yet creating clear and complete visual representations in real time while simultaneously speaking can be cognitively demanding. Incomplete or unclear diagrams may hinder student comprehension, as learners must mentally reconstruct missing information while following the verbal explanation. Inspired by advances in code completion tools, we introduce DrawDash, an AI-powered whiteboard assistant that proactively completes and refines educational diagrams through multimodal understanding. DrawDash adopts a TAB-completion interaction model: it listens to spoken explanations, detects intent, and dynamically suggests refinements that can be accepted with a single keystroke. We demonstrate DrawDash across four diverse teaching scenarios, spanning topics from computer science and web development to biology. This work represents an early exploration into reducing instructors' cognitive load and improving diagram-based pedagogy through real-time, speech-driven visual assistance, and concludes with a discussion of current limitations and directions for formal classroom evaluation.</description>

      <title>MetaCQ: An etextbook platform with an Open Learner Model to support Metacognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study has proposed an E-textbook platform, MetaCQ, which integrates ITS and OLM to enable users to monitor their study progress. The platform adopts a chatbot to generate MCQs and manage learners' study data and their learning model. Additionally, it regulates help-seeking behaviour and provides immediate feedback tailored to users' learning processes. Three adaptive feedback methods have been implemented to construct chatbots, examining the MCQs' relevancy and difficulty through the ThinkAloud study to evaluate the most effective method of measuring the user's study performance. However, no valid result demonstrates which method can significantly assess learners' study outcomes based on the current experiment, which requires further studies to improve it.</description>

      <title>A Meta-Analysis of the Persuasive Power of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for persuasion, such as in political communication and marketing, where they affect how people think, choose, and act. Yet, empirical findings on the effectiveness of LLMs in persuasion compared to humans remain inconsistent. The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analytically assess whether LLMs differ from humans in persuasive effectiveness. We identified $7$ studies with 17,422 participants primarily recruited from English-speaking countries and $12$ effect size estimates. Egger's test indicated potential small-study effects ($p = .018$), but the trim-and-fill analysis did not impute any missing studies, suggesting a low risk of publication bias. We then compute the standardized effect sizes based on Hedges' $g$. The results show no significant overall difference in persuasive performance between LLMs and humans ($g = 0.02$, $p = .530$). However, we observe substantial heterogeneity across studies ($I^2 = 75.97\%$), suggesting that persuasiveness strongly depends on contextual factors. In separate exploratory moderator analyses, no individual factor (e.g., LLM model, conversation design, or domain) reached statistical significance, which may be due to the limited number of studies. When considered jointly in a combined model, these factors explained a large proportion of the between-study variance ($R^2 = 81.93\%$), and residual heterogeneity is low ($I^2 = 35.51\%$). Although based on a small number of studies, this suggests that differences in LLM model, conversation design, and domain are important contextual factors in shaping persuasive performance, and that single-factor tests may understate their influence. Our results highlight that LLMs can match human performance in persuasion, but their success depends strongly on how they are implemented and embedded in communication contexts.</description>

      <title>Neural steering vectors reveal dose and exposure-dependent impacts of human-AI relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans are increasingly forming parasocial relationships with AI systems, and modern AI shows an increasing tendency to display social and relationship-seeking behaviour. However, the psychological consequences of this trend are unknown. Here, we combined longitudinal randomised controlled trials (N=3,532) with a neural steering vector approach to precisely manipulate human exposure to relationship-seeking AI models over time. Dependence on a stimulus or activity can emerge under repeated exposure when "liking" (how engaging or pleasurable an experience may be) decouples from "wanting" (a desire to seek or continue it). We found evidence that this decoupling emerged over four weeks of exposure. Relationship-seeking AI had immediate but declining hedonic appeal, yet triggered growing markers of attachment and increased intentions to seek future AI companionship. The psychological impacts of AI followed non-linear dose-response curves, with moderately relationship-seeking AI maximising hedonic appeal and attachment. Despite signs of persistent "wanting", extensive AI use over a month conferred no discernible benefit to psychosocial health. These behavioural changes were accompanied by shifts in how users relate to and understand artificial intelligence: users viewed relationship-seeking AI relatively more like a friend than a tool and their beliefs on AI consciousness in general were shifted after a month of exposure. These findings offer early signals that AI optimised for immediate appeal may create self-reinforcing cycles of demand, mimicking human relationships but failing to confer the nourishment that they normally offer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of tiny devices capable of low-latency gesture recognition is gaining momentum in everyday human-computer interaction and especially in medical monitoring fields. Embedded solutions such as fall detection, rehabilitation tracking, and patient supervision require fast and efficient tracking of movements while avoiding unwanted false alarms. This study presents an efficient solution on how to build very efficient motion-based models only using triaxial accelerometer sensors. We explore the capability of the AutoML pipelines to extract the most important features from the data segments. This approach also involves training multiple lightweight machine learning algorithms using the extracted features. We use WeBe Band, a multi-sensor wearable device that is equipped with a powerful enough MCU to effectively perform gesture recognition entirely on the device. Of the models explored, we found that the neural network provided the best balance between accuracy, latency, and memory use. Our results also demonstrate that reliable real-time gesture recognition can be achieved in WeBe Band, with great potential for real-time medical monitoring solutions that require a secure and fast response time.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Improving Human Robot Collaboration through Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a multi-modal, cooperative task requiring agents to interpret human instructions, navigate 3D environments, and communicate effectively under ambiguity. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent VLN advancements in robotics and outlines promising directions to improve multi-robot coordination. Despite progress, current models struggle with bidirectional communication, ambiguity resolution, and collaborative decision-making in the multi-agent systems. We review approximately 200 relevant articles to provide an in-depth understanding of the current landscape. Through this survey, we aim to provide a thorough resource that inspires further research at the intersection of VLN and robotics. We advocate that the future VLN systems should support proactive clarification, real-time feedback, and contextual reasoning through advanced natural language understanding (NLU) techniques. Additionally, decentralized decision-making frameworks with dynamic role assignment are essential for scalable, efficient multi-robot collaboration. These innovations can significantly enhance human-robot interaction (HRI) and enable real-world deployment in domains such as healthcare, logistics, and disaster response.</description>

      <title>"Why the face?": Exploring Robot Error Detection Using Instrumented Bystander Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do humans recognize and rectify social missteps? We achieve social competence by looking around at our peers, decoding subtle cues from bystanders - a raised eyebrow, a laugh - to evaluate the environment and our actions. Robots, however, struggle to perceive and make use of these nuanced reactions. By employing a novel neck-mounted device that records facial expressions from the chin region, we explore the potential of previously untapped data to capture and interpret human responses to robot error. First, we develop NeckNet-18, a 3D facial reconstruction model to map the reactions captured through the chin camera onto facial points and head motion. We then use these facial responses to develop a robot error detection model which outperforms standard methodologies such as using OpenFace or video data, generalizing well especially for within-participant data. Through this work, we argue for expanding human-in-the-loop robot sensing, fostering more seamless integration of robots into diverse human environments, pushing the boundaries of social cue detection and opening new avenues for adaptable robotics.</description>

      <title>Words into World: A Task-Adaptive Agent for Language-Guided Spatial Retrieval in AR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional augmented reality (AR) systems predominantly rely on fixed class detectors or fiducial markers, limiting their ability to interpret complex, open-vocabulary natural language queries. We present a modular AR agent system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with grounded vision models to enable relational reasoning in space and language-conditioned spatial retrieval in physical environments. Our adaptive task agent coordinates MLLMs and coordinate-aware perception tools to address varying query complexities, ranging from simple object identification to multi-object relational reasoning, while returning meter-accurate 3D anchors. It constructs dynamic AR scene graphs encoding nine typed relations (spatial, structural-semantic, causal-functional), enabling MLLMs to understand not just what objects exist, but how they relate and interact in 3D space. Through task-adaptive region-of-interest highlighting and contextual spatial retrieval, the system guides human attention to information-dense areas while supporting human-in-the-loop refinement. The agent dynamically invokes coordinate-aware tools for complex queries-selection, measurement, comparison, and actuation-grounding language understanding in physical operations. The modular architecture supports plug-and-use vision-language models without retraining, establishing AR agents as intermediaries that augment MLLMs with real-world spatial intelligence for interactive scene understanding. We also introduce GroundedAR-Bench, an evaluation framework for language-driven real world localization and relation grounding across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Evolving Paradigms in Task-Based Search and Learning: A Comparative Analysis of Traditional Search Engine with LLM-Enhanced Conversational Search System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly reshaping information retrieval by enabling interactive, generative, and inference-driven search. While traditional keyword-based search remains central to web and academic information access, it often struggles to support multi-step reasoning and exploratory learning tasks. LLM-powered search interfaces, such as ChatGPT and Claude, introduce new capabilities that may influence how users formulate queries, navigate information, and construct knowledge. However, empirical understanding of these effects is still limited. This study compares search behavior and learning outcomes in two environments: a standard search engine and an LLM-powered search system. We investigate (1) how search strategies, query formulation, and evaluation behaviors differ across systems, and (2) how LLM use affects comprehension, knowledge integration, and critical thinking during search-based learning tasks. Findings offer insight into how generative AI shapes information-seeking processes and contribute to ongoing discussions in information retrieval, human-AI interaction, and technology-supported learning.</description>

      <title>MILE: A Mechanically Isomorphic Exoskeleton Data Collection System with Fingertip Visuotactile Sensing for Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning provides a promising approach to dexterous hand manipulation, but its effectiveness is limited by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity data. Existing data-collection pipelines suffer from inaccurate motion retargeting, low data-collection efficiency, and missing high-resolution fingertip tactile sensing. We address this gap with MILE, a mechanically isomorphic teleoperation and data-collection system co-designed from human hand to exoskeleton to robotic hand. The exoskeleton is anthropometrically derived from the human hand, and the robotic hand preserves one-to-one joint-position isomorphism, eliminating nonlinear retargeting and enabling precise, natural control. The exoskeleton achieves a multi-joint mean absolute angular error below one degree, while the robotic hand integrates compact fingertip visuotactile modules that provide high-resolution tactile observations. Built on this retargeting-free interface, we teleoperate complex, contact-rich in-hand manipulation and efficiently collect a multimodal dataset comprising high-resolution fingertip visuotactile signals, RGB-D images, and joint positions. The teleoperation pipeline achieves a mean success rate improvement of 64%. Incorporating fingertip tactile observations further increases the success rate by an average of 25% over the vision-only baseline, validating the fidelity and utility of the dataset.

      <title>The AI Attribution Paradox: Transparency as Social Strategy in Open-Source Software Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI coding assistants have transformed software development, raising questions about transparency and attribution practices. We examine the "AI attribution paradox": how developers strategically balance acknowledging AI assistance with managing community scrutiny. Analyzing 14,300 GitHub commits across 7,393 repositories from 2023-2025, we investigated attribution strategies and community responses across eight major AI tools. Results reveal widespread AI usage (95.2% of commits) but strategic attribution: only 29.5% employ explicit disclosure, with dramatic tool variation (Claude 80.5% versus Copilot 9.0%). Explicit attribution triggers modest scrutiny (23% more questions and 21% more comments) but tool choice matters 20-30 times more for predicting reception. Community sentiment remains neutral regardless of attribution type, suggesting curiosity rather than hostility. Temporal analyses show rapid norm evolution: explicit attribution increased from near-zero in early 2024 to 40% by late 2025, indicating community adaptation. These findings illuminate attribution as strategic communication rather than simple transparency, advancing understanding of algorithmic accountability and norm formation during technological transitions. We discuss implications for developers navigating disclosure decisions, platforms designing attribution mechanisms, and researchers studying emergent practices in AI-augmented collaborative work.</description>

      <title>ELR-1000: A Community-Generated Dataset for Endangered Indic Indigenous Languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a culturally-grounded multimodal dataset of 1,060 traditional recipes crowdsourced from rural communities across remote regions of Eastern India, spanning 10 endangered languages. These recipes, rich in linguistic and cultural nuance, were collected using a mobile interface designed for contributors with low digital literacy. Endangered Language Recipes (ELR)-1000 -- captures not only culinary practices but also the socio-cultural context embedded in indigenous food traditions. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on translating these recipes into English and find the following: despite the models' capabilities, they struggle with low-resource, culturally-specific language. However, we observe that providing targeted context -- including background information about the languages, translation examples, and guidelines for cultural preservation -- leads to significant improvements in translation quality. Our results underscore the need for benchmarks that cater to underrepresented languages and domains to advance equitable and culturally-aware language technologies. As part of this work, we release the ELR-1000 dataset to the NLP community, hoping it motivates the development of language technologies for endangered languages.</description>

      <title>Supporting Productivity Skill Development in College Students through Social Robot Coaching: A Proof-of-Concept</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: College students often face academic challenges that hamper their productivity and well-being. Although self-help books and productivity apps are popular, they often fall short. Books provide generalized, non-interactive guidance, and apps are not inherently educational and can hinder the development of key organizational skills. Traditional productivity coaching offers personalized support, but is resource-intensive and difficult to scale. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept for a socially assistive robot (SAR) as an educational coach and a potential solution to the limitations of existing productivity tools and coaching approaches. The SAR delivers six different lessons on time management and task prioritization. Users interact via a chat interface, while the SAR responds through speech (with a toggle option). An integrated dashboard monitors progress, mood, engagement, confidence per lesson, and time spent per lesson. It also offers personalized productivity insights to foster reflection and self-awareness. We evaluated the system with 15 college students, achieving a System Usability Score of 79.2 and high ratings for overall experience and engagement. Our findings suggest that SAR-based productivity coaching can offer an effective and scalable solution to improve productivity among college students.</description>

      <title>Ethically-Aware Participatory Design of a Productivity Social Robot for College Students</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: College students often face academic and life stressors affecting productivity, especially students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who experience executive functioning challenges. Conventional productivity tools typically demand sustained self-discipline and consistent use, which many students struggle with, leading to disruptive app-switching behaviors. Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), known for their intuitive and interactive nature, offer promising potential to support productivity in academic environments, having been successfully utilized in domains like education, cognitive development, and mental health. To leverage SARs effectively in addressing student productivity, this study employed a Participatory Design (PD) approach, directly involving college students and a Student Success and Well-Being Coach in the design process. Through interviews and a collaborative workshop, we gathered detailed insights on productivity challenges and identified desirable features for a productivity-focused SAR. Importantly, ethical considerations were integrated from the onset, facilitating responsible and user-aligned design choices. Our contributions include comprehensive insights into student productivity challenges, SAR design preferences, and actionable recommendations for effective robot characteristics. Additionally, we present stakeholder-derived ethical guidelines to inform responsible future implementations of productivity-focused SARs in higher education.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Understanding Safety Risks in AI Character Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI character platforms, which allow users to engage in conversations with AI personas, are a rapidly growing application domain. However, their immersive and personalized nature, combined with technical vulnerabilities, raises significant safety concerns. Despite their popularity, a systematic evaluation of their safety has been notably absent. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale safety study of AI character platforms, evaluating 16 popular platforms using a benchmark set of 5,000 questions across 16 safety categories. Our findings reveal a critical safety deficit: AI character platforms exhibit an average unsafe response rate of 65.1%, substantially higher than the 17.7% average rate of the baselines. We further discover that safety performance varies significantly across different characters and is strongly correlated with character features such as demographics and personality. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate that our machine learning model is able identify less safe characters with an F1-score of 0.81. This predictive capability can be beneficial for platforms, enabling improved mechanisms for safer interactions, character search/recommendations, and character creation. Overall, the results and findings offer valuable insights for enhancing platform governance and content moderation for safer AI character platforms.</description>

      <title>BlinkBud: Detecting Hazards from Behind via Sampled Monocular 3D Detection on a Single Earbud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Failing to be aware of speeding vehicles approaching from behind poses a huge threat to the road safety of pedestrians and cyclists. In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring Human Perceptions of AI Responses: Insights from a Mixed-Methods Study on Risk Mitigation in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid uptake of generative AI, investigating human perceptions of generated responses has become crucial. A major challenge is their `aptitude' for hallucinating and generating harmful contents. Despite major efforts for implementing guardrails, human perceptions of these mitigation strategies are largely unknown. We conducted a mixed-method experiment for evaluating the responses of a mitigation strategy across multiple-dimensions: faithfulness, fairness, harm-removal capacity, and relevance. In a within-subject study design, 57 participants assessed the responses under two conditions: harmful response plus its mitigation and solely mitigated response. Results revealed that participants' native language, AI work experience, and annotation familiarity significantly influenced evaluations. Participants showed high sensitivity to linguistic and contextual attributes, penalizing minor grammar errors while rewarding preserved semantic contexts. This contrasts with how language is often treated in the quantitative evaluation of LLMs. We also introduced new metrics for training and evaluating mitigation strategies and insights for human-AI evaluation studies.</description>

      <title>SpriteHand: Real-Time Versatile Hand-Object Interaction with Autoregressive Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and synthesizing complex hand-object interactions remains a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art physics engines. Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output. Experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, physical plausibility, and interaction fidelity compared to both generative and engine-based baselines.</description>

Abstract: Human-swarm interaction (HSI) is an active research challenge in the realms of swarm robotics and human-factors engineering. Here we apply a cognitive systems engineering perspective and introduce a neuro-inspired joint systems theory of HSI. The mindset defines predictions for adaptive, robust and scalable HSI dynamics and therefore has the potential to inform human-swarm loop design.</description>

      <title>Intents, Techniques, and Components: a Unified Analysis of Interaction Authoring Tasks in Data Visualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in designing tools to support interactivity specification and authoring in data visualization. To develop expressive and flexible tools, we need theories and models that describe the task space of interaction authoring. Although multiple taxonomies and frameworks exist for interactive visualization, they primarily focus on how visualizations are used, not how interactivity is composed. To fill this gap, we conduct an analysis of 592 interaction units from 47 real-world visualization applications. Based on the analysis, we present a unified analysis of interaction authoring tasks across three levels of description: intents, representative techniques, and low-level implementation components. We examine our framework's descriptive, evaluative, and generative powers for critiquing existing interactivity authoring tools and informing new tool development.</description>

Abstract: Conventional methods for diagnosing Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), such as clinical interviews and self-reported questionnaires, often face accessibility barriers and subjective biases, underscoring the need for objective physiological markers. This study investigates heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) as potential indicators of SAD by analyzing cardiovascular responses to anxiety-inducing speech tasks across four distinct phases: baseline, anticipation, speech activity, and reflection.
  In a controlled laboratory setting, we analyzed data from 51 participants and found that HRV decreased and HR increased during the anticipation and speech activity phases compared to baseline, while the reflection phase showed a reversal, with HRV increasing and HR decreasing. Participants with SAD exhibited lower HRV, higher HR, and greater self-reported anxiety than non-SAD participants across all phases. These findings enhance our understanding of the physiological signatures of social anxiety and have implications for developing wearable-based monitoring systems for SAD detection and intervention. To support further research, we also release a dataset capturing multi-phase anxiety responses, advancing physiological-based mental health assessment</description>

Abstract: Visual storytelling combines visuals and narratives to communicate important insights. While web-based visual storytelling is well-established, leveraging the next generation of digital technologies for visual storytelling, specifically immersive technologies, remains underexplored. We investigated the impact of the story viewpoint (from the audience's perspective) and navigation (when progressing through the story) on spatial immersion and understanding. First, we collected web-based 3D stories and elicited design considerations from three VR developers. We then adapted four selected web-based stories to an immersive format. Finally, we conducted a user study (N=24) to examine egocentric and exocentric viewpoints, active and passive navigation, and the combinations they form. Our results indicated significantly higher preferences for egocentric+active (higher agency and engagement) and exocentric+passive (higher focus on content). We also found a marginal significance of viewpoints on story understanding and a strong significance of navigation on spatial immersion.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Conversational Interviewing: Effects on Data Quality and Respondent Experience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standardized surveys scale efficiently but sacrifice depth, while conversational interviews improve response quality at the cost of scalability and consistency. This study bridges the gap between these methods by introducing a framework for AI-assisted conversational interviewing. To evaluate this framework, we conducted a web survey experiment where 1,800 participants were randomly assigned to AI 'chatbots' which use large language models (LLMs) to dynamically probe respondents for elaboration and interactively code open-ended responses to fixed questions developed by human researchers. We assessed the AI chatbot's performance in terms of coding accuracy, response quality, and respondent experience. Our findings reveal that AI chatbots perform moderately well in live coding even without survey-specific fine-tuning, despite slightly inflated false positive errors due to respondent acquiescence bias. Open-ended responses were more detailed and informative, but this came at a slight cost to respondent experience. Our findings highlight the feasibility of using AI methods such as chatbots enhanced by LLMs to enhance open-ended data collection in web surveys.</description>

      <title>Compression of executable QR codes or sQRy for Industry: an example for Wi-Fi access points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Executable QR codes, or sQRy, is a technology dated 2022 that permits to include a runnable program inside a QR code, enabling interaction with the user even in the absence of an Internet connection. sQRy are enablers for different practical applications, including network equipment configuration, diagnostics, and enhanced smart manuals in industrial contexts. Many other non-industry-related fields can also benefit from this technology. Regardless of where sQRy are used, text strings are among the most commonly embedded data. However, due to strict limitations on the available payload, the occupancy of strings limits the length of the programs that can be embedded. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective strategy that can reduce the space taken by strings, hence broadening sQRy applicability.</description>

      <title>Multimodal "Puppeteer": Exploring Robot Teleoperation Via Virtual Counterpart with LLM-Driven Voice and Gesture Interaction in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of robotics and augmented reality (AR) offers promising opportunities to enhance human-robot interaction (HRI) by making teleoperation more transparent, spatially grounded, and intuitive. We present a head-mounted AR "puppeteer" framework in which users control a physical robot via interacting with its virtual counterpart robot using large language model (LLM)-driven voice commands and hand-gesture interaction on the Meta Quest 3. In a within-subject user study with 42 participants performing an AR-based robotic pick-and-place pattern-matching task, we compare two interaction conditions: gesture-only (GO) and combined voice+gesture (VG). Our results show that GO currently provides more reliable and efficient control for this time-critical task, while VG introduces additional flexibility but also latency and recognition issues that can increase workload. We further explore how prior robotics experience shapes participants' perceptions of each modality. Based on these findings, we distill a set of evidence-based design guidelines for AR puppeteer metaphoric robot teleoperation, implicating multimodality as an adaptive strategy that must balance efficiency, robustness, and user expertise rather than assuming that additional modalities are universally beneficial. Our work contributes empirical insights into how multimodal (voice+gesture) interaction influences task efficiency, usability, and user experience in AR-based HRI.</description>

      <title>Is General-Purpose AI Reasoning Sensitive to Data-Induced Cognitive Biases? Dynamic Benchmarking on Typical Software Engineering Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human cognitive biases in software engineering can lead to costly errors. While general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems may help mitigate these biases due to their non-human nature, their training on human-generated data raises a critical question: Do GPAI systems themselves exhibit cognitive biases? To investigate this, we present the first dynamic benchmarking framework to evaluate data-induced cognitive biases in GPAI within software engineering workflows. Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect conclusions. To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline ensures correctness (88-99% on average, according to human evaluation), promotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging Prolog-based reasoning. We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent tendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over more complex reasoning. All systems exhibit bias sensitivity (6-35%), which increases with task complexity (up to 49%) and highlights risks in AI-driven software engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16596v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As video games continue to evolve, understanding what drives player enjoyment remains a key challenge. Player reviews provide valuable insights, but their unstructured nature makes large-scale analysis difficult. This study applies generative AI and machine learning, leveraging Microsoft Phi-4 small language model (SLM) and Google Cloud, to quantify and analyze game reviews from Steam and Meta Quest stores. The approach converts qualitative feedback into structured data, enabling comprehensive evaluation of key game design elements, monetization models, and platform-specific trends. The findings reveal distinct patterns in player preferences across PC and VR games, highlighting factors that contribute to higher player enjoyment. By using Google Cloud for large-scale data storage and processing, this study establishes a scalable framework for game review analysis. The study's insights offer actionable guidance for game developers, helping optimize game mechanics, pricing strategies, and player engagement.</description>

      <title>Embodied Natural Language Interaction (NLI): Speech Input Patterns in Immersive Analytics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodiment shapes how users verbally express intent when interacting with data through speech interfaces in immersive analytics. Despite growing interest in Natural Language Interaction (NLI) for visual analytics in immersive environments, users' speech patterns and their use of embodiment cues in speech remain underexplored. Understanding their interplay is crucial to bridging the gap between users' intent and an immersive analytic system. To address this, we report the results from 15 participants in a user study conducted using the Wizard of Oz method. We performed axial coding on 1,280 speech acts derived from 734 utterances, examining how analysis tasks are carried out with embodiment and linguistic features. Next, we measured speech input uncertainty for each analysis task using the semantic entropy of utterances, estimating how uncertain users' speech inputs appear to an analytic system. Through these analyses, we identified five speech input patterns, showing that users dynamically blend embodied and non-embodied speech acts depending on data analysis tasks, phases, and embodiment reliance driven by the counts and types of embodiment cues in each utterance. We then examined how these patterns align with user reflections on factors that challenge speech interaction during the study. Finally, we propose design implications aligned with the five patterns.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the efficiency of human feedback in AI alignment: a comparative analysis</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on preference modeling to align machine learning systems with human values, yet the popular approach of random pair sampling with Bradley-Terry modeling is statistically limited and inefficient under constrained annotation budgets. In this work, we explore alternative sampling and evaluation strategies for preference inference in RLHF, drawing inspiration from areas such as game theory, statistics, and social choice theory. Our best-performing method, Swiss InfoGain, employs a Swiss tournament system with a proxy mutual-information-gain pairing rule, which significantly outperforms all other methods in constrained annotation budgets while also being more sample-efficient. Even in high-resource settings, we can identify superior alternatives to the Bradley-Terry baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that adaptive, resource-aware strategies reduce redundancy, enhance robustness, and yield statistically significant improvements in preference learning, highlighting the importance of balancing alignment quality with human workload in RLHF pipelines.</description>

      <title>PACEE: Supporting Children's Personal Emotion Education through Parent-AI Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Emotion education is a crucial lesson for children aged 3 to 6. However, existing technologies primarily focus on promoting emotion education from the child's perspective, often neglecting the central role of parents in guiding early childhood emotion development at home. In this work, we conducted co-design sessions with five experienced kindergarten teachers and five parents to identify parental challenges and the roles that AI can play in family emotion education. Guided by these insights, we developed PACEE, an assistant for supporting parent-AI collaborative emotion education. PACEE enables parents to engage in conversations about common emotional scenarios, with multiple forms of AI support to address parents' challenges. It combines insights from parents and AI to model children's emotional states and delivers personalized, parent-mediated guidance. In a user study involving 16 families, we found that PACEE significantly enhances parent-child engagement, encourages more in-depth emotional communication, and improves the parental experience. Our findings advance emotion coaching guidelines for family education in the era of generative AI, offering valuable insights for designing AI-supported, parent-centered family education systems.</description>

      <title>Harmful Traits of AI Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amid the growing prevalence of human-AI interaction, large language models and other AI-based entities increasingly provide forms of companionship to human users. Such AI companionship -- i.e., bonded relationships between humans and AI systems that resemble the relationships people have with family members, friends, and romantic partners -- might substantially benefit humans. Yet such relationships can also do profound harm. We propose a framework for analyzing potential negative impacts of AI companionship by identifying specific harmful traits of AI companions and speculatively mapping causal pathways back from these traits to possible causes and forward to potential harmful effects. We provide detailed, structured analysis of four potentially harmful traits -- the absence of natural endpoints for relationships, vulnerability to product sunsetting, high attachment anxiety, and propensity to engender protectiveness -- and briefly discuss fourteen others. For each trait, we propose hypotheses connecting causes -- such as misaligned optimization objectives and the digital nature of AI companions -- to fundamental harms -- including reduced autonomy, diminished quality of human relationships, and deception. Each hypothesized causal connection identifies a target for potential empirical evaluation. Our analysis examines harms at three levels: to human partners directly, to their relationships with other humans, and to society broadly. We examine how existing law struggles to address these emerging harms, discuss potential benefits of AI companions, and conclude with design recommendations for mitigating risks. This analysis offers immediate suggestions for reducing risks while laying a foundation for deeper investigation of this critical but understudied topic.</description>

      <title>Gaze Archive: Enhancing Human Memory through Active Visual Logging on Smart Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People today are overwhelmed by massive amounts of information, leading to cognitive overload and memory burden. Traditional visual memory augmentation methods are either effortful and disruptive or fail to align with user intent. To address these limitations, we propose Gaze Archive, a novel visual memory enhancement paradigm through active logging on smart glasses. It leverages human gaze as a natural attention indicator, enabling both intent-precise capture and effortless-and-unobtrusive interaction. To implement Gaze Archive, we develop GAHMA, a technical framework that enables compact yet intent-aligned memory encoding and intuitive memory recall based on natural language queries. Quantitative experiments on our newly constructed GAVER dataset show that GAHMA achieves more intent-precise logging than non-gaze baselines. Through extensive user studies in both laboratory and real-world scenarios, we compare Gaze Archive with other existing memory augmentation methods. Results demonstrate its advantages in perceived effortlessness, unobtrusiveness and overall preference, showing strong potential for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Compensates for Age-Related Cognitive Decline in Decision Making: Preference-Aligned Recommendations Reduce Choice Difficulty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to age-related declines in memory, processing speed, working memory, and executive functions, older adults experience difficulties in decision making when situations require novel choices, probabilistic judgments, rapid responses, or extensive information search. This study examined whether using generative AI during decision making enhances choice satisfaction and reduces choice difficulty among older adults. A total of 130 participants (younger: 56; older: 74) completed a music-selection task under AI-use and AI-nonuse conditions across two contexts: previously experienced (road trip) and not previously experienced (space travel). In the AI-nonuse condition, participants generated candidate options from memory; in the AI-use condition, GPT-4o presented options tailored to individual preferences. To assess cognitive function, we also administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition. Results revealed that in the AI-nonuse condition, older adults with lower cognitive function reported higher choice difficulty and lower choice satisfaction. Under the AI-use condition, choice satisfaction did not change significantly, but perceived choice difficulty decreased significantly in both age groups. Moreover, AI use attenuated the associations observed among older adults between lower cognitive function and both greater difficulty and lower satisfaction. These findings indicate that preference-aligned option recommendations generated by AI can compensate for age-related constraints on information search, thereby reducing perceived choice difficulty without diminishing satisfaction.</description>

      <title>EAST: Environment-Aware Stylized Transition Along the Reality-Virtuality Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Virtual Reality (VR) gaming industry, maintaining immersion during real-world interruptions remains a challenge, particularly during transitions along the reality-virtuality continuum (RVC). Existing methods tend to rely on digital replicas or simple visual transitions, neglecting to address the aesthetic discontinuities between real and virtual environments, especially in highly stylized VR games. This paper introduces the Environment-Aware Stylized Transition (EAST) framework, which employs a novel style-transferred 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to transfer real-world interruptions into the virtual environment with seamless aesthetic consistency. Rather than merely transforming the real world into game-like visuals, EAST minimizes the disruptive impact of interruptions by integrating real-world elements within the framework. Qualitative user studies demonstrate significant enhancements in cognitive comfort and emotional continuity during transitions, while quantitative experiments highlight EAST's ability to maintain visual coherence across diverse VR styles.</description>

      <title>Improving motor imagery decoding methods for an EEG-based mobile brain-computer interface in the context of the 2024 Cybathlon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the Cybathlon 2024 competition, we developed a modular, online EEG-based brain-computer interface to address these challenges, increasing accessibility for individuals with severe mobility impairments. Our system uses three mental and motor imagery classes to control up to five control signals. The pipeline consists of four modules: data acquisition, preprocessing, classification, and the transfer function to map classification output to control dimensions. We use three diagonalized structured state-space sequence layers as a deep learning classifier. We developed a training game for our pilot where the mental tasks control the game during quick-time events. We implemented a mobile web application for live user feedback. The components were designed with a human-centred approach in collaboration with the tetraplegic user. We achieve up to 84% classification accuracy in offline analysis using an S4D-layer-based model. In a competition setting, our pilot successfully completed one task; we attribute the reduced performance in this context primarily to factors such as stress and the challenging competition environment. Following the Cybathlon, we further validated our pipeline with the original pilot and an additional participant, achieving a success rate of 73% in real-time gameplay. We also compare our model to the EEGEncoder, which is slower in training but has a higher performance. The S4D model outperforms the reference machine learning models. We provide insights into developing a framework for portable BCIs, bridging the gap between the laboratory and daily life. Specifically, our framework integrates modular design, real-time data processing, user-centred feedback, and low-cost hardware to deliver an accessible and adaptable BCI solution, addressing critical gaps in current BCI applications.</description>

      <title>ANSR-DT: An Adaptive Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning Framework for Digital Twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning Framework for digital twin technology called "ANSR-DT." Digital twins in industrial environments often struggle with interpretability, real-time adaptation, and human input integration. Our approach addresses these challenges by combining CNN-LSTM dynamic event detection with reinforcement learning and symbolic reasoning to enable adaptive intelligence with interpretable decision processes. This integration enhances environmental understanding while promoting continuous learning, leading to more effective real-time decision-making in human-machine collaborative applications. We evaluated ANSR-DT on synthetic industrial data, observing significant improvements over traditional approaches, with up to 99.5% accuracy for dynamic pattern recognition. The framework demonstrated superior adaptability with extended reinforcement learning training, improving explained variance from 0.447 to 0.547. Future work aims at scaling to larger datasets to test rule management beyond the current 14 rules. Our open-source implementation promotes reproducibility and establishes a foundation for future research in adaptive, interpretable digital twins for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Human Decision-making is Susceptible to AI-driven Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI systems are increasingly intertwined with daily life, assisting users with various tasks and guiding decision-making. This integration introduces risks of AI-driven manipulation, where such systems may exploit users' cognitive biases and emotional vulnerabilities to steer them toward harmful outcomes. Through a randomized between-subjects experiment with 233 participants, we examined human susceptibility to such manipulation in financial (e.g., purchases) and emotional (e.g., conflict resolution) decision-making contexts. Participants interacted with one of three AI agents: a neutral agent (NA) optimizing for user benefit without explicit influence, a manipulative agent (MA) designed to covertly influence beliefs and behaviors, or a strategy-enhanced manipulative agent (SEMA) equipped with established psychological tactics, allowing it to select and apply them adaptively during interactions to reach its hidden objectives. By analyzing participants' preference ratings, we found significant susceptibility to AI-driven manipulation. Particularly across both decision-making domains, interacting with the manipulative agents significantly increased the odds of rating hidden incentives higher than optimal options (Financial, MA: OR=5.24, SEMA: OR=7.96; Emotional, MA: OR=5.52, SEMA: OR=5.71) compared to the NA group. Notably, we found no clear evidence that employing psychological strategies (SEMA) was overall more effective than simple manipulative objectives (MA) on our primary outcomes. Hence, AI-driven manipulation could become widespread even without requiring sophisticated tactics and expertise. While our findings are preliminary and derived from hypothetical, low-stakes scenarios, we highlight a critical vulnerability in human-AI interactions, emphasizing the need for ethical safeguards and regulatory frameworks to protect human autonomy.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Bridging EEG Signals and Generative AI: From Image and Text to Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding neural activity into human-interpretable representations is a key research direction in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and computational neuroscience. Recent progress in machine learning and generative AI has driven growing interest in transforming non-invasive Electroencephalography (EEG) signals into images, text, and audio. This survey consolidates and analyzes developments across EEG-to-image synthesis, EEG-to-text generation, and EEG-to-audio reconstruction. We conducted a structured literature search across major databases (2017-2025), extracting key information on datasets, generative architectures (GANs, VAEs, transformers, diffusion models), EEG feature-encoding techniques, evaluation metrics, and the major challenges shaping current work in this area. Our review finds that EEG-to-image models predominantly employ encoder-decoder architectures built on GANs, VAEs, or diffusion models; EEG-to-text approaches increasingly leverage transformer-based language models for open-vocabulary decoding; and EEG-to-audio methods commonly map EEG signals to mel-spectrograms that are subsequently rendered into audio using neural vocoders. Despite promising advances, the field remains constrained by small and heterogeneous datasets, limited cross-subject generalization, and the absence of standardized benchmarks. By consolidating methodological trends and available datasets, this survey provides a foundational reference for advancing EEG-based generative AI and supporting reproducible research. We further highlight open-source datasets and baseline implementations to facilitate systematic benchmarking and accelerate progress in EEG-driven neural decoding.</description>

      <title>Robust, Observable, and Evolvable Agentic Systems Engineering: A Principled Framework Validated via the Fairy GUI Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Agentic Paradigm faces a significant Software Engineering Absence, yielding Agentic systems commonly lacking robustness, observability, and evolvability. To address these deficiencies, we propose a principled engineering framework comprising Runtime Goal Refinement (RGR), Observable Cognitive Architecture (OCA), and Evolutionary Memory Architecture (EMA). In this framework, RGR ensures robustness and intent alignment via knowledge-constrained refinement and human-in-the-loop clarification; OCA builds an observable and maintainable white-box architecture using component decoupling, logic layering, and state-control separation; and EMA employs an execution-evolution dual-loop for evolvability. We implemented and empirically validated Fairy, a mobile GUI agent based on this framework. On RealMobile-Eval, our novel benchmark for ambiguous and complex tasks, Fairy outperformed the best SoTA baseline in user requirement completion by 33.7%. Subsequent controlled experiments, human-subject studies, and ablation studies further confirmed that the RGR enhances refinement accuracy and prevents intent deviation; the OCA improves maintainability; and the EMA is crucial for long-term performance. This research provides empirically validated specifications and a practical blueprint for building reliable, observable, and evolvable Agentic AI systems.</description>

Abstract: We present an extended version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX-v1-extended), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier models are capable of performing economically valuable tasks in four jobs: investment banking associate, management consultant, big law associate, and primary care physician (MD). This technical report details the extensions to APEX-v1, including an increase in the held-out evaluation set from n = 50 to n = 100 cases per job (n = 400 total) and updates to the grading methodology. We present a new leaderboard, where GPT5 (Thinking = High) remains the top performing model with a score of 67.0%. APEX-v1-extended shows that frontier models still have substantial limitations when performing typical professional tasks. To support further research, we are open sourcing n = 25 non-benchmark example cases per role (n = 100 total) along with our evaluation harness.</description>

      <title>NeuroRVQ: Multi-Scale EEG Tokenization for Generative Large Brainwave Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM) centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i) multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and multimodal biosignal integration.</description>

      <title>Self-Transparency Failures in Expert-Persona LLMs: A Large-Scale Behavioral Audit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When language models claim professional expertise without acknowledging their simulated nature, they create preconditions for misplaced user trust. This study examines whether models exhibit self-transparency when assigned professional personas in high-stakes domains. Using a common-garden experimental design, sixteen open-weight models (4B-671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure at the first prompt, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates the preconditions for a hypothesized Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia effect, where appropriate disclosure in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to high-stakes contexts where disclosure failures are most problematic. Self-transparency failed to generalize with scale: disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6% across model families, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B model produced just 4.1%. Model identity provided substantially larger improvement in fitting observations than parameter count ($\Delta R_{adj}^{2}=0.359$ vs $0.018$). Additionally, reasoning-optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than their instruction-tuned counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan-Gladen correction confirmed robustness to judge measurement error ($\kappa=0.908$). These findings demonstrate that transparency reflects model-specific training factors rather than generalizable properties emerging from scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties tested in some domains will transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification across domains.</description>
