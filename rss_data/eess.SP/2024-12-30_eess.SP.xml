      <title>Experimental Study of RCS Diversity with Novel No-divergent OAM Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel approach utilizing Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) beams to enhance Radar Cross Section (RCS) diversity for target detection in future transportation systems. Unlike conventional OAM beams with hollow-shaped divergence patterns, the new proposed OAM beams provide uniform illumination across the target without a central energy void, but keep the inherent phase gradient of vortex property. We utilize waveguide slot antennas to generate four different modes of these novel OAM beams at X-band frequency. Furthermore, these different mode OAM beams are used to illuminate metal models, and the resulting RCS is compared with that obtained using plane waves. The findings reveal that the novel OAM beams produce significant azimuthal RCS diversity, providing a new approach for the detection of weak and small targets.This study not only reveals the RCS diversity phenomenon based on novel OAM beams of different modes but also addresses the issue of energy divergence that hinders traditional OAM beams in long-range detection applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Compatible Semantic Communication: A Perspective on Digital Coding and Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SC) is emerging as a pivotal innovation within the 6G framework, aimed at enabling more intelligent transmission. This development has led to numerous studies focused on designing advanced systems through powerful deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, many of these approaches envision an analog transmission manner by formulating the transmitted signals as continuous-valued semantic representation vectors, limiting their compatibility with existing digital systems. To enhance compatibility, it is essential to explore digitized SC systems. This article systematically identifies two promising paradigms for designing digital SC: probabilistic and deterministic approaches, according to the modulation strategies. For both, we first provide a comprehensive analysis of the methodologies. Then, we put forward the principles of designing digital SC systems with a specific focus on informativeness and robustness of semantic representations to enhance performance, along with constellation design. Additionally, we present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods. Moreover, this article also explores the intrinsic advantages and opportunities provided by digital SC systems, and then outlines several potential research directions for future investigation.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Aerial Non-Terrestrial Networks: An Intelligent Synergy with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted aerial non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) offer a promising paradigm for enhancing wireless communications in the era of 6G and beyond. By integrating RIS with aerial platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high-altitude platforms (HAPs), these networks can intelligently control signal propagation, extending coverage, improving capacity, and enhancing link reliability. This article explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as a powerful tool for optimizing RIS-assisted aerial NTNs. We focus on hybrid proximal policy optimization (H-PPO), a robust DRL algorithm well-suited for handling the complex, hybrid action spaces inherent in these networks. Through a case study of an aerial RIS (ARIS)-aided coordinated multi-point non-orthogonal multiple access (CoMP-NOMA) network, we demonstrate how H-PPO can effectively optimize the system and maximize the sum rate while adhering to system constraints. Finally, we discuss key challenges and promising research directions for DRL-powered RIS-assisted aerial NTNs, highlighting their potential to transform next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Traffic-Aware Base Station Sleep Mode and Cell Zooming Strategy in RIS-Aided Multi-Cell Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in wireless technology have significantly increased the number of wireless connections, leading to higher energy consumption in networks. Among these, base stations (BSs) in radio access networks (RANs) account for over half of the total energy usage. To address this, we propose a multi-cell sleep strategy combined with adaptive cell zooming, user association, and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to minimize BS energy consumption. This approach allows BSs to enter sleep during low traffic, while adaptive cell zooming and user association dynamically adjust coverage to balance traffic load and enhance data rates through RIS, minimizing the number of active BSs. However, it is important to note that the proposed method may achieve energy-savings at the cost of increased delay, requiring a trade-off between these two factors. Moreover, minimizing BS energy consumption under the delay constraint is a complicated non-convex problem. To address this issue, we model the RIS-aided multi-cell network as a Markov decision process (MDP) and use the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to optimize sleep mode (SM), cell zooming, and user association. Besides, we utilize a double cascade correlation network (DCCN) algorithm to optimize the RIS reflection coefficients. Simulation results demonstrate that PPO balances energy-savings and delay, while DCCN-optimized RIS enhances BS energy-savings. Compared to systems optimised by the benchmark DQN algorithm, energy consumption is reduced by 49.61%</description>

      <title>Unifying Tree-Reweighted Belief Propagation and Mean Field for Tracking Extended Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a unified tree-reweighted belief propagation (BP) and mean field (MF) approach for scalable detection and tracking of extended targets within the framework of factor graph. The factor graph is partitioned into a BP region and an MF region so that the messages in each region are updated according to the corresponding region rules. The BP region exploits the tree-reweighted BP, which offers improved convergence than the standard BP for graphs with massive cycles, to resolve data association. The MF region approximates the posterior densities of the measurement rate, kinematic state and extent. For linear Gaussian target models and gamma Gaussian inverse Wishart distributed state density, the unified approach provides a closed-form recursion for the state density. Hence, the proposed algorithm is more efficient than particle-based BP algorithms for extended target tracking. This method also avoids measurement clustering and gating since it solves the data association problem in a probabilistic fashion. We compare the proposed approach with algorithms such as the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filter and the BP-based Poisson multi-Bernoulli filter. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves enhanced tracking performance.</description>

      <title>Movable Intelligent Surface (MIS) for Wireless Communications: Architecture, Modeling, Algorithm, and Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces enhance wireless systems by reshaping propagation environments. However, dynamic metasurfaces (MSs) with numerous phase-shift elements incur undesired control and hardware costs. In contrast, static MSs (SMSs), configured with static phase shifts pre-designed for specific communication demands, offer a cost-effective alternative by eliminating element-wise tuning. Nevertheless, SMSs typically support a single beam pattern with limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel Movable Intelligent Surface (MIS) technology that enables dynamic beamforming while maintaining static phase shifts. Specifically, we design a MIS architecture comprising two closely stacked transmissive MSs: a larger fixed-position MS 1 and a smaller movable MS 2. By differentially shifting MS 2's position relative to MS 1, the MIS synthesizes distinct beam patterns. Then, we model the interaction between MS 2 and MS 1 using binary selection matrices and padding vectors and formulate a new optimization problem that jointly designs the MIS phase shifts and selects shifting positions for worst-case signal-to-noise ratio maximization. This position selection, equal to beam pattern scheduling, offers a new degree of freedom for RIS-aided systems. To solve the intractable problem, we develop an efficient algorithm that handles unit-modulus and binary constraints and employs manifold optimization methods. Finally, extensive validation results are provided. We implement a MIS prototype and perform proof-of-concept experiments, demonstrating the MIS's ability to synthesize desired beam patterns that achieve one-dimensional beam steering. Numerical results show that by introducing MS 2 with a few elements, MIS effectively offers beamforming flexibility for significantly improved performance. We also draw insights into the optimal MIS configuration and element allocation strategy.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Terahertz Antenna Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promising way to provide sufficient transmission capacity is by accessing transmission bands at higher carrier frequencies. This desire for higher carrier frequency or more bandwidth led the researchers to take advantage of the terahertz (THz) spectrum. The opportunity for large bandwidth in the THz band leads to the possibility of easy, high data rate transmission. In spite of the advantages, the THz band suffers from large free space path loss. In the development of THz communication systems, the antenna is the most significant component. The focus is especially on designing highly directive antennas because they enhance the performance of the overall system by compensating for the large path loss at THz and thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio. This chapter presents different types of THz antennas, including planar, reflectarray, horn antenna, and lens antenna. Emphasis has been made to present the latest trend of designing THz antennas using carbon-based materials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes. The performance of these antennas has been compared with that of traditional copper-based THz antennas by critically analyzing their properties. A brief discussion on THz power sources is included in this chapter for completeness. A comprehensive discussion on different fabrication techniques has been provided to appraise the reader of the general fabrication processes of THz components.</description>

      <title>Interference-Robust Broadband Rapidly-Varying MIMO Communications: A Knowledge-Data Dual Driven Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel time-efficient framework is proposed for improving the robustness of a broadband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system against unknown interference under rapidly-varying channels. A mean-squared error (MSE) minimization problem is formulated by optimizing the beamformers employed. Since the unknown interference statistics are the premise for solving the formulated problem, an interference statistics tracking (IST) module is first designed. The IST module exploits both the time- and spatial-domain correlations of the interference-plus-noise (IPN) covariance for the future predictions with data training. Compared to the conventional signal-free space sampling approach, the IST module can realize zero-pilot and low-latency estimation. Subsequently, an interference-resistant hybrid beamforming (IR-HBF) module is presented, which incorporates both the prior knowledge of the theoretical optimization method as well as the data-fed training. Taking advantage of the interpretable network structure, the IR-HBF module enables the simplified mapping from the interference statistics to the beamforming weights. The simulations are executed in high-mobility scenarios, where the numerical results unveil that: 1) the proposed IST module attains promising prediction accuracy compared to the conventional counterparts under different snapshot sampling errors; and 2) the proposed IR-HBF module achieves lower MSE with significantly reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Dynamic Sparsity for Near-Field Spatial Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers a spatial non-stationary channel tracking problem in broadband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. In the case of spatial non-stationary, each scatterer has a certain visibility region (VR) over antennas and power change may occur among visible antennas. Concentrating on the temporal correlation of XL-MIMO channels, we design a three-layer Markov prior model and hierarchical two-dimensional (2D) Markov model to exploit the dynamic sparsity of sparse channel vectors and VRs, respectively. Then, we formulate the channel tracking problem as a bilinear measurement process, and a novel dynamic alternating maximum a posteriori (DA-MAP) framework is developed to solve the problem. The DA-MAP contains four basic modules: channel estimation module, VR detection module, grid update module, and temporal correlated module. Specifically, the first module is an inverse-free variational Bayesian inference (IF-VBI) estimator that avoids computational intensive matrix inverse each iteration; the second module is a turbo compressive sensing (Turbo-CS) algorithm that only needs small-scale matrix operations in a parallel fashion; the third module refines the polar-delay domain grid; and the fourth module can process the temporal prior information to ensure high-efficiency channel tracking. Simulations show that the proposed method can achieve a significant channel tracking performance while achieving low computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Real-time Reflectance Generation for UAV Multispectral Imagery using an Onboard Downwelling Spectrometer in Varied Weather Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing with spectral imaging enable efficient assessment of critical agronomic traits. However, existing reflectance calibration or generation methods suffer from limited prediction accuracy and practical flexibility. This study explores reliable and cost-efficient methods for the accurate conversion of digital number values acquired from a multispectral imager into reflectance, leveraging real-time solar spectra as references. To ensure consistent measurements of incident light, an upward gimbal-mounted downwelling spectrometer was attached to the UAV, and a sinusoidal model was developed to correct for solar position variability. Using principal component analysis on the reference solar spectrum for band selection, a multiple linear regression model with four sensitive bands (4-Band MLR) and a 30 nm bandwidth achieved performance comparable to the direct correction method. The root mean square error (RMSE) for reflectance prediction improved by 86.1% compared to the empirical line method under fluctuating cloudy conditions and by 59.6% compared to the downwelling light sensor method averaged across different weather conditions. The RMSE was calculated as 2.24% in a ground-based diurnal validation, and 2.03% in a UAV campaign conducted at various times throughout a sunny day. Implementing the 4-Band MLR model enhanced the consistency of canopy reflectance within a homogeneous vegetation area by 95.0% during spectral imaging in a large rice field under significant cloud fluctuations. Additionally, improvements of 86.0% and 90.3% were noted for two vegetation indices: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; a ratio index) and the difference vegetation index (DVI; a non-ratio index), respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel movable antenna (MA)-aided secure transmission framework is proposed to enhance the secrecy transmission rate without relying on the eavesdropper's channel state information. Within this framework, a joint beamforming and jamming scheme is proposed, where the power of the confidential signal is minimized by optimizing the positions of the MAs, and the residual power is used to jam the eavesdropper. An efficient gradient-based method is employed to solve this non-convex problem. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the MA-based framework over systems using traditional fixed-position antennas in secure transmission.</description>

      <title>Multi-population Differential Evolution for RSS based Cooperative Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks with Limited Communication Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to deal with the cooperative localization problem in wireless sensor networks based on received signal strength measurements. In cooperative scenarios, the cost function of the localization problem becomes increasingly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the heightened interaction between sensor nodes, making the estimation of the positions of the target nodes more challenging. Although most of existing cooperative localization algorithms assure acceptable localization accuracy, their computational complexity increases dramatically, which may restrict their applicability. To reduce the computational complexity and provide competitive localization accuracy at the same time, we propose a localization algorithm based on the differential evolution with multiple populations, opposite-based learning, redirection, and anchoring. In this work, the cooperative localization cost function is split into several simpler cost functions, each of which accounts only for one individual target node. Then, each cost function is solved by a dedicated population of the proposed algorithm. In addition, an enhanced version of the proposed algorithm which incorporates the population midpoint scheme for further improvement in the localization accuracy is devised. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms provide comparative localization accuracy with much lower computational complexity compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted MIMO CV-QKD at THz Frequencies: Channel Estimation and SKR Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system incorporating a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to efficiently operate at terahertz (THz) frequencies is considered. The transmitter, Alice, employs continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) to communicate secret keys to the receiver, Bob, which utilizes either homodyne or heterodyne detection. The latter node applies the least-squared approach to estimate the effective MIMO channel gain matrix prior to receiving the secret key, and this estimation is made available to Alice via an error-free feedback channel. An eavesdropper, Eve, is assumed to employ a collective Gaussian entanglement attack on the feedback channel to avail the estimated channel state information. We present a novel closed-form expression for the secret key rate (SKR) performance of the proposed RIS-assisted THz CV-QKD system. The effect of various system parameters, such as the number of RIS elements and their phase configurations, the channel estimation error, and the detector noise, on the SKR performance are studied via numerical evaluation of the derived formula. It is demonstrated that the RIS contributes to larger SKR for larger link distances, and that heterodyne detection is preferable over homodyne at lower pilot symbol powers.</description>

Abstract: Computational music research plays a critical role in advancing music production, distribution, and understanding across various musical styles worldwide. Despite the immense cultural and religious significance, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (EOTC) chants are relatively underrepresented in computational music research. This paper contributes to this field by introducing a new dataset specifically tailored for analyzing EOTC chants, also known as Yaredawi Zema. This work provides a comprehensive overview of a 10-hour dataset, 369 instances, creation, and curation process, including rigorous quality assurance measures. Our dataset has a detailed word-level temporal boundary and reading tone annotation along with the corresponding chanting mode label of audios. Moreover, we have also identified the chanting options associated with multiple chanting notations in the manuscript by annotating them accordingly. Our goal in making this dataset available to the public 1 is to encourage more research and study of EOTC chants, including lyrics transcription, lyric-to-audio alignment, and music generation tasks. Such research work will advance knowledge and efforts to preserve this distinctive liturgical music, a priceless cultural artifact for the Ethiopian people.</description>

      <title>Computational Analysis of Yaredawi YeZema Silt in Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Chants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its musicological, cultural, and religious significance, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (EOTC) chant is relatively underrepresented in music research. Historical records, including manuscripts, research papers, and oral traditions, confirm Saint Yared's establishment of three canonical EOTC chanting modes during the 6th century. This paper attempts to investigate the EOTC chants using music information retrieval (MIR) techniques. Among the research questions regarding the analysis and understanding of EOTC chants, Yaredawi YeZema Silt, namely the mode of chanting adhering to Saint Yared's standards, is of primary importance. Therefore, we consider the task of Yaredawi YeZema Silt classification in EOTC chants by introducing a new dataset and showcasing a series of classification experiments for this task. Results show that using the distribution of stabilized pitch contours as the feature representation on a simple neural network-based classifier becomes an effective solution. The musicological implications and insights of such results are further discussed through a comparative study with the previous ethnomusicology literature on EOTC chants. By making this dataset publicly accessible, we aim to promote future exploration and analysis of EOTC chants and highlight potential directions for further research, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and preservation of this unique spiritual and cultural heritage.</description>

      <title>A Tractable Approach for Queueing Analysis on Buffer-Aware Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency communication has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its potential of enabling delay-sensitive services in next-generation industrial cyber-physical systems. To achieve target average or maximum delay given random arrivals and time-varying channels, buffer-aware scheduling is expected to play a vital role. Evaluating and optimizing buffer-aware scheduling relies on its queueing analysis, while existing tools are not sufficiently tractable. Particularly, Markov chain and Monte-Carlo based approaches are computationally intensive, while large deviation theory (LDT) and extreme value theory (EVT) fail in providing satisfactory accuracy in the small-queue-length (SQL) regime. To tackle these challenges, a tractable yet accurate queueing analysis is presented by judiciously bridging Markovian analysis for the computationally manageable SQL regime and LDT/EVT for large-queue-length (LQL) regime where approximation error diminishes asymptotically. Specifically, we leverage censored Markov chain augmentation to approximate the original one in the SQL regime, while a piecewise approach is conceived to apply LDT/EVT across various queue-length intervals with different scheduling parameters. Furthermore, we derive closed-form bounds on approximation errors, validating the rigor and accuracy of our approach. As a case study, the approach is applied to analytically analyze a Lyapunov-drift-based cross-layer scheduling for wireless transmissions. Numerical results demonstrate its potential in balancing accuracy and complexity.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communication with Flexible Reflector: Joint Placement and Rotation Optimization for Coverage Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive metal reflectors for communication enhancement have appealing advantages such as ultra low cost, zero energy expenditure, maintenance-free operation, long life span, and full compatibility with legacy wireless systems. To unleash the full potential of passive reflectors for wireless communications, this paper proposes a new passive reflector architecture, termed flexible reflector (FR), for enabling the flexible adjustment of beamforming direction via the FR placement and rotation optimization. We consider the multi-FR aided area coverage enhancement and aim to maximize the minimum expected receive power over all locations within the target coverage area, by jointly optimizing the placement positions and rotation angles of multiple FRs. To gain useful insights, the special case of movable reflector (MR) with fixed rotation is first studied to maximize the expected receive power at a target location, where the optimal single-MR placement positions for electrically large and small reflectors are derived in closed-form, respectively. It is shown that the reflector should be placed at the specular reflection point for electrically large reflector. While for area coverage enhancement, the optimal placement is obtained for the single-MR case and a sequential placement algorithm is proposed for the multi-MR case. Moreover, for the general case of FR, joint placement and rotation design is considered for the single-/multi-FR aided coverage enhancement, respectively. Numerical results are presented which demonstrate significant performance gains of FRs over various benchmark schemes under different practical setups in terms of receive power enhancement.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Omni-Surface Configurations in MU-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent omni-surface (IOS) is a promising technique to enhance the capacity of wireless networks, by reflecting and refracting the incident signal simultaneously. Traditional IOS configuration schemes, relying on all sub-channels' channel state information and user equipments' mobility, are difficult to implement in complex realistic systems. Existing works attempt to address this issue employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL), but this method requires a lot of trial-and-error interactions with the external environment for efficient results and thus cannot satisfy the real-time decision-making. To enable model-free and real-time IOS control, this paper puts forth a new framework that integrates DRL and digital twins. DeepIOS, a DRL based IOS configuration scheme with the goal of maximizing the sum data rate, is first developed to jointly optimize the phase-shift and amplitude of IOS in multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output systems. Thereafter, to further reduce the computational complexity, DeepIOS introduces an action branch architecture, which separately decides two optimization variables in parallel. Finally, a digital twin module is constructed through supervised learning as a pre-verification platform for DeepIOS, such that the decision-making's real-time can be guaranteed. The formulated framework is a closed-loop system, in which the physical space provides data to establish and calibrate the digital space, while the digital space generates experience samples for DeepIOS training and sends the trained parameters to the IOS controller for configurations. Numerical results show that compared with random and MAB schemes, the proposed framework attains a higher data rate and is more robust to different settings. Furthermore, the action branch architecture reduces DeepIOS's computational complexity, and the digital twin module improves the convergence speed and run-time.</description>

      <title>Preventing output saturation in active noise control: An output-constrained Kalman filter approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF)-based active noise control (ANC) system demonstrates superior tracking and faster convergence compared to the least mean square (LMS) method, particularly in dynamic noise cancellation scenarios. However, in environments with extremely high noise levels, the power of the control signal can exceed the system's rated output power due to hardware limitations, leading to output saturation and subsequent non-linearity. To mitigate this issue, a modified KF with an output constraint is proposed. In this approach, the disturbance treated as an measurement is re-scaled by a constraint factor, which is determined by the system's rated power, the secondary path gain, and the disturbance power. As a result, the output power of the system, i.e. the control signal, is indirectly constrained within the maximum output of the system, ensuring stability. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves rapid suppression of dynamic noise but also effectively prevents non-linearity due to output saturation, highlighting its practical significance.</description>

      <title>Graph-Enhanced Dual-Stream Feature Fusion with Pre-Trained Model for Acoustic Traffic Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microphone array techniques are widely used in sound source localization and smart city acoustic-based traffic monitoring, but these applications face significant challenges due to the scarcity of labeled real-world traffic audio data and the complexity and diversity of application scenarios. The DCASE Challenge's Task 10 focuses on using multi-channel audio signals to count vehicles (cars or commercial vehicles) and identify their directions (left-to-right or vice versa). In this paper, we propose a graph-enhanced dual-stream feature fusion network (GEDF-Net) for acoustic traffic monitoring, which simultaneously considers vehicle type and direction to improve detection. We propose a graph-enhanced dual-stream feature fusion strategy which consists of a vehicle type feature extraction (VTFE) branch, a vehicle direction feature extraction (VDFE) branch, and a frame-level feature fusion module to combine the type and direction feature for enhanced performance. A pre-trained model (PANNs) is used in the VTFE branch to mitigate data scarcity and enhance the type features, followed by a graph attention mechanism to exploit temporal relationships and highlight important audio events within these features. The frame-level fusion of direction and type features enables fine-grained feature representation, resulting in better detection performance. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. GEDF-Net is our submission that achieved 1st place in the DCASE 2024 Challenge Task 10.</description>

      <title>ERGNN: Spectral Graph Neural Network with Explicitly-optimized Rational Graph Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximation-based spectral graph neural networks, which construct graph filters with function approximation, have shown substantial performance in graph learning tasks. Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.</description>

      <title>A Selective Secure Precoding Framework for MU-MIMO Rate-Splitting Multiple Access Networks Under Limited CSIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust and adaptable secure precoding framework designed to encapsulate a intricate scenario where legitimate users have different information security: secure private or normal public information. Leveraging rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), we formulate the sum secrecy spectral efficiency (SE) maximization problem in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with multi-eavesdropper. To resolve the challenges including the heterogeneity of security, non-convexity, and non-smoothness of the problem, we initially approximate the problem using a LogSumExp technique. Subsequently, we derive the first-order optimality condition in the form of a generalized eigenvalue problem. We utilize a power iteration-based method to solve the condition, thereby achieving a superior local optimal solution. The proposed algorithm is further extended to a more realistic scenario involving limited channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). To effectively utilize the limited channel information, we employ a conditional average rate approach. Handling the conditional average by deriving useful bounds, we establish a lower bound for the objective function under the conditional average. Then we apply the similar optimization method as for the perfect CSIT case. In simulations, we validate the proposed algorithm in terms of the sum secrecy SE.</description>

      <title>Robust $H_{\infty}$ Position Controller for Steering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust position controller for electric power assisted steering and steer-by-wire force-feedback systems. A position controller is required in steering systems for haptic feedback control, advanced driver assistance systems and automated driving. However, the driver's \textit{physical} arm impedance causes an inertial uncertainty during coupling. Consequently, a typical position controller, i.e., based on single variable, becomes less robust and suffers tracking performance loss. Therefore, a robust position controller is investigated.
  The proposed solution is based on the multi-variable concept such that the sensed driver torque signal is also included in the position controller. The subsequent solution is obtained by solving the LMI$-H_{\infty}$ optimization problem. As a result, the desired loop gain shape is achieved, i.e., large gain at low frequencies for performance and small gain at high frequencies for robustness.
  Finally, frequency response comparison of different position controllers on real hardware is presented. Experiments and simulation results clearly illustrate the improvements in reference tracking and robustness with the proposed $H_\infty$ controller.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Search for a Change Point Anomaly under a Composite Hypothesis Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of searching for a change point in an anomalous process among a finite set of M processes. Specifically, we address a composite hypothesis model in which each process generates measurements following a common distribution with an unknown parameter (vector). This parameter belongs to either a normal or abnormal space depending on the current state of the process. Before the change point, all processes, including the anomalous one, are in a normal state; after the change point, the anomalous process transitions to an abnormal state. Our goal is to design a sequential search strategy that minimizes the Bayes risk by balancing sample complexity and detection accuracy. We propose a deterministic search algorithm with the following notable properties. First, we analytically demonstrate that when the distributions of both normal and abnormal processes are unknown, the algorithm is asymptotically optimal in minimizing the Bayes risk as the error probability approaches zero. In the second setting, where the parameter under the null hypothesis is known, the algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality with improved detection time based on the true normal state. Simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Aided Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless networks. However, existing ISAC systems are based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs), which inevitably incur a loss in performance when balancing the trade-off between sensing and communication. Movable antenna (MA) technology offers promising potential to enhance ISAC performance by enabling flexible antenna movement. Nevertheless, exploiting more spatial channel variations requires larger antenna moving regions, which may invalidate the conventional far-field assumption for channels between transceivers. Therefore, this paper utilizes the MA to enhance sensing and communication capabilities in near-field ISAC systems, where a full-duplex base station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit and receive MAs movable in large-size regions to simultaneously sense multiple targets and serve multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users for communication. We aim to maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication rates (WSR) by jointly designing the transmit beamformers, sensing signal covariance matrices, receive beamformers, and MA positions at the BS, as well as the UL power allocation. The resulting optimization problem is challenging to solve, while we propose an efficient two-layer random position (RP) algorithm to tackle it. In addition, to reduce movement delay and cost, we design an antenna position matching (APM) algorithm based on the greedy strategy to minimize the total MA movement distance. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the substantial performance improvement achieved by deploying MAs in near-field ISAC systems. Moreover, the results show the effectiveness of the proposed APM algorithm in reducing the antenna movement distance, which is helpful for energy saving and time overhead reduction for MA-aided near-field ISAC systems with large moving regions.</description>

Abstract: In the wake of disruptive IoT technologies generating massive amounts of diverse data, Machine Learning (ML) will play a crucial role in bringing intelligence to Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of resource allocation within IoT networks, focusing specifically on two key categories: Low-Power IoT Networks and Mobile IoT Networks. We delve into the resource allocation strategies that are crucial for optimizing network performance and energy efficiency in these environments. Furthermore, the paper explores the transformative role of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing IoT functionalities. We highlight a range of applications and use cases where these advanced technologies can significantly improve decision-making and optimization processes. In addition to the opportunities presented by ML, DL, and RL, we also address the potential challenges that organizations may face when implementing these technologies in IoT settings. These challenges include crucial accuracy, low flexibility and adaptability, and high computational cost, etc. Finally, the paper identifies promising avenues for future research, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to overcome existing hurdles and improve the integration of ML, DL, and RL into IoT networks. By providing this holistic perspective, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse on resource allocation strategies and the application of intelligent technologies in the IoT landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is an emerging paradigm aiming at transmitting only task-relevant semantic information to the receiver, which can significantly improve communication efficiency. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have empowered GenAI-enabled SemCom (GenSemCom) to further expand its potential in various applications. However, current GenSemCom systems still face challenges such as semantic inconsistency, limited adaptability to diverse tasks and dynamic environments, and the inability to leverage insights from past transmission. Motivated by the success of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in the domain of GenAI, this paper explores the integration of RAG in GenSemCom systems. Specifically, we first provide a comprehensive review of existing GenSemCom systems and the fundamentals of RAG techniques. We then discuss how RAG can be integrated into GenSemCom. Following this, we conduct a case study on semantic image transmission using an RAG-enabled diffusion-based SemCom system, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed integration. Finally, we outline future directions for advancing RAG-enabled GenSemCom systems.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant surge of interest in Mars exploration, driven by the planet's potential for human settlement and its proximity to Earth. In this paper, we explore the performance of the LoRaWAN technology on Mars, to study whether commercial off-the-shelf IoT products, designed and developed on Earth, can be deployed on the Martian surface. We use the ns-3 simulator to model various environmental conditions, primarily focusing on the Free Space Path Loss (FSPL) and the impact of Martian dust storms. Simulation results are given with respect to Earth, as a function of the distance, packet size, offered traffic, and the impact of Mars' atmospheric perturbations. We show that LoRaWAN can be a viable communication solution on Mars, although the performance is heavily affected by the extreme Martian environment over long distances.</description>

Abstract: The growing complexity of radar signals demands responsive and accurate detection systems that can operate efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing models, while effective, often rely on substantial computational resources and large datasets, making them impractical for edge deployment. In this work, we propose an ultralight hybrid neural network optimized for edge applications, delivering robust performance across unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios (mean accuracy of 96.3% at 0 dB) using less than 100 samples per class, and significantly reducing computational overhead.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Secure ISAC Against Dual Eavesdropping Threats: Joint Beamforming and Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a UAV serves as an aerial base station (BS) to simultaneously perform communication with a user and detect a target on the ground, while a dual-functional eavesdropper attempts to intercept the signals for both sensing and communication. Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</description>

Abstract: We consider the uplink of a hardware-impaired intelligent reflective surfaces (IRS) aided multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system with mobile user equipments, whose channel age with time. For this system, we analyze the distortion due to hardware impairments, and the effect of channel aging, and propose a novel distortion-and-aging-aware MMSE (DAA-MMSE) receiver that not only provides a higher spectral efficiency (SE) than conventional maximal ratio and distortion-unaware MMSE (DU-MMSE) receivers, but also reduces the pilot overhead. By considering non-ideal hardware and spatially-correlated Rician fading channels with phase shifts, we also derive the SE lower bound for this system. We show that the SE gain of the DAA-MMSE receiver over DU-MMSE receiver increases with hardware impairments, and channel aging. Along with DAA-MMSE receiver, the IRS is also shown to reduce the pilot overhead in a mMIMO system with channel aging.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication Enabled Cooperative Passive Sensing Using Mobile Communication System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a potential technology of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system, which enables communication base station (BS) with sensing capability. However, the performance of single-BS sensing is limited, which can be overcome by multi-BS cooperative sensing. There are three types of multi-BS cooperative sensing, including cooperative active sensing, cooperative passive sensing, and cooperative active and passive sensing, where the multi-BS cooperative passive sensing has the advantages of low hardware modification cost and large sensing coverage. However, multi-BS cooperative passive sensing faces the challenges of synchronization offsets mitigation and sensing information fusion. To address these challenges, a non-line of sight (NLoS) and line of sight (LoS) signal cross-correlation (NLCC) method is proposed to mitigate carrier frequency offset (CFO) and time offset (TO). Besides, a symbol-level multi-BS sensing information fusion method is proposed. The discrete samplings of echo signals from multiple BSs are matched independently and coherent accumulated to improve sensing accuracy. Moreover, a lowcomplexity joint angle-of-arrival (AoA) and angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation method is proposed to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results show that symbol-level multi-BS cooperative passive sensing scheme has an order of magnitude higher sensing accuracy than single-BS passive sensing. This work provides a reference for the research on multi-BS cooperative passive sensing.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Power-Aware Learned Optimization for Modular Receive Beamforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems play a key role in wireless communication technologies. A widely considered approach to realize scalable MIMO systems involves architectures comprised of multiple separate modules, each with its own beamforming capability. Such models accommodate cell-free massive MIMO and partially connected hybrid MIMO architectures. A core issue with the implementation of modular MIMO arises from the need to rapidly set the beampatterns of the modules, while maintaining their power efficiency. This leads to challenging constrained optimization that should be repeatedly solved on each coherence duration. In this work, we propose a power-oriented optimization algorithm for beamforming in uplink modular hybrid MIMO systems, which learns from data to operate rapidly. We derive our learned optimizer by tackling the rate maximization objective using projected gradient ascent steps with momentum. We then leverage data to tune the hyperparameters of the optimizer, allowing it to operate reliably in a fixed and small number of iterations while completely preserving its interpretable operation. We show how power efficient beamforming can be encouraged by the learned optimizer, via boosting architectures with low-resolution phase shifts and with deactivated analog components. Numerical results show that our learn-to-optimize method notably reduces the number of iterations and computation latency required to reliably tune modular MIMO receivers, and that it allows obtaining desirable balances between power efficient designs and throughput.</description>

      <title>Diversity and Multiplexing for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general fading model that applies to multipath channels between two non-parallel continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs) is proposed. On this basis, the performance of diversity and multiplexing achieved by CAPAs over fading channels is analyzed. i) For multiple-input single-output and single-input multiple-output channels, Landau's eigenvalue theorem is employed to analyze the autocorrelation of the spatial response. Closed-form expressions are derived for the outage probability (OP) and ergodic channel capacity (ECC). Additionally, asymptotic analyses in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are carried out to unveil the maximal diversity and multiplexing gains. The diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT) is also characterized, along with the array gain within the DMT framework. ii) For multiple-input multiple-output channels, a wavenumber-domain-based transmission framework is proposed to exploit the spatial degrees of freedom offered by CAPAs. Asymptotic approximations are derived for the OP and ECC, and the DMT is revealed. The performance of CAPAs is further compared with that of conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). The analytical and numerical results demonstrate that: i) CAPAs achieve a lower OP and higher ECC than SPDAs; ii) CAPAs achieve the same DMT as SPDAs with half-wavelength antenna spacing while attaining a larger array gain; and iii) CAPAs achieve a better DMT than SPDAs with antenna spacing greater than half a wavelength.</description>

      <title>Near-Field ISAC in 6G: Addressing Phase Nonlinearity via Lifted Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a promising component of 6G networks, fusing communication and radar technologies to facilitate new services. Additionally, the use of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) at the ISAC common receiver not only facilitates terahertz-rate communication links but also significantly enhances the accuracy of target detection in radar applications. In practical scenarios, communication scatterers and radar targets often reside in close proximity to the ISAC receiver. This, combined with the use of ELAA, fundamentally alters the electromagnetic characteristics of wireless and radar channels, shifting from far-field planar-wave propagation to near-field spherical wave propagation. Under the far-field planar-wave model, the phase of the array response vector varies linearly with the antenna index. In contrast, in the near-field spherical wave model, this phase relationship becomes nonlinear. This shift presents a fundamental challenge: the widely-used Fourier analysis can no longer be directly applied for target detection and communication channel estimation at the ISAC common receiver. In this work, we propose a feasible solution to address this fundamental issue. Specifically, we demonstrate that there exists a high-dimensional space in which the phase nonlinearity can be expressed as linear. Leveraging this insight, we develop a lifted super-resolution framework that simultaneously performs communication channel estimation and extracts target parameters with high precision.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.</description>

      <title>FOGNA: An effective Sum-Difference Co-Array Design Based on Fourth-Order Cumulants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Array structures based on the fourth-order difference co-array (FODCA) provide more degrees of freedom (DOF). However, since the growth of DOF is limited by a single case of fourth-order cumulant in FODCA, this paper aims to design a sparse linear array (SLA) with higher DOF via exploring different cases of fourth-order cumulants. This paper presents a mathematical framework based on fourth-order cumulant to devise a fourth-order extend co-array (FOECA), which is equivalent to FODCA. A novel SLA, namely fourth-order generalized nested array (FOGNA), is proposed based on FOECA to provide closed-form expressions for the sensor locations and enhance DOF to resolve more signal sources in direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. FOGNA is consisted of three subarrays, where the first is a concatenated nested array and the other two subarrays are SLA with big inter-spacing between sensors. When the total physical sensors of FOGNA are given, the number of sensors in each subarray is determined by the designed method, which can obtain the maximum DOF under the proposed array structure and derive closed-form expressions for the sensor locations of FOGNA. The proposed array structure not only achieves higher DOF than those of existing FODCAs but also reduces mutual coupling effects. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of FOGNA on DOA estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing FODCAs.</description>

      <title>Throughput Maximization for UAV-enabled Integrated Periodic Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is expected to revolutionize the existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system and promise a more flexible joint design. Nevertheless, the existing works on ISAC mainly focus on exploring the performance of both functionalities simultaneously during the entire considered period, which may ignore the practical asymmetric sensing and communication requirements. In particular, always forcing sensing along with communication may make it is harder to balance between these two functionalities due to shared spectrum resources and limited transmit power. To address this issue, we propose a new integrated periodic sensing and communication mechanism for the UAV-enabled ISAC system to provide a more flexible trade-off between two integrated functionalities. Specifically, the system achievable rate is maximized via jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, user association, target sensing selection, and transmit beamforming, while meeting the sensing frequency and beam pattern gain requirement for the given targets. Despite that this problem is highly non-convex and involves closely coupled integer variables, we derive the closed-form optimal beamforming vector to dramatically reduce the complexity of beamforming design, and present a tight lower bound of the achievable rate to facilitate UAV trajectory design. Based on the above results, we propose a penalty-based algorithm to efficiently solve the considered problem. The optimal achievable rate and the optimal UAV location are analyzed under a special case of infinity number of antennas. Furthermore, we prove the structural symmetry between the optimal solutions in different ISAC frames without location constraints and propose an efficient algorithm for solving the problem with location constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce 3D-Speaker-Toolkit, an open-source toolkit for multimodal speaker verification and diarization, designed for meeting the needs of academic researchers and industrial practitioners. The 3D-Speaker-Toolkit adeptly leverages the combined strengths of acoustic, semantic, and visual data, seamlessly fusing these modalities to offer robust speaker recognition capabilities. The acoustic module extracts speaker embeddings from acoustic features, employing both fully-supervised and self-supervised learning approaches. The semantic module leverages advanced language models to comprehend the substance and context of spoken language, thereby augmenting the system's proficiency in distinguishing speakers through linguistic patterns. The visual module applies image processing technologies to scrutinize facial features, which bolsters the precision of speaker diarization in multi-speaker environments. Collectively, these modules empower the 3D-Speaker-Toolkit to achieve substantially improved accuracy and reliability in speaker-related tasks. With 3D-Speaker-Toolkit, we establish a new benchmark for multimodal speaker analysis. The toolkit also includes a handful of open-source state-of-the-art models and a large-scale dataset containing over 10,000 speakers. The toolkit is publicly available at https://github.com/modelscope/3D-Speaker.</description>

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems rely on speech input and emotional labels annotated by humans. However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities. We show that using labels elicited by voice-only stimuli for training yields better performance on the test set, whereas labels elicited by voice-only stimuli.</description>

      <title>End-User-Centric Collaborative MIMO: Performance Analysis and Proof of Concept</title>

Abstract: The trend toward using increasingly large arrays of antenna elements continues. However, fitting more antennas into the limited space available on user equipment (UE) within the currently popular Frequency Range 1 spectrum presents a significant challenge. This limitation constrains the capacity-scaling gains for end users, even when networks support a higher number of antennas. To address this issue, we explore a user-centric collaborative MIMO approach, termed UE-CoMIMO, which leverages several fixed or portable devices within a personal area to form a virtually expanded antenna array. This paper develops a comprehensive mathematical framework to analyze the performance of UE-CoMIMO. Our analytical results demonstrate that UE-CoMIMO can significantly enhance the system's effective channel response within the current communication system without requiring extensive modifications. Further performance improvements can be achieved by optimizing the phase shifters on the expanded antenna arrays at the collaborative devices. These findings are corroborated by ray-tracing simulations. Beyond the simulations, we implemented these collaborative devices and successfully conducted over-the-air validation in a real 5G environment, showcasing the practical potential of UE-CoMIMO. Several practical perspectives are discussed, highlighting the feasibility and benefits of this approach in real-world scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are envisioned to be employed in next generation wireless networks to enhance the communication and radio localization services. In this paper, we propose novel localization and tracking algorithms exploiting reflections through RISs at multiple receivers. We utilize a single antenna transmitter (Tx) and multiple single antenna receivers (Rxs) to estimate the position and the velocity of users (e.g. vehicles) equipped with RISs. Then, we design the RIS phase shifts to separate the signals from different users. The proposed algorithms exploit the geometry information of the signal at the RISs to localize and track the users. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the localization system. Compared to the time of arrival (ToA)-based localization approach, the proposed method reduces the localization error by a factor up to three. Also, the simulation results show the accuracy of the proposed tracking approach.</description>
