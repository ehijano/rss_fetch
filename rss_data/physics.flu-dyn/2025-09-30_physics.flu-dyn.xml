      <title>Predictive Criteria for Electrospray-Assisted Droplet Dynamics in Aerodynamic Flow Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrospray technology enables external electric fields to steer charged droplets, with potential applications in fuel-air mixing and aerodynamic flow control. This study develops a computational framework that couples a steady OpenFOAM RANS solution of a NACA 1912 airfoil channel flow with a reduced-order Lagrangian particle model to examine droplet trajectories under viscous drag and electrostatic forces. Baseline uniform-flow tests confirmed that electrostatic deflection weakens as inertial effects grow with freestream velocity. In the non-uniform aerodynamic field, an opposing streamwise electric field increased residence times and produced local reversal in low-speed pockets. Building on these results, we derive a predictive criterion linking the minimum electric field for reversal to the local convective velocity and introduce a "control authority" map that highlights regions where modest fields achieve strong kinematic response. Together, these diagnostics provide a design-oriented basis for positioning electrodes and tuning field strength in aerodynamic environments. The framework thus establishes both a computationally efficient tool for parametric studies and predictive criteria for electrospray-assisted flow manipulation, laying groundwork for three-dimensional extensions and experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Droplet rebounds off a fluid bath: kinematic match simulations and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to simulate non-coalescing impacts and rebounds of droplets onto the free surface of a liquid bath, together with new experimental data. The method is derived from first principles and imposes only natural geometric and kinematic constraints on the motion of the impacting interfaces, yielding predictions for the evolution of the contact area, pressure distribution, and wave field generated by the impact on both impacting masses. This work generalises an existing kinematic-match method whose prior applications dealt with deformation in the surface of the bath only; i.e., neglecting that of the droplet. The method's extension to include droplet deformation gives predictions that compare favourably with existing experimental results and the new experiments in the low Weber number regime using submillimeter-sized droplets.</description>

      <title>Screening Canopy-Induced Wind with a Lightweight 2-D RANS Quadratic-Drag Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vegetation belts are widely used in urban planning to manage pedestrian wind, dust dispersion, and outdoor thermal comfort. This paper presents a compact method for predicting canopy-induced flow using a steady two-dimensional RANS model with Spalart-Allmaras closure and a quadratic drag model for vegetation. Each planting zone is defined by a single leaf area index (LAI). The workflow maps LAI to porosity using an exponential coefficient of 0.5, converts porosity to a local LAI per cell, divides by the grid-measured canopy thickness to form a leaf area density, and applies a quadratic drag term. The model is benchmarked against streamwise-mean velocity profiles reported by Liang et al. at heights 0.25h, 0.75h, and 1.25h (where h is canopy height) for a belt spanning x/H = 0 to 5. Results accurately reproduce the three canonical regions-approach, in-canopy deficit, and leeward wake, and show strong agreement with experimental data in the leeward wake, critical for sitting homes and streets near planting. The method is computationally efficient, faster than 3D CFD, uses designer-friendly inputs, and is transparent for early design screening. Implementation details, including LAI-to-porosity mapping, grid-based canopy thickness, quadratic drag, and boundary sponges, are provided to enable reproduction in AirSketcher (Polar Dynamix) or comparable solvers.</description>

      <title>Interplay of blowups in a differential kinetic model of gravity wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the blowup scenarios in a novel phase-parametrized differential approximation model of deep water surface gravity waves that was recently derived in the limit of a large number of multicomponent fields. Previous work showed that upon precisely tuning the phase parameter $\phi$ to $\pi$, the model formally supports steady-state solutions transitioning from Kolmogorov-Zakharov $\propto \omega^{-4}$ to Phillips' critical balance $\propto \omega^{-5}$ at small scales, a feature qualitatively consistent with oceanic measurements. Here we show that the critical balance is in fact a generic feature of the model, which prescribes a finite-time transfer of the energy from the IR towards the UV for any value of $\phi \in [0,\pi)$. We observe a bifurcation in the blowup scenario from continuous to discrete self-similarity as $\phi$ is increased above $\phi_*\simeq 2.7$. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a non-continuous blowup in the kinetic theory of waves.</description>

      <title>A Framework to Systematically Study the Nonlinear Fluid-Structure Interaction of Phononic Materials with Aerodynamic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phononic materials (PMs) are periodic media that exhibit novel elastodynamic responses. While PMs have made progress in vibration-mitigation applications, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of PMs to passively and adaptively modulate flow behavior through fluid-structure interaction (FSI). For example, PMs have been shown to delay laminar-to-turbulent transition and mitigate unsteadiness in shock-boundary layer interactions. However, a systematic framework to relate the effect of specific PM behaviors to the FSI dynamics is lacking. Such a framework is essential to systematically investigate the complex and nonlinear coupled dynamics of the FSI. Further, parameters that are not typically considered in PM models become critical, such as the vibration amplitude. This article addresses this gap by proposing FSI-relevant ``behavioral'' parameters, distinct from the structural parameters of the PM, but with a clear mapping provided to them. We use high-fidelity, strongly coupled simulations to quantify the FSI between a novel configuration of laminar flow past a flat plate, equipped with a PM. Our study proposes four critical PM behavioral parameters -- effective stiffness, truncation resonance frequency, a quantity representing the dynamic displacement amplitude, and unit cell mass -- that influence the spectral characteristics of the vortex-shedding process inherent to the flat plate system. Results show connections between each parameter and distinct behavior in the lift coefficient in FSI. While the focus of this work is on the PM-FSI dynamics in an aerodynamic flow, we argue that identifying these behavioral parameters is key to unlocking scientific study and design with phononic materials in fluid flows more broadly.</description>

      <title>Time-domain pressure and surface wave propagation over generic topography due to sea floor motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface gravity wave evolution, imitating tsunamis triggered by the ocean floor's arbitrary temporal motion over a generic seafloor topography, is investigated using the linearised water wave theory of a compressible ocean. The unprecedented details of pressure wave bounce between the water surface and ocean floor, followed by the generation of acoustic-gravity wave (AGW) propagation away from the initial disturbance, are shown for the first time. The computational novelty covers accurate pressure-wave-field computation using high-frequency AGW modes, unlike the dominant first AGW in surface waves. The mathematical problem is solved using the Fourier transformation and eigenfunction expansion techniques, following a multistep approximation of the arbitrarily deep sea. Test cases of two idealistic subsurface geometries (continental shelf and mountain range) using the ocean floor's linear and parabolic temporal growth show elongation and shortening of the surface wavelength and changes in the propagation speed due to the variable seafloor topography through simulations. The mutual interaction of the pressure waves within the water column unravels depth-change-induced scattering. While high-frequency pressure at a shallower depth is dominant for the continental shelf, a significantly reduced amplitude across a mountain ridge is visualised with a corresponding lower impact of the acoustic-gravity wave on the surface wave. Substantial contrast in the pressure wavefield triggered by a slight change in the rupture's properties suggests its careful consideration when building tsunami prediction models. Since these AGWs are precursors to tsunamis, we believe their detection through an accurate pressure measurement will give very important information about the associated tsunami wave.</description>

      <title>Scaling rules for multiphase flow in vertical Venturis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing a suitable scaling rule in gas-liquid flow can produce dynamically comparable results, which helps in the development of flow models applicable to a wide range of flow conditions and reduces the carbon footprint; however, matching all dimensionless numbers in gas-liquid flow is a challenge. This study uses a computational fluid dynamics approach to identify key dimensionless numbers that can produce dimensionally equivalent results under a variety of flow conditions in the vertical Venturi of varied sizes. The performance of the scaling rule is evaluated and validated based on experimental measurements in terms of the phase fraction, the Venturi dimensionless pressure drop, and the two-phase discharge coefficient.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Applicability of the Lattice-Boltzmann Method for Two-Dimensional Turbulence Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lattice-Boltzmann method is a mesoscopic approach for solving hydrodynamic problems involving both laminar and turbulent fluids. Although the suitability for the former cases is supported by a myriad of studies, turbulent flows always give rise to additional challenges that need to be addressed properly. In this paper, we estimate the accuracy of the simulation results obtained via a custom implementation of a Lattice-Boltzmann solver for a two-dimensional turbulent flow. To this end, a two-dimensional flow field filled with randomly located rigid disks was simulated, and the von Karman vortex street generated after the wake of such obstacles was studied.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of diffusiophoresis in a cellular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study experimentally the dispersion of colloids in a two-dimensional, time independent, Rayleigh-B\'enard flow in the presence of salt gradients. Due to the additional scalar, the colloids do not follow exactly the Eulerian flow-field, but have a (small) extra-velocity $\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{dp}} = D_{\mathrm{dp}} \nabla \log C_s$, where $D_\mathrm{dp}$ is the phoretic constant and $C_s$ the salt concentration. Such a configuration is motivated by the theoretical work by Volk \textit{et al.} (JFM, 2022), which predicted enhanced transport or blockage in a stationary cellular flow depending on the value of a blockage coefficient. By means of High Dynamical Range Light Induced Fluorescence, we study the evolution of the colloids concentration field at large P\'eclet number. We find a good agreement with the theoretical work although a number of hypotheses are not satisfied, as the experiment is non homogeneous in space and intrinsically transient. In particular we observe enhanced transport when salt and colloids are injected at both ends of the Rayleigh-B\'enard chamber, and blockage when colloids and salt are injected together and phoretic effects are strong enough.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Cost-Effective In situ Fabrication of Nanoporous Membranes in Microfluidic Devices for Biomedical and Environmental Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro/nanoporous membranes have been used extensively in biological and medical applications associated with filtration, particle sorting, cell separation, and real-time sensing. Expanding its applications to microfluidics offers several advantages, such as precise control over fluid flow rates, regulated reaction times, and efficient product extraction. This study demonstrates a simple, cost-effective, rapid, single-step method for the synthesis of nanoporous membranes within a microfluidic device. The membrane is prepared by filling up the microchamber with cellulose acetate dissolved in N, N-dimethylformamide, and 1-hexanol, followed by the continuous flow of water as an antisolvent. Mixing CA-DMF with antisolvent water leads to an in-situ synthesis of cellulose acetate nanoparticles (CANPs) at the Water-DMF interface. The continuous flow of water ensures the coagulation of CANPs, forming nanoporous membranes. The thickness, porosity, and wettability of the membrane are dependent on the flow rate of water and the concentration of CA dissolved in DMF. Apart from its wide application in cell and biomolecule separation, this membrane can be used to detect biomarkers or pathogens in clinical samples. Additionally, these nanoporous membranes can be used to detect and filter environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and emulsified oil from water. In summary, the synthesis of CANP nanoporous membranes within microfluidic channels with adjustable porosity enhances the potential uses of micro/nanomembranes in both healthcare and environmental contexts.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Acoustically Forced Helium Jet in Crossflow Using Shadowgraphy and Modal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an experimental investigation of helium jet in crossflow of air, with an objective to understand the influence of acoustic forcing on jet behavior and mixing. Unforced and sinusoidally forced jets are studied. High speed shadowgraphy is used to capture instantaneous jet images. These images are further processed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) algorithm to provide insights into the spatiotemporal behavior. Schlieren Imaging Velocimetry (SIV) is also used to understand the jet entrainment and identify regions of low and high velocities. Moreover, an interface tracking method is used to obtain interface location oscillations for near nozzle and far field locations. Energy spectrum is obtained from Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of these oscillations. The unforced jet is observed for different jet to crossflow velocity ratios (R), and it is observed that the jet penetration increases with R. Unforced cases show a broadband spectrum indicating the absence of any dominant frequency, except for the lowest velocity ratio case. The instability in unforced cases is limited to the shear layer oscillations. For the forced cases, a clear dominant frequency corresponding to the forcing frequency (and occasionally their harmonics) is recorded. It is observed that the impact of forcing function is not the same for all the frequencies, and the jet response is observed to be much more pronounced for a higher frequency as compared to a lower frequency forcing. Two typical cases, highlighting the effect of frequency response are compared in detail using image analysis, interface tracking, POD and SIV.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Learning of Free Surface Dynamics in Generalized Newtonian Fluids using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) model for efficiently predicting the flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids with free surface dynamics. The numerical analysis of non-Newtonian fluids presents significant challenges, as traditional algorithms designed for Newtonian fluids with constant viscosity often struggle to converge when applied to non-Newtonian cases, where rheological properties vary dynamically with flow conditions. Among these, power-law fluids exhibit viscosity that decreases exponentially as the shear rate increases, making numerical simulations particularly difficult. The complexity further escalates in free surface flow scenarios, where computational challenges intensify. In such cases, particle-based methods like smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) provide advantages over traditional grid-based techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM). Building on this approach, we introduce a novel GNN-based numerical model to enhance the computational efficiency of non-Newtonian power-law fluid flow simulations. Our model is trained on SPH simulation data, learning the effects of particle accelerations in the presence of SPH interactions based on the fluid's power-law parameters. The GNN significantly accelerates computations while maintaining reliable accuracy in benchmark tests, including dam-break and droplet impact simulations. The results underscore the potential of GNN-based simulation frameworks for efficiently modeling non-Newtonian fluid behavior, paving the way for future advancements in data-driven fluid simulations.</description>

      <title>Event-based complexity in atmospheric turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the studies of Kolmogorov and Oboukhov in 1941, the problem of intermittent large velocity excursions was recognized to be one of the most intriguing and elusive aspects of turbulent flows. While many efforts were devoted since 1960s to the magnitude intermittency, related to the statistics of the large increments in the turbulent signals, the attention towards the so-called clustering intermittency has started to increase only in the last two decades, even if some pioneering studies were carried in previous years. The low attention towards the clustering intermittency is somewhat surprising, as intermittency itself is essentially defined as an alternance of extended quiescent periods/regions and short/small high activity periods/zones. It is then natural to characterize intermittency by means of events marked along the dependent variable axes, whatever time or space. Conversely, the concept of crucial events and of temporal complexity, related to non-trivial clustering properties of these same events, has been proposed as a general interpretative framework for the investigation of complex systems with metastable self-organizing dynamics. Without any claim to being complete, in this chapter we give a review of event-based complexity approaches used in literature for the description of turbulence in the planetary boundary layer. The main goal is to put a first bridge between turbulence studies exploiting event-based complexity approaches, such as clustering exponents and classical Oboukhov intermittency exponents, and studies about intermittent complex systems, where concepts and ideas developed in the fields of non-equilibrium statistical physics, probability theory and dynamical system theory are jointly exploited.</description>

      <title>Kinetic energy instability of pipe flow in finite domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The instability of pipe flow has been a subject of extensive research, yet a significant gap remains between experimental observations and theoretical predictions. This study revisits the classical problem of kinetic energy instability of pipe flow using contemporary computational methods. We focus on finite domains to address the limitations of previous infinite pipe analyses. We analyze two different cases by imposing homogeneous Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions. Our investigation reveals that the critical Reynolds number for instability approaches values established by Joseph and Carmi $(1969)$ as the length of the pipe increases. Specifically, when homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied, the critical Reynolds number converges monotonically to a value of $\RE_c \leq 81.62$. In contrast, for the periodic case, the critical Reynolds number varies periodically with the length of the pipe, exhibiting local minima at $\RE_c = 81.58$. We further characterize the shape of the perturbations by computing their magnitude and vorticity for several local minima and maxima associated with the periodic problem. Focusing on the perturbations obtained by imposing the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, we compute their temporal evolution. As expected, the $L^2$-norm of the perturbation decreases from the initial time when solving for the critical Reynolds number, while it initially increases and then eventually decreases for Reynolds numbers exceeding the critical value.</description>

      <title>A classification of mode-1 internal solitary waves in a three-layer fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the bifurcation structure of mode-1 solitary waves in a three-layer fluid confined between two rigid boundaries. A recent study (Lamb, J. Fluid Mech. 2023, 962, A17) proposed a method to predict the coexistence of solitary waves with opposite polarity in a continuously stratified fluid with a double pycnocline by examining the conjugate states for the Euler equations. We extend this line of inquiry to a piecewise-constant three-layer stratification, taking advantage of the fact that the conjugate states for the Euler equations are exactly preserved by the strongly nonlinear model that we will refer to as the three-layer Miyata-Maltseva-Choi-Camassa (MMCC3) equations. In this reduced setting, solitary waves are governed by a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, whose critical points are used to explain the bifurcation structure. Through this analysis, we also discover families of solutions that have not been previously reported. Using the shared conjugate state structure between the MMCC3 model and the full Euler equations, we propose criteria for distinguishing the full range of solution behaviours. This alignment between the reduced and full models provides strong evidence that partitioning the parameter space into regions associated with distinct solution types is valid within both theories. This classification is further substantiated by numerical solutions to both models, which show excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of two-phase flows with surfactant-induced surface viscous effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of interfacial flows with surfactant-induced complexities involving surface viscous stresses are performed within the framework of the Level Contour Reconstruction Method (LCRM); this hybrid front-tracking/level-set approach leverages the advantages of both methods. In addition to interface-confined surfactant transport that results in surface diffusion and Marangoni stresses, the interface, endowed with shear and dilatational viscosities; these act to resist deformation arising from velocity gradients in the plane of the two-dimensional manifold of the interface, and interfacial compressibility effects, respectively. By adopting the Boussinesq-Scriven constitutive model, We provide a mathematical formulation of these effects that accurately captures the interfacial mechanics, which is then implemented within the LCRM-based code by exploiting the benefits inherent to the underlying front-tracking/level-sets hybrid approach. We validate our numerical predictions against a number of benchmark cases that involve drops undergoing deformation when subjected to a flow field or when rising under the action of buoyancy. The results of these validation studies highlight the importance of adopting a rigorous approach in modelling the interfacial dynamics. We also present results that demonstrate the effects of surface viscous stresses on interfacial deformation in unsteady parametric surface waves and atomisation events.</description>

      <title>Leveraging modal structure similarity for simulation of spatially evolving wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new methodology to enable efficient simulation of high Reynolds number wakes. In this approach, a body-exclusive hybrid simulation at Re = 5 x 10^4 is initialized using inflow fields reconstructed from a lower Reynolds number (Re = 5 x 10^3) body-inclusive simulation. Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) is employed to identify dominant coherent structures, and a low-rank reconstruction generates physically meaningful inflow conditions. The resulting simulations accurately recover key large-scale flow, including the vortex shedding mode, and match the spectral content of a fully body-inclusive Re = 5 x 10^4 reference simulation beyond an adjustment region. SPOD eigenspectra confirm agreement across both low and high frequencies. This strategy achieves over an order-of-magnitude reduction in computational cost by avoiding direct high-Re body-inclusive simulations, offering a scalable framework for simulating complex wakes using low Re as well as reduced-order inflow prescriptions.</description>

      <title>VIVALDy: A Hybrid Generative Reduced-Order Model for Turbulent Flows, Applied to Vortex-Induced Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing reduced-order models applicable to fluid-dynamics problems involving complex geometries and different flow conditions remains a critical challenge for turbulent flows. This study introduces VIVALDy, a novel machine-learning framework that employs a hybrid $\beta$-Variational Autoencoder-Generative Adversarial Network ($\beta$-VAE-GAN) architecture with masked convolutions to extract dominant flow features into a compact latent space while preserving fidelity at solid-fluid interfaces. A bidirectional transformer then models the temporal evolution of these features, learning to predict flow trajectories from minimal sensor inputs. This two-stage approach enables the transformer to map sensor measurements to dominant flow variables identified by the autoencoder, advancing reduced-order modeling capabilities for real-time flow prediction. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through application to a problem relevant to vortex-induced vibration (VIV) energy harvesting systems, reconstructing the turbulent flow around a one-degree-of-freedom moving cylinder. Validated against experimental data spanning fluid-structure interaction regimes of interest, VIVALDy accurately predicts different flow states using only the cylinder displacement. The framework demonstrates adequate performance in both reconstruction accuracy and statistical fidelity across diverse operating conditions, enabling efficient prediction of the turbulent flow phenomena governing vortex-induced vibration.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic performance and robustness of a nature-inspired concept for a micro-scale wind turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present direct numerical simulations of a novel concept for a micro-scale wind turbine, inspired in the mechanics of the auto-rotation of winged seeds. In this nature-inspired concept the turbine blades have two degrees of freedom: the pitch and the elevation (or coning) angles. These allow the blade to vary its attitude with respect to the incoming velocity seen by the blade (i.e., the tip-speed ratio, $\lambda$). In order to validate this new concept, we perform numerical simulations of the coupled fluid-solid problem, solving together the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid and the Newton equations for the rigid body (i.e., the blade). We characterize a preliminary nature-inspired single-blade rotor over a range of operational conditions (including both uniform and turbulent inflows), demonstrating the ability of the novel rotor to extract power at a very low Reynolds number (i.e., $Re=240$ based on the blade's chord and the freestream velocity), significantly changing its attitude in response to different braking torques and tip-speed ratios. The rotor achieves a peak power coefficient of $C_{P,\max} = 0.026$ at $\lambda \approx 2.0$. This peak value is unchanged between uniform and turbulence-perturbed inflows, demonstrating the robustness of the nature-inspired design. However, performance remains lower than that of fixed-blade configurations, showing that while the concept is feasible and stable, optimization of blade planform and mass distribution is essential to improve efficiency.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian description and quantification of scalar mixing in fluid flows from particle tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding, quantifying and controlling transport and mixing processes are central in the study of fluid flows. Many different Lagrangian approaches have been proposed for detecting organizing flow structures that determine material transport, including recent data-based methods that aim to identify such coherent objects directly from tracer trajectories. These methods have helped to gain a better understanding of the underlying dynamics. However, the quantification of scalar mixing has not been the focus. Here, we develop a data-driven description and quantification of transport and mixing of scalar quantities by combining a diffusion map approach for the extraction of coherent flow structures with aspects of deterministic particle methods.</description>

      <title>Advancing three dimensional modeling of adsorption physics in porous media for gas separation towards a new design of fixed bed adsorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new three-dimensional (3D) multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for adsorption physics in porous media is developed and validated. The model is constituted at a macroscopic scale that integrates new volumetric source terms in the multi-species gas transport and energy conservation equations. These new terms, for the first time, take into account the impact of pores adsorption occupation rate (PAOR), or gas loading. Transient 3D simulations are performed at an atmospheric pressure of about 1.02 bar for different CO2-He gas mixture feed-in compositions (100%, 50%, and 15% CO2). The 3D model validation is conducted through quantitative comparisons with experimental data from the literature for CO2 adsorption on porous Zeolite-13X beads in a cylindrical fixed-bed. Results demonstrate the new model's ability to accurately predict the breakthrough curves and the thermal front propagation inside the bed. Finally, the new CFD model is applied to investigate CO2 capture in a new 3D design of fixed-bed adsorbers of equivalent adsorbent material volume. The new design outperformed the reference cylindrical design thanks to its new geometry with higher surface area. This allows to shorten the adsorption periods in pressure and temperature swing adsorption processes and thus increase the overall gas separation process productivity.</description>

      <title>Cause-and-effect approach to turbulence forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to turbulence forecasting often rely on correlation-based criteria for input selection. These methods may select variables that correlate with the target without truly driving its dynamics, which limits interpretability, generalization, and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a causality-based approach for input selection in turbulence forecasting based on the Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition (SURD) of causality. This method decomposes the information from candidate inputs into unique, redundant, and synergistic causal contributions and links them to the fundamental limits of predictive accuracy achievable by any model. In practice, we implement the approach using neural mutual-information estimators and demonstrate its application to wall-shear-stress forecasting from direct numerical simulation data of turbulent channel flow. Our findings show that input variables with strong unique or synergistic causal contributions enable compact forecasting models with high predictive power, whereas redundant variables can be excluded without degrading accuracy. We first validate these capabilities in two benchmark cases involving collider effects, and then apply the methodology to three turbulent flow configurations with different interaction types. In each case, we demonstrate how SURD causalities guide optimal input selection by constructing forecasting models based on various input combinations. We also compare the results with standard space-time correlation analysis and show that SURD provides a more reliable basis for input selection, as it captures nonlinear dependencies, distinguishes redundant, unique, and synergistic interactions, and remains invariant under invertible transformations of the variables. Overall, we believe this enables more interpretable and compact models by reducing input dimensionality without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Optimal Velocity Drag Model for Traffic Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Hybrid Optimal Velocity-Drag (OVD) model that combines the behavioral structure of the classical Optimal Velocity Model (OVM) with a drag-based saturation law motivated by Newtonian mechanics. The model retains the OVM principle that desired speed depends on headway, but replaces the linear relaxation law with a formulation that enforces bounded accelerations and smooth convergence to equilibrium. After reviewing the OVM framework and its stability properties, we introduce the OVD dynamics and derive the dispersion relation from a linear stability analysis of uniform flow. This analysis shows that the OVD formulation preserves the instability mechanisms responsible for stop-and-go waves, while avoiding the unrealistic acceleration predictions of the classical OVM. We also illustrate the model using desired velocity functions of hyperbolic tangent type, a common choice in the OVM literature, and highlight applications to large-scale traffic simulation and empirical data studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the OVD model enforces bounded accelerations while preserving the nonlinear instabilities of the classical OVM, providing a physically grounded and interpretable foundation for advancing traffic flow research.</description>

      <title>Why and when merging surface nanobubbles jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas bubble accumulation on substrates reduces the efficiency of many physicochemical processes, such as water electrolysis. For microbubbles, where buoyancy is negligible, coalescence-induced jumping driven by the release of surface energy provides an efficient pathway for their early detachment. At the nanoscale, however, gas compressibility breaks volume conservation during coalescence, suppressing surface energy release and seemingly disabling this detachment route. Using molecular dynamics simulations, continuum numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis, we show that surface nanobubbles with sufficiently large contact angles can nevertheless detach after coalescence. In this regime, detachment is powered by the release of pressure energy associated with nanobubble volume expansion. This finding thus establishes a unified driving mechanism for coalescence-induced bubble detachment across all length scales.</description>

      <title>Design of model Boger fluids with systematically controlled viscoelastic properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subject of viscoelastic flow phenomena is crucial to many areas of engineering and the physical sciences. Although much of our understanding of viscoelastic flow features stem from carefully designed experiments, preparation of model viscoelastic fluids remains an outstanding challenge; for example, fabricating a series of fluids with varied fluid shear moduli $G_0$, but with an identical relaxation time $\tau$, is nontrivial. In this work, we harness the non-ideality of nearly constant-viscosity elastic fluids (commonly known as `Boger fluids') made with polyisobutylene to develop an experimental methodology that produces a set of fluids with desired viscoelastic properties, specifically, $G_0$, $\tau$, and the first normal stress difference coefficient $\psi_1$. Through a simple linear algebraic manipulation between the rheological properties of interest ($G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$) and the fluid compositions in terms of polymer concentration $c$, molecular weight $M_w$, and solvent viscosity $\eta_s$, we developed a `design equation' that takes $G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$ as inputs and calculates values for $c$, $M_w$, $\eta_s$ as outputs. Using this method, fabrication of sample viscoelastic fluids whose rheological properties are \textit{a priori} known can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action: Real-Time Control of Vortex-Induced Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80% vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.</description>

Abstract: The recent classification of the onset of turbulence as a directed percolation (DP) phase transition has been applied to all major shear flows including pipe, channel, Couette and boundary layer flows. A cornerstone of the DP analogy is the memoryless (Poisson) property of turbulent sites. We here show that, for the classic case of channel flow, neither the decay nor the proliferation of turbulent stripes is memoryless. As demonstrated by a standard analysis of the respective survival curves, isolated channel stripes, in the immediate vicinity of the critical point, age. Consequently, the one to one mapping between turbulent stripes and active DP-sites is not fulfilled in this low Reynolds number regime. In addition, the interpretation of turbulence as a chaotic saddle with supertransient properties, the basis of recent theoretical progress, does not apply to individual localized stripes. The discrepancy between channel flow and the transition models established for pipe and Couette flow, illustrates that seemingly minor geometrical differences between flows can give rise to instabilities and growth mechanisms that fundamentally alter the nature of the transition to turbulence.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Nonlinear Data Assimilation Algorithm for Multi-Layer Flow Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State estimation in multi-layer turbulent flow fields with only a single layer of partial observation remains a challenging yet practically important task. Applications include inferring the state of the deep ocean by exploiting surface observations. Directly implementing an ensemble Kalman filter based on the full forecast model is usually expensive. One widely used method in practice projects the information of the observed layer to other layers via linear regression. However, when nonlinearity in the highly turbulent flow field becomes dominant, the regression solution will suffer from large uncertainty errors. In this paper, we develop a multi-step nonlinear data assimilation method. A sequence of nonlinear assimilation steps is applied from layer to layer recurrently. Fundamentally different from the traditional linear regression approaches, a conditional Gaussian nonlinear system is adopted as the approximate forecast model to characterize the nonlinear dependence between adjacent layers. The estimated posterior is a Gaussian mixture, which can be highly non-Gaussian. Therefore, the multi-step nonlinear data assimilation method can capture strongly turbulent features, especially intermittency and extreme events, and better quantify the inherent uncertainty. Another notable advantage of the multi-step data assimilation method is that the posterior distribution can be solved using closed-form formulae under the conditional Gaussian framework. Applications to the two-layer quasi-geostrophic system with Lagrangian data assimilation show that the multi-step method outperforms the one-step method with linear stochastic flow models, especially as the tracer number and ensemble size increase.</description>

Abstract: Dimensional analysis is one of the most fundamental tools for understanding physical systems. However, the construction of dimensionless variables, as guided by the Buckingham-$\pi$ theorem, is not uniquely determined. Here, we introduce IT-$\pi$, a model-free method that combines dimensionless learning with the principles of information theory. Grounded in the irreducible error theorem, IT-$\pi$ identifies dimensionless variables with the highest predictive power by measuring their shared information content. The approach is able to rank variables by predictability, identify distinct physical regimes, uncover self-similar variables, determine the characteristic scales of the problem, and extract its dimensionless parameters. IT-$\pi$ also provides a bound of the minimum predictive error achievable across all possible models, from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning techniques, naturally enabling a definition of model efficiency. We benchmark IT-$\pi$ across different cases and demonstrate that it offers superior performance and capabilities compared to existing tools. The method is also applied to conduct dimensionless learning for supersonic turbulence, aerodynamic drag on both smooth and irregular surfaces, magnetohydrodynamic power generation, and laser-metal interaction.</description>

      <title>Super resonance: Breaking the bandwidth limit of resonant modes and its application to flow control</title>

Abstract: We report the discovery of super resonance--a new regime of resonant behavior in which a mode's out-of-phase response persists far beyond its classical bandwidth. This effect emerges from a coiled phononic structure composed of a locally resonant elastic metamaterial and architected to support multiple internal energy pathways. These pathways converge at a single structural location, enabling extended modal dominance and significantly broadening the frequency range over which a resonant phase is sustained. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations the implications of this mechanism in the context of flow instability control, where current approaches are inherently constrained by the characteristically narrow spectral bandwidth of conventional resonances. Using a super-resonant phononic subsurface structure interfacing with a channel flow, we show passive simultaneous suppression of four unstable flow perturbations across a frequency range more than five times wider than that is achievable with a standard resonance in an equivalent uncoiled structure. By enabling broadband, passive control of flow instabilities, super resonance overcomes a longstanding limitation in laminar flow control strategies. More broadly, it introduces a powerful new tool for phase-engineered wave-matter interaction. The ability to preserve out-of-phase modal response across wide spectral ranges establishes a fundamental advance in the physics of resonance, with far-reaching implications for suppressing fully developed turbulent flows and beyond.</description>

      <title>Non-Newtonian viscous fluid models with learned rheology accurately reproduce Lagrangian sea ice simulations</title>

Abstract: Polar sea ice is crucial to Earth's climate system. Its dynamics also affect coastal communities, wildlife, and global shipping. Sea ice is typically modeled as a continuum fluid using a model proposed almost 50 years, which is moderately accurate for packed ice, but loses its predictive accuracy outside of the central ice pack. Discrete element methods (DEMs) offer an alternative by resolving the behavior of individual ice floes, including collisions, frictional contact, fracture, and ridging. However, DEMs are generally too costly for large-scale simulations. To address this, we present a framework for inferring rheological behavior from DEM velocity data. We characterize isotropic constitutive laws as scalar functions of the principal invariants of the strain-rate tensor. These functions are parameterized by neural networks trained on DEM data. By combining machine learning and finite element methods, we incorporate the governing partial differential equation (PDE) into the training, requiring to solve a PDE-constrained optimization problem for the network parameters. We find that, over a wide range of ice concentrations, the velocity fields observed in a complex sea ice DEM can be captured by a nonlinear rheology. Depending on the ice concentration, a shear-thinning or a shear-thickening behavior is observed. Moreover, the effective shear viscosity is found to increase by several orders of magnitude with changes as small as 5% in the sea ice concentration. We show that the learned rheology generalizes to different forcing scenarios, time-dependent problems, and settings in which compressibility is not a dominant factor. For these reasons, our framework represents a major step towards developing non-Newtonian models that accurately reproduce observed sea ice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09864</link>

Abstract: It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the cooling wall. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on an approximate quasi-continuum approach. This work examines this effect rigorously by studying evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Numerical results show that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, reaffirming the evaporative refrigeration effect. The present work further reveals that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. While the dominant mechanism is the asymmetry in the molecular distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules at the interface, additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion, similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. The impacts of key parameters, including liquid thickness, Knudsen number, and accommodation coefficient, are investigated. The numerical simulation shows that with a thicker vapor, a thinner liquid film, and a larger accommodation coefficient, leads to stronger evaporative refrigeration effect. This work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning, refrigeration, and membrane distillation.</description>

      <title>An adaptive, data-driven multiscale approach for dense granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of coarse-grained continuum models of dense granular flows is limited by the lack of high-fidelity closure models for granular rheology. One approach to addressing this issue, referred to as the hierarchical multiscale method, is to use a high-fidelity fine-grained model to compute the closure terms needed by the coarse-grained model. The difficulty with this approach is that the overall model can become computationally intractable due to the high computational cost of the high-fidelity model. In this work, we describe a multiscale modeling approach for dense granular flows that utilizes neural networks trained using high-fidelity discrete element method (DEM) simulations to approximate the constitutive granular rheology for a continuum incompressible flow model. Our approach leverages an ensemble of neural networks to estimate predictive uncertainty that allows us to determine whether the rheology at a given point is accurately represented by the neural network model. Additional DEM simulations are only performed when needed, minimizing the number of additional DEM simulations required when updating the rheology. This adaptive coupling significantly reduces the overall computational cost of the approach while controlling the error. In addition, the neural networks are customized to learn regularized rheological behavior to ensure well-posedness of the continuum solution. We first validate the approach using two-dimensional steady-state and decelerating inclined flows. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by modeling three-dimensional sub-aerial granular column collapse for varying initial column aspect ratios, where our multiscale method compares well with the computationally expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-DEM simulation.</description>
