      <title>Self-force and the Schwarzschild star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the self-force acting on a pointlike (electromagnetic or conformal-scalar) charge held fixed on a spacetime with a spherically-symmetric mass distribution of constant density (the Schwarzschild star). We calculate the self-force with two complementary regularization methods, direct and difference regularization, and we find agreement. The Schwarzschild star is shown to be conformal to a three-sphere geometry; we use this conformal symmetry to obtain closed-form expressions for mode solutions. The new results for the self-force come in three forms: series expansions for the self-force in the far field; an approximation that captures the divergence in the self-force near the star's boundary; and as numerical data presented in a selection of plots. We conclude with a discussion of the logarithmic divergence in the self-force in the approach to the star's surface.</description>

      <title>The Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the wake of major breakthroughs in General Relativity during the 1960s, Roger Penrose introduced Strong Cosmic Censorship, a profound conjecture regarding the deterministic nature of the theory. Penrose's proposal has since opened far-reaching new mathematical avenues, revealing connections to fundamental questions about black holes and the nature of gravitational singularities. We review recent advances arising from modern techniques in the theory of partial differential equations as applied to Strong Cosmic Censorship, maintaining a focus on the context of gravitational collapse that gave birth to the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Can we hear beats with pulsar timing arrays?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isolated supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) produces an identical cross-correlation pattern of pulsar timings as an isotropic stochastic background gravitational waves (GWs) generated possibly by inflation. Can there remain the identical cross-correlation pattern in the presence of a secondary SMBHB? To address this issue, the present paper considers GWs with slightly different frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ coming from two different directions. Beats between the two GWs can modify angular correlation patterns. The beat-induced correlation patterns are not stationary but modulated with a beat frequency $f_{beat} \equiv |f_1 - f_2|$. We obtain an analytic formula to present a proof-of-principle that $f_{beat}$ can be measured from the modulated angular correlations.</description>

      <title>Orbital Motion in Spacetimes Influenced by the Presence of Scalar and Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates orbital motion of test particles near compact objects described by solutions involving massless scalar fields, electromagnetic fields, and nonlinear electrodynamics. Specifically, we analyze orbital dynamics in the Janis-Newman-Winicour, Janis-Newman-Winicour-Maxwell, Schwarzschild-Melvin, and Bonnor-Melvin spacetimes, comparing the results with those obtained for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions. We examine the stability of circular orbits and the behavior of epicyclic frequencies under varying physical parameters. Our analysis shows that in certain cases the central object transitions into a naked singularity. Deviations from classical Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions reveal conditions for the existence of multiple photon orbits or marginally stable orbits. In some instances, the geometry allows the presence of two photon orbits -- one stable and one unstable -- with an interesting connection to the region of stable orbits. We find that at lower intensities, the effects of the scalar field and electromagnetic fields are comparable and seemingly interchangeable. However, for a sufficiently strong scalar field, its influence becomes dominant, leading to the emergence of a distinct region of stable orbits near the naked singularity. These effects are illustrated within the framework of optical geometry using embedding diagrams.</description>

      <title>Exploring gravitational impulse via quantum Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational impulse by using the generalized formulation of the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE), wherein the initial states are taken as wave packets rather than plane waves. The QBE equation operates within an open quantum system framework. Using this approach, we can analyze the two-body gravitational scattering by considering one body as part of the environment and the other as the system. Similarly, we apply this approach to the gravitational impulse of a photon due to a massive object, during which we consider the photon as the system and the massive object as the environment. In this methodology, we use the forward scattering term of the extended QBE to compute the time evolution of the momentum operator associated with the system. While this term vanishes when considering point particles, we demonstrate its persistence when using wave packets to describe both massive particles and the photon field. Through this procedure, we obtain the leading order of the system's impulse. The results reported here are entirely consistent with the previous approaches.</description>

      <title>On thermodynamics of charged and accelerating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider various C-metric spacetimes describing charged and (slowly) accelerating AdS black holes in different theories of (non-linear) electrodynamics and revisit their thermodynamic properties. Focusing first on the Maxwell theory, we find a parametrization of the metric where we can eliminate the non-trivial `normalization' of the boost Killing vector which was crucial for obtaining consistent thermodynamics in previous studies. We also calculate the Euclidean action using i) the standard holographic renormalization and ii) using the topological renormalization, showing that in the presence of overall cosmic string tension the two do not agree. These results are also extended to accelerating black holes in ModMax and RegMax non-linear electrodynamics. Interestingly, for the latter the electrostatic potential picks up a modification, that remains to be explained, but is consistent with the topological renormalization and the (generalized) Hawking--Ross prescription. Our study indicates that thermodynamics of charged accelerating black holes is far from being completely understood.</description>

      <title>Naked and truly naked rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, it was noticed that in some space-times with Killing horizons some curvature components, responsible for tidal forces, small or even zero in the static frame, become enhanced from the viewpoint of a falling observer. This leads to the notion of so-called naked black holes. If some components in the frame attached to a free-falling observer formally diverge, although scalar invariants remain finite, such space-times was named "truly naked black holes" (in mathematical language, one can speak about non-scalar singularity). Previous results included static spherically symmetric or distorted static metrics. In the present work, we generalized them to include rotation in consideration. We also scrutiny how the algebraic type can change in the vicinity of the horizon due to local Lorentz boost. Our approach essentially uses the Newman-Penrose formalism, so we analyze the behavior of Weyl scalar for different kinds of observers.</description>

      <title>Regular Black Hole from gravitational collapse of dust and radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A black hole is the end state of the gravitational collapse of massive stars. However, a typical black hole contains a singularity and to avoid singularity formation we have to violate a strong energy condition that states that gravity must attract. The nature of the matter that prevents the singularity formation is still unknown. In this paper, we offer a simple model of gravitational collapse of dust and radiation. In the simplest case, such a model leads to a singular black hole. However, if we assume an energy exchange between dust and radiation, which increases towards the center of the collapsing cloud, then it becomes possible to construct a model of a regular black hole. We identify the conditions under which a regular center is possible and also give an explicit example of how such an interaction leads to a regular center.</description>

      <title>Optical Images of Mini Boson Stars in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the optical properties of mini boson stars within the framework of Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, adopting a quadratic form $f(R) = R + \xi R^2$, where $\xi$ is the gravitational coupling constant. By deriving the modified scalar Lagrangian and solving the field equations numerically, we explore photon trajectories and the resulting optical images under spherical light sources and thin accretion disks. Unlike Schwarzschild black holes (BHs), boson stars lack stable photon rings due to the positive second derivative of their effective potential. Consequently, their images are dominated by direct emissions from photons completing a single orbit. The study examines the dependence of the optical characteristics on the initial scalar field $\psi_0$ and the coupling parameter $\xi$. Numerical results include effective potentials, redshift maps, and detailed imaging of boson stars, providing insights into distinguishing boson stars from black holes using high-resolution astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Probing the Unstable Spectrum of Schwarzschild-like Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the pseudospectrum of a Schwarzschild-like spacetime within the framework of black hole perturbation theory to analyze a counterintuitive assertion regarding the instability of quasinormal modes. Recent findings suggest that random perturbations to the effective potential associated with gravitational waves may enhance the stability of the underlying wave operator, thereby yielding a stable spectrum of randomly displaced quasinormal modes. Given the unphysical nature of such random perturbations, this work examines these findings within a spacetime that inherently exhibits a perturbed quasinormal spectrum. We find that, in contrast to the QNM spectrum of the Schwarzschild spacetime under random perturbations, the quasinormal spectrum of a Schwarzschild-like black hole deformed through a physically motivated implementation of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko parametrization is unstable. In particular, we show that the pseudospectra of these Schwarzschild-like black holes do not display the typical features associated with wave operators that yield stable quasinormal spectra. We corroborate our findings by computing the quasinormal spectra when additional (ad-hoc) deformations are added to the effective potential of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko black hole. We also argue that when multiple perturbation sources are present, identifying the origin of the instability may be difficult.</description>

      <title>Redshift leverage for the search of GRB neutrinos affected by quantum properties of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some previous studies based on IceCube neutrinos had found intriguing preliminary evidence that some of them might be GRB neutrinos with travel times affected by quantum properties of spacetime delaying them proportionally to their energy, an effect often labeled as "quantum-spacetime-induced in-vacuo dispersion". Those previous studies looked for candidate GRB neutrinos in a fixed (neutrino-energy-independent) time window after the GRB onset and relied rather crucially on crude estimates of the redshift of GRBs whose redshift has not been measured. We here introduce a complementary approach to the search of quantum-spacetime-affected GRB neutrinos which restricts the analysis to GRBs of sharply known redshift, and, in a way that we argue is synergistic with having sharp information on redshift, adopts a neutrino-energy-dependent time window. We find that knowing the redshift of the GRBs strengthens the analysis enough to compensate for the fact that of course the restriction to GRBs of known redshift reduces the number of candidate GRB neutrinos. And rather remarkably our estimate of the magnitude of the in-vacuo-dispersion effects is fully consistent with what had been found using the previous approach. Our findings are still inconclusive, since their significance is quantified by a $p$-value of little less than $0.01$, but provide motivation for monitoring the accrual of neutrino observations by IceCube and KM3NeT as well as for further refinements of the strategy of analysis here proposed.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Mitigating Machine Learning Biases for the Gravitational-wave Detection Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matched-filtering is a long-standing technique for the optimal detection of known signals in stationary Gaussian noise. However, it has known departures from optimality when operating on unknown signals in real noise and suffers from computational inefficiencies in its pursuit to near-optimality. A compelling alternative that has emerged in recent years to address this problem is deep learning. Although it has shown significant promise when applied to the search for gravitational-waves in detector noise, we demonstrate the existence of a multitude of learning biases that hinder generalisation and detection performance. Our work identifies the sources of a set of 11 interconnected biases present in the supervised learning of the gravitational-wave detection problem, and contributes mitigation tactics and training strategies to concurrently address them. We introduce, Sage, a machine-learning based binary black hole search pipeline. We evaluate our pipeline on the injection study presented in the Machine Learning Gravitational-Wave Search Challenge and show that Sage detects ~11.2% more signals than the benchmark PyCBC analysis at a false alarm rate of one per month in O3a noise. Moreover, we also show that it can detect ~48.29% more signals than the previous best performing machine-learning pipeline on the same dataset. We empirically prove that our pipeline has the capability to effectively handle out-of-distribution noise power spectral densities and reject non-Gaussian transient noise artefacts. By studying machine-learning biases and conducting empirical investigations to understand the reasons for performance improvement/degradation, we aim to address the need for interpretability of machine-learning methods for gravitational-wave detection.

      <title>Scalar field source Teleparallel Robertson-Walker F(T)-gravity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the teleparallel Robertson--Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a scalar field source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity field equations (FEs) for each $k$-parameter value case added by a scalar field to find new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For $k=0$, we find an easy-to-compute $F(T)$ solution formula applicable for any scalar field source. Then, we obtain, for $k=-1$ and $+1$ situations, some new analytical $F(T)$ solutions, only for specific $n$-parameter values and well-determined scalar field cases. We can find by those computations a large number of analytical teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions independent of any scalar potential $V(\phi)$ expression. The $V(\phi)$ independence makes the FE solving and computations easier. The new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications in dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy and quintom models of physical processes.</description>

      <title>Topological Leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard lore, the baryon asymmetry of the present universe is attributed to the leptogenesis from the sterile right-handed neutrino with heavy Majorana mass decaying into the Standard Model's leptons at the very early universe -- called the Majorana fermion's leptogenesis; while the electroweak sphaleron causes baryogenesis at a later time. In this work, we propose a new mechanism, named topological leptogenesis, to explain the lepton asymmetry. Topological leptogenesis replaces some of the sterile neutrinos by introducing a new gapped topological order sector (whose low-energy exhibits topological quantum field theory with long-range entanglement) that can cancel the baryon minus lepton $({\bf B} - {\bf L})$ mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly of the Standard Model. Then the Beyond-the-Standard-Model dark matter consists of topological quantum matter, such that the gapped non-particle excitations of extended line and surface defect with fractionalization and anyon charges can decay into the Standard Model particles. In addition, gravitational leptogenesis can be regarded as an intermediate step (between Majorana particle leptogenesis and topological non-particle leptogenesis) to mediate such decaying processes from the highly entangled gapped topological order excitations.</description>

Abstract: For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. Peculiar motions on the sky are only measured for a few cases. With increasingly detailed observations, the assumption that line-of-sight velocities suffice for an accurate and precise reconstruction of galaxy kinematics needs to be re-investigated and the impact of perpendicular velocities to be quantified. We analyse the motion of two galaxies with arbitrary velocities, determine their mutual velocity on an arbitrary background, and compare this general relative velocity to the one from line-of-sight components only. The latter are known as ``minor and major infall models'' established by Karachentsev and Kashibadze (2006). Our derivations reveal that the infall models approximate the radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies with small angular separations, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight velocities. For larger angles, the minor infall model is mostly suitable when perpendicular velocity components are negligible and there is no information about the tangential velocity of the binary. The major infall model is best suitable when the motion is mainly radial and symmetry assumptions cancel the tangential and one perpendicular component. The latter often requires to transition from galaxy binaries to groups or clusters, as we show quantitatively. We give an encompassing overview how the infall models over- and under-estimate general binary or $N$-body motions. We quantify the impact of perpendicular velocity components, sparse sampling, and deviations of the tracer-galaxies from the motion in an embedding gravitational potential which are related to the angular momentum of the structure.

      <title>Implications of Magnetic Flux-Disk Mass Correlation in Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers for GRB sub-populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform numerical relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers with a fixed mass ratio of $q = 3$, varying the BH spin to produce a wide range of post-merger accretion disk masses. Our high-order numerical scheme, fine resolution, and Large Eddy Simulation techniques enable us to achieve likely the most resolved BH-NS merger simulations to date, capturing the post-merger magnetic field amplification driven by turbulent dynamo processes. Following tidal disruption and during disk formation, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the spiral arm drives a turbulent state in which the magnetic field, initialized to a realistic average value of $10^{11}\, \rm{G}$, grows to an average of approximately $10^{14}\, \rm{G}$ in the first $\approx 20\, \mathrm{ms}$ post-merger. Notably, the dimensionless magnetic flux on the BH, $ \phi $, evolves similarly across nearly two orders of magnitude in disk mass. This similarity, along with estimates from longer numerical simulations of the decay of the mass accretion rate, suggests a universal timescale at which the dimensionless flux saturates at a magnetically arrested state (MAD) such that $ \phi \approx 50 $ at $t_{\rm MAD} \gtrsim 10\,{\rm s}$. The unified framework of Gottlieb et al. (2023) established that the MAD timescale sets the duration of the resulting compact binary gamma-ray burst (cbGRB), implying that all BH-NS mergers contribute to the recently detected new class of long-duration cbGRBs.</description>

      <title>Type-III Scotogenic Model: Inflation, Dark Matter and Collider Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an extension of the Type-III scotogenic model by incorporating a real singlet scalar. This scalar plays a crucial role as the inflaton due to its non-minimal coupling with the Ricci scalar. The inflaton field subsequently decays into other particles within the Type-III scotogenic framework. In this framework, the inert scalar doublet and fermion triplet are crucial for neutrino mass generation and present strong candidates for 25\% energy budget or dark matter in the Universe. We study their relic abundance and potential for direct detection. Furthermore, we discuss possible observational signals that could be identified in future collider experiments.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjectured relation between the energy-momentum and the displacement norm of superconformal defects. The proof completes earlier results, and shows that supersymmetry identifies two natural notions of brane tension in Anti-de Sitter gravity. As a byproduct we show that a modification of the energy-momentum tensor that removes the stress of static superconformal defects, ensures also that the radiation these emit obeys the Null Energy Condition. This sheds new light on the radiation-reaction problem for moving charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider DHOST inflationary models with a shift symmetry leading to a de Sitter space-time at the background cosmological level. Deviations from scale invariance of the scalar and tensor perturbations follow from the breaking of the shift symmetry by quadratic and quartic operators. These models show a strong violation of the consistency relation of single-field inflationary models with a very flat spectrum of tensor perturbations. This opens up the prospects of future detection of primordial gravitational waves by mHz experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform one-dimensional linear analysis and numerical simulations of the propagation of Alfven waves in a force-free magnetosphere along magnetic field lines around a spinning black hole. We use the results to investigate the dynamic process of wave propagation and energy transport for Alfven waves. As in a previous study using the Banados--Teitelboim--Zanelli spacetime (Koide et al. 2022), the Alfven wave induces a fast magnetosonic wave in the case of a spinning black hole. Energy conservation is confirmed when this additional induced magnetosonic wave is considered. We also observe the reflection of the inwardly propagating Alfven wave around the static limit, which is prohibited in theory when using the eikonal approximation.</description>

      <title>Probing new scalars with the lepton anomalous magnetic moment and the weak equivalence principle violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new scalar particle with generic couplings to the standard-model particles is a possible source for the lepton anomalous magnetic moment and the violation of the weak equivalence principle. Here, one-loop contributions to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment, involving the scalar-photon and scalar-lepton couplings, are calculated. Then, with the recent experimental results of the electron anomalous magnetic moment, the muon anomalous magnetic moment, and the MICROSCOPE mission, we find that a scalar which couples merely to the photon or leptons can not be consistent with three experimental results. It has to couple to both the photon and leptons simultaneously. Improved constraints on scalar-lepton and scalar-photon couplings are set: $|\lambda_e|=(1.8-8.2)\times 10^{-6}$, $|\lambda_\mu|=(2.5-4.8)\times 10^{-4}$, and $|\lambda_\gamma|=(1.5-6.5)\times 10^{-14}$ ${\rm eV^{-1}}\, {\rm or}\,\, (1.4-6.1)\times 10^{-13}$ ${\rm eV^{-1}}$. We find that the naive scaling relationship between the scalar-muon coupling and the scalar-electron coupling is not favored by three experimental results. Furthermore, we show that the minimal standard-model extension by one scalar is also not favored for scalar mass below $10^4$ eV.</description>

      <title>Detection of Intermediate-Mass Ratio Inspirals in Globular Clusters: Revealing the Brownian Motion with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) formed by stellar-mass compact objects orbiting intermediate-mass black holes will be detected by future gravitational wave (GW) observatories like TianQin, LISA, and AION. We study a set of 100 IMRI systems in globular clusters obtained from MOCCA simulations to study their detectability. Furthermore, we model the Brownian motion of the IMRIs induced by weak interactions with the surrounding field of stars and include its effect on the GW's phase through Doppler and aberrational phase shift. We find that a small fraction of IMRIs ($&lt;10\,\%$) will have signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) high enough to be detected by TianQin, LISA, and AION. However, for all sources detected the SNR is high enough to discern the Brownian motion of the IMRI. More precisely, we find that the match between the signal containing the effect of the Brownian motion and a waveform model without this effect is in most cases low ($&lt;0.5$). These results highlight the importance of including the interaction of IMRIs with the surrounding field of stars to obtain proper detection but also show the possibility of studying the environment of the source using GWs.</description>

      <title>Navigating permanent underdetermination in dark energy and inflationary cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify troubling cases of so-called `permanent underdetermination' in both dark energy and inflationary cosmology. We bring to bear (a) a taxonomy of possible responses to underdetermination, and (b) an understanding of both dark energy and inflationary cosmology from an effective field point of view. We argue that, under certain conditions, there are available viable responses which can alleviate at least some of the concerns about underdetermination in the dark energy and inflationary sectors. However, outside of these specific scenarios, the epistemic threat of permanent underdetermination will persist.</description>

      <title>Forecasted Detection Limits on the (Dark) Matter Density in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are among the most powerful known sources of gravitational waves (GWs). Accordingly, these systems could dominate GW emission in the micro- and millihertz frequency range. Within this domain, SMBHs evolve rapidly and merge with each other. Dynamical friction from stars and gas at the centers of galaxies typically helps to bring together two SMBHs when they are at relatively far separations ($\approx$ kpc $-$ 100 pc), but becomes less efficient at smaller separations. However, dark matter (DM) spikes around SMBHs could enhance dynamical friction at close separations and, thus, shorten the evolution times. In this paper, we simulate the effects of DM spikes on GW signals in the micro- to millihertz frequency range and confirm that the GW signals from SMBHBs with DM spikes can be clearly distinguished from those without any additional matter. Making use of the projected sensitivity curve of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we forecast upper limits for the (dark) matter density for given future SMBHB observations. We then compare these thresholds with the theoretical density profiles expected for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) spikes.</description>

      <title>Revealing turbulent Dark Matter via merging of self-Gravitating condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-gravitating condensates have been proposed as potential candidates for modelling dark matter. In this paper, we numerically investigate the dynamics of dark matter utilizing the merging of self-gravitating condensates. We have used the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson model and identified distinct turbulent regimes based on the merging speed of the condensate. As a result of collision, we notice the appearance of various dark soliton-mediated instabilities that finally lead to the turbulent state characterized by Kolmogorov-like turbulence scaling \( \varepsilon_{\mathrm{kin}}^i \sim k^{-5/3} \) in the infrared and \( \varepsilon_{\mathrm{kin}}^i \sim k^{-3} \) in the ultraviolet regions. The compressible spectrum suggests weak-wave turbulence. The turbulent fluctuations in the condensate cease as the vortices formed via soliton decay are expelled to the condensate's periphery, manifested in the transferring of kinetic energy from incompressible and compressible flows to the quantum pressure energy. We also establish the significant role played by the self-gravitating trap in determining the distribution of compressible kinetic energy and the resulting density waves, which differ markedly from those observed in atomic condensates under harmonic confinement. Our study may offer valuable insights into the merging of binary stars and open new avenues for understanding the structure and dynamics of the dark matter through self-gravitating condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order tensor perturbations induced by primordial fluctuations play a crucial role in probing small-scale physics, but gauge dependence of their energy density has remained a fundamental challenge in cosmological perturbation theory. We address this issue by introducing a boundary condition-based filtering method that extracts physical radiation through the Sommerfeld criterion. We demonstrate that after filtering non-physical modes, the energy density of secondary gravitational waves becomes gauge-invariant and exhibits physically consistent behavior in the sub-horizon limit. This approach provides a unified framework for both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations, enhancing theoretical predictions and observational signatures of early universe physics.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we discuss a scenario of a micro-Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) associated with high-speed white dwarfs and stellar-mass black holes. It happens at galactic centers, where a white dwarf orbiting around the massive black hole scatters with a stellar-mass black hole in its early extreme mass-ratio inspiral stage. We estimate the formation rate, perform a series of hydro simulations to investigate the amount of accreted and unbound mass as a function of impact radius and speed, and discuss the main EM signatures: an X-ray flare (micro-TDE) followed by a relatively faint (TDE-type) optical flare. The properties of some of the transient X-ray bursts found by Einstein Probe are consistent with the micro-TDE scenario considered here.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we construct a scattering theory for the massive and charged Dirac fields in the interiors of sub-extremal Kerr-Newman(-anti)-de Sitter black holes. More precisely, we show existence, uniqueness and asymptotic completeness of scattering data for such Dirac fields from the event horizon of the black hole to the Cauchy horizon. Our approach relies on constructing the wave operators where the Hamiltonian of the full dynamics is time-dependent. To prove asymptotic completeness, we use two methods. The first involves a comparison operator, while for the second we introduce and employ a symmetry operator of the Dirac equation.</description>

      <title>Kasner-like description of spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric spacetimes with scalar matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric spacetimes obeying the Einstein equations, in the presence of matter. We consider in particular matter described by a scalar field, both in the presence of an electromagnetic field and without. We prove that if a spacelike singularity obeying several reasonable assumptions is formed, then the Hawking mass, the Kretschmann scalar, and the matter fields have inverse polynomial blow-up rates near the singularity that may be described precisely.
  Furthermore, one may view the resulting spacetime in the context of the BKL heuristics regarding space-like singularities in relativistic cosmology. In particular, near any point $p$ on the singular boundary in our spherically symmetric spacetime, we obtain a leading order BKL-type expansion, including a description of Kasner exponents associated to $p$.
  This provides a rigorous description of a detailed correspondence between Kasner-like singularities most often associated to the cosmological setting, and the singularities observed in (spherically symmetric) gravitational collapse. Moreover, we outline a program concerning the study of the stability and instability of spacelike singularities in the latter picture, both outside of spherical symmetry and within (where the electromagnetic field acts as a proxy for angular momentum).</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study spin-0 particles in a spacetime whose structure is determined by a homogeneous magnetic field and a cosmological constant. For this purpose, we take into account a framework based on the Bonnor-Melvin solution with the inclusion of the cosmological constant. We write the Klein-Gordon equation, solve it, and determine the Landau levels. The effects of scalar and vector potentials are considered, and we investigate the influence of the parameters of the theory on the results, which present observable effects. The implications of the physics of a stellar model based on this framework are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Horizon-bound objects: Kerr--Vaidya solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kerr-Vaidya metrics are the simplest dynamical axially-symmetric solutions, all of which violate the null energy condition and thus are consistent with the formation of a trapped region in finite time according to distant observers. We examine different classes of Kerr-Vaidya metrics, and find two which possess spherically-symmetric counterparts that are compatible with the finite formation time of a trapped region. These solutions describe evaporating black holes and expanding white holes. We demonstrate a consistent description of accreting black holes based on the ingoing Kerr--Vaidya metric with increasing mass, and show that the model can be extended to cases where the angular momentum to mass ratio varies. For such metrics we describe conditions on their dynamical evolution required to maintain asymptotic flatness. Pathologies are also identified in the evaporating white hole geometry in the form of an intermediate singularity accessible by timelike observers. We also describe a generalization of the equivalence between Rindler and Schwarzschild horizons to Kerr--Vaidya black holes, and describe the relevant geometric constructions.</description>

      <title>Relational dynamics and Page-Wootters formalism in group field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group field theory posits that spacetime is emergent and is hence defined without any background notion of space or time; dynamical questions are formulated in relational terms, in particular using (scalar) matter degrees of freedom as time. Unlike in canonical quantisation of gravitational systems, there is no obvious notion of coordinate transformations or constraints, and established quantisation methods cannot be directly applied. As a result, different canonical formalisms for group field theory have been discussed in the literature. We address these issues using a parametrised version of group field theory, in which all (geometry and matter) degrees of freedom evolve in a fiducial parameter. There is a constraint associated to the freedom of reparametrisation and the Dirac quantisation programme can be implemented. Using the "trinity of relational dynamics", we show that the resulting "clock-neutral" theory is entirely equivalent to a deparametrised canonical group field theory, interpreted in terms of the Page-Wootters formalism. Our results not only show that the deparametrised quantisation is fully covariant and can be seen as encoding the dynamics of joint quantum matter and geometry degrees of freedom, they also appear to be the first application of the Page-Wootters formalism directly to non-perturbative quantum gravity. We show extensions to a setting in which many independent gauge symmetries are introduced, which connects to the "multi-fingered time" idea in quantum gravity and provides a somewhat novel extension of the Page-Wootters formalism.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Black Bounce to Transversable Wormhole Analytically Connected to an asymptotically $AdS_5$ Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the recent approach from reference [1] to obtain complete and analytic solutions (both brane and bulk) of a Simpson-Vaser (SV) geometry within a braneworld framework. The embedded geometry can represent a traversable wormhole (TWH), a one-way wormhole (OOWH), or a regular black hole (RBH). The resulting geometry is regular everywhere, eliminating any singularity or local de-Sitter core at the origin and on the brane location, where the regular geometry is given by the SV geometry. The throat of TWHs or OOWHs can extend into the extra dimension. The event horizon of RBH extends along the extra dimension, prompting speculation on the extension of entropy into this dimension. Although the induced geometry is characterized by tension, acting akin to a positive cosmological constant (thus potentially representing empty space), the induced four-dimensional geometry remains regular. There is no need to introduce additional energy sources on the brane to achieve this regularity. Hence, the brane's geometry, which may depict an RBH, TWH, or OWWH, is influenced by the geometric properties of the bulk</description>

      <title>Optimal reconstruction of the Hellings and Downs correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10968v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) detect gravitational waves (GWs) via the correlations they create in the arrival times of pulses from different pulsars. The mean correlation, a function of the angle between the directions to two pulsars, was predicted in 1983 by Hellings and Downs (HD). Observation of this angular pattern is crucial evidence that GWs are present, so PTAs "reconstruct the HD curve'' by estimating the correlation using pulsar pairs separated by similar angles. Several studies have examined the amount by which this curve is expected to differ from the HD mean. The variance arises because (a) a finite set of pulsars at specific sky locations is used, (b) the GW sources interfere, and (c) the data are contaminated by noise. Here, for a Gaussian ensemble of sources, we predict that variance by constructing an optimal estimator of the HD correlation, taking into account the pulsar sky locations and the frequency distribution of the GWs and the pulsar noise. The variance is a ratio: the numerator depends upon the pulsar sky locations, and the denominator is the (effective) number of frequency bins for which the GW signal dominates the noise. In effect, after suitable combination, each such frequency bin gives an independent estimate of the HD correlation.</description>

      <title>Spatial curvature in coincident gauge $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmologies with arbitrary spatial curvature for the symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity, giving the first presentation of their coincident gauge form. Our approach explicitly starts with the cosmological Killing vectors and constructs the coincident gauge coordinates adapted to these Killing vectors. We then obtain three distinct spatially flat branches and a single spatially curved branch. Contrary to some previous claims, we show that all branches can be studied in this gauge-fixed formalism, which offers certain conceptual advantages. We also identify common flaws that have appeared in the literature regarding the coincident gauge. Using this approach, we find that both the flat and spatially curved solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity can be seen as equivalent to the metric teleparallel $f(T)$ models, demonstrating a deeper connection between these theories. This is accomplished by studying the connection equation of motion, which can be interpreted as a consistency condition in the gauge-fixed approach. Finally, we discuss the role of diffeomorphism invariance and local Lorentz invariance in these geometric modifications of gravity.</description>

      <title>Large-kernel Convolutional Neural Networks for Wide Parameter-Space Searches of Continuous Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of wide-parameter-space searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) is limited by their high computational cost. Deep learning is being studied as an alternative method to replace various aspects of a CW search. In previous work arXiv:2305.01057[gr-qc], new design principles were presented for deep neural network (DNN) search of CWs and such DNNs were trained to perform a targeted search with matched filtering sensitivity. In this paper, we adapt these design principles to build a DNN architecture for wide parameter-space searches in 10 days of data from two detectors (H1 and L1). We train a DNN for each of the benchmark cases: six all-sky searches and eight directed searches at different frequencies in the search band of 20 - 1000 Hz. We compare our results to the DNN sensitivity achieved from Dreissigacker and Prix arXiv:2005.04140[gr-qc] and find that our trained DNNs are more sensitive in all the cases. The absolute improvement in detection probability ranges from 6.5% at 20 Hz to 38% at 1000 Hz in the all-sky cases and from 1.5% at 20 Hz to 59.4% at 500 Hz in the directed cases. An all-sky DNN trained on the entire search band of 20 - 1000 Hz shows a high sensitivity at all frequencies providing a proof of concept for training a single DNN to perform the entire search. We also study the generalization of the DNN performance to signals with different signal amplitude, frequency and the dependence of the DNN sensitivity on sky position.</description>

      <title>Cold Collapse and Bounce of an FLRW Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collapse of spherical cold clouds beyond black hole formation to investigate the possibility of a bounce in the in-falling matter when a critical density or pressure is reached. As a first step, we analyse the pressureless collapse in general relativity (GR), where an analytic solution exists, and demonstrate that an equivalent Newtonian solution can be derived. Such equivalence also holds for spherically symmetric perfect fluids with uniform density and non-vanishing pressure. We numerically investigate the Newtonian collapse of such clouds with masses of $5$, $20$, and $1000$ M$_\odot$ obeying a polytropic equation of state (EoS). By choosing EoS parameters inspired by typical neutron star conditions, we observe bounces at and above nuclear saturation density. Assuming approximate uniformity, we explore the equivalent GR behaviour of the matter during the bounce. Our findings are as follows: (i) A GR bounce occurs around the ground state of the matter, characterized by $P = -\rho$. (ii) The GR solution differs significantly from the Newtonian result due to the presence of curvature ($k \neq 0$). (iii) Both the curvature and the ground state are crucial factors in allowing a GR bounce to occur.</description>

Abstract: In this note we prove the Riemannian analog of black hole mode stability for Hermitian, non-self-dual gravitational instantons which are either asymptotically locally flat (ALF) and Ricci-flat, or compact and Einstein with positive cosmological constant. We show that the Teukolsky equation on any such manifold is a positive definite operator. We also discuss the compatibility of the results with the existence of negative modes associated to variational instabilities.</description>

      <title>Proton decay in de Sitter environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01892v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of proton in the de Sitter environment is governed by the temperature $T=H/\pi$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. This temperature is twice larger than the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. This demonstrates the physical difference of two processes. The temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the proton decay rate in the local process which takes well inside the cosmological horizon. While the Gibbons-Hawking temperature can be related to the processes which involve the Hawking photons or other particles radiated from the cosmological horizon. The same temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the radiation of electron-positron pairs by positron or by other object in the de Sitter environment. Creation of matter and its thermalization in the de Sitter heat bath leads to the energy exchange between matter and quantum vacuum and finally to the decay of the de Sitter state towards the Minkowski vacuum. The lesson for the Unruh effect is also discussed. One may expect the similar separation of effects governed by two different temperatures: the effects related to the Rindler horizon with the Unruh temperature $T_{\rm U}=a/2\pi$ and the local radiation with $T=a/\pi=2T_{\rm U}$.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>

Abstract: The ESA/NASA joint LISA (laser interferometer space antenna) mission is designed to detect gravitational waves, which relies crucially on maintaining three-spacecraft constellation as close to an equilateral triangle with a designed distance as possible. Efforts have been made to achieve this goal by using various simplified models to make it easy to approximately solve the complex problem. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem using exact nonlinear Kepler's orbit equations. It is shown that the optimal solution based on the exact nonlinear Kepler's orbit equations gives a better solution than the previously obtained ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in the study of black hole (BH) perturbations, both within the framework of general modified gravity theories and in complex environments. However, a well-established conclusion regarding the boundary conditions of the perturbed fields remains elusive. In this paper, we investigate the boundary conditions for a general perturbation at spatial infinity and the event horizon of a black hole (BH) described by a generic metric that is stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat, and respects the condition of circularity. Our analysis is independent of any specific BH model or the nature of the perturbed field. In particular, by extending the formulation introduced by Teukolsky and utilizing purely geometric principles, we derive a universal expression for the boundary condition at the horizon. This expression is elegantly formulated in terms of the physical quantities at the event horizon, specifically the BH's surface gravity and angular velocity. The results presented in this work may provide valuable insights for the calculation of quasinormal modes and the gravitational waves generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, extending beyond the standard Kerr case.</description>

Abstract: The formation of the cosmic structures in the late Universe is considered using Vlasov kinetic approach. The crucial point is the use of the gravitational potential with repulsive term of the cosmological constant which provides a solution to the Hubble tension, that is the Hubble parameter for the late Universe has to differ from its global cosmological value. This also provides a mechanism of formation of stationary semi-periodic gravitating structures of voids and walls, so that the cosmological constant has a role of the scaling and hence can be compared with the observational data for given regions. The considered mechanism of the structure formation in late cosmological epoch then is succeeding the epoch described by the evolution of primordial density fluctuations.</description>

In fact, this solution belongs to a more general class of solutions described by Herdeiro in [7].

More specifically, we describe the general charged rotating black holes with NUT charge and present some of their properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.08744v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Magrathea-Pathfinder, a relativistic ray-tracing framework that can reconstruct the past light cone of observers in cosmological simulations. The code directly computes the 3D trajectory of light rays through the null geodesic equations, with the weak-field limit as its only approximation. This approach offers high levels of versatility while removing the need for many of the standard ray-tracing approximations such as plane-parallel, Born, or multiple-lens. Moreover, the use of adaptive integration steps and interpolation strategies based on adaptive-mesh refinement (AMR) grids allows Magrathea-Pathfinder to accurately account for the non-linear regime of structure formation and fully take advantage of the small-scale gravitational clustering. To handle very large N-body simulations, the framework has been designed as a high-performance computing post-processing tool relying on a hybrid parallelization that combines MPI tasks with C++11 std::threads. In this paper, we describe how realistic cosmological observables can be computed from numerical simulation using ray-tracing techniques. We discuss in particular the production of simulated catalogues and sky maps that account for all the observational effects considering first-order metric perturbations (such as peculiar velocities, gravitational potential, integrated Sachs-Wolfe, time-delay, and gravitational lensing). We perform convergence tests of our gravitational lensing algorithms and conduct performance benchmarks of the null geodesic integration procedures. Magrathea-Pathfinder introduces sophisticated ray-tracing tools to make the link between the space of N-body simulations and light-cone observables. This should provide new ways of exploring existing cosmological probes and building new ones beyond standard assumptions in order to prepare for the next generation of large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>A Gauss-Bonnet formula for the renormalized area of minimal submanifolds of Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds</title>

Abstract: Assuming the extrinsic $Q$-curvature admits a decomposition into the Pfaffian, a scalar conformal submanifold invariant, and a tangential divergence, we prove that the renormalized area of an even-dimensional minimal submanifold of a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold can be expressed as a linear combination of its Euler characteristic and the integral of a scalar conformal submanifold invariant. We derive such a decomposition of the extrinsic $Q$-curvature in dimensions two and four, thereby recovering and generalizing results of Alexakis-Mazzeo and Tyrrell, respectively. We also conjecture such a decomposition for general natural submanifold scalars whose integral over compact submanifolds is conformally invariant, and verify our conjecture in dimensions two and four. Our results also apply to the area of a compact even-dimensional minimal submanifold of an Einstein manifold.</description>

      <title>Generation of effective massive Spin-2 fields through spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity and quantum field theory are the cornerstones of our understanding of physical processes, from subatomic to cosmic scales. While both theories work remarkably well in their tested domains, they show minimal overlap. However, our research challenges this separation by revealing that non-perturbative effects bridge these distinct domains. We introduce a novel mechanism wherein, at linear order, spin-2 fields around an arbitrary background acquire \emph{effective mass} due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of either global or local symmetry of complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. The action of the spin-2 field is identical to the extended Fierz-Pauli (FP) action, corresponding to the mass deformation parameter $\alpha = 1/2$. We show that this occurs due to the effect of SSB on the variation of the energy-momentum tensor of the matter field, which has a dominant effect during SSB. The extended FP action has a salient feature, compared to the standard FP action: the action has 6 degrees of freedom with no ghosts. For local $U(1)$ SSB, we establish that the effective mass of spin-2 fields is related to the mass of the gauge boson and the electric charge of the complex scalar field. Interestingly, our results indicate that the millicharged dark matter scalar fields, generating dark photons, can produce a mass of spin-2 fields of the same order as the Hubble constant $(H_0)$. Hence, we argue that the dark sector offers a natural explanation for the acceleration of the current Universe.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving spacetime mean curvature flow in initial data sets and applications to General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math. 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>The DAWES review: Gravitational-wave burst astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over a hundred gravitational-wave signals have now been detected from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars, but other sources of gravitational waves have not yet been discovered. Some of the most violent explosive events in the Universe are predicted to emit bursts of gravitational waves, and may result in the next big multi-messenger discovery. Gravitational-wave burst signals often have an unknown waveform shape, and unknown gravitational-wave energy, due to unknown or very complicated progenitor astrophysics. Potential sources of gravitational-wave bursts include core-collapse supernovae, cosmic strings, fast radio bursts, eccentric binary systems, and gravitational-wave memory. In this review, we discuss the astrophysical properties of the main predicted sources of gravitational-wave bursts, and the known features of their gravitational-wave emission. We summarise their future detection prospects, and discuss the challenges of searching for gravitational-wave burst signals and interpreting the astrophysics of the source.</description>

      <title>Do we live on the End of the World?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario of a de Sitter universe living on an End-of-the-World brane. Motivated by the Swampland programme and in particular the Cobordism Conjecture, we consider a compact region of AdS$_5$ nucleating from nothing, with a dS$_4$ living on its boundary. We show that it can equivalently be interpreted as an up-tunnelling from AdS$_5$ with cosmological constant $\Lambda\to -\infty$, following Brown and Dahlen's proposal for 'nothing'. Their picture naively leads to the conclusion that the brane has infinite negative tension. But we show that it becomes finite and positive once we employ holographic renormalization, recovering the Bubble of Something where the domain wall becomes a boundary of spacetime. The same holds true in any number of dimensions and, moreover, at the level of metric perturbations. This provides motivation for alternative routes of obtaining cosmology from quantum gravity or string theory using domain walls, departing from conventional vacuum approaches.</description>

      <title>Spacetime and Planck mass generation from scale-invariant degenerate gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a gravitational model based on local Lorentz invariance and general coordinate invariance. The model incorporates classical scale invariance, which forbids dimensionful parameters, and the irreversible vierbein postulate, which enables continuous degenerate limits of the vierbein, both at a specific scale. Through the dynamics of the system, we demonstrate the simultaneous emergence of the Planck mass and a curved spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Models of Black Hole Photon Rings from Low-Luminosity Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Images of black holes encode both astrophysical and gravitational properties. Detecting highly-lensed features in images can differentiate between these two effects. We present an accretion disk emission model coupled to the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code that allows a fast parameter space exploration of black hole photon ring images produced from synchrotron emission from 10 to 670 GHz. As an application, we systematically study several disk models and compute their total flux density, average radii, and optical depth. The model parameters are chosen around fiducial values calibrated to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and observations of M87*. For the parameter space studied, we characterize the transition between optically thin and thick regimes and the frequency at which the first photon ring is observable. Our results highlight the need for careful definitions of photon ring radius in the image domain, as in certain models, the highly lensed photon ring is dimmer than the direct emission at certain angles. We find that at low frequencies, the ring radii are set by the electron temperature, while at higher frequencies, the magnetic field strength plays a more significant role, demonstrating how multi-frequency analysis can also be used to infer plasma parameters. Lastly, we show how our implementation can qualitatively reproduce multifrequency black hole images from GRMHD simulations when adding time-variability to our disk model through Gaussian random fields. This approach provides a new method for simulating observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) space mission.</description>
