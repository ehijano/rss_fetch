      <title>Ultracold collisions of a neutral atom with a trapped ion in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully quantum mechanical description of a free $^6$Li atom scattering from a trapped $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ion in one dimension. By reformulating the system in polar coordinates and employing the adiabatic representation, we extract a set of coupled adiabatic potentials representing the atom interacting with the ion in different trap states. In an approach similar to quantum defect theory (QDT), we leverage the vast difference in energy scale between the interaction, the trap, and the scattering energy to encapsulate the short-range atom-ion scattering behavior in a single phase parameter. The presence of trapped $({}^{171}\text{Yb}^6\text{Li})^+$ molecular-ion states leads to a series of roughly evenly spaced resonances in the scattering cross section. The predicted distribution of resonances at low collision energies is at odds with the expectation of quantum chaos and the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit (BGS) conjecture.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Hard-Sphere Potential and Coulomb Interaction: Deser-Trueman Formula for Rydberg States of Exotic Atomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In exotic atomic systems with hadronic constituent particles, it is notoriously difficult to estimate the strong-interaction correction to energy levels. It is well known that, due to the strength of the nuclear interaction, the problem cannot be treated on the basis of Wigner-Brioullin perturbation theory. Recently, high-angular-momentum Rydberg states of exotic atomic systems with hadronic constituents have been identified as promising candidates for the search of New Physics in the low-energy sector of the Standard Model. In order to render this endeavor feasible, it is necessary to estimate the strong-interaction correction to the atomic energy levels. We thus derive a generalized Deser-Trueman formula for the induced energy shift for a general hydrogenic bound state with principal quantum number $n$ and orbital angular momentum quantum number~$\ell$, and find that the energy shift is given by the formula delta E = 2 alpha_{n, L} beta_L (a_h/a_0)^(2 L + 1) E_h/n^3, where alpha_{n,0} = 1, alpha_{n,L} is the product from s=1 to s=L of the expression (s^(-2) - n^(-2)), beta_L = (2 L + 1)/[(2 L + 1)!!]^2, where E_h is the Hartree energy, a_h is the hadronic radius and a_0 is the generalized Bohr radius. The square of the double factorial, [(2\ell + 1)!!]^2, in the denominator implies a somewhat fortunate, drastic suppression of the effect for higher angular momenta. The results are verified by numerical calculations on an exponential lattice with 20,000 points.</description>

      <title>Detection of twisted radiowaves with Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the outer electron in an alkali atom in the presence of structured electromagnetic waves is described. The interaction of the alkali Rydberg atom with twisted radiowaves is considered. The two schemes for Rydberg-atom based detector of twisted radiowaves are proposed. According to the theoretical model for these detectors, they can record a source of twisted radiowaves with power down to several nW. The first scheme of the detector employs the nondipole transitions between Rydberg states induced by twisted radio photons. The second scheme involves the array of Rydberg-atom based antennas, every antenna measuring the dipole transitions excited by plane radiowaves comprising the twisted one.</description>

      <title>CaF+CaF interactions in the ground and excited electronic states: implications for collisional losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are essential to understand and predict collisional outcomes in ultracold molecular systems. In this study, we explore the intermolecular interactions between two laser-cooled CaF molecules, both in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the observed collisional losses on the non-reactive, spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute twelve electronic states of the Ca$_2$F$_2$ complex within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Calculating the potential energy surfaces for the excited electronic states of Ca$_2$F$_2$ is challenging and computationally expensive. Our approach employs the multireference configuration interaction method, restricted to single and double excitations, along with a reasonably large active space to ensure the convergence in the excited states. We also compute the spin-orbit coupling between the ground state and the lowest spin-polarized triplet state, as well as the spin-spin coupling within the lowest triplet state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$. Additionally, we determine the electric transition dipole moments for the (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(2) $^3\mathrm{A}'$ and (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(1) $^3\mathrm{A}''$ transitions. Notably, we find that the lowest spin-polarized state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$, shifted by 1064 nm of laser light from the optical dipole trap, intersects several electronically excited states. Finally, by analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss two plausible pathways that may account for the observed collisional losses on the spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system.</description>

      <title>Formation of ultracold $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs Feshbach molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the creation of an ultracold gas of bosonic $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules. We first demonstrate a cooling strategy relying on sympathetic cooling of $^{133}$Cs to produce an ultracold mixture. From this mixture, weakly bound molecules are formed using a Feshbach resonance at 361.7 G. The molecular gas contains $7.6(10)\times 10^3$ molecules with a lifetime of about 130 ms, limited by two-body decay. We perform Feshbach spectroscopy to observe several new interspecies resonances and characterize the bound state used for magnetoassociation. Finally, we fit the combined results to obtain improved K-Cs interaction potentials. This provides a good starting point for the creation of ultracold samples of ground-state $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Towards the Heisenberg Limit with Locally Interacting Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a robust approach to spin squeezing with local interactions that approaches the Heisenberg limit of phase sensitivity. To generate the requisite entanglement, we generalize the paradigmatic two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian -- akin to squeezing by parametric amplification -- to systems with power-law interactions, incorporating a Heisenberg coupling that aids in spreading correlations and protects the collective spin coherence. The resulting time to approach the Heisenberg limit scales sublinearly with particle number in 2D dipolar and 3D van der Waals interacting systems. Our protocol is robust to disorder and density fluctuations, and can be implemented in near-term experiments with molecules, Rydberg atoms, and solid-state spins.</description>

      <title>Fidelity Relations in an Array of Neutral Atom Qubits -- Experimental Validation of Control Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise is a hindering factor for current-era quantum computers. In this study, we experimentally validate the theoretical relationships between control noise and qubit state fidelity. The experiment comprises a 10$\times$10 site optical tweezer array stochastically loaded with single rubidium-85 atoms. A global microwave field is used to manipulate the state of the hyperfine qubits. With precise control of the time-dependent amplitude of the microwave drive, we apply control signals featuring artificial noise. We systematically analyze the impact of various noise profiles on the fidelity distribution of the quantum states. The measured fidelities are compared against theoretical predictions made using the stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Our results show a good agreement between the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted results. This validation is consequential, as the model provides critical information on noise identification and optimal control protocols in NISQ-era quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional sub-wavelength topological dark state lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</description>

      <title>Frequently Used References For Atomic Data In X-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate atomic physics reference data are a crucial requirement for analysis and interpretation of observed spectra, even more so for observations with high spectral resolution. This document provides a curated list of atomic physics references frequently used for plasma diagnostics in X-ray spectroscopy, outside of comprehensive plasma models that typically come with their own underlying atomic databases. The list includes references to physical constants, laboratory benchmarks, transition energies, position and line shapes of neutral fluorescence lines, radiative branching ratios, and commonly used notation for prominent transitions. Quick-look tables for transition energies in H-, He-, and Li-like ions and line positions and shapes for fluorescence lines in neutrals. The main focus is on K-shell transitions. For the H- and He-like tables, we cite state-of-the art calculations that we consider currently the best available reference energies, which are considered high accuracy and thus typically used for energy scale calibration in laboratory measurements. Omissions in these tables are due to the lack of availability in the chosen references, and are not a statement about the relevance of these lines. Due to their complex and highly source-dependent line shape, the atomic data for neutrals is of lower accuracy than that for the highly charged ions, and the best reference data for these line shapes typically consist of empirical models derived from very high-resolution laboratory measurements. The table for neutrals provided here is consistent with the reference used for the energy gain scale calibration of XRISM/Resolve. This document is meant to serve as a resource to help find relevant references and conveniently formatted overview tables. When making use of the information found in these papers, credit should be given to their original authors by citing the appropriate references.</description>

      <title>Forces on alkali Rydberg atoms due to non-linearly polarized light</title>

Abstract: Trapped Rydberg atoms are highly promising candidates for quantum science experiments. While several approaches have been put forward to exert (trapping) forces on isolated Rydberg atoms, a widely applicable lossless technique is lacking. This paper proposes a robust versatile alternative technique that avoids lifetime compromising losses. Our proposal leverages the vector polarizability, which is induced by non-linearly polarized light and is shown to be several orders of magnitude larger than the usual scalar and tensor polarizabilities for commonly used alkali Rydberg series such as the $nS$, $nP$, and $nD$ series with principal quantum number $n$ as low as 30. The resulting force can be used to trap isolated Rydberg atoms over long times, which constitutes a key advance that is expected to impact quantum simulation applications, as well as to generate large light--Rydberg-atom hybrid states, which possess non-trivial position-dependent forces.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Quantum Sensing with Rydberg Atomic Receiver: Principles, Experiments and Future Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensing using Rydberg atoms offers unprecedented opportunities for next-generation radar systems, transcending classical limitations in miniaturization and spectral agility. Implementing this paradigm for radar sensing, this work proposes a quantum-enhanced radar reception architecture enabled by the emerging Rydberg atomic receiver, replacing conventional antenna-to-mixer chains with a centimeter-scale vapor cell. The proposed approach is based on electromagnetically induced transparency with the Autler-Townes splitting enabling direct RF-to-optical downconversion within the atomic medium via an external co-frequency reference. To circumvent the intrinsic bottleneck on instantaneous bandwidth of atomic receiver, we invoke a non-uniform stepped-frequency synthesis strategy combining coarse laser frequency tuning with fine AC-Stark shift compensation. Additionally, we establish a nonlinear response model of the Rydberg atomic homodyne receiver and propose a customized nonlinear compensation method that extends the linear dynamic range by over 7 dB. We develop a compressive sensing algorithm (CS-Rydberg) to suppress noise and mitigate the undersampling problem. Experimentally, we demonstrate a compact prototype achieving centimeter-level ranging precision (RMSE = 1.06 cm) within 1.6-1.9 m. By synthesizing GHz-bandwidth (2.6-3.6 GHz), resolvable target separations down to 15 cm are observed under controlled sparse scenarios. These results not only validate the feasibility of quantum sensing based on Rydberg atomic receivers but also underscore the architecture's inherent scalability: by harnessing the atoms' ultra-broad spectral response, the synthesized bandwidth can be extended well beyond the current range, enabling sub-centimeter resolution in future radar systems while preserving quantum-traceable calibration and a highly simplified front end.</description>

Abstract: Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) by precisely measuring effects on atomic systems. Previous studies have demonstrated their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM candidates, yet their potential for probing spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM across several frameworks for massive gravity, including the Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two distinct Lorentz-violating scenarios. We show that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce measurable phase shifts in atom interferometers through three coupling mechanisms: scalar interactions that modify atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that alter the propagation of both atoms and light. We demonstrate that these multifaceted interactions enable atom interferometers to probe a range of ULDM properties and mass scales that are inaccessible to laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Our results establish the potential of atom interferometers to open a new experimental frontier for spin-2 dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Coherent control over the high-dimensional space of the nuclear spin of alkaline-earth atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dynamics of charmonia in strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of charmonium systems in strong external magnetic fields using a relativistic light-front Hamiltonian approach within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework. By solving the eigenvalue problem for the invariant mass squared operator with confinement potentials and one-gluon-exchange interactions, we obtain the mass spectrum and wave functions under varying magnetic fields. Our results reveal significant spectral modifications via the Zeeman effect, including $\eta_c$-$J/\psi$ mixing and magnetic sublevel splitting. Momentum density analysis demonstrates wave function deformation, with transverse momentum broadening and longitudinal narrowing under strong fields, alongside structural shifts in parton distributions such as double-hump profiles in excited states. Relativistic corrections and center-of-mass coupling critically drive these dynamics, highlighting the necessity of a relativistic framework for QCD bound states in extreme magnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Dielectronic recombination studies of ions relevant to kilonovae and non-LTE plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents calculations of rate coefficients, resonance strengths, and cross sections for the dielectronic recombination (DR) of $\text{Y}^{+}$, $\text{Sr}^{+}$, $\text{Te}^{2+}$, and $\text{Ce}^{2+}$-low-charge ions relevant to kilonovae and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) plasmas. Using relativistic atomic structure methods, we computed DR rate coefficients under conditions typical of these environments. These DR rate coefficients and cross sections were calculated using the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC). The DR resonance features were identified by comparing theoretical resonance energies, estimated as the difference between NIST excitation energies and Dirac binding energies, with dominant autoionizing states confirmed through analysis of autoionization rates. Our results highlight the critical role of low-lying DR resonances in shaping rate coefficients at kilonova temperatures ($\sim 10^4$ K) and regulating charge-state distributions. Pronounced near-threshold DR resonances significantly influence the evolving ionization states and opacity of neutron star merger ejecta. Comparisons with previous studies emphasize the necessity of including high-$n$ Rydberg states for accurate DR rate coefficients, especially for complex heavy ions with dense energy levels. Discrepancies with existing datasets underscore the need for refined computational techniques to minimize uncertainties. These results provide essential input for interpreting spectroscopic observations of neutron star mergers, including James Webb Space Telescope data. We also put forward suitable candidates for experimental studies, recognizing the challenges involved in such measurements. The data presented here have the potential to refine models of heavy-element nucleosynthesis, enhance plasma simulation accuracy, and improve non-LTE plasma modeling in astrophysical and laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Electron and positron channeling and photon emission processes in boron doped periodically bent diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, theoretical and numerical analyses are conducted of the profiles of the planar (-110) crystallographic direction in the diamond layer doped with boron atoms. The planar profiles for periodic doping following several ideal dependencies of the boron concentration on the distance in the crystalline medium. Numerical simulations of the channeling and photon emission processes have been carried out for 855 MeV electron and 530 MeV positron beams incident on boron-doped diamond with a four-period bending profile in the samples grown at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The simulations were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. It is shown that the channeling efficiency and the intensity of the crystalline undulator radiation strongly depend on the orientation of the incident beam relative to the bent channel profile at the entrance to the boron-doped layer. For the same conditions at the crystal entrance, the intensity of radiation emitted by positrons is significantly higher than that for electrons.</description>
