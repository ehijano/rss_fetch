      <title>Urban traffic resilience control -- An ecological resilience perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban traffic resilience has gained increased attention, with most studies adopting an engineering perspective that assumes a single optimal equilibrium and prioritizes local recovery. On the other hand, systems may possess multiple metastable states, and ecological resilience is the ability to switch between these states according to perturbations. Control strategies from these two resilience perspectives yield distinct outcomes. In fact, ecological resilience oriented control has rarely been viewed in urban traffic, despite the fact that traffic system is a complex system in highly uncertain environment with possible multiple metastable states. This absence highlights the necessity for urban traffic ecological resilience definition. To bridge this gap, we defines urban traffic ecological resilience as the ability to absorb uncertain perturbations by shifting to alternative states. The goal is to generate a system with greater adaptability, without necessarily returning to the original equilibrium. Our control framework comprises three aspects: portraying the recoverable scopes; designing alternative steady states; and controlling system to shift to alternative steady states for adapting large disturbances. Among them, the recoverable scopes are portrayed by attraction region; the alternative steady states are set close to the optimal state and outside the attraction region of the original equilibrium; the controller needs to ensure the local stability of the alternative steady states, without changing the trajectories inside the attraction region of the original equilibrium. Comparisons with classical engineering resilience oriented urban traffic resilience control schemes show that, proposed ecological resilience oriented control schemes can generate greater resilience. These results will contribute to the fundamental theory of future resilient intelligent transportation system.</description>

      <title>Global topological synchronization of weighted simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks are able to capture the many-body interactions present in complex systems and to unveil new fundamental phenomena revealing the rich interplay between topology, geometry, and dynamics. Simplicial complexes are higher-order networks that encode higher-order topology and dynamics of complex systems. Specifically, simplicial complexes can sustain topological signals, i.e., dynamical variables not only defined on nodes of the network but also on their edges, triangles, and so on. Topological signals can undergo collective phenomena such as synchronization, however, only some higher-order network topologies can sustain global synchronization of topological signals. Here we consider global topological synchronization of topological signals on weighted simplicial complexes. We demonstrate that topological signals can globally synchronize on weighted simplicial complexes, even if they are odd-dimensional, e.g., edge signals, overcoming thus a limitation of the unweighted case. These results thus demonstrate that weighted simplicial complexes are more advantageous for observing these collective phenomena than their unweighted counterpart. In particular, we present two weighted simplicial complexes the Weighted Triangulated Torus and the Weighted Waffle. We completely characterize their higher-order spectral properties and we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions on their weights, they can sustain global synchronization of edge signals. Our results are interpreted geometrically by showing, among the other results, that in some cases edge weights can be associated with the lengths of the sides of curved simplices.</description>

      <title>When time delays and phase lags are not the same: higher-order phase reduction unravels delay-induced synchronization in oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled oscillators with time-delayed network interactions are critical to understand synchronization phenomena in many physical systems. Phase reductions to finite-dimensional phase oscillator networks allow for their explicit analysis. However, first-order phase reductions - where delays correspond to phase lags - fail to capture the delay-dependence of synchronization. We develop a systematic approach to derive phase reductions for delay-coupled oscillators to arbitrary order. Already the second-order reduction can predict delay-dependent (bi-)stability of synchronized states as demonstrated for Stuart-Landau oscillators.</description>
