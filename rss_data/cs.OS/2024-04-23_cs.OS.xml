      <title>Taming Server Memory TCO with Multiple Software-Defined Compressed Tiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory accounts for 33 - 50% of the total cost of ownership (TCO) in modern data centers. We propose a novel solution to tame memory TCO through the novel creation and judicious management of multiple software-defined compressed memory tiers.
  As opposed to the state-of-the-art solutions that employ a 2-Tier solution, a single compressed tier along with DRAM, we define multiple compressed tiers implemented through a combination of different compression algorithms, memory allocators for compressed objects, and backing media to store compressed objects. These compressed memory tiers represent distinct points in the access latency, data compressibility, and unit memory usage cost spectrum, allowing rich and flexible trade-offs between memory TCO savings and application performance impact. A key advantage with ntier is that it enables aggressive memory TCO saving opportunities by placing warm data in low latency compressed tiers with a reasonable performance impact while simultaneously placing cold data in the best memory TCO saving tiers. We believe our work represents an important server system configuration and optimization capability to achieve the best SLA-aware performance per dollar for applications hosted in production data center environments.
  We present a comprehensive and rigorous analytical cost model for performance and TCO trade-off based on continuous monitoring of the application's data access profile. Guided by this model, our placement model takes informed actions to dynamically manage the placement and migration of application data across multiple software-defined compressed tiers. On real-world benchmarks, our solution increases memory TCO savings by 22% - 40% percentage points while maintaining performance parity or improves performance by 2% - 10% percentage points while maintaining memory TCO parity compared to state-of-the-art 2-Tier solutions.</description>
