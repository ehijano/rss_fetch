      <title>Insights into Protein Unfolding under pH, Temperature, and Shear using Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein biologics hold immense potential in therapeutic applications, but their ephemeral nature has hindered their widespread application. The effects of different stressors on protein folding have long been studied, but whether these stressors induce protein unfolding through different pathways remains unclear. In this work, we conduct all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the unfolding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) under three distinct external stressors: high temperature, acidic pH, and shear stress. Our findings reveal that each stressor induces unique unfolding patterns in BSA, indicating stressor-specific unfolding pathways. Detailed structural analysis showed that high temperature significantly disrupts the protein's secondary structure, while acidic pH causes notable alterations in the tertiary structure, leading to domain separation and an extended shape. Shear stress initially perturbs the tertiary structure, initiating structural rearrangements followed by a loss of secondary structure. These distinct unfolding behaviors suggest that different stabilization strategies are required to enhance protein stability under various denaturation conditions. Insights from these unfolding studies can inform the design of materials, especially polymers, aimed at improving protein stability.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Thermostability of CRISPR Cas12b using Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)- based diagnostics are at the forefront of rapid detection platforms of infectious diseases. The integration of reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with CRISPR-Cas protein systems has led to the creation of advanced one-pot assays. The sensitivity of these assays has been bolstered by the utilization of a thermophilic Cas12 protein, BrCas12b, and its engineered variant, which exhibits enhanced thermal stability and allows for broader operation temperatures of the assay. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on wild-type and mutant BrCas12b to reveal the mechanism of stabilization conferred by the mutation. High-temperature simulations reveal a small structural change along with greater flexibility in the PAM-interacting domain of the mutant BrCas12b, with marginal structural and flexibility changes in the other mutated domains. Comparative essential dynamics analysis between the wild-type and mutant BrCas12b at both ambient and elevated temperatures provides insights into the stabilizing effects of the mutations. Our findings not only offer a comprehensive insight into the dynamic alterations induced by mutations but reveal important motions in BrCas12b, important for the rational design of diagnostic and therapeutic platforms of Cas12 proteins.</description>

      <title>Motor-driven microtubule diffusion in a photobleached dynamical coordinate system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor-driven cytoskeletal remodeling in cellular systems can often be accompanied by a diffusive-like effect at local scales, but distinguishing the contributions of the ordering process, such as active contraction of a network, from this active diffusion is difficult to achieve. Using light-dimerizable kinesin motors to spatially control the formation and contraction of a microtubule network, we deliberately photobleach a grid pattern onto the filament network serving as a transient and dynamic coordinate system to observe the deformation and translation of the remaining fluorescent squares of microtubules. We find that the network contracts at a rate set by motor speed but is accompanied by a diffusive-like spread throughout the bulk of the contracting network with effective diffusion constant two orders of magnitude lower than that for a freely-diffusing microtubule. We further find that on micron scales, the diffusive timescale is only a factor of approximately 3 slower than that of advection regardless of conditions, showing that the global contraction and long-time relaxation from this diffusive behavior are both motor-driven but exhibit local competition within the network bulk.</description>

      <title>Robust Protein Electrical Junctions with Permanent Contacts show Activation-less Charge Transport down to 10 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust solid-state protein junctions (RPJs) with permanent contacts are essential for a wide range of studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms for electron transport across such junctions and their possible applications. Here we report on first time, RPJs formed with vacuum-evaporated carbon (eC) followed by Au as top electrode set on a single bilayer of bacteriorhodopsin (bR), self-assembled from so-lution on an Au substrate. The light-induced photocycle of bR, as well as the amide I &amp; II vibrational frequencies of bR, were unchanged upon eC deposition; the yield of the resulting junctions was reproducible ~ 90 % (non-shorted), and they were stable between ~ 10 and 300K. The current-voltage characteristics of these junc-tions were temperature-independent and the junctions were stable for several months. Hence, such robust all-solid-state protein junctions provide valuable tools for investigating the potential use of proteins in future bio-molecular electronic de-vices.</description>

      <title>Effects of curvature on growing films of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To provide insight into the basic properties of emerging structures when bacteria or other microorganisms conquer surfaces, it is crucial to analyze their growth behavior during the formation of thin films. In this regard, many theoretical studies focus on the behavior of elongating straight objects. They repel each other through volume exclusion and divide into two halves when reaching a certain threshold length. However, in reality, hardly any object of a certain elongation is perfectly straight. Therefore, we here study the consequences of curvature on the growth of colonies and thin active films. A given amount of curvature is prescribed to each growing individual. Particularly, we analyze how this individual curvature affects the size of orientationally ordered domains in the colony and find a significant decrease. Instead, strings of stacked curved cells emerge that show branched structures. Furthermore, we identify a significant spatio-orientational coupling that is not observed in colonies of straight cells. Our results are important for a fundamental understanding of the interaction and spreading of microorganisms on surfaces, with implications for medical applications and bioengineering.</description>

      <title>Entangled biphoton generation in myelin sheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consciousness within the brain hinges on the synchronized activities of millions of neurons, but the mechanism responsible for orchestrating such synchronization remains elusive. In this study, we employ cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to explore entangled biphoton generation through cascade emission in the vibration spectrum of C-H bonds within the lipid molecules' tails. The results indicate that the cylindrical cavity formed by a myelin sheath can facilitate spontaneous photon emission from the vibrational modes and generate a significant number of entangled photon pairs. The abundance of C-H bond vibration units in neurons can therefore serve as a source of quantum entanglement resources for the nervous system. The finding may offer insight into the brain's ability to leverage these resources for quantum information transfer, thereby elucidating a potential source for the synchronized activity of neurons.</description>
