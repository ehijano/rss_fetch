      <title>"Is This It?": Towards Ecologically Valid Benchmarks for Situated Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report initial work towards constructing ecologically valid benchmarks to assess the capabilities of large multimodal models for engaging in situated collaboration. In contrast to existing benchmarks, in which question-answer pairs are generated post hoc over preexisting or synthetic datasets via templates, human annotators, or large language models (LLMs), we propose and investigate an interactive system-driven approach, where the questions are generated by users in context, during their interactions with an end-to-end situated AI system. We illustrate how the questions that arise are different in form and content from questions typically found in existing embodied question answering (EQA) benchmarks and discuss new real-world challenge problems brought to the fore.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective User Attribution for Latent Diffusion Models via Watermark-Informed Blending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in multimodal large language models have enabled the creation of hyper-realistic images from textual descriptions. However, these advancements also raise significant concerns about unauthorized use, which hinders their broader distribution. Traditional watermarking methods often require complex integration or degrade image quality. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework Towards Effective user Attribution for latent diffusion models via Watermark-Informed Blending (TEAWIB). TEAWIB incorporates a unique ready-to-use configuration approach that allows seamless integration of user-specific watermarks into generative models. This approach ensures that each user can directly apply a pre-configured set of parameters to the model without altering the original model parameters or compromising image quality. Additionally, noise and augmentation operations are embedded at the pixel level to further secure and stabilize watermarked images. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of TEAWIB, showcasing the state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and attribution accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Few-Shot Classification without Forgetting through Multi-Level Contrastive Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most recent few-shot learning approaches are based on meta-learning with episodic training. However, prior studies encounter two crucial problems: (1) \textit{the presence of inductive bias}, and (2) \textit{the occurrence of catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Level Contrastive Constraints (MLCC) framework, that jointly integrates within-episode learning and across-episode learning into a unified interactive learning paradigm to solve these issues. Specifically, we employ a space-aware interaction modeling scheme to explore the correct inductive paradigms for each class between within-episode similarity/dis-similarity distributions. Additionally, with the aim of better utilizing former prior knowledge, a cross-stage distribution adaption strategy is designed to align the across-episode distributions from different time stages, thus reducing the semantic gap between existing and past prediction distribution. Extensive experiments on multiple few-shot datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of MLCC approach over the existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking VLMs' Reasoning About Persuasive Atypical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong zero-shot generalization across various tasks, especially when integrated with large language models (LLMs). However, their ability to comprehend rhetorical and persuasive visual media, such as advertisements, remains understudied. Ads often employ atypical imagery, using surprising object juxtapositions to convey shared properties. For example, Fig. 1 (e) shows a beer with a feather-like texture. This requires advanced reasoning to deduce that this atypical representation signifies the beer's lightness. We introduce three novel tasks, Multi-label Atypicality Classification, Atypicality Statement Retrieval, and Aypical Object Recognition, to benchmark VLMs' understanding of atypicality in persuasive images. We evaluate how well VLMs use atypicality to infer an ad's message and test their reasoning abilities by employing semantically challenging negatives. Finally, we pioneer atypicality-aware verbalization by extracting comprehensive image descriptions sensitive to atypical elements. Our findings reveal that: (1) VLMs lack advanced reasoning capabilities compared to LLMs; (2) simple, effective strategies can extract atypicality-aware information, leading to comprehensive image verbalization; (3) atypicality aids persuasive advertisement understanding. Code and data will be made available.</description>

      <title>Stimulus Modality Matters: Impact of Perceptual Evaluations from Different Modalities on Speech Emotion Recognition System Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems rely on speech input and emotional labels annotated by humans. However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities. We show that using labels elicited by voice-only stimuli for training yields better performance on the test set, whereas labels elicited by voice-only stimuli.</description>

      <title>PDMX: A Large-Scale Public Domain MusicXML Dataset for Symbolic Music Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent explosion of generative AI-Music systems has raised numerous concerns over data copyright, licensing music from musicians, and the conflict between open-source AI and large prestige companies. Such issues highlight the need for publicly available, copyright-free musical data, in which there is a large shortage, particularly for symbolic music data. To alleviate this issue, we present PDMX: a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores collected from the score-sharing forum MuseScore, making it the largest available copyright-free symbolic music dataset to our knowledge. PDMX additionally includes a wealth of both tag and user interaction metadata, allowing us to efficiently analyze the dataset and filter for high quality user-generated scores. Given the additional metadata afforded by our data collection process, we conduct multitrack music generation experiments evaluating how different representative subsets of PDMX lead to different behaviors in downstream models, and how user-rating statistics can be used as an effective measure of data quality. Examples can be found at https://pnlong.github.io/PDMX.demo/.</description>

      <title>3DFacePolicy: Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation with Diffusion Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation has made immersive progress both in research and application developments. The newest approaches focus on Transformer-based methods and diffusion-based methods, however, there is still gap in the vividness and emotional expression between the generated animation and real human face. To tackle this limitation, we propose 3DFacePolicy, a diffusion policy model for 3D facial animation prediction. This method generates variable and realistic human facial movements by predicting the 3D vertex trajectory on the 3D facial template with diffusion policy instead of facial generation for every frame. It takes audio and vertex states as observations to predict the vertex trajectory and imitate real human facial expressions, which keeps the continuous and natural flow of human emotions. The experiments show that our approach is effective in variable and dynamic facial motion synthesizing.</description>

      <title>Less is More: A Simple yet Effective Token Reduction Method for Efficient Multi-modal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has led to remarkable performances across various domains. However, this progress is accompanied by a substantial surge in the resource consumption of these models. We address this pressing issue by introducing a new approach, Token Reduction using CLIP Metric (TRIM), aimed at improving the efficiency of MLLMs without sacrificing their performance. Inspired by human attention patterns in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, TRIM presents a fresh perspective on the selection and reduction of image tokens. The TRIM method has been extensively tested across 12 datasets, and the results demonstrate a significant reduction in computational overhead while maintaining a consistent level of performance. This research marks a critical stride in efficient MLLM development, promoting greater accessibility and sustainability of high-performing models.</description>

      <title>NVLM: Open Frontier-Class Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce NVLM 1.0, a family of frontier-class multimodal large language models (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks, rivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models (e.g., Llama 3-V 405B and InternVL 2). Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In terms of model design, we perform a comprehensive comparison between decoder-only multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) and cross-attention-based models (e.g., Flamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design for tile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boosts performance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding training data, we meticulously curate and provide detailed information on our multimodal pretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. Our findings indicate that dataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even during the pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, we develop production-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excel in vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-only performance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, we craft and integrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongside a substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhanced math and coding capabilities across modalities. To advance research in the field, we are releasing the model weights and will open-source the code for the community: https://nvlm-project.github.io/.</description>
