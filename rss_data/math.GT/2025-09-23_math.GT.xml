      <title>Bounded ribbonlength for knot families and multi-twist M\"obius bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Take a thin, rectangular strip of paper, add in an odd number of half-twists, then join the ends together. This gives a multi-twist paper M\"obius band. We prove that any multi-twist paper M\"obius band can be constructed so the aspect ratio of the rectangle is $3\sqrt{3}+\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. We could also take the thin, rectangular strip of paper and tie a knot in it, then join the ends and fold flat in the plane. This creates a folded ribbon knot. We apply the techniques used to prove the multi-twist paper M\"obius band result to $(2,q)$ torus knots and twist knots. We prove that any $(2,q)$-torus knot can be constructed so that the folded ribbonlength $\leq 13.86$. We prove that any twist knot can be constructed so that the folded ribbonlength is $\leq 17.59$. Both of these results give the lower bound for the ribbonlength crossing number problem which relates the infimal folded ribbonlength of a knot type $[K]$ to its crossing number $\text{Cr}(K)$. That is, we have shown $\alpha=0$ in the equation $c\cdot \text{Cr}(K)^\alpha \leq \text{Rib}([K])$, where $c$ is a constant.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Strong, Topologically Meaningful and Fun Knot Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a pair of polynomial knot invariants $\Theta=(\Delta,\theta)$ which is:
  * Theoretically and practically fast: $\Theta$ can be computed in polynomial time. We can compute it in full on random knots with over 300 crossings, and its evaluation at simple rational numbers on random knots with over 600 crossings.
  * Strong: Its separation power is much greater than the hyperbolic volume, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial and Khovanov homology (taken together) on knots with up to 15 crossings (while being computable on much larger knots).
  * Topologically meaningful: It likely gives a genus bound, and there are reasons to hope that it would do more.
  * Fun: Scroll to Figures 1.1-1.4, 3.1, and 6.2.
  $\Delta$ is merely the Alexander polynomial. $\theta is$ almost certainly equal to an invariant that was studied extensively by Ohtsuki, continuing Rozansky, Kricker, and Garoufalidis. Yet our formulas, proofs, and programs are much simpler and enable its computation even on very large knots.</description>

      <title>Center of stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras: even roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the center of quantum tori appearing in quantum higher Teichm\"uller theory when the quantum parameter is an even root of unity. This is a subsequent of the work in the odd roots of unity case. The centers of the quantum tori help to understand those of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras via quantum trace maps. Moreover, we compute the PI-degree of the quantum tori, which are the same with those of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras. As corollaries, we give matrix decompositions for anti-symmetric integer matrices for the quantum tori.</description>

      <title>An intrinsically linked simplicial $n$-complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any positive integer $n$, Lov\'{a}sz-Schrijver, Taniyama and Skopenkov provided examples of simplicial $n$-complexes that inevitably contain a nonsplittable two-component link of $n$-spheres, no matter how they are embedded into the Euclidean $(2n+1)$-space. In this paper, we introduce a new example of such a simplicial $n$-complex through a simple argument in piecewise linear topology and an application of the van Kampen--Flores theorem. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of additional such complexes through higher dimensional generalizations of the $\triangle Y$-exchange on graphs.</description>

      <title>Vertex-minimal hyperbolic origami 2-torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore geometrizations of triangulated hyperbolic 2-tori $\Sigma_2$ in the hyperbolic 3-space $\mathbb{H}^3$. We show that for all $n \geq 10$, there exists a triangulation of $\Sigma_2$ with $n$ vertices and an embedding $S: \Sigma_2 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{H}^3$ that restricts to isometries on the triangles. We call these embeddings hyperbolic origami 2-tori. Since the lower bound $n \geq 10$ is combinatorially sharp, this paper settles the question of minimum number of vertices required to obtain a hyperbolic embedding.</description>

      <title>An illustrated introduction to the coarse topology of lamplighters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Roughly speaking, lamplighter graphs encode the possible configurations of a lamplighter that moves along a given graph and that modifies the colours of lamps at vertices. This article is dedicated to the following delicate question: when do two lamplighter graphs have the same coarse geometry, i.e.\ when are they quasi-isometric? Inspired by elementary ideas from topology, which we will ``coarsify'', I will survey some techniques that allow us to compare efficiently lamplighter graphs (and more) up to quasi-isometry. Based on a minicourse given during the Journ\'ees de Topologie G\'eom\'etrique at the Institut Fourier in August 2025.</description>

      <title>Framed configuration spaces and exotic spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine when an exotic sphere $\Sigma$ of dimension $d\not{\equiv }1\pmod{4}$ can be detected through the homotopy type of its truncated Disc-presheaf. The latter records the diagram of framed configuration spaces of bounded cardinality in $\Sigma$ with natural point-forgetting and -splitting maps between them. Our proof involves three ingredients that could be of independent interest: a gluing result for Disc-presheaves of manifolds divided into two codimension zero submanifolds, a version of Atiyah duality in the context of Disc-presheaves, and a computation of the finite residual of the mapping class group of the connected sums $\sharp^g(S^{2k+1}\times S^{2k+1})$.</description>

      <title>The Johnson-Morita theory for the handlebody group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Johnson-Morita theory is an algebraic approach to the mapping class group of a surface, in which one considers its action on the successive nilpotent quotients of the fundamental group of the surface. In this paper, we develop an analogue of this theory for the handlebody group, i.e. the mapping class group of a 3-dimensional handlebody. Thus, we obtain a filtration on the handlebody group, prove that its associated graded embeds into a Lie algebra of "special derivations", and give an explicit diagrammatic description of this graded Lie algebra in terms of "oriented trees with beads". Our new diagrammatic method reveals part of the richness of the algebraic structure of the handlebody group, which lies mainly in the subgroup generated by Dehn twists along meridians: the so-called "twist group". As an application, we obtain that each term of the associated graded of the lower central series of the twist group is infinitely generated.</description>

      <title>Revised note on surface-link of trivial components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that a surface-link of ribbon surface-knot components is a ribbon surface-link if and only if it is a surface-link producing a ribbon surface-link by surgery along a self-trivial 1-handle system. This corrects an earlier statement. This result makes a corrected proof for the claim that every surface-link of trivial surface-knot components with at most one aspheric component is a ribbon surface-link. For non-ribbon surface-links of trivial components with at least two aspheric components constructed in a previous note, it adds the new property that non-ribbonability continues through surgery along any self-trivial 1-handle system.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that a boundary surface-link in the 4-sphere is a ribbon surface-link if the surface-link obtained from it by surgery along a pairwise nontrivial fusion 1-handle system is a ribbon surface-link. As a corollary, the surface-knot obtained from the anti-parallel surface-link of a non-ribbon surface-knot by surgery along a nontrivial fusion 1-handleis a non-ribbon surface-knot. This result answers Cochran's conjecture on non-ribbon sphere-knots in the affirmative.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of slice depth of a 2-knot K, which is the minimal integer n such that K is n-slice. We give an upper bound for the slice depth of the n-twist spin of a classical knot which belongs to several specific classes, namely, certain types of 2-bridge knots, pretzel knots, ribbon knots of 1-fusion, and knots with given unknotting number.</description>

Abstract: We prove effective equidistribution theorems, with polynomial error rate, for orbits of the unipotent subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ in arithmetic quotients of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$ and $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)\times\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$.
  The proof is based on the use of a Margulis function, tools from incidence geometry, and the spectral gap of the ambient space.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a topological theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial or CW complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation. One can further deformation retract the manifold back to a CW complex which supports a non-topological code with minimal overhead suitable for near-term implementation. Both types of codes admit cohomology operations including cup product which can induce non-Clifford gates. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to logical CCZ on 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes with the aid of non-Euclidean geometries. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources ('magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>

      <title>Symplectic configurations: a homological and computer-aided approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulated a homological and computer-aided approach to study certain unions of symplectic surfaces, called symplectic configurations, in a rational $4$-manifold $X=CP^2\# N\overline{CP^2}$. We addressed several fundamental theoretical questions, and also as a technical device, developed a symplectic analog of the so-called quadratic Cremona transformations in complex algebraic geometry. As an application, we gave a new proof that a certain line arrangement in $CP^2$, called Fano planes, does not exist in the symplectic category. The nonexistence of Fano planes in the holomorphic category was due to Hirzebruch, and in the topological category, it was first proved by Ruberman and Starkston. Our proof in the symplectic category is independent to both.</description>
