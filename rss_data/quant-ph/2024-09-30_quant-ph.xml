      <title>Generic and Scalable Differential Equation Solver for Quantum Scientific Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important topics in quantum scientific computing is solving differential equations. In this paper, generalized quantum functional expansion (QFE) framework is proposed. In the QFE framework, a functional expansion of solution is encoded into a quantum state and the time evolution of the quantum state is solved with variational quantum simulation (VQS). The quantum functional encoding supports different numerical schemes of functional expansions. The lower bound of the required number of qubits is double logarithm of the inverse error bound in the QFE framework. Furthermore, a new parallel Pauli operation strategy is proposed to significantly improve the scalability of VQS. The number of circuits in VQS is exponentially reduced to only the quadratic order of the number of ansatz parameters. Four example differential equations are solved to demonstrate the generic QFE framework.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Purity Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum purity amplification (QPA) offers a novel approach to counteracting the pervasive noise that degrades quantum states. We present the optimal QPA protocol for general quantum systems against global depolarizing noise, which has remained unknown for two decades. We construct and prove the optimality of our protocol, which demonstrates improved fidelity scaling compared to the best-known methods. We explore the operational interpretation of the protocol and provide simple examples of how to compile it into efficient circuits for near-term experiments. Furthermore, we conduct numerical simulations to investigate the effectiveness of our protocol in the quantum simulation of Hamiltonian evolution, demonstrating its ability to enhance fidelity even under circuit-level noise. Our findings suggest that QPA could improve the performance of quantum information processing tasks, particularly in the context of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, where reducing the effect of noise with limited resources is critical.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Logical Clifford Gates from Code Automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implementation of fault-tolerant logical Clifford gates on stabilizer quantum error correcting codes based on their symmetries. Our approach is to map the stabilizer code to a binary linear code, compute its automorphism group, and impose constraints based on the Clifford operators permitted. We provide a rigorous formulation of the method for finding automorphisms of stabilizer codes and generalize ZX-dualities to non-CSS codes. We provide a Python package implementing our algorithms which uses the computational algebra system MAGMA. Our algorithms map automorphism group generators to physical circuits, calculate Pauli corrections based on the destabilizers of the code, and determine their logical action. We discuss the fault tolerance of the circuits and include examples of gates through automorphisms for the [[4,2,2]] and perfect [[5,1,3]] codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and the best known distance codes.</description>

      <title>Can the quantum switch be deterministically simulated?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order transformations that act on a certain number of input quantum channels in an indefinite causal order - such as the quantum switch - cannot be described by standard quantum circuits that use the same number of calls of the input quantum channels. However, the question remains whether they can be simulated, i.e., whether their action on their input channels can be deterministically reproduced, for all arbitrary inputs, by a quantum circuit that uses a larger number of calls of the input channels. Here, we prove that when only one extra call of each input channel is available, the quantum switch cannot be simulated by any quantum circuit. We demonstrate that this result is robust by showing that, even when probabilistic and approximate simulations are considered, higher-order transformations that are close to the quantum switch can be at best simulated with a probability strictly less than one. This result stands in stark contrast with the known fact that, when the quantum switch acts exclusively on unitary channels, its action can be simulated.</description>

      <title>Towards Error Budgeting for Superconducting Modular Quantum Architecture Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses frequency crowding constraints in modular quantum architecture design, focusing on the SNAIL-based quantum modules. Two key objectives are explored. First, we present physics-informed design constraints by describing a physical model for realizable gates within a SNAIL module and building a fidelity model using error budgeting derived from device characteristics. Second, we tackle the allocation problem by analyzing the impact of frequency crowding on gate fidelity as the radix of the module increases. We explore whether the gate fidelity can be preserved with a discrete set of qubit frequencies while adhering to defined separation thresholds. This work offers insights into novel quantum architectures and coupled optimization techniques to mitigate the effects of unstable noise and improve overall gate performance.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Global Minimum of Electronic Hamiltonian 1-Norm via Linear Programming in the Block Invariant Symmetry Shift (BLISS) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cost of encoding a system Hamiltonian in a digital quantum computer as a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) grows with the 1-norm of the LCU expansion. The Block Invariant Symmetry Shift (BLISS) technique reduces this 1-norm by modifying the Hamiltonian action on only the undesired electron-number subspaces. Previously, BLISS required a computationally expensive nonlinear optimization that was not guaranteed to find the global minimum. Here, we introduce various reformulations of this optimization as a linear programming problem, which guarantees optimality and significantly reduces the computational cost. We apply BLISS to industrially-relevant homogeneous catalysts in active spaces of up to 76 orbitals, finding substantial reductions in both the spectral range of the modified Hamiltonian and the 1-norms of Pauli and fermionic LCUs. Our linear programming techniques for obtaining the BLISS operator enable more efficient Hamiltonian simulation and, by reducing the Hamiltonian's spectral range, offer opportunities for improved LCU groupings to further reduce the 1-norm.</description>

      <title>The QES sextic and Morse potentials: exact WKB condition and supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, as a continuation of [Contreras-Astorga A., Escobar-Ruiz A. M. and Linares R., \textit{Phys. Scr.} {\bf99} 025223 (2024)] the one-dimensional quasi-exactly solvable (QES) sextic potential $V^{\rm(qes)}(x) = \frac{1}{2}(\nu\, x^{6} + 2\, \nu\, \mu\,x^{4} + \left[\mu^2-(4N+3)\nu \right]\, x^{2})$ is considered. In the cases $N=0,\frac{1}{4},\,\frac{1}{2},\,\frac{7}{10}$ the WKB correction $\gamma=\gamma(N,n)$ is calculated for the first lowest 50 states $n\in [0,\,50]$ using highly accurate data obtained by the Lagrange Mesh Method. Closed analytical approximations for both $\gamma$ and the energy $E=E(N,n)$ of the system are constructed. They provide a reasonably relative accuracy $|\Delta|$ with upper bound $\lesssim 10^{-3}$ for all the values of $(N,n)$ studied. Also, it is shown that the QES Morse potential is shape invariant characterized by a hidden $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{R})$ Lie algebra and vanishing WKB correction $\gamma=0$.</description>

      <title>Demystifying dust contamination in quantum optics labs: measurements and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments in the field of quantum optics often require very low concentrations of dust particles in the laboratory, but the complexity of working routines precludes operation within a proper clean room. Research teams have established a multitude of different approaches, precaution measures, and habits to keep the delicate optics setups free of contamination. Here, we systematically quantify dust particle concentration during day-to-day operation of a quantum optics lab, assess the effectiveness of various measures, and give practical recommendations.</description>

      <title>AQMLator -- An Auto Quantum Machine Learning E-Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A successful Machine Learning (ML) model implementation requires three main components: training dataset, suitable model architecture and training procedure. Given dataset and task, finding an appropriate model might be challenging. AutoML, a branch of ML, focuses on automatic architecture search -- a meta method that aims at moving human from ML system design process. The success of ML and the development of quantum computing (QC) in recent years led to a birth of new fascinating field called Quantum Machine Learning (QML) that, amongst others, incorporates quantum computers into ML models. In this paper we present AQMLator, an Auto Quantum Machine Learning platform that aims to automatically propose and train the quantum layers of an ML model with minimal input from the user. This way, data scientists can bypass the entry barrier for QC and use QML. AQMLator uses standard ML libraries, making it easy to introduce into existing ML pipelines.</description>

      <title>Influence of bias voltage noise on the Inelastic Cooper-Pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally show that the Inelastic Cooper-Pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA), implementing a DC-powered parametric amplification scheme, can achieve gain and noise performance similar to that of Josephson parametric amplifiers. Using experimental data and simulations, we show that the ICTA has near-quantum-limited noise as long as the integral voltage bias noise divided by the superconducting flux quantum is below the amplification bandwidth. We observe a gain of 20 dB with noise below 1.7 times the quantum limit when the full width at half maximum of the integral voltage noise, expressed as frequency, is 5.6 MHz.</description>

      <title>Faster Randomized Dynamical Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a randomized dynamical decoupling (DD) protocol that can improve the performance of any given deterministic DD, by using no more than two additional pulses. Our construction is implemented by probabilistically applying sequences of pulses, which, when combined, effectively eliminate the error terms that scale linearly with the system-environment coupling strength. As a result, we show that a randomized protocol using a few pulses can outperform deterministic DD protocols that require considerably more pulses. Furthermore, we prove that the randomized protocol provides an improvement compared to deterministic DD sequences that aim to reduce the error in the system's Hilbert space, such as Uhrig DD, which had been previously regarded to be optimal. To rigorously evaluate the performance, we introduce new analytical methods suitable for analyzing higher-order DD protocols that might be of independent interest. We also present numerical simulations confirming the significant advantage of using randomized protocols compared to widely used deterministic protocols.</description>

      <title>Exponential separation in quantum query complexity of the quantum switch with respect to simulations with standard quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory is consistent with a computational model permitting black-box operations to be applied in an indefinite causal order, going beyond the standard circuit model of computation. The quantum switch -- the simplest such example -- has been shown to provide numerous information-processing advantages. Here, we prove that the action of the quantum switch on two $n$-qubit quantum channels cannot be simulated deterministically and exactly by any causally ordered quantum circuit that uses $M$ calls to one channel and one call to the other, if $M \leq \max(2, 2^n-1)$. This demonstrates an exponential enhancement in quantum query complexity provided by indefinite causal order.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Entanglement Dynamics in Optical Fibers: Mitigating Decay in the Non-Markovian Regime with Dynamical Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future distributed quantum systems and networks are likely to rely, at least in part, on the existing fiber infrastructure for entanglement distribution; hence, a precise understanding of the adverse effects of imperfections in optical fibers on entanglement is essential to their operation. Here, we consider maximally entangled polarization qubits and study the decay of the entanglement caused by spatial fluctuations in the refractive index of optical fibers. We study this entanglement dynamics using the spin-boson model and numerically solve our system of equations using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) formalism. We show that within the range of practically relevant system parameters, our developed model exhibits both Markovian and non-Markovian entanglement decay behavior. Further, to counter the observed entanglement decay, we propose the implementation of dynamical decoupling in optical fibers using spaced half waveplates. In particular, we numerically model the time-dependent Hamiltonians of the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill and Uhrig dynamical decoupling schemes and show a reduced rate of entanglement decay even with sparsely spaced half waveplates along the length of optical fiber. Finally, we evaluate the performance of these two schemes in multiple system configurations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hidden Vulnerabilities in Quantum Systems by Expanding Attack Vectors through Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uncovers novel vulnerabilities within Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols that extend beyond traditional implementation flaws, such as loopholes. These newly identified vulnerabilities arise from the complex interaction between Bell Inequalities (BIs) and Hidden Variable Theories (HVTs), further exacerbated by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP). Through a combination of theoretical analysis, simulations, and quantum experiments, we reveal critical security weaknesses that challenge the core assumptions of today's quantum cryptography. While these vulnerabilities differ from known loopholes, when considered alongside them and traditional cyberattacks, they present a significant threat to the robustness of QKD and quantum integrity systems. These results provide a new perspective to rethink current quantum security frameworks to ensure the robustness of future quantum cryptographic and quantum integrity protocols.</description>

QKD systems using SPS often require cryogenic cooling, while recent QKD attempts using SPS operating at room-temperature have failed to achieve long-distance transmission due to the SPS not operating at telecommunication wavelength. In this work, we have successfully demonstrated QKD using a room-temperature SPS at telecommunication wavelength. The SPS used in this work is based on point defects hosted by gallium nitride (GaN) thin films grown on sapphire substrates. We employed a time-bin and phase encoding scheme to perform the BB84 and reference-frame-independent QKD protocols over a 33 km fiber spool, achieving a secure key rate of $7.58\times 10^{-7}$ per pulse. Moreover, we also implemented a metropolitan QKD experiment over a 30 km deployed fiber, achieving a secure key rate of $6.06\times 10^{-8}$ per pulse. These results broaden the prospects for future use of SPS in commercial QKD applications.</description>

      <title>Bath Dynamical Decoupling with a Quantum Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bang-bang dynamical decoupling protects an open quantum system from decoherence due to its interaction with the surrounding bath/environment. In its standard form, this is achieved by strongly kicking the system with cycles of unitary operations, which average out the interaction Hamiltonian. In this paper, we generalize the notion of dynamical decoupling to repeated kicks with a quantum channel. This procedure is physically motivated by applying these CPTP kicks to the bath. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the employed quantum channel and find that bath dynamical decoupling works if and only if the kick is ergodic. Furthermore, we study in which circumstances CPTP kicks on a mono-partite quantum system induce quantum Zeno dynamics with its Hamiltonian cancelled out. This does not require the ergodicity of the kicks, and the absence of decoherence-free subsystems is both necessary and sufficient. While the standard unitary dynamical decoupling is essentially the same as the quantum Zeno dynamics, our investigation implies that this is not true any more in the case of CPTP kicks. To derive our results, we prove some spectral properties of ergodic quantum channels, that might be of independent interest. Our approach establishes an enhanced and unified mathematical understanding of several recent experimental demonstrations and might form the basis of new dynamical decoupling schemes that harness environmental noise degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Stability of emergent time periodicity in a few-body interacting system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative time crystals are many-body open quantum systems that exhibit non-trivial time periodic motion at late times. We examine the onset and resilience of such emergent time periodicity in a few-body all-to-all interacting Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, where one of the constituents is locally in contact with a thermal bath. Employing both a collision model framework and a suitable time-continuous description, we show that stable time-crystalline behavior can only be exhibited when the bath acts as purely dissipative channel. We assess the role that the microscopic interactions within the system play, establishing that for the all-to-all model the introduction of temperature leads to a melting of the dissipative time crystallinity, in contrast to stable long-time periodicity which can be maintained for nearest neighbor $XXZ$ type interactions.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for advection-diffusion equation by a probabilistic imaginary-time evolution operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving the linear advection-diffusion equation by employing a new approximate probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) operator which improves the existing approximate PITE. First, the effectiveness of the proposed approximate PITE operator is justified by the theoretical evaluation of the error. Next, we construct the explicit quantum circuit for realizing the imaginary-time evolution of the Hamiltonian coming from the advection-diffusion equation, whose gate complexity is logarithmic regarding the size of the discretized Hamiltonian matrix. Numerical simulations using gate-based quantum emulator for 1D/2D examples are also provided to support our algorithm. Finally, we extend our algorithm to the coupled system of advection-diffusion equations, and we also compare our proposed algorithm to some other algorithms in the previous works. We find that our algorithm gives comparable result to the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm with similar gate complexity, while we need much less ancillary qubits. Besides, our algorithm outperforms a specific HHL algorithm and a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) based on the finite difference method (FDM).</description>

      <title>A magic monotone for faithful detection of non-stabilizerness in mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a monotone to quantify the amount of non-stabilizerness (or magic for short), in an arbitrary quantum state. The monotone gives a necessary and sufficient criterion for detecting the presence of magic for both pure and mixed states. The monotone is based on determining the boundaries of the stabilizer polytope in the space of Pauli string expectation values. The boundaries can be described by a set of hyperplane inequations, where violation of any one of these gives a necessary and sufficient condition for magic. The monotone is constructed by finding the hyperplane with the maximum violation and is a type of Minkowski functional. We also introduce a witness based on similar methods. The approach is more computationally efficient than existing faithful mixed state monotones such as robustness of magic due to the smaller number and discrete nature of the parameters to be optimized.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Drone Mission Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mission planning often involves optimising the use of ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) assets in order to achieve a set of mission objectives within allowed parameters subject to constraints. The missions of interest here, involve routing multiple UAVs visiting multiple targets, utilising sensors to capture data relating to each target. Finding such solutions is often an NP-Hard problem and cannot be solved efficiently on classical computers. Furthermore, during the mission new constraints and objectives may arise, requiring a new solution to be computed within a short time period. To achieve this we investigate near term quantum algorithms that have the potential to offer speed-ups against current classical methods. We demonstrate how a large family of these problems can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and then converted to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO). The formulation provided is versatile and can be adapted for many different constraints with clear qubit scaling provided. We discuss the results of solving the QUBO formulation using commercial quantum annealers and compare the solutions to current edge classical solvers. We also analyse the results from solving the QUBO using Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithms (QAOA) and discuss their results. Finally, we also provide efficient methods to encode to the problem into the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) formalism, where we have tailored the ansatz to the problem making efficient use of the qubits available.</description>

      <title>Interference of photons from independent hot atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. It employs finite temporal coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. Presented interferometry promises direct applications in Doppler-free atomic and molecular spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Belief Propagation for Practical Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fault-tolerant approach to reliable quantum memory is essential for scalable quantum computing, as physical qubits are susceptible to noise. Quantum error correction (QEC) must be continuously performed to prolong the memory lifetime. In QEC, error syndromes are generated rapidly, often within the execution time of a few quantum gates, requiring decoders to process this error data with equal speed. A typical QEC cycle involves multiple rounds of syndrome measurements, causing potential error locations to scale rapidly with the code size and the number of measurement rounds. However, no such decoders currently exist for general quantum low-density parity-check codes. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant belief propagation (FTBP) decoder that utilizes a space-time Tanner graph across multiple rounds of syndrome extraction with mixed-alphabet error variables. To enhance FTBP, we introduce a technique of probabilistic error consolidation to mitigate degeneracy effects and short cycles. Additionally, we propose an adaptive sliding window procedure that captures long error events across window boundaries and adjusts the decoding in real time. Our simulations demonstrate high error thresholds of 0.4%-0.87% and strong error-floor performance for topological code families, including rotated toric, toric color, and twisted XZZX toric codes.</description>

      <title>MG-Net: Learn to Customize QAOA with Circuit Depth Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its variants exhibit immense potential in tackling combinatorial optimization challenges. However, their practical realization confronts a dilemma: the requisite circuit depth for satisfactory performance is problem-specific and often exceeds the maximum capability of current quantum devices. To address this dilemma, here we first analyze the convergence behavior of QAOA, uncovering the origins of this dilemma and elucidating the intricate relationship between the employed mixer Hamiltonian, the specific problem at hand, and the permissible maximum circuit depth. Harnessing this understanding, we introduce the Mixer Generator Network (MG-Net), a unified deep learning framework adept at dynamically formulating optimal mixer Hamiltonians tailored to distinct tasks and circuit depths. Systematic simulations, encompassing Ising models and weighted Max-Cut instances with up to 64 qubits, substantiate our theoretical findings, highlighting MG-Net's superior performance in terms of both approximation ratio and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Quantum resource-theoretical analysis of the role of vibrational structure in photoisomerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamical systems at the nanoscale, such as single molecules interacting with highly structured vibrational environments, typically undergo non-equilibrium physical processes that lack precise microscopic descriptions. Photoisomerization is such an example which has emerged as a platform on which to study single-molecule ultrafast photochemical processes from a quantum resource theoretic perspective. However, upper bounds on its efficiency have only been obtained under significant simplifications that make the mathematics of the resource-theoretical treatment manageable. Here we generalize previous models for the photoisomers, while retaining the full vibrational structure, and still get analytical bounds on the efficiency of hotoisomerization. We quantify the impact of such vibrational structure on the optimal photoisomerization quantum yield both when the vibrational coordinate has no dynamics of its own and when we take into account the vibrational dynamics. This work serves as an example of how to bridge the gap between the abstract language of quantum resource theories and the open system formulation of nanoscale processes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying genuine tripartite entanglement by reshaping the state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), as one quantum resource, is indispensable in quantum information processing, most of the existing measures cannot detect GME faithfully. In this paper, we present a novel GME measure, namely the minimum pairwise concurrence (MPC), by introducing pairwise entanglement, which characters the entanglement between two single-qubit subsystems of a multipartite system without tracing out the remaining qubit. The pairwise entanglement can be obtained by combining the entanglement of reduced subsystem and three-tangle. Compared with the existing measures, the MPC measure outperforms the previous ones in many aspects. Due to its fine properties, it thus is believed that the MPC could be one of good candidates in achieving potential quantum tasks and also facilitate the understanding for GME.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the filtering challenges in microwave-optical quantum transduction through optomechanical four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave-optical quantum transduction is a key enabling technology in quantum networking, but has been plagued by a formidable technical challenge. As most microwave-optical-transduction techniques rely on three-wave mixing processes, the processes consume photons from a driving telecom-band (pump) laser to convert input microwave photons into telecom-band photons detuned from the laser by this microwave frequency. However, cleanly separating out single photons detuned only a few GHz away from a classically bright laser in the same spatial mode requires frequency filters of unprecedented extinction over a very narrow transition band, straining the capabilities of today's technology. Instead of confronting this challenge directly, we show how one may achieve the same transduction objective with comparable efficiency using a four-wave mixing process in which $pairs$ of pump photons are consumed to produce transduced optical photons widely separated in frequency from the pump. We develop this process by considering higher-order analogues of photoelasticity and electrostriction than those used in conventional optomechanics, and examine how the efficiency of this process can be made to exceed conventional optomechanical couplings.</description>

      <title>Interplay between time and energy in bosonic noisy quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When using infinite-dimensional probes (such as a bosonic mode), one could in principle obtain infinite precision when estimating some physical parameters. This is unphysical, as it would require infinite resources, so one needs to impose some additional constraint: typically the average energy employed by the probe is finite. Here we treat both energy and time as a resource, showing that, in the presence of noise, there is a nontrivial interplay between the average energy and the time devoted to the estimation. Our results are valid for the most general metrological schemes (e.g. adaptive schemes which may involve entanglement with external ancillae). We apply recently derived precision bounds for all parameters characterizing the paradigmatic case of a bosonic mode, subject to Linbladian noise. We show how the time employed in the estimation should be partitioned in order to achieve the best possible precision. In most cases, the optimal performance may be obtained without the necessity of adaptivity or entanglement with ancilla. We compare results with optimal classical strategies. Interestingly, for temperature estimation, applying a fast-prepare-and-measure protocol with Fock states provides better scaling with the number of photons than any classical strategy.</description>

      <title>Verifying Energy-Time Entanglement with Irregularly Sampled Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying entanglement with experimental measurements requires that we take the limitations of experimental techniques into account, while still proving that the data obtained could not have been generated from a classical source. In the energy-time degree of freedom, this challenge is exacerbated because realistic high-resolution frequency measurements are obtained as a function of light passing through arbitrary filters positioned at uneven intervals. In this work, we show how the data gathered from these kinds of measurements can be used to fully certify the degree of energy and timing correlations needed to certify energy-time entanglement without having to make special assumptions about the state or the measurement device. We accomplish this by showing how to construct a continuous-variable probability density from the data that can closely estimate, but never over-estimate the correlations (and entanglement) actually present in the system, and note that these methods are applicable to all continuous-variable degrees of freedom (e.g., spatial, field quadratures, etc). We illustrate the feasibility of these methods using frequency and timing correlations obtainable from photon pairs in Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion.</description>

      <title>Automated quantum system modeling with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the complexity of quantum systems in the real world, models with just a few effective many-body states often suffice to describe their quantum dynamics, provided decoherence is accounted for. We show that a machine learning algorithm is able to construct such models, given a straightforward set of quantum dynamics measurements. The effective Hilbert space can be a black box, with variations of the coupling to just one accessible output state being sufficient to generate the required training data. We demonstrate through simulations of a Markovian open quantum system that a neural network can automatically detect the number $N $ of effective states and the most relevant Hamiltonian terms and state-dephasing processes and rates. For systems with $N\leq5$ we find typical mean relative errors of predictions in the $10 \%$ range. With more advanced networks and larger training sets, it is conceivable that a future single software can provide the automated first stop solution to model building for an unknown device or system, complementing and validating the conventional approach based on physical insight into the system.</description>

      <title>Convergence guarantee for linearly-constrained combinatorial optimization with a quantum alternating operator ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA$^+$) that solves a class of linearly constrained optimization problems by evolving a quantum state within a Hilbert subspace of feasible problem solutions. Our main focus is on a class of problems with a linear constraint containing sequential integer coefficients. For problems in this class, we devise QAOA$^+$ circuits that provably converge to the optimal solution as the number of circuit layers increases, generalizing previous guarantees for solving unconstrained problems or problems with symmetric constraints. Our approach includes asymmetric ``mixing" Hamiltonians that drive transitions between feasible states, as well as a method to incorporate an arbitrary known feasible solution as the initial state, each of which can be applied beyond the specific linear constraints considered here. This analysis extends QAOA$^+$ performance guarantees to a more general set of linearly-constrained problems and provides tools for future generalizations.</description>

      <title>Thermalization Dynamics in Closed Quantum Many Body Systems: a Precision Large Scale Exact Diagonalization Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a Krylov-subspace time evolution algorithm, we simulate the real-time dynamics of non-integrable finite spin rings to quite long times with high accuracy. We systematically study the finite-size deviation between the resulting equilibrium state and the thermal state, and we highlight the importance of the energy variance on the deviations. We find that the deviations are well described by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and that the von Neumann entropy correction scaling is the square of the local operator scaling. We reveal also an area law contribution to the relaxed von Neumann entropy, which we connect to the mutual information between the considered subsystem and its immediate environment. We also find that local observables relax towards equilibrium exponentially with a relaxation time scale that grows linearly with system length and is somewhat independent of the local operator, but depends strongly on the energy of the initial state, with the fastest relaxation times found towards one end of the overall energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Maximal device-independent randomness in every dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random numbers are used in a wide range of sciences. In many applications, generating unpredictable \textit{private} random numbers is indispensable. Device-independent quantum random number generation is a framework that makes use of the intrinsic randomness of quantum processes to generate numbers that are fundamentally unpredictable according to our current understanding of physics. While device-independent quantum random number generation is an exceptional theoretical feat, the difficulty of controlling quantum systems makes it challenging to carry out in practice. It is therefore desirable to harness the full power of the quantum degrees of freedom (the dimension) that one can control. It is known that no more than $2 \log(d)$ bits of private device-independent randomness can be extracted from a quantum system of local dimension $d$. In this paper we demonstrate that this bound can be achieved for all dimensions $d$ by providing a family of explicit protocols. In order to obtain our result, we develop new certification techniques that can be of wider interest in device-independent applications for scenarios in which complete certification (`self-testing') is impossible or impractical.</description>

      <title>Subspace Preserving Quantum Convolutional Neural Network Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subspace preserving quantum circuits are a class of quantum algorithms that, relying on some symmetries in the computation, can offer theoretical guarantees for their training. Those algorithms have gained extensive interest as they can offer polynomial speed-up and can be used to mimic classical machine learning algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel convolutional neural network architecture model based on Hamming weight preserving quantum circuits. In particular, we introduce convolutional layers, and measurement based pooling layers that preserve the symmetries of the quantum states while realizing non-linearity using gates that are not subspace preserving. Our proposal offers significant polynomial running time advantages over classical deep-learning architecture. We provide an open source simulation library for Hamming weight preserving quantum circuits that can simulate our techniques more efficiently with GPU-oriented libraries. Using this code, we provide examples of architectures that highlight great performances on complex image classification tasks with a limited number of qubits, and with fewer parameters than classical deep-learning architectures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement distribution in pure non-Gaussian tripartite states: a Schmidt decomposition approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study entanglement in a system of three coupled quantum harmonic oscillators. Specifically, we use the Schmidt decomposition to analyze how the entanglement is distributed among the three subsystems. The Schmidt decomposition is a powerful mathematical tool for characterizing bipartite entanglement in composite quantum systems. It allows to write a multipartite quantum state as a sum of product states between the subsystems, with coefficients known as Schmidt coefficients. We apply this decomposition to the general quantum state of three coupled oscillators and study how the Schmidt coefficients evolve as the interaction strengths between the oscillators are varied. This provides insight into how entanglement is shared between the different bipartitions of the overall three-particle system. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of multipartite entanglement in networked quantum systems. They also have implications for quantum information processing using multiple entangled nodes.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Information Geometry in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fluctuation-dissipation theorem in open quantum systems from an information-theoretic perspective. We define the fidelity susceptibility that measures the sensitivity of the systems under perturbation and relate it to the fidelity correlator that characterizes the correlation behaviors for mixed quantum states. In particular, we determine the scaling behavior of the fidelity susceptibility in the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SW-SSB) phase, strongly symmetric short-range correlated phase, and the quantum critical point between them. We then provide a geometric perspective of our construction using distance measures of density matrices. We find that the metric of the quantum information geometry generated by perturbative distance between density matrices before and after perturbation is generally non-analytic. Finally, we design a polynomial proxy that can in principle be used as an experimental probe for detecting the SW-SSB and phase transition through quantum metrology. In particular, we show that each term of the polynomial proxy is related to the R\'enyi versions of the fidelity correlators.</description>

      <title>X-arability of mixed quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of determining when entanglement is present in a quantum system is one of the most active areas of research in quantum physics. Depending on the setting at hand, different notions of entanglement (or lack thereof) become relevant. Examples include separability (of bosons, fermions, and distinguishable particles), Schmidt number, biseparability, entanglement depth, and bond dimension. In this work, we propose and study a unified notion of separability, which we call X-arability, that captures a wide range of applications including these. For a subset (more specifically, an algebraic variety) of pure states X, we say that a mixed quantum state is X-arable if it lies in the convex hull of X. We develop unified tools and provable guarantees for X-arability, which already give new results for the standard separability problem. Our results include:
  -- An X-tension hierarchy of semidefinite programs for X-arability (generalizing the symmetric extensions hierarchy for separability), and a new de Finetti theorem for fermionic separability.
  -- A hierarchy of eigencomputations for optimizing a Hermitian operator over X, with applications to X-tanglement witnesses and polynomial optimization.
  -- A hierarchy of linear systems for the X-tangled subspace problem, with improved polynomial time guarantees even for the standard entangled subspace problem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the workflow for converting qubit circuits represented by Open Quantum ASseMbly format (OpenQASM, also known as QASM) into the qudit form for execution on qudit hardware and provide a method for translating qudit experiment results back into qubit results. We present the comparison of several qudit transpilation regimes, which differ in decomposition of multicontrolled gates: "qubit" as ordinary qubit transpilation and execution, "qutrit" with $d{=}3$ levels and single qubit in qudit and "ququart" with $d{=}4$ levels and 2 qubits per ququart. We provide several examples of transpiling circuits, which demonstrate potential advantages of qudits.</description>

      <title>Tuning transport in solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures by Feshbach resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures have emerged as promising platforms for realizing tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures. Their constituents are fermionic charge carriers resonantly coupled to long-lived bosonic interlayer excitons, allowing them to form trion bound states. Such platforms promise to achieve comparable densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures. Here, we predict the transport properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the response of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag. Our results on the temperature-dependent resistivities demonstrate that interaction effects dominate over established conventional scattering mechanisms in these solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement renormalization of fractonic anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gapped fracton phases constitute a new class of quantum states of matter which connects to topological orders but does not fit easily into existing paradigms. They host unconventional features such as sub-extensive and robust ground state degeneracies as well as sensitivity to lattice geometry. We investigate the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model [1] which can describe a family of fracton phases defined on arbitrary graphs. Focusing on representative geometries where the 3D lattices are extensions of 2D square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices into the third dimension, we study their ground state degeneracies and mobility of excitations, and examine their entanglement renormalization group (ERG) flows. All models show bifurcating behaviors under ERG but have distinct ERG flows sensitive to both $N$ and lattice geometry. In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices are equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast to previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice is robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Truncated-Wigner-Approximation Theory of Molecular Exciton-Polariton Dynamics in Optical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular exciton polaritons are hybrid states resulting from the strong coupling of molecular electronic excitations with an optical cavity mode, presenting a promising approach for controlling photophysical and photochemical properties in molecular systems. In this study, we develop a semiclassical theory for molecular exciton-polariton dynamics using the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) to explore the collective behavior of molecular electronic excited states under strong light-matter coupling. Our approach expands the previously developed TWA theory for molecular vibration-polariton dynamics (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 3019--3027) by incorporating semiclassical treatment of quantum coherence between ground and excited molecular states. We initially apply the TWA theory to a simplified system of molecules modeled as two-level (spin-1/2) systems, omitting vibronic coupling. The semiclassical results derived from applying the TWA to single-spin operators demonstrate excellent agreement with full quantum dynamic simulations in systems with a sufficiently large number of molecules. Lastly, the TWA theory is extended to incorporate molecular vibronic coupling, revealing the dynamic polaron decoupling effect, where quantum coherence between molecular excitations is preserved under strong light-matter coupling.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of autoencoders and machine learning methods for detecting and analyzing quantum phase transitions in the Two-Component Bose-Hubbard Model. By leveraging deep learning models such as autoencoders, we investigate latent space representations, reconstruction error analysis, and cluster distance calculations to identify phase boundaries and critical points. The study is supplemented by dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE for latent space visualization. The results demonstrate the potential of autoencoders to describe the dynamics of quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Quantum Annealing for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealers offer a promising approach to solve Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which have a wide range of applications. However, when a user submits its QUBO problem to a third-party quantum annealer, the problem itself may disclose the user's private information to the quantum annealing service provider. To mitigate this risk, we introduce a privacy-preserving QUBO framework and propose a novel solution method. Our approach employs a combination of digit-wise splitting and matrix permutation to obfuscate the QUBO problem's model matrix $Q$, effectively concealing the matrix elements. In addition, based on the solution to the obfuscated version of the QUBO problem, we can reconstruct the solution to the original problem with high accuracy. Theoretical analysis and empirical tests confirm the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed technique, demonstrating its potential for preserving user privacy in quantum annealing services.</description>

Abstract: Quantum trajectories are Markov processes describing the evolution of a quantum system subject to indirect measurements. They can be viewed as place dependent iterated function systems or the result of products of dependent and non identically distributed random matrices. In this article, we establish a complete classification of their invariant measures. The classification is done in two steps. First, we prove a Markov process on some linear subspaces called dark subspaces, defined in (Maassen, K\"ummerer 2006), admits a unique invariant measure. Second, we study the process inside the dark subspaces. Using a notion of minimal family of isometries from a reference space to dark subspaces, we prove a set of measures indexed by orbits of a unitary group is the set of ergodic measures of quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>Interaction between Unruh-Dewitt detectors exclusively due to acceleration: A Parallel to the FDU Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have discovered an interaction between two detectors in a vacuum that emerges exclusively due to acceleration, akin to the spontaneous excitation of a single detector as predicted by the Fulling-Davies-Unruh (FDU) effect. However, this interaction contrasts sharply with the FDU effect, which suggests that a uniformly accelerated detector behaves as if it were in a thermal bath, as the discovered interaction does not manifest in a thermal environment. The novel interaction displays unique dependencies on the separation between detectors: it can be either attractive or repulsive, with the potential to transition between these behaviors as the inter-detector separation changes. More intriguingly, it exhibits a surprising large-small duality in its dependence on acceleration, suggesting the existence of an optimal acceleration at which the interaction is strongest, in contrast to the monotonic acceleration-dependence of the FDU effect.</description>

Abstract: Optically trapped Rydberg atoms are a suitable platform to explore quantum many-body physics mediated by long-range atom--atom interactions that can be engineered through externally applied light fields. However, this approach is limited to dipole-allowed transitions and a spatial resolution of the order of the optical wavelength. Here, we theoretically investigate the interaction between free electrons and individual Rydberg atoms as an approach to induce nondipolar transitions with subnanometer spatial precision and a substantial degree of control over the final atomic states. We observe unity-order excitation probabilities produced by a single electron for suitably chosen combinations of electron energies and electron-beam distance to the atom. We further discuss electron--atom entanglement in combination with lateral shaping of the electron followed by postselection. Our results support free electrons as powerful tools to manipulate Rydberg atoms in previously inaccessible ways.</description>

Abstract: Understanding many body systems is a key challenge in physics. Single atom resolved imaging techniques have unlocked access to microscopic correlations in ultracold quantum gases. However they cannot be used when the relevant length scales are obscured by the resolution of the detection technique. We present a matterwave magnification scheme, based on evolutions in optical potentials, tailored to magnify the wave function of atoms, such that all length scales can be resolved. To showcase this method, we image atoms in the strongly interacting regime, establishing a new way to characterize correlated systems.</description>

Abstract: We show how to super-resolve signals encoded in bosonic modes using collective quantum measurements exploiting permutation symmetry. Our collective measurement strategy does not rely on estimating or knowing additional nuisance parameters of the signals, such as the mean or median value of the signals distribution, a necessary condition in almost all spatial, temporal or spectral super-resolution schemes employed to date. More importantly, we show that careful fine-graining of our collective measurement strategy allows for estimation of additional signal parameters, such as the relative intensity of the bosonic sources, at the quantum limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing entanglement is central for quantum information science. Special observables which indicate entanglement, so-called entanglement witnesses, are a widely used tool for this task. The construction of these witnesses typically relies on the observation that quantum states with a high fidelity to some entangled target state are entangled, too. We introduce a general method to construct entanglement witnesses based on the Schmidt decomposition of observables. The method works for two- and, more importantly, many-body systems and is strictly stronger than fidelity-based constructions. The resulting witnesses can also be used to quantify entanglement as well as to characterize the dimensionality of it. Finally, we present experimentally relevant examples, where our approach improves entanglement detection significantly.</description>

      <title>Limit on spatial quantum superpositions with massive objects due to phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing goal to bring massive objects into a superposition of different locations in real space, not only to confirm quantum theory in new regimes, but also to explore the interface with gravity. The main challenge is usually thought to arise from forces or scattering due to environmental fields and particles that decohere the large object's wave function into a statistical mixture. We unveil a decoherence channel which cannot be eliminated by improved isolation from the environment. It originates from sound waves within the object, which are excited as part of any splitting process and carry partial "Welcher Weg" information. This puts stringent constraints on future spatial superpositions of large objects.</description>

Abstract: Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components. However, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Experimental realization of strong coupling in a hybrid system remains a long-standing challenge, especially when it has multiple components and the components are of different nature. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a novel polaromechanical hybrid system, where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. The corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting is observed. A high polaromechanical cooperativity of $9.4\times10^3$ is achieved by significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via exploiting coherent perfect absorption. The quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable if placing the system at low bath temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.</description>

      <title>Channel-based framework for phase esimation of multiple eigenvalues</title>

Abstract: Quantum phase estimation (QPE) of the eigenvalues of a unitary operator on a target quantum system is a crucial subroutine in various quantum algorithms. Conventional QPE is often expensive to implement as it requires a large number of ancilla qubits and the ability to perform quantum Fourier transform. Recent developments in iterative QPE reduce the implementation cost by repetitive uses of a single ancilla and classical post-processing. However, both conventional and iterative schemes often require preparation of the target system in an eigenstate of the unitary operator, while it remains ambiguous to achieve QPE of multiple eigenvalues with no need of initial state preparation. Here we clarify this issue by developing a theoretical framework based on sequential quantum channels for iterative QPE. We find that QPE of multiple eigenvalues can be efficiently realized for arbitrary initial target system state by actively utilizing the measurement backaction of iterative QPE on the target system with a long coherence time. Specifically, we investigate two iterative QPE schemes based on sequential Ramsey interferometry measurements (RIMs) of an ancilla qubit: (a) the repetitive scheme, which conducts repetitive RIMs to achieve the standard quantum limit in estimating the eigenvalues; (b) the adaptive scheme, which adjusts the parameters of each RIM based on prior measurement outcomes to attain the Heisenberg limit. In both schemes, sequential ancilla measurements generate sequential quantum channels on the target system, gradually steering it to the eigenstates of the estimated unitary operator, while the measurement statistics of the ancilla can reveal the embedded information about its eigenvalues with proper post-processing. We demonstrate the analysis by simulating a central spin model, and evaluate the performance and noise resilience of both schemes.</description>

Abstract: The quantum time of arrival (TOA) problem requires the statistics of measured arrival times given only the initial state of a particle. Following the standard framework of quantum theory, the problem translates into finding an appropriate quantum image of the classical arrival time $\mathcal{T}_C(q,p)$, usually in operator form $\hat{\mathrm{T}}$. In this paper, we consider the problem anew within the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. The resulting quantum image is a real-valued and time-reversal symmetric function $\mathcal{T}_M(q,p)$ in formal series of $\hbar^2$ with the classical arrival time as the leading term. It is obtained directly from the Moyal bracket relation with the system Hamiltonian and is hence interpreted as a Moyal deformation of the classical TOA. We investigate its properties and discuss how it bypasses the known obstructions to quantization by showing the isomorphism between $\mathcal{T}_M(q,p)$ and the rigged Hilbert space TOA operator constructed in [Eur. Phys. J. Plus \textbf{138}, 153 (2023)] which always satisfy the time-energy canonical commutation relation (TECCR) for arbitrary analytic potentials. We then examine TOA problems for a free particle and a quartic oscillator potential as examples.</description>

      <title>(Almost-)Quantum Bell Inequalities and Device-Independent Applications</title>

Abstract: Investigations of the boundary of the quantum correlation set through the derivation of quantum Bell inequalities have gained increased attention in recent years, which are related to Tsirelson's problem and have significant applications in DI information processing. However, determining quantum Bell inequalities is a notoriously difficult task and only isolated examples are known. In this paper, we present families of (almost-)quantum Bell inequalities and highlight three foundational and DI applications. Firstly, quantum correlations on the non-signaling boundary are crucial in the DI randomness extraction from weak sources. In the practical Bell scenario of two players with two k-outcome measurements, we derive quantum Bell inequalities that show a separation of the quantum boundary from certain portions of the no-signaling boundary of dimension up to 4k-8, extending previous results. As an immediate by-product of this, we give a general proof of Aumann's Agreement theorem for quantum systems and the almost-quantum correlations, which implies Aumann's agreement theorem is a reasonable physical principle in the context of epistemics to pick out both quantum theory and almost-quantum correlations from general no-signaling theories. Secondly, we present a family of quantum Bell inequalities in the two players with m binary measurements scenarios, that serve to self-test the two-qubit singlet and 2m measurements. Interestingly, this claim generalizes the result for m=2 discovered by Tsirelson-Landau-Masanes and shows an improvement over the state-of-the-art DIRA. Lastly, we use our quantum Bell inequalities to derive the general form of the principle of no advantage in nonlocal computation, which is an information-theoretic principle that serves to characterize the quantum correlation set. With this, we provide the most precise characterization of the quantum boundary known so far.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing and quantum-inspired algorithms have sparked renewed interest in binary optimization. These hardware and software innovations promise to revolutionize solution times for complex problems. In this work, we propose a novel method for solving linear systems. Our approach leverages binary optimization, making it particularly well-suited for problems with large condition numbers. We transform the linear system into a binary optimization problem, drawing inspiration from the geometry of the original problem and resembling the conjugate gradient method. This approach employs conjugate directions that significantly accelerate the algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by leveraging partial knowledge of the problem's intrinsic geometry, we can decompose the original problem into smaller, independent sub-problems. These sub-problems can be efficiently tackled using either quantum or classical solvers. While determining the problem's geometry introduces some additional computational cost, this investment is outweighed by the substantial performance gains compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Error and Disturbance as Irreversibility with Applications: Unified Definition, Wigner--Araki--Yanase Theorem and Out-of-Time-Order Correlator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the proposal of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, error and disturbance of quantum measurements have been fundamental notions in quantum physics. As is often the case when defining physical quantities in quantum physics, there is no single way to define these two notions, and many independent definitions of them have been given. Here, we establish a novel formulation defining the error and disturbance as special cases of the irreversibility in quantum processes. The formulation enables us to apply the knowledge of irreversibility in stochastic thermodynamics and quantum information theory to the error and disturbance in quantum measurements. To demonstrate this strength, we provide three byproducts: First, we unify the existing formulations of error and disturbance. Second, we extend the quantitative Wigner--Araki--Yanase theorem -- a universal restriction on measurement implementation under a conservation law -- to errors and disturbances of arbitrary definitions and processes. Third, we reveal that our formulation covers the out-of-time-orderd-correlator -- a measure of quantum chaos in a quantum many-body system -- as the irreversibility in analogy with the measurement context, and provide its experimental evaluation method.</description>

      <title>Trainability and Expressivity of Hamming-Weight Preserving Quantum Circuits for Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has become a promising area for real world applications of quantum computers, but near-term methods and their scalability are still important research topics. In this context, we analyze the trainability and controllability of specific Hamming weight preserving variational quantum circuits (VQCs). These circuits use qubit gates that preserve subspaces of the Hilbert space, spanned by basis states with fixed Hamming weight $k$.
  In this work, we first design and prove the feasibility of new heuristic data loaders, performing quantum amplitude encoding of $\binom{n}{k}$-dimensional vectors by training an $n$-qubit quantum circuit. These data loaders are obtained using dimensionality reduction techniques, by checking the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM)'s rank. Second, we provide a theoretical justification for the fact that the rank of the QFIM of any VQC state is almost-everywhere constant, which is of separate interest. Lastly, we analyze the trainability of Hamming weight preserving circuits, and show that the variance of the $l_2$ cost function gradient is bounded according to the dimension $\binom{n}{k}$ of the subspace. This proves conditions of existence/lack of Barren Plateaus for these circuits, and highlights a setting where a recent conjecture on the link between controllability and trainability of variational quantum circuits does not apply.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quantum Communication Advantage in Distributed Inference and Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training and inference with large machine learning models that far exceed the memory capacity of individual devices necessitates the design of distributed architectures, forcing one to contend with communication constraints. We present a framework for distributed computation over a quantum network in which data is encoded into specialized quantum states. We prove that for models within this framework, inference and training using gradient descent can be performed with exponentially less communication compared to their classical analogs, and with relatively modest overhead relative to standard gradient-based methods. We show that certain graph neural networks are particularly amenable to implementation within this framework, and moreover present empirical evidence that they perform well on standard benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first example of exponential quantum advantage for a generic class of machine learning problems that hold regardless of the data encoding cost. Moreover, we show that models in this class can encode highly nonlinear features of their inputs, and their expressivity increases exponentially with model depth. We also delineate the space of models for which exponential communication advantages hold by showing that they cannot hold for linear classification. Our results can be combined with natural privacy advantages in the communicated quantum states that limit the amount of information that can be extracted from them about the data and model parameters. Taken as a whole, these findings form a promising foundation for distributed machine learning over quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toric $t$-designs, or equivalently $t$-designs on the diagonal subgroup of the unitary group, are sets of points on the torus over which sums reproduce integrals of degree $t$ monomials over the full torus. Motivated by the projective structure of quantum mechanics, we develop the notion of $t$-designs on the projective torus, which have a much more restricted structure than their counterparts on full tori. We provide various new constructions of toric and projective toric designs and prove bounds on their size. We draw connections between projective toric designs and a diverse set of mathematical objects, including difference and Sidon sets from the field of additive combinatorics, symmetric, informationally complete positive operator valued measures and complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) from quantum information theory, and crystal ball sequences of certain root lattices. Using these connections, we prove bounds on the maximal size of dense $B_t \bmod m$ sets. We also use projective toric designs to construct families of quantum state designs. In particular, we construct families of (uniformly-weighted) quantum state $2$-designs in dimension $d$ of size exactly $d(d+1)$ that do not form complete sets of MUBs, thereby disproving a conjecture concerning the relationship between designs and MUBs (Zhu 2015). We then propose a modification of Zhu's conjecture and discuss potential paths towards proving this conjecture. We prove a fundamental distinction between complete sets of MUBs in prime-power dimensions versus in dimension $6$ (and, we conjecture, in all non-prime-power dimensions), the distinction relating to group structure of the corresponding projective toric design. Finally, we discuss many open questions about the properties of these projective toric designs and how they relate to other questions in number theory, geometry, and quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Two-way microwave-optical quantum transduction is essential to connecting distant superconducting qubits via optical fiber, and to enable quantum networking at a large scale. In Bl\'esin, Tian, Bhave, and Kippenberg's article, ``Quantum coherent microwave-optical transduction using high overtone bulk acoustic resonances" (Phys. Rev. A, 104, 052601 (2021)), they lay out a two-way quantum transducer converting between microwave photons and telecom-band photons by way of an intermediary GHz-band phonon mode utilizing piezoelectric and optomechanical interactions respectively (and are the first to work out the quantum piezoelectric coupling). In this work, we examine both the piezoelectric, and optomechanical interactions from first principles, and together with the evanescent coupling between optical modes, discuss what parameters matter most in optimizing this kind of quantum transducer. For its additional utility, we have also compiled a table of relevant properties of optical materials that may be used as elements in transducers.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELMs) have emerged as a promising framework for quantum machine learning. Their appeal lies in the rich feature map induced by the dynamics of a quantum substrate - the quantum reservoir - and the efficient post-measurement training via linear regression. Here we study the expressivity of QELMs by decomposing the prediction of QELMs into a Fourier series. We show that the achievable Fourier frequencies are determined by the data encoding scheme, while Fourier coefficients depend on both the reservoir and the measurement. Notably, the expressivity of QELMs is fundamentally limited by the number of Fourier frequencies and the number of observables, while the complexity of the prediction hinges on the reservoir. As a cautionary note on scalability, we identify four sources that can lead to the exponential concentration of the observables as the system size grows (randomness, hardware noise, entanglement, and global measurements) and show how this can turn QELMs into useless input-agnostic oracles. In particular, our result on the reservoir-induced concentration strongly indicates that quantum reservoirs drawn from a highly random ensemble make QELM models unscalable. Our analysis elucidates the potential and fundamental limitations of QELMs, and lays the groundwork for systematically exploring quantum reservoir systems for other machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Shadow Simulation of Quantum Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the task of shadow process simulation, where the goal is to simulate the estimation of the expectation values of arbitrary quantum observables at the output of a target physical process. When the sender and receiver share random bits or other no-signaling resources, we show that the performance of shadow process simulation exceeds that of conventional process simulation protocols in a variety of scenarios including communication, noise simulation, and data compression. Remarkably, we find that there exist scenarios where shadow simulation provides increased statistical accuracy without any increase in the number of required samples.</description>

      <title>State-dependent and state-independent uncertainty relations for skew information and standard deviation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we derive state-dependent uncertainty relations (uncertainty equalities) in which commutators of incompatible operators (not necessarily Hermitian) are explicitly present and state-independent uncertainty relations based on the Wigner-Yanase (-Dyson) skew information. We derive uncertainty equality based on standard deviation for incompatible operators with mixed states, a generalization of previous works in which only pure states were considered. We show that for pure states, the Wigner-Yanase skew information based state-independent uncertainty relations become standard deviation based state-independent uncertainty relations which turn out to be tighter uncertainty relations for some cases than the ones given in previous works, and we generalize the previous works for arbitrary operators. As the Wigner-Yanase skew information of a quantum channel can be considered as a measure of quantum coherence of a density operator with respect to that channel, we show that there exists a state-independent uncertainty relation for the coherence measures of the density operator with respect to a collection of different channels. We show that state-dependent and state-independent uncertainty relations based on a more general version of skew information called generalized skew information which includes the Wigner-Yanase (-Dyson) skew information and the Fisher information as special cases hold. In qubits, we derive tighter state-independent uncertainty inequalities for different form of generalized skew informations and standard deviations, and state-independent uncertainty equalities involving generalized skew informations and standard deviations. Finally, we provide a scheme to determine the Wigner-Yanase (-Dyson) skew information of an unknown observable using the notion of weak values.</description>

      <title>Approximating maximum independent set on Rydberg atom arrays using local detunings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays operated by a quantum adiabatic principle are among the most promising quantum simulating platforms due to their scalability and long coherence time. From the perspective of combinatorial optimization, they offer an efficient solution for an intrinsic maximum independent set problem because of the resemblance between the Rydberg Hamiltonian and the cost function of the maximum independent set problem. In this study, a strategy is suggested to approximate maximum independent sets by adjusting local detunings on the Rydberg Hamiltonian according to each vertex's vertex support, which is a quantity that represents connectivity between vertices. By doing so, the strategy successfully reduces the error rate three times for the checkerboard graphs with defects when the adiabaticity is sufficient. In addition, the strategy decreases the error rate for random graphs even when the adiabaticity is relatively insufficient. Moreover, it is shown that the strategy helps to prepare a quantum many-body ground state by raising the fidelity between the evolved quantum state and a 2D cat state on a square lattice. Finally, the strategy is combined with the non-abelian adiabatic mixing and this approach is highly successful in finding maximum independent sets compared to the conventional adiabatic evolution with local detunings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the solution of time-dependent nonlinear differential equations, we present variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that encode both space and time in qubit registers. The spacetime encoding enables us to obtain the entire time evolution from a single ground-state computation. We describe a general procedure to construct efficient quantum circuits for the cost function evaluation required by VQAs. To mitigate the barren plateau problem during the optimization, we propose an adaptive multigrid strategy. The approach is illustrated for the nonlinear Burgers equation. We classically optimize quantum circuits to represent the desired ground-state solutions, run them on IBM Q System One and Quantinuum System Model H1, and demonstrate that current quantum computers are capable of accurately reproducing the exact results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum communication and quantum metrology are widely compelling applications in the field of quantum information science, and quantum remote sensing is an intersection of both. Despite their differences, there are notable commonalities between quantum communication and quantum remote sensing, as they achieve their functionalities through the transmission of quantum states. Here we propose a novel quantum integrated sensing and communication (QISAC) protocol, which achieves quantum sensing under the Heisenberg limit while simultaneously enabling quantum secure communication through the transmission of entanglements. We have theoretically proven its security against eavesdroppers. The security of QISAC is characterized by the secrecy capacity for information bit as well as asymmetric Fisher information gain for sensing. Through simulations conducted under the constraints of limited entanglement resources, we illustrate that QISAC maintains high accuracy in the estimation of phase. Hence our QISAC offers a fresh perspective for the applications of future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>An angle rounding parameter initialization technique for ma-QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-angle quantum approximate optimization algorithm (ma-QAOA) is a recently introduced algorithm that gives at least the same approximation ratio as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and, in most cases, gives a significantly higher approximation ratio than QAOA. One drawback to ma-QAOA is that it uses significantly more classical parameters than QAOA, so the classical optimization component more complex. In this paper, we motivate a new parameter initialization strategy in which angles are initially randomly set to multiples of $\pi/8$ between $-\pi$ and $\pi$ and this vector is used to seed one round of BFGS. We find that this parameter initialization strategy gives average approximation ratios of $0.900$, $0.982$, and $0.997$ for $p = 1, 2, 3$ layers of ma-QAOA. This is comparable to the average approximation ratios of ma-QAOA where the optimal parameters are found using BFGS with 1 random starting seed, which are $0.900$, $0.982$, and $0.996$. We also test another parameter initialization strategy in which angles corresponding to maximal degree vertices in the graph are set to 0 while all other are randomly initialized to random multiples of $\pi/8$. Using this strategy, the average approximation ratios are $0.897$, $0.984$, and $0.997$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography, aimed at deriving a classical description of an unknown state from measurement data, is a fundamental task in quantum physics. In this work, we analyse the ultimate achievable performance of tomography of continuous-variable systems, such as bosonic and quantum optical systems. We prove that tomography of these systems is extremely inefficient in terms of time resources, much more so than tomography of finite-dimensional systems: not only does the minimum number of state copies needed for tomography scale exponentially with the number of modes, but it also exhibits a dramatic scaling with the trace-distance error, even for low-energy states, in stark contrast with the finite-dimensional case. On a more positive note, we prove that tomography of Gaussian states is efficient. To accomplish this, we answer a fundamental question for the field of continuous-variable quantum information: if we know with a certain error the first and second moments of an unknown Gaussian state, what is the resulting trace-distance error that we make on the state? Lastly, we demonstrate that tomography of non-Gaussian states prepared through Gaussian unitaries and a few local non-Gaussian evolutions is efficient and experimentally feasible.</description>

      <title>An operational distinction between quantum entanglement and classical non-separability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement describes superposition states in multi-dimensional systems, at least two partite, which cannot be factorized and are thus non-separable. Non-separable states exist also in classical theories involving vector spaces. In both cases, it is possible to violate a Bell-like inequality. This has led to controversial discussions, which we resolve by identifying an operational distinction between the classical and quantum cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of random scattering in quantum walks on a finite graph and compare it with the effect of repeated measurements. To this end, a constructive approach is employed by introducing a localized and a delocalized basis for the underlying Hilbert space. This enables us to design Hamiltonians whose eigenvectors are either localized or delocalized. By presenting some specific examples we demonstrate that the localization of eigenvectors restricts the transition probabilities on the graph and leads to dark states in the monitored evolution. We conclude that repeated measurements as well as random scattering provide efficient tools for controlling quantum walks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum-Classical Hybrid Algorithm for Determining Eigenstate Energies in Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing efficient quantum computing algorithms is essential for tackling computationally challenging problems across various fields. This paper presents a novel quantum algorithm, XZ24, for efficiently computing the eigen-energy spectra of arbitrary quantum systems. Given a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ and an initial reference state $|\psi_{\text{ref}} \rangle$, the algorithm extracts information about $\langle \psi_{\text{ref}} | \cos(\hat{H} t) | \psi_{\text{ref}} \rangle$ from an auxiliary qubit's state. By applying a Fourier transform, the algorithm resolves the energies of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with significant overlap with the reference wavefunction.
  We provide a theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, showing XZ24's superior efficiency and accuracy compared to existing algorithms. XZ24 has three key advantages:
  1. It removes the need for eigenstate preparation, requiring only a reference state with non-negligible overlap, improving upon methods like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. 2. It reduces measurement overhead, measuring only one auxiliary qubit. For a system of size $L$ with precision $\epsilon$, the sampling complexity scales as $O(L \cdot \epsilon^{-1})$. When relative precision $\epsilon$ is sufficient, the complexity scales as $O(\epsilon^{-1})$, making measurements independent of system size. 3. It enables simultaneous computation of multiple eigen-energies, depending on the reference state.
  We anticipate that XZ24 will advance quantum system simulations and enhance applications in quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: High-rate, high-fidelity entanglement distribution is essential to the creation of a quantum internet, but recent achievements in fiber and satellite-based entanglement distribution fall far short of what is needed. Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 054209 (2023)] proposed a means for dramatically increasing entanglement-distribution rates via zero added-loss multiplexing (ZALM). ZALM's quantum transmitter employs a pair of Sagnac-configured spontaneous parametric downconverters (SPDCs), channelization via dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) filtering, and partial Bell-state measurements (BSMs) to realize a heralded source of frequency-multiplexed polarization-entangled biphotons. Each biphoton is transmitted to Alice and Bob with a classical message identifying its frequency channel and the heralded entangled state. Their quantum receivers use DWDM filtering and mode conversion to interface their received biphotons to intra-cavity color-center quantum memories. This paper delves deeply into ZALM's SPDCs, partial-BSMs, and loading of Alice and Bob's quantum memories. It derives the density operators for the SPDC sources and the quantum memories, allowing heralding probability, heralding efficiency, and fidelity to be evaluated for both the polarization-entangled biphotons and the loaded quantum memories, thus enabling exploration of the parameter space for optimizing ZALM performance. Even without optimization analysis, the paper already demonstrates two critical features of the ZALM architecture: the necessity of achieving a near-separable channelized biphoton wave function to ensure the biphoton sent to Alice and Bob is of high purity; and the premium placed on Alice and Bob's temporal-mode converters' enabling narrowband push-pull memory loading to ensure the arriving biphoton's state is faithfully transferred to the intra-cavity color centers.</description>

      <title>Resource overheads and attainable rates for trapped-ion lattice surgery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present estimates for the number of ions needed to implement fault-tolerant lattice surgery between spatially separated trapped-ion surface codes. Additionally, we determine attainable lattice surgery rates given a number of dedicated ``communication ions" per logical qubit. Because our analysis depends heavily on the rate that syndrome extraction cycles take place, we survey the state-of the art and propose three possible cycle times between $10$ and $1000 \mu s$ that we could reasonably see realised provided certain technological milestones are met. Consequently, our numerical results indicate that hundreds of resource ions will be needed for lattice surgery in the slowest case, while close to a hundred thousand will be needed in the fastest case. The main factor contributing to these prohibitive estimates is the limited rate that ions can be coupled across traps. Our results indicate an urgent need for optical coupling to improve by one or more orders of magnitude for trapped-ion quantum computers to scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon pairs generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion are a well-established method to realize entangled bipartite photonic systems. Laguerre-Gaussian modes, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), are commonly exploited to engineer high-dimensional entangled quantum states. %experimentally. For Hilbert spaces with dimension d&gt;2, maximally entangled states (MESs) help to improve the capacity and security of quantum communication protocols, among several other promising features. However, the direct generation of MES in well-defined high-dimensional subspaces of the infinite OAM basis has remained a challenge. Here, we formalize how the spatial distribution of the pump beam and the nonlinear profile of the crystal can be simultaneously utilized to generate MES without additional spatial filtering of OAM modes within a subspace. We illustrate our approach with maximally entangled qutrits (d=3) and ququints (d=5).</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of quantum fidelity kernels for Gaussian process regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing algorithms have been shown to produce performant quantum kernels for machine-learning classification problems. Here, we examine the performance of quantum kernels for regression problems of practical interest. For an unbiased benchmarking of quantum kernels, it is necessary to construct the most optimal functional form of the classical kernels and the most optimal quantum kernels for each given data set. We develop an algorithm that uses an analog of the Bayesian information criterion to optimize the sequence of quantum gates used to estimate quantum kernels for Gaussian process models. The algorithm increases the complexity of the quantum circuits incrementally, while improving the performance of the resulting kernels, and is shown to yield much higher model accuracy with fewer quantum gates than a fixed quantum circuit ansatz. We demonstrate that quantum kernels thus obtained can be used to build accurate models of global potential energy surfaces (PES) for polyatomic molecules. The average interpolation error of the six-dimensional PES obtained with a random distribution of 2000 energy points is 16 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_3$O$^+$, 15 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_2$CO and 88 cm$^{-1}$ for HNO$_2$. We show that a compositional optimization of classical kernels for Gaussian process regression converges to the same errors. This indicates that quantum kernels can achieve the same, though not better, expressivity as classical kernels for regression problems.</description>

      <title>Leading correction to the relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Dirac particles interacting with external fields, we use the exact operator of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation obtained by Eriksen and rigorously derive a leading correction in the weak-field approximation to the known relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we carry out the operator extraction of a square root in the Eriksen operator. The derived correction is important for the scattering of relativistic particles. Since the description of this scattering by a relativistic wave equation of the second order is more convenient, we determine a general connection between relativistic wave equations of the first and second orders. For Dirac particles, the relativistic wave equation of the second order is obtained with the correction similar to that to the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma and Second Law of Quantum Resource Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics is the cornerstone of physics, characterizing the convertibility between thermodynamic states through a single function, entropy. Given the universal applicability of thermodynamics, a fundamental question in quantum information theory is whether an analogous second law can be formulated to characterize the convertibility of resources for quantum information processing by a single function. In 2008, a promising formulation was proposed, linking resource convertibility to the optimal performance of a variant of the quantum version of hypothesis testing. Central to this formulation was the generalized quantum Stein's lemma, which aimed to characterize this optimal performance by a measure of quantum resources, the regularized relative entropy of resource. If proven valid, the generalized quantum Stein's lemma would lead to the second law for quantum resources, with the regularized relative entropy of resource taking the role of entropy in thermodynamics. However, in 2023, a logical gap was found in the original proof of this lemma, casting doubt on the possibility of such a formulation of the second law. In this work, we resolve this problem by developing alternative techniques and successfully proving the generalized quantum Stein's lemma. Based on our proof, we reestablish and extend the formulation of quantum resource theories with the second law, applicable to both static resources of quantum states and a fundamental class of dynamical resources represented by classical-quantum (CQ) channels. These results resolve the fundamental problem of bridging the analogy between thermodynamics and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Qoncord: A Multi-Device Job Scheduling Framework for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers face challenges due to limited resources, particularly in cloud environments. Despite these obstacles, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are considered promising applications for present-day Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. VQAs require multiple optimization iterations to converge on a globally optimal solution. Moreover, these optimizations, known as restarts, need to be repeated from different points to mitigate the impact of noise. Unfortunately, the job scheduling policies for each VQA task in the cloud are heavily unoptimized. Notably, each VQA execution instance is typically scheduled on a single NISQ device. Given the variety of devices in the cloud, users often prefer higher-fidelity devices to ensure higher-quality solutions. However, this preference leads to increased queueing delays and unbalanced resource utilization.
  We propose Qoncord, an automated job scheduling framework to address these cloud-centric challenges for VQAs. Qoncordleverages the insight that not all training iterations and restarts are equal, Qoncord strategically divides the training process into exploratory and fine-tuning phases. Early exploratory iterations, more resilient to noise, are executed on less busy machines, while fine-tuning occurs on high-fidelity machines. This adaptive approach mitigates the impact of noise and optimizes resource usage and queuing delays in cloud environments. Qoncord also significantly reduces execution time and minimizes restart overheads by eliminating low-performance iterations. Thus, Qoncord offers similar solutions 17.4x faster. Similarly, it can offer 13.3% better solutions for the same time budget as the baseline.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lov\'asz Local Lemma: Shearer's Bound is Tight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.07055v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz Local Lemma (LLL) is a very powerful tool in combinatorics and probability theory to show the possibility of avoiding all bad events under some weakly dependent conditions. In a seminal paper, Ambainis, Kempe, and Sattath (JACM 2012) introduced a quantum version LLL (QLLL) which shows the possibility of avoiding all ``bad" Hamiltonians under some weakly dependent condition, and applied QLLL to the random k-QSAT problem. Sattath, Morampudi, Laumann, and Moessner (PNAS 2015) extended Ambainis, Kempe, and Sattath's result and showed that Shearer's bound is a sufficient condition for QLLL, and conjectured that Shearer's bound is indeed the tight condition for QLLL.
  In this paper, we affirm this conjecture. Precisely, we prove that Shearer's bound is tight for QLLL, i.e., the relative dimension of the smallest satisfying subspace is completely characterized by the independent set polynomial. Our result implies the tightness of Gily\'en and Sattath's algorithm (FOCS 2017), and also implies that the lattice gas partition function fully characterizes quantum satisfiability for almost all Hamiltonians with large enough qudits (Sattath, Morampudi, Laumann and Moessner, PNAS 2015).
  The commuting LLL (CLLL), which focuses on commuting local Hamiltonians, is also investigated here. We prove that the tight regions of CLLL and QLLL are different in general. This result indicates that it is possible to design an algorithm for CLLL which is still efficient beyond Shearer's bound.</description>

      <title>How can scientists establish an observer-independent science? Embodied cognition, consciousness and quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.15428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence is growing for the theory of embodied cognition, which posits that action and perception co-determine each other, forming an action-perception loop. This suggests that we humans somehow participate in what we perceive. So, how can scientists escape the action-perception loop to obtain an observer-independent description of the world? Here we present a set of conjectures informed by the philosophy of mind and a reverse-engineering of science and quantum physics to explore this question. We argue that embodiment, as traditionally understood, can manifest aspects of imaginary-time quantum dynamics. We then explore what additional constraints are required to obtain aspects of genuine, real-time quantum dynamics. In particular, we conjecture that an embodied scientist doing experiments must be described from the perspective of another scientist, which is ignored in traditional approaches to embodied cognition, and that observers play complementary roles as both objects experienced by other observers and ``subjects'' that experience other objects.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic and Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effects across Berry-Dipole Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Hopf insulators are a class of topological phases beyond the tenfold-way classification. The critical point separating two rotation-invariant Hopf insulator phases with distinct Hopf invariants is quite different from the usual Dirac-type or Weyl-type critical points and uniquely characterized by a quantized Berry dipole. Close to such Berry-dipole transitions, we find that the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors in the weakly doped regime are characterized by two universal functions of the ratio between doping level and bulk energy gap, and are directly proportional to the change in Hopf invariant across the transition. Our work suggests that the nonlinear Hall effects display a general-sense quantized behavior across Berry-dipole transitions, establishing a correspondence between nonlinear Hall effects and Hopf invariant.</description>

      <title>Real space thermalization of locally driven quantum magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of thermalization and its breakdown in isolated systems has led to a deeper understanding of non-equilibrium quantum states and their dependence on initial conditions. The role of initial conditions is prominently highlighted by the existence of quantum many-body scars, special athermal states with an underlying effective superspin structure, embedded in an otherwise chaotic many-body spectrum. Spin Heisenberg and $XXZ$ models and their variants in one and higher dimension have been shown to host exact quantum many-body scars, exhibiting perfect revivals of spin helix states that are realizable in synthetic and condensed matter systems. Motivated by these advances, we propose experimentally accessible, local, time-dependent protocols to explore the spatial thermalization profile and highlight how different parts of the system thermalize and affect the fate of the superspin. We identify distinct parametric regimes for the ferromagnetic ($X$-polarized) initial state based on the interplay between the driven spin and the rest, including local athermal behavior where the driven spin effectively decouples, acting like a ``cold" spot while being instrumental in heating up the other spins. We also identify parameter regimes where the superspin remains resilient to local driving for long time scales. We develop a real and Floquet space picture that explains our numerical observations, and make predictions that can be tested in various experimental setups.</description>

Abstract: In spite or the large astronomical evidence for its existence, the nature of dark matter remains enigmatic. Particles that interact only, or almost only, gravitationally, in particular with masses around the Planck mass -- the fundamental scale in quantum gravity, are intriguing candidates. Here we show that there is a theoretical possibility to directly detect such particles using highly sensitive gravity-mediated quantum phase shifts. In particular, we consider a protocol utilizing Josephson junctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain-specific hardware to solve computationally hard optimization problems has generated tremendous excitement. Here, we evaluate probabilistic bit (p-bit) based Ising Machines (IM) on the 3-regular 3-Exclusive OR Satisfiability (3R3X), as a representative hard optimization problem. We first introduce a multiplexed architecture that emulates all-to-all network functionality while maintaining highly parallelized chromatic Gibbs sampling. We implement this architecture in single Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and show that running the adaptive parallel tempering algorithm demonstrates competitive algorithmic and prefactor advantages over alternative IMs by D-Wave, Toshiba, and Fujitsu. We also implement higher-order interactions that lead to better prefactors without changing algorithmic scaling for the XORSAT problem. Even though FPGA implementations of p-bits are still not quite as fast as the best possible greedy algorithms accelerated on Graphics Processing Units (GPU), scaled magnetic versions of p-bit IMs could lead to orders of magnitude improvements over the state of the art for generic optimization.</description>

Abstract: We present QDarts, an efficient simulator for realistic charge stability diagrams of quantum dot array (QDA) devices in equilibrium states. It allows for pinpointing the location of concrete charge states and their transitions in a high-dimensional voltage space (via arbitrary two-dimensional cuts through it), and includes effects of finite tunnel coupling, non-constant charging energy and a simulation of noisy sensor dots. These features enable close matching of various experimental results in the literature, and the package hence provides a flexible tool for testing QDA experiments, as well as opening the avenue for developing new methods of device tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that 1D lattice models exhibit superdiffusive transport in the presence of random "nodal impurities" in the absence of interaction. Here a nodal impurity is defined as a localized state, the wave function of which has zeros (nodes) in momentum space. The dynamics exponent $z$, a defining quantity for transport behaviors, is computed to establish this result. To be specific, in a disordered system having only nodal impurities, the dynamical exponent $z=4n/(4n-1)$ where $n$ is the order of the node. If the system has time reversal, the nodes appear in pairs and the dynamical exponent can be enhanced to $z=8n/(8n-1)$. As $1&lt;z&lt;2$, both cases indicate superdiffusive transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the anisotropic effects on a system of three qubits with chain and ring topology, described by the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg XXX model subjected to a homogeneous magnetic field. We explore the Stirling and Otto cycles and find that easy-axis anisotropy significantly enhances engine efficiency across all cases. At low temperatures, the ring configuration outperforms the chain on both work and efficiency during the Stirling cycle. Additionally, in both topologies, the Stirling cycle achieves Carnot efficiency with finite work at quantum critical points. In contrast, the quasistatic Otto engine also reaches Carnot efficiency at these points but yields no useful work. Notably, the Stirling cycle exhibits all thermal operational regimes engine, refrigerator, heater, and accelerator unlike the quasistatic Otto cycle, which functions only as an engine or refrigerator.</description>

      <title>Molecular Quantum (MolQ) Communication Channel in the Gut-Brain Axis Synapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gut-brain axis is the communication link between the gut and the brain. Although it is known that the gut-brain axis plays a pivotal role in homeostasis, its overall mechanism is still not known. However, for neural synapses, classical molecular communication is described by the formation of ligand-receptor complexes, which leads to the opening of ion channels. Moreover, there are some conditions that need to be fulfilled before the opening of the ion channel. In this study, we consider the gut-brain axis, where neurotransmitters diffuse through the synaptic cleft, considering molecular communication. On the vagus nerve (VN) membrane, i.e., the post-synaptic membrane of the synapse, it undergoes a quantum communication (QC), which initiates the opening of the ion channel, thus initiating the communication signal from the gut to the brain. It evolves a new paradigm of communication approach, Molecular Quantum (MolQ) communication. Based on the QC model, we theoretically analyze the output states, and QC is simulated considering the incoming neurotransmitter's concentration and validated by analyzing the entropy and the mutual information of the input, i.e., neurotransmitter's concentration, and output, i.e., ion channel opening.</description>

      <title>SIC-POVMs and orders of real quadratic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of counting and classifying symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (SICs or SIC-POVMs), that is, sets of $d^2$ equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$. For $4 \leq d \leq 90$, we show the number of known equivalence classes of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs in dimension $d$ equals the cardinality of the ideal class monoid of (not necessarily invertible) ideal classes in the real quadratic order of discriminant $(d+1)(d-3)$. Equivalently, this is the number of $\mathbf{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ conjugacy classes in $\mathbf{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ of trace $d-1$. We conjecture the equality extends to all $d \geq 4$. We prove that this conjecture implies more that one equivalence class of Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SICs for every $d &gt; 22$.
  We refine the "class field hypothesis" of Appleby, Flammia, McConnell, and Yard (arXiv:1604.06098) to predict the exact class field generated by the ratios of vector entries for the equiangular lines defining a Weyl--Heisenberg covariant SIC. The class fields conjecturally associated to SICs in dimension $d$ have a natural partial order under inclusion; we show the natural inclusions of these fields in the partial order are strict, except in a small family of cases.</description>

Abstract: In present work, we present a couple-channel formalism for the description of tunneling time of a quantum particle through a composite compound with multiple energy levels or a complex structure that can be reduced to a quasi-one-dimensional multiple-channel system.</description>

      <title>Quantum efficiency and vertical position of quantum emitters in hBN determined by Purcell effect in hybrid metal-dielectric planar photonic structures</title>

Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) advantageously combine excellent photophysical properties with a potential for integration in highly compact devices. Progress towards scalable integration necessitates a high quantum efficiency and an efficient photon collection. In this context, we compare the optical characteristics of individual hBN color centers generated by electron irradiation, in two different electromagnetic environments. We keep track of well-identified emitters that we characterize before and after dry transfer of exfoliated crystals. This comparison provides information about their quantum efficiency - which we find close to unity - as well as their vertical position in the crystal with nanometric precision, which we find away from the flake surfaces. Our work suggests hybrid dielectric-metal planar structures as an efficient tool for characterizing quantum emitters in addition to improving the count rate, and can be generalized to other emitters in 2D materials or in planar photonic structures.</description>
