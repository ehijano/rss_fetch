      <title>Certain residual properties of HNN-extensions with normal associated subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{E}$ be the HNN-extension of a group $B$ with subgroups $H$ and $K$ associated according to an isomorphism $\varphi\colon H \to K$. Suppose that $H$ and $K$ are normal in $B$ and $(H \cap K)\varphi = H \cap K$. Under these assumptions, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for $\mathbb{E}$ to be residually a $\mathcal{C}$-group, where $\mathcal{C}$ is a class of groups closed under taking subgroups, quotient groups, and unrestricted wreath products. Among other things, these conditions give new facts on the residual finiteness and the residual $p$-finiteness of the group $\mathbb{E}$.</description>

      <title>Orbit-blocking words in free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By strengthening known results about primitivity-blocking words in free groups, we prove that for any nontrivial element w of a free group of finite rank, there are words that cannot be subwords of any cyclically reduced automorphic image of w. This has implications for the average-case complexity of Whitehead's problem.</description>

      <title>Group class operations and homological conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kropholler's operation ${\scriptstyle{{\bf LH}}}$ and Talelli's operation $\Phi$ can be often used to formally enlarge the class of available examples of groups that satisfy certain homological conditions. In this paper, we employ this enlargement technique regarding two specific homological conditions. We thereby demonstrate the abundance of groups that (a) have virtually Gorenstein group algebras, as defined by Beligiannis and Reiten, and (b) satisfy Moore's conjecture on the relation between projectivity and relative projectivity, that was studied by Aljadeff and Meir.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's Theorem 90, periodicity, and roots of Artin-Schreier polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E/F$ be a cyclic field extension of degree $n$, and let $\sigma$ generate the group Gal$(E/F)$. If Tr${}^E_F(y)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sigma^i y=0$, then the additive form of Hilbert's Theorem 90 asserts that $y=\sigma x-x$ for some $x\in E$. Suppose that $E$ has characteristic $p$. We prove that $x$ gives rise to a periodic sequence $x_0,x_1,\dots$ which has period $pn_p$, where $n_p$ is the largest $p$-power that divides $n$. As an application, we find closed-form expressions for the roots of Artin-Schreier polynomials $t^p-t-y$. Let $y$ lie in the finite field $F_{p^n}$ of order $p^n$. The Artin-Schreier polynomial $t^p-t-y\in F_{p^n}[t]$ is reducible precisely when $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y^{p^i}=0$. In this case, $t^p-t-y=\prod_{k=0}^{p-1}(t-x-k)$ where $x=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}y^{p^i}$ for some $z\in F_{p^e}$ and $e=n_p$. The sequence $\left(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}\right)_{i\ge0}$ is periodic with period $pe$, and if $e$ is small, then we give explicit $z$.</description>

      <title>When is $A + x A =\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there is an additive $F_\sigma$ subgroup $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\mathrm{dim_H} (A) = \frac{1}{2}$ and $A + x A =\mathbb{R}$. However, if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subring of $\mathbb{R}$ and there is $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $A + x A =\mathbb{R}$, then $A =\mathbb{R}$. Moreover, assuming the continuum hypothesis (CH), there is a subgroup $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ with $\mathrm{dim_H} (A) = 0$ such that $x \not\in \mathbb{Q}$ if and only if $A + x A =\mathbb{R}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. A key ingredient in the proof of this theorem consists of some techniques in recursion theory and algorithmic randomness. We believe it may lead to applications to other constructions of exotic sets of reals. Several other theorems on measurable, and especially Borel and analytic subgroups and subfields of the reals are presented. We also discuss some of these results in the $p$-adics.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Generating Sets of Splitting Field and Cluster Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of cluster towers was introduced by the second author and Krithika in [4] along with a question which was answered by the first author and Bhagwat in [1]. In this article we introduce the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting field and connect it to the concept of cluster towers. We establish that there exist infinitely many irreducible polynomials over rationals for which the splitting field has two extreme minimal generating sets (one of given cardinality and other of minimum cardinality) and for which we have two extreme cluster towers (one of given length and other of minimum length). We prove interesting properties of cluster tower associated with minimal generating set that we constructed in proof of the theorem and as a consequence get that degree sequence depends on the ordering even when we work with minimal generating set. We also establish an equivalent condition for a set to be minimum minimal generating set for a certain family of polynomials over rationals and count the total number of minimum minimal generating sets.</description>

      <title>Bounded projections to the $\mathcal{Z}$-factor graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $G$ is a free product $G = A_1 * A_2* \cdots * A_k * F_N$, where each of the groups $A_i$ is torsion-free and $F_N$ is a free group of rank $N$. Let $\mathcal{O}$ be the deformation space associated to this free product decomposition. We show that the diameter of the projection of the subset of $\mathcal{O}$ where a given element has bounded length to the $\mathcal{Z}$-factor graph is bounded, where the diameter bound depends only on the length bound. This relies on an analysis of the boundary of $G$ as a hyperbolic group relative to the collection of subgroups $A_i$ together with a given non-peripheral cyclic subgroup. The main theorem is new even in the case that $G = F_N$, in which case $\mathcal{O}$ is the Culler-Vogtmann outer space. In a future paper, we will apply this theorem to study the geometry of free group extensions.</description>

      <title>Advertising finite commutative semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every mathematician is familiar with the beautiful structure of finite commutative groups. What is less well known is that finite commutative semigroups also have a neat and well-described structure. We prove this in an efficient fashion. We unravel the structural details of many concrete finite commutative semigroups. Here "concrete" comes in two types. First, we examine the structure of the MULTIPLICATIVE semigroups Z/nZ (more interesting than their bland additive siblings) and show that it depends on the prime factors of $n$ in interesting ways. Second, we thoroughly treat finite commutative semigroups defined by generators and relations. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the area, including some novel results and some enticing directions for the expert to follow.</description>

Abstract: Let $G_{1}$, $G_{2}$, ... be a sequence of groups each of which is either an alternating group, a symmetric group or a cyclic group and construct a sequence $(W_{i})$ of wreath products via $W_{1} = G_{1}$ and, for each $i \geq 1$, $W_{i+1} = G_{i+1} \operatorname{wr} G_{i}$ via the natural permutation action. We determine the minimum number $d(W_{i})$ of generators required for each wreath product in this sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16233v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shnirel'man's inequality and Shnirel'man's basis theorem are fundamental results about sums of sets of positive integers in additive number theory. It is proved that these results are inherently order-theoretic and extend to partially ordered abelian and nonabelian groups. One abelian application is an addition theorem for sums of sets of $n$-dimensional lattice points.</description>

      <title>The McKay Conjecture on character degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any prime $\ell$, any finite group has as many irreducible complex characters of degree prime to $\ell$ as the normalizers of its Sylow $\ell$-subgroups. This equality was conjectured by John McKay.
  The conjecture was reduced by Isaacs--Malle--Navarro (2007) to a conjecture on representations, linear and projective, of finite simple groups that we finish proving here using the classification of those groups.
  We study mainly characters of normalizers N$_{\mathbf G}({\mathbf S})^F$ of Sylow $d$-tori ${\mathbf S}$ ($d\geq 3$) in a simply-connected algebraic group ${\mathbf G}$ of type D$_l$ ($l\geq 4$) for which $F$ is a Frobenius endomorphism. We also introduce a certain class of $F$-stable reductive subgroups ${\mathbf M}\leq {\mathbf G}$ of maximal rank where ${\mathbf M}^\circ$ is of type some D$_{k}\times\ $D$_{l-k}$. The finite groups ${\mathbf M}^F$ are an efficient substitute for N$_{\mathbf G}({\mathbf S})^F$ or the $\ell$-local subgroups of ${\mathbf G}^F$ relevant to McKay's abstract statement. For a general class of those subgroups ${\mathbf M}^F$ we describe their characters and the action of Aut$({\mathbf G}^F)_{{\mathbf M}^F}$ on them, showing in particular that Irr$({\mathbf M}^F)$ and Irr$({\mathbf G}^F)$ share some key features in that regard.</description>
