      <title>Deep Hedging of Green PPAs in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In power markets, Green Power Purchase Agreements have become an important contractual tool of the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources such as wind or solar radiation. Trading Green PPAs exposes agents to price risks and weather risks. Also, developed electricity markets feature the so-called cannibalisation effect : large infeeds induce low prices and vice versa. As weather is a non-tradable entity the question arises how to hedge and risk-manage in this highly incom-plete setting. We propose a ''deep hedging'' framework utilising machine learning methods to construct hedging strategies. The resulting strategies outperform static and dynamic benchmark strategies with respect to different risk measures.</description>

      <title>Vote Delegation in DeFi Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the drivers of vote delegation in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), using the Uniswap governance DAO as a laboratory. We show that parties with fewer self-owned votes and those affiliated with the controlling venture capital firm, Andreesen Horowitz (a16z), receive more vote delegations. These patterns suggest that while the Uniswap ecosystem values decentralization, a16z may engage in window-dressing around it. Moreover, we find that an active and successful track record in submitting improvement proposals, especially in the final stage, leads to more vote delegations, indicating that delegation in DAOs is at least partly reputation- or merit-based. Combined, our findings provide new insights into how governance and decentralization operate in DeFi.</description>

      <title>Intraday Battery Dispatch for Hybrid Renewable Energy Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical model for intraday dispatch of co-located wind-battery energy assets. Focusing on the primary objective of firming grid-side actual production vis-a-vis the preset day-ahead hourly generation targets, we conduct a comprehensive study of the resulting stochastic control problem across different firming formulations and wind generation dynamics. Among others, we provide a closed-form solution in the special case of a quadratic objective and linear dynamics, as well as design a novel adaptation of a Gaussian Process-based Regression Monte Carlo algorithm for our setting. Extensions studied include an asymmetric loss function for peak shaving, capturing the cost of battery cycling, and the role of battery duration. In the applied portion of our work, we calibrate our model to a collection of 140+ wind-battery assets in Texas, benchmarking the economic benefits of firming based on outputs of a realistic unit commitment and economic dispatch solver.</description>

      <title>Realized Volatility Forecasting for New Issues and Spin-Offs using Multi-Source Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting the volatility of financial assets is essential for various financial applications. This paper addresses the challenging task of forecasting the volatility of financial assets with limited historical data, such as new issues or spin-offs, by proposing a multi-source transfer learning approach. Specifically, we exploit complementary source data of assets with a substantial historical data record by selecting source time series instances that are most similar to the limited target data of the new issue/spin-off. Based on these instances and the target data, we estimate linear and non-linear realized volatility models and compare their forecasting performance to forecasts of models trained exclusively on the target data, and models trained on the entire source and target data. The results show that our transfer learning approach outperforms the alternative models and that the integration of complementary data is also beneficial immediately after the initial trading day of the new issue/spin-off.</description>

      <title>The deep multi-FBSDE method: a robust deep learning method for coupled FBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the deep multi-FBSDE method for robust approximation of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs), focusing on cases where the deep BSDE method of Han, Jentzen, and E (2018) fails to converge. To overcome the convergence issues, we consider a family of FBSDEs that are equivalent to the original problem in the sense that they satisfy the same associated partial differential equation (PDE). Our algorithm proceeds in two phases: first, we approximate the initial condition for the FBSDE family, and second, we approximate the original FBSDE using the initial condition approximated in the first phase. Numerical experiments show that our method converges even when the standard deep BSDE method does not.</description>
