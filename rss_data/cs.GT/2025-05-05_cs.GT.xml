      <title>Promises Made, Promises Kept: Safe Pareto Improvements via Ex Post Verifiable Commitments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A safe Pareto improvement (SPI) [41] is a modification of a game that leaves all players better off with certainty. SPIs are typically proven under qualitative assumptions about the way different games are played. For example, we assume that strictly dominated strategies can be iteratively removed and that isomorphic games are played isomorphically. In this work, we study SPIs achieved through three types of ex post verifiable commitments -- promises about player behavior from which deviations can be detected by observing the game. First, we consider disarmament -- commitments not to play certain actions. Next, we consider SPIs based on token games. A token game is a game played by simply announcing an action (via cheap talk). As such, its outcome is intrinsically meaningless. However, we assume the players commit in advance to play specific (pure or correlated) strategy profiles in the original game as a function of the token game outcome. Under such commitments, the token game becomes a new, meaningful normal-form game. Finally, we consider default-conditional commitment: SPIs in settings where the players' default ways of playing the original game can be credibly revealed and hence the players can commit to act as a function of this default. We characterize the complexity of deciding whether SPIs exist in all three settings, giving a mixture of characterizations and efficient algorithms and NP- and Graph Isomorphism-hardness results.</description>

      <title>The Proportional Veto Principle for Approval Ballots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proportional veto principle, which captures the idea that a candidate vetoed by a large group of voters should not be chosen, has been studied for ranked ballots in single-winner voting. We introduce a version of this principle for approval ballots, which we call flexible-voter representation (FVR). We show that while the approval voting rule and other natural scoring rules provide the optimal FVR guarantee only for some flexibility threshold, there exists a scoring rule that is FVR-optimal for all thresholds simultaneously. We also extend our results to multi-winner voting.</description>

      <title>QEGS: A Mathematica Package for the Analysis of Quantum Extended Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum games have attracted much attention in recent years due to their ability to solve decision-making dilemmas. The aim of this study is to extend previous work on quantum games by introducing a Mathematica package QEGS (Quantum Extension Game Solver) dedicated to the study of quantum extensions of classical $2\times2$ games based on the EWL scheme. The package generates all possible game extensions with one or two unitary strategies, which are invariant with respect to isomorphic transformations of the initial games. The package includes a number of functions to study these extensions, such as determining their Nash equilibria in pure strategies, eliminating dominated strategies, or computing maximin strategies. Independently of quantum extensions, these functions can also be used to analyze classical games. Reporting to a pdf is available. The discussion includes an outline of future research directions, such as the exploration of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria and potential real-world applications in fields like quantum computing and secure communications.</description>

      <title>A Quadratic Speedup in Finding Nash Equilibria of Quantum Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in domains such as non-local games, quantum interactive proofs, and quantum generative adversarial networks have renewed interest in quantum game theory and, specifically, quantum zero-sum games. Central to classical game theory is the efficient algorithmic computation of Nash equilibria, which represent optimal strategies for both players. In 2008, Jain and Watrous proposed the first classical algorithm for computing equilibria in quantum zero-sum games using the Matrix Multiplicative Weight Updates (MMWU) method to achieve a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon^2)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in the $4^d$-dimensional spectraplex. In this work, we propose a hierarchy of quantum optimization algorithms that generalize MMWU via an extra-gradient mechanism. Notably, within this proposed hierarchy, we introduce the Optimistic Matrix Multiplicative Weights Update (OMMWU) algorithm and establish its average-iterate convergence complexity as $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria. This quadratic speed-up relative to Jain and Watrous' original algorithm sets a new benchmark for computing $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in quantum zero-sum games.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication via Textual Prompts: Latency Performance Tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an edge-device collaborative Generative Semantic Communications (Gen SemCom) framework leveraging pre-trained Multi-modal/Vision Language Models (M/VLMs) for ultra-low-rate semantic communication via textual prompts. The proposed framework optimizes the use of M/VLMs on the wireless edge/device to generate high-fidelity textual prompts through visual captioning/question answering, which are then transmitted over a wireless channel for SemCom. Specifically, we develop a multi-user Gen SemCom framework using pre-trained M/VLMs, and formulate a joint optimization problem of prompt generation offloading, communication and computation resource allocation to minimize the latency and maximize the resulting semantic quality. Due to the nonconvex nature of the problem with highly coupled discrete and continuous variables, we decompose it as a two-level problem and propose a low-complexity swap/leaving/joining (SLJ)-based matching algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements over the conventional semanticunaware/non-collaborative offloading benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Optimal classification with outcome performativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I consider the problem of classifying individual behavior in a simple setting of outcome performativity where the behavior the algorithm seeks to classify is itself dependent on the algorithm. I show in this context that the most accurate classifier is either a threshold or a negative threshold rule. A threshold rule offers the "good" classification to those individuals more likely to have engaged in a desirable behavior, while a negative threshold rule offers the "good" outcome to those less likely to have engaged in the desirable behavior. While seemingly pathological, I show that a negative threshold rule can maximize classification accuracy when outcomes are performative. I provide an example of such a classifier, and extend the analysis to more general algorithm objectives. A key takeaway is that optimal classification can negatively correlate with signal information, yielding adverse downstream effects on individual behavior.</description>
