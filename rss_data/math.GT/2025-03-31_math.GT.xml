      <title>Holonomy preserving transformations of weighted graphs and its application to knot theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goda showed that the twisted Alexander polynomial can be recovered from the zeta function of a matrix-weighted graph. Motivated by this, we study transformations of weighted graphs that preserve this zeta function, introducing a notion of holonomy as an analogy for the accumulation of weights along cycles. We extend the framework from matrices to group elements, and show that holonomy preserving transformations correspond to transformations of group presentations and preserve the twisted Alexander polynomial from a graph-theoretic viewpoint. We also generalize to quandle-related structures, where the holonomy condition coincides with the Alexander pair condition of Ishii and Oshiro. This perspective allows us to view knot diagrams as covering-like structures enriched with holonomy.</description>

      <title>Representations of knot groups in $\textrm{AGL}_{1}(\mathbb{C})$ and Alexander invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reinterprets Alexander-type invariants of knots via representation varieties of knot groups into the group $\textrm{AGL}_1(\mathbb{C})$ of affine transformations of the complex line. In particular, we prove that the coordinate ring of the $\textrm{AGL}_{1}(\mathbb{C})$-representation variety is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra of the Alexander module. This yields a natural interpretation of the Alexander polynomial as the singular locus of a coherent sheaf over $\mathbb{C}^*$, whose fibres correspond to quandle representation varieties of the knot quandle. As a by-product, we construct Topological Quantum Field Theories that provide effective computational methods and recover the Burau representations of braids. This theory offers a new geometric perspective on classical Alexander invariants and their functorial quantization.</description>

      <title>A rational cohomology which including that of a spin hyperelliptic mapping class group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{G}=\mathfrak{S}_{q} \overleftrightarrow{\times} \mathfrak{S}_q$ be the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-extension of the product of two symmetric groups $\mathfrak{S}_{q} \times \mathfrak{S}_q$. In this paper, we compute the $\mathfrak{G}$-invariant part of the rational cohomology of the pure braid group $P_{n}$, where $n=2q$, denoted by $H^{*}(P_n)^{\mathfrak{G}}$. As is known classically, $H^{*}(P_n)^{\mathfrak{G}}$ includes the rational cohomology of a spin hyperelliptic mapping class group, denoted by $H^*(\mathcal{S}(\Sigma_{g};c))$, where $2g+2=n=2q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build the first example of a hyperbolic 6-manifold that admits a perfect circle-valued Morse function, which can be considered as the analogue of a fibration over the circle for manifolds with non-vanishing Euler characteristic. As a consequence, we obtain a new example of a subgroup of a hyperbolic group which is of type $\mathcal{F}_2$ but not $\mathcal{F}_3$.</description>

      <title>Extended signatures and link concordance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Levine-Tristram signature admits an n-variable extension for n-component links: it was first defined as an integer valued function on $(S^1\setminus\{1\})^n$, and recently extended to the full torus $T^n$. The aim of the present article is to study and use this extended signature. First, we show that it is constant on the connected components of the complement of the zero-locus of some renormalized Alexander polynomial. Then, we prove that the extended signature is a concordance invariant on an explicit dense subset of $T^n$. Finally, as an application, we present an infinite family of 3-component links with the following property: these links are not concordant to their mirror image, a fact that can be detected neither by the non-extended signatures, nor by the multivariable Alexander polynomial, nor by the Milnor triple linking number.</description>

      <title>On the Marinus-Ptolemy and Delisle-Euler conical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine connections between the mathematics behind  methods of drawing geographical maps due, on the one hand to Marinos and Ptolemy (1st-2nd c. CE) and Delisle and Euler (18th century). A recent work by the first two authors of this article shows that these methods are the best among a collection of geographical maps we term ``conical''. This is an example of an instance where after practitioners and craftsmen (here, geographers) have used a certain tool during several centuries, mathematicians prove that this tool is indeed optimal. Many connections among geography, astronomy and geometry are highlighted.The fact that the Marinos-Ptolemy and the Delisle-Euler methods of drawing geographical maps share many non-trivial properties is an important instance of historical continuity in mathematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a list of monodromy factorizations in the pure mapping class group $Mod(T_{d+1})$ of a torus with d+1 marked points that represent lines on a del Pezzo surface Y of degree $d\le4$. These factorizations are lifts of a certain fixed monodromy factorization in $Mod(T_d)$ that represents Y. In the case d=1, discussed in more detail, we give an explicit correspondence between such factorizations and the 240 roots of $E_8=K^\perp$, the orthogonal complement in $H_2(Y)$ of the canonical class.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>From veering triangulations to link spaces and back again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.00006v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the third in a sequence establishing a dictionary between the combinatorics of veering triangulations equipped with appropriate filling slopes, and the dynamics of pseudo-Anosov flows (without perfect fits) on closed three-manifolds.
  Our motivation comes from the work of Agol and Gu\'eritaud. Agol introduced veering triangulations of mapping tori as a tool for understanding the surgery parents of pseudo-Anosov mapping tori. Gu\'eritaud gave a new construction of veering triangulations of mapping tori using the orbit spaces of their suspension flows. Generalising this, Agol and Gu\'eritaud announced a method that, given a closed manifold with a pseudo-Anosov flow (without perfect fits), produces a veering triangulation equipped with filling slopes.
  In this paper we build, from a veering triangulation, a canonical circular order on the cusps of the universal cover. Using this we build the veering circle and the link space. These are the first entries in the promised dictionary. The link space and the circle are, respectively, analogous to the orbit space of a flow and to Fenley's boundary at infinity of the orbit space.
  In the other direction, and using our previous work, we prove that the veering triangulation is recovered (up to canonical isomorphism) from the dynamics of the fundamental group acting on the link space. This is the first step in proving that our dictionary gives a bijection between the two theories.</description>

      <title>Stratified Morse critical points and Brasselet number on non-degenerate locally tame singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.13793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalization of the Morse theory presented by Goresky and MacPherson is a landmark that divided completely the topological and geo\-me\-tri\-cal study of singular spaces. Let \{$X_t\}_t$ be a suitable family of germs at $0$ of complete intersection varieties in $\mathbb{C}^n$ and $\{f_t\}_t, \{g_t\}_t$ families of non-constant polynomial functions on $X_t$. If the germs $X_t$, $X_t \cap f_t^{-1}(0)$ and $X_t\cap f_t^{-1}(0) \cap g_t^{-1}(0)$ are non-degenerate, locally tame, complete intersection varieties, for each $t,$ we prove that the difference of the Brasselet numbers, ${\rm B}_{f_t,X_t}(0)$ and ${\rm B}_{f_t,X_t\cap g_t^{-1}(0)}(0)$, is related with the number of Morse critical points {on the regular part of the Milnor fiber} of $f_t$ appearing in a morsefication of $g_t$, even in the case where $g_t$ has a critical locus with arbitrary dimension. This result connects topological and geometric properties and allows us to determine some interesting formulae, mainly in terms of the combinatorial information from Newton polyhedra.</description>

      <title>Real spectrum compactification of Hitchin components, Weyl chamber valued lengths, and dual spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of this article is that Hitchin representations over real closed field extensions $\mathbb{F}$ of $\mathbb{R}$ correspond precisely to those representations of the fundamental group of a closed surface into $\textrm{PSL}(n,\mathbb{F})$ that are conjugate to $\mathbb{F}$-positive representations, i.e. representations that admit an equivariant limit map from the set of fixed points in the boundary of the universal cover of the surface into the set of full flags in $\mathbb{F}^n$ satisfying specific positivity properties. As the theorem treats general real closed fields, and not only the reals, the tools of analysis are not available. Instead, our proof is based on the Tarski-Seidenberg transfer principle and a multiplicative version of the Bonahon-Dreyer coordinates. We use this result to prove that $\mathbb{F}$-positive representations form semi-algebraically connected components of the space of all representations, that consist entirely of injective and discrete representations, which are positively hyperbolic and weakly dynamics-preserving over $\mathbb{F}$. Furthermore, we show how to associate intersection geodesic currents to $\mathbb{F}$-positive representations, and conclude with applications to the Weyl chamber length compactification and to dual spaces of geodesic currents.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that certain spherical fibrations over certain CW-complexes are stably fibre homotopy equivalent to $\mm{TOP}$-spherical fibrations (see Definition 1,1). Applying this result, we get a sufficient condition for whether a Poincar$\mm{\acute{e}}$ complex is of the homotopy type of a topological manifold. Moreover, we present the classification for some highly connected manifolds by the homotopy types of highly connected Poincar$\mm{\acute{e}}$ complexes.</description>

      <title>The smoothness of the real projective deformation spaces of orderable Coxeter 3-polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Coxeter polytope is a convex polytope in a real projective space equipped with linear reflections in its facets, such that the orbits of the polytope under the action of the group generated by the linear reflections tessellate a convex domain in the real projective space. Vinberg proved that the group generated by these reflections acts properly discontinuously on the interior of the convex domain, thus inducing a natural orbifold structure on the polytope. In this paper, we consider labeled combinatorial polytopes $\mathcal{G}$ associated to such orbifolds, and study the deformation space $\mathcal{C} (\mathcal{G})$ of Coxeter polytopes realizing $\mathcal{G}$. We prove that if $\mathcal{G}$ is orderable and of normal type then the deformation space $\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{G})$ of real projective Coxeter 3-polytopes realizing $\mathcal{G}$ is a smooth manifold. This result is achieved by analyzing a natural map of $\mathcal{C} (\mathcal{G})$ into a smooth manifold called the realization space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finitely presented Bestvina-Brady group (BBG) admits a presentation involving only commutators. We show that if a graph admits a certain type of spanning trees, then the associated BBG is a right-angled Artin group (RAAG). As an application, we obtain that the class of BBGs contains the class of RAAGs. On the other hand, we provide a criterion to certify that certain finitely presented BBGs are not isomorphic to RAAGs (or more general Artin groups). This is based on a description of the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariants of finitely presented BBGs in terms of separating subgraphs, analogous to the case of RAAGs. As an application, we characterize when the BBG associated to a 2-dimensional flag complex is a RAAG in terms of certain subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Recovering contact forms from boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14604v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact connected smooth manifold with boundary. The paper deals with contact $1$-forms $\beta$ on $X$, whose Reeb vector fields $v_\beta$ admit Lyapunov functions $f$.
  We tackle the question: how to recover $X$ and $\beta$ from the appropriate data along the boundary $\partial X$? We describe such boundary data and prove that they allow for a reconstruction of the pair $(X, \beta)$, up to a diffeomorphism of $X$. We use the term ``holography" for the reconstruction. We say that objects or structures inside $X$ are {\it holographic}, if they can be reconstructed from their $v_\beta$-flow induced ``shadows" on the boundary $\partial X$.
  We also introduce numerical invariants that measure how ``wrinkled" the boundary $\partial X$ is with respect to the $v_\beta$-flow and study their holographic properties under the contact forms preserving embeddings of equidimensional contact manifolds with boundary. We get some ``non-squeezing results" about such contact embedding, which are reminiscent of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem in symplectic geometry.</description>

Abstract: It was first shown in (Catanese-LeBrun 1997) that certain high-dimensional smooth closed manifolds admit pairs of Einstein metrics with Ricci curvatures of opposite sign. After reviewing subsequent progress that has been made on this topic, we then prove various related results, with the ultimate goal of stimulating further research on associated questions.</description>
