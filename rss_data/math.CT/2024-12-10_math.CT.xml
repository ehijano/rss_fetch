      <title>Cotorsion pairs and Enochs Conjecture for object ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ be object ideals in an exact category $(\mathcal{A}; \mathcal{E})$. It is proved that $(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{J})$ is a perfect ideal cotorsion pair if and only if $({\rm Ob}(\mathcal{I}),{\rm Ob}(\mathcal{J}))$ is a perfect cotorsion pair, where ${\rm Ob}(\mathcal{I})$ and ${\rm Ob}(\mathcal{J})$ is the objects of $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{J}$, respectively. If in addition $(\mathcal{A}; \mathcal{E})$ has enough projective objects and injective objects, and $\mathcal{J}$ is enveloping, then $(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{J})$ is a complete ideal cotorsion pair if and only if $({\rm Ob}(\mathcal{I}),{\rm Ob}(\mathcal{J}))$ is a complete cotorsion pair. This gives a partial answer to the question posed by Fu, Guil Asensio, Herzog and Torrecillas. Moreover, for any object ideal $\mathcal{I}$ in the category of left $R$-modules, it is proved that $\mathcal{I}$ satisfies Enochs Conjecture if and only if ${\rm Ob}(\mathcal{I})$ satisfies Enochs Conjecture. Applications are given to projective morphisms and ideal cotorsion pairs $(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{J})$ of object ideals under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Order Theory in the Context of Machine Learning: an application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper ``Tropical Geometry of Deep Neural Networks'' by L. Zhang et al. introduces an equivalence between integer-valued neural networks (IVNN) with activation $\text{ReLU}_{t}$ and tropical rational functions, which come with a map to polytopes. Here, IVNN refers to a network with integer weights but real biases, and $\text{ReLU}_{t}$ is defined as $\text{ReLU}_{t}(x)=\max(x,t)$ for $t\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}$.
  For every poset with $n$ points, there exists a corresponding order polytope, i.e., a convex polytope in the unit cube $[0,1]^n$ whose coordinates obey the inequalities of the poset. We study neural networks whose associated polytope is an order polytope. We then explain how posets with four points induce neural networks that can be interpreted as $2\times 2$ convolutional filters. These poset filters can be added to any neural network, not only IVNN.
  Similarly to maxout, poset convolutional filters update the weights of the neural network during backpropagation with more precision than average pooling, max pooling, or mixed pooling, without the need to train extra parameters. We report experiments that support our statements.
  We also prove that the assignment from a poset to an order polytope (and to certain tropical polynomials) is one to one, and we define the structure of algebra over the operad of posets on tropical polynomials.</description>

      <title>Notions of enriched purity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce enriched notions of purity depending on the left class $\mathcal E$ of a factorization system on the base $\mathcal V$ of enrichment. Ordinary purity is given by the class of surjective mappings in the category of sets. Under specific assumptions, covering enrichment over quantale-valued metric spaces, $\omega$-complete posets, and quasivarieties, we characterize the $(\lambda,\mathcal E)$-injectivity classes of locally presentable $\mathcal V$-categories in terms of closure under a class of limits, $\lambda$-filtered colimits, and $(\lambda,\mathcal E)$-pure subobjects.</description>

      <title>On a fibrational construction for optics, lenses, and Dialectica categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16388v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>

      <title>CaTT contexts are finite computads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two novel descriptions of weak {\omega}-categories have been recently proposed, using type-theoretic ideas. The first one is the dependent type theory CaTT whose models are {\omega}-categories. The second is a recursive description of a category of computads together with an adjunction to globular sets, such that the algebras for the induced monad are again {\omega}-categories. We compare the two descriptions by showing that there exits a fully faithful morphism of categories with families from the syntactic category of CaTT to the opposite of the category of computads, which gives an equivalence on the subcategory of finite computads. We derive a more direct connection between the category of models of CaTT and the category of algebras for the monad on globular sets, induced by the adjunction with computads.</description>

      <title>An Ultrametric for Cartesian Differential Categories for Taylor Series Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cartesian differential categories provide a categorical framework for multivariable differential calculus and also the categorical semantics of the differential $\lambda$-calculus. Taylor series expansion is an important concept for both differential calculus and the differential $\lambda$-calculus. In differential calculus, a function is equal to its Taylor series if its sequence of Taylor polynomials converges to the function in the analytic sense. On the other hand, for the differential $\lambda$-calculus, one works in a setting with an appropriate notion of algebraic infinite sums to formalize Taylor series expansion. In this paper, we provide a formal theory of Taylor series in an arbitrary Cartesian differential category without the need for converging limits or infinite sums. We begin by developing the notion of Taylor polynomials of maps in a Cartesian differential category and then show how comparing Taylor polynomials of maps induces an ultrapseudometric on the homsets. We say that a Cartesian differential category is Taylor if maps are entirely determined by their Taylor polynomials. The main results of this paper are that in a Taylor Cartesian differential category, the induced ultrapseudometrics are ultrametrics and that for every map $f$, its Taylor series converges to $f$ with respect to this ultrametric. This framework recaptures both Taylor series expansion in differential calculus via analytic methods and in categorical models of the differential $\lambda$-calculus (or Differential Linear Logic) via infinite sums.</description>

      <title>Polynomials in homotopy type theory as a Kleisli category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polynomials in a category have been studied as a generalization of the traditional notion in mathematics. Their construction has recently been extended to higher groupoids, as formalized in homotopy type theory, by Finster, Mimram, Lucas and Seiller, thus resulting in a cartesian closed bicategory. We refine and extend their work in multiple directions. We begin by generalizing the construction of the free symmetric monoid monad on types in order to handle arities in an arbitrary universe. Then, we extend this monad to the (wild) category of spans of types, and thus to a comonad by self-duality. Finally, we show that the resulting Kleisli category is equivalent to the traditional category of polynomials. This thus establishes polynomials as a (homotopical) model of linear logic. In fact, we explain that it is closely related to a bicategorical model of differential linear logic introduced by Melli\`es.</description>

      <title>Linear Arboreal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10088v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arboreal categories, introduced by Abramsky and Reggio, axiomatise categories with tree-shaped objects. These categories provide a categorical language for formalising behavioural notions such as simulation, bisimulation, and resource-indexing. In this paper, we strengthen the axioms of an arboreal category to exclude `branching' behaviour, obtaining a notion of `linear arboreal category'. We then demonstrate that every arboreal category satisfying a linearisability condition has an associated linear arboreal subcategory related via an adjunction. This identifies the relationship between the pebble-relation comonad, of Montacute and Shah, and the pebbling comonad, of Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang, and generalises it further. As another outcome of this new framework, we obtain a linear variant of the arboreal category for modal logic. By doing so we recover different linear-time equivalences between transition systems as instances of their categorical definitions. We conclude with new preservation and characterisation theorems relating trace inclusion and trace equivalence with different linear fragments of modal logic.</description>

      <title>Amortized Analysis via Coalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amortized analysis is a cost analysis technique for data structures in which cost is studied in aggregate: rather than considering the maximum cost of a single operation, one bounds the total cost encountered throughout a session. Traditionally, amortized analysis has been phrased inductively, quantifying over finite sequences of operations. Connecting to prior work on coalgebraic semantics for data structures, we develop the alternative perspective that amortized analysis is naturally viewed coalgebraically in a category of cost algebras, where a morphism of coalgebras serves as a first-class generalization of potential function suitable for integrating cost and behavior. Using this simple definition, we consider amortization of other sample effects, non-commutative printing and randomization. To support imprecise amortized upper bounds, we adapt our discussion to the bicategorical setting, where a potential function is a colax morphism of coalgebras. We support algebraic and coalgebraic operations simultaneously by using coalgebras for an endoprofunctor instead of an endofunctor, combining potential using a monoidal structure on the underlying category. Finally, we compose amortization arguments in the indexed category of coalgebras to implement one amortized data structure in terms of others.</description>

      <title>Parametricity via Cohesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parametricity is a key metatheoretic property of type systems, which implies strong uniformity &amp; modularity properties of the structure of types within systems possessing it. In recent years, various systems of dependent type theory have emerged with the aim of expressing such parametric reasoning in their internal logic, toward the end of solving various problems arising from the complexity of higher-dimensional coherence conditions in type theory. This paper presents a first step toward the unification, simplification, and extension of these various methods for internalizing parametricity. Specifically, I argue that there is an essentially modal aspect of parametricity, which is intimately connected with the category-theoretic concept of cohesion. On this basis, I describe a general categorical semantics for modal parametricity, develop a corresponding framework of axioms (with computational interpretations) in dependent type theory that can be used to internally represent and reason about such parametricity, and show this in practice by implementing these axioms in Agda and using them to verify parametricity theorems therein. I then demonstrate the utility of these axioms in managing the complexity of higher-dimensional coherence by deriving induction principles for higher inductive types, and in closing, I sketch the outlines of a more general synthetic theory of parametricity, with applications in domains ranging from homotopy type theory to the analysis of program modules.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics II: Stability and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the duality between Kripke and algebraic semantics of intuitionistic and intuitionistic modal logic. We find that there is a certain mismatch between the two semantics, which means that not all algebraic models can be embedded into a Kripke model. This leads to an alternative proposal for a relational semantics, the stable semantics. Instead of an arbitrary partial order, the stable semantics requires a distributive lattice of worlds. We constructively show that the stable semantics is exactly as complete as the algebraic semantics. Categorifying these results leads to a 2-duality between two-dimensional stable semantics and categories of product-preserving presheaves, i.e. models of algebraic theories in the style of Lawvere.</description>
