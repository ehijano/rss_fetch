      <title>Evaluating the Influence of Satellite Systems on Terrestrial Networks: Analyzing S-Band Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The co-existence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) is essential for achieving comprehensive global coverage in sixth-generation cellular networks. Given the escalating demand for spectrum, there is an ongoing global discourse on the feasibility of sharing certain frequencies currently utilized by terrestrial networks (TNs) with NTNs. However, this sharing leads to co-channel interference and subsequent performance degradation. This paper specifically investigates the interference caused by NTNs on TNs in the S-band and its relationship with the relative position between satellite and TN user equipment. We analyzed the transmission mechanisms of satellite signals and employed the ITU two-state model for our interference analysis. Through simulations, we evaluated the interference intensity at different separation distances and slant ranges. Our findings reveal that the angle between the user equipment direction and the sub-satellite point direction from the beam center significantly influences the interference level. Furthermore, we determine the minimum separation distance needed to keep the interference-to-noise ratio of NTN interference below 0 dB.</description>

      <title>Downlink Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO for LEO Satellite Mega-Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) has emerged as a promising technology for improving wireless connectivity in global areas. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), an architecture recently proposed for next-generation networks, has yet to be fully explored for LEO satellites. In this paper, we investigate the downlink performance of a CF-mMIMO LEO SatCom network, where many satellite access points (SAPs) simultaneously serve the corresponding ground user terminals (UTs). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we model the locations of SAPs and UTs on surfaces of concentric spheres using Poisson point processes (PPPs) and present expressions based on linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) channel estimation and conjugate beamforming. Then, we derive the coverage probabilities in both fading and non-fading scenarios, with significant system parameters such as the Nakagami fading parameter, number of UTs, number of SAPs, orbital altitude, and service range brought by the dome angle. Finally, the analytical model is verified by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results show that stronger line-of-sight (LoS) effects and a more comprehensive service range of the UT bring higher coverage probability despite existing multi-user interference. Moreover, we found that there exist optimal numbers of UTs for different orbital altitudes and dome angles, which provides valuable system design insights.</description>

      <title>Array Gain for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antennas is a novel flexible-antenna technology, which can be realized by employing small dielectric particles on a waveguide. The aim of this letter is to characterize the array gain achieved by pinching-antenna systems (PASS). A closed-form upper bound on the array gain is derived by fixing the inter-antenna spacing. Asymptotic analyses of this bound are conducted by considering an infinitely large number of antennas, demonstrating the existence of an optimal number of antennas that maximizes the array gain. The relationship between the array gain and inter-antenna spacing is further explored by incorporating the effect of mutual coupling. It is proven that there also exists an optimal inter-antenna spacing that maximizes the array gain. Numerical results demonstrate that by optimizing the number of antennas and inter-antenna spacing, PASS can achieve a significantly larger array gain than conventional fixed-location antenna systems.</description>

      <title>RIS Optimization Algorithms for Urban Wireless Scenarios in Sionna RT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) optimization algorithms, which utilize channel estimation methods, in ray tracing (RT) simulations within urban digital twin environments. Beyond Sionna's native capabilities, we implement and benchmark additional RIS optimization algorithms based on channel estimation, enabling an evaluation of RIS strategies under various deployment conditions. Coverage maps for RIS-assisted communication systems are generated through the integration of Sionna's RT simulations. Moreover, real-world experimentation underscores the necessity of validating algorithms in near-realistic simulation environments, as minor variations in measurement setups can significantly affect performance.</description>

      <title>User Selection in Near-Field Gigantic MIMO Systems with Modular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular Arrays (MAs) are a promising architecture to enable multi-user communications in next-generation multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems based on extra-large (XL) or gigantic MIMO (gMIMO) deployments, trading off an improved spatial resolution with characteristic interference patterns associated to grating lobes. In this work, we analyze whether MAs can outperform conventional collocated deployments, in terms of achievable sum-rate and served users in a multi-user downlink set-up. First, we provide a rigorous analytical characterization of the inter-user interference for modular gMIMO systems operating in the near field. Then, we leverage these results to optimize the user selection and precoding mechanisms, designing two algorithms that largely outperform existing alternatives in the literature, with different algorithmic complexities. Results show that the proposed algorithms yield over 70% improvements in achievable sum-spectral efficiencies compared to the state of the art. We also illustrate how MAs allow to serve a larger number of users thanks to their improved spatial resolution, compared to the collocated counterpart.</description>

      <title>A Practical Demonstration of DRL-Based Dynamic Resource Allocation xApp Using OpenAirInterface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network slicing is a key enabler for providing a differentiated service support to heterogeneous use cases and applications in 5G and beyond networks through creating multiple logical slices. Resource allocation for satisfying diverse requirements of slices is a highly challenging task under time-varying traffic and wireless channel conditions. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for allocating radio resources to slices, where the objective is to meet the latency requirement of the low-latency slice without jeopardizing the performance of the other slice. The proposed DRL approach is implemented within an open source mobile network emulator, namely OpenAirInterface, to create an O-RAN compliant end-to-end 5G network capable of dynamic resource allocation capabilities. The intelligent resource allocation mechanism operates on the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) as an xApp, enabling monitoring and dynamic resource control of the gNB through the E2 interface. The results demonstrate that the latency requirement of the low-latency slice is met under extremely loaded traffic scenarios, where the trained DRL model deployed on the near-RT RIC platform is used to dynamically allocate the radio resources to the slices.</description>

      <title>Coverage and Spectral Efficiency of NOMA-Enabled LEO Satellite Networks with Ordering Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an analytical model for low-earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The satellites transmit data to multiple NOMA user terminals (UTs), each employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous-signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the coverage probabilities of UTs under different channel conditions. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and the benefit of NOMA only exists when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs' sum SE by as much as 35\%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.</description>

      <title>Soft-Demapping for Short Reach Optical Communication: A Comparison of Deep Neural Networks and Volterra Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optical fiber communication, optical and electrical components introduce nonlinearities, which require effective compensation to attain highest data rates. In particular, in short reach communication, components are the dominant source of nonlinearities. Volterra series are a popular countermeasure for receiver-side equalization of nonlinear component impairments and their memory effects. However, Volterra equalizer architectures are generally very complex. This article investigates soft deep neural network (DNN) architectures as an alternative for nonlinear equalization and soft-decision demapping. On coherent 92 GBd dual polarization 64QAM back-to-back measurements performance and complexity is experimentally evaluated. The proposed bit-wise soft DNN equalizer (SDNNE) is compared to a 5th order Volterra equalizer at a 15 % overhead forward error correction (FEC) limit. At equal performance, the computational complexity is reduced by 65 %. At equal complexity, the performance is improved by 0.35 dB gain in optical signal-to-noise-ratio (OSNR).</description>

      <title>On the Sum Rate and User Fairness of STAR-RIS Aided Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided communication system is investigated. A robust joint beamforming design problem under the imperfect channel state information (CSI) is formulated to maximize the weighted sum of the Jain's fairness index and the normalized system sum rate. To solve this non-convex problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed, which leverages the S-Procedure, successive convex approximation (SCA), and semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Simulation results demonstrate that with proposed algorithm: 1) various trade-offs between sum rate and user fairness can be achieved; 2) a larger trade-off region can be achieved by adopting STAR-RIS compared to conventional RIS; and 3) the performance degradation caused by imperfect CSI is less than 7% with our proposed robust beamforming approach.</description>

Abstract: Marathons are one of the ultimate challenges of human endeavor. In this paper, we apply recently introduced multifractal techniques which yield a new classification parameter in the processing of physiological data captured on marathon runners. The comparison of their values gives a new insight on the way that runners of different level conduct their run, and ultimately, can be used in order to give advice on how to improve their performance.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Multi-Antenna Architectures with Unitary Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in the number of base station (BS) antennas calls for efficient solutions to deal with the increased interconnection bandwidth and processing complexity of traditional centralized approaches. Decentralized approaches are thus gaining momentum, since they achieve important reductions in data/processing volume by preprocessing the received signals before forwarding them to a central node. The WAX framework offers a general description of decentralized architectures with arbitrary interplay between interconnection bandwidth and decentralized processing complexity, but the applicability of this framework has only been studied assuming unrestricted baseband processing. We consider an adaptation of the WAX framework where the decentralized processing has unitary restriction, which allows for energy-efficient implementations based on reconfigurable impedance networks at the cost of some performance loss. Moreover, we propose an effective method to minimize the performance gap with respect to centralized processing. The previous method gives a first step towards characterizing the information-lossless trade-off between interconnection bandwidth and processing complexity in decentralized architectures with unitary constraints.</description>

      <title>Precoding Design for Limited-Feedback MISO Systems via Character-Polynomial Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Multiple-Input Single- Output (MISO) communication with limited feedback, where the transmitter relies on a limited number of bits associated with the channel state information (CSI), available at the receiver (CSIR) but not at the transmitter (no CSIT), sent via the feedback link. We demonstrate how character-polynomial (CP) codes, a class of analog subspace codes (also, referred to as Grassmann codes) can be used for the corresponding quantization problem in the Grassmann space. The proposed CP codebook-based precoding design allows for a smooth trade-off between the number of feedback bits and the beamforming gain, by simply adjusting the rate of the underlying CP code. We present a theoretical upper bound on the mean squared quantization error of the CP codebook, and utilize it to upper bound the resulting distortion as the normalized gap between the CP codebook beamforming gain and the baseline equal gain transmission (EGT) with perfect CSIT. We further show that the distortion vanishes asymptotically. The results are also confirmed via simulations for different types of fading models in the MISO system and various parameters.</description>

      <title>Regularized Top-$k$: A Bayesian Framework for Gradient Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error accumulation is effective for gradient sparsification in distributed settings: initially-unselected gradient entries are eventually selected as their accumulated error exceeds a certain level. The accumulation essentially behaves as a scaling of the learning rate for the selected entries. Although this property prevents the slow-down of lateral movements in distributed gradient descent, it can deteriorate convergence in some settings. This work proposes a novel sparsification scheme that controls the learning rate scaling of error accumulation. The development of this scheme follows two major steps: first, gradient sparsification is formulated as an inverse probability (inference) problem, and the Bayesian optimal sparsification mask is derived as a maximum-a-posteriori estimator. Using the prior distribution inherited from Top-$k$, we derive a new sparsification algorithm which can be interpreted as a regularized form of Top-$k$. We call this algorithm regularized Top-$k$ (RegTop-$k$). It utilizes past aggregated gradients to evaluate posterior statistics of the next aggregation. It then prioritizes the local accumulated gradient entries based on these posterior statistics. We validate our derivation through numerical experiments. In distributed linear regression, it is observed that while Top-$k$ remains at a fixed distance from the global optimum, RegTop-$k$ converges to the global optimum at significantly higher compression ratios. We further demonstrate the generalization of this observation by employing RegTop-$k$ in distributed training of ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, where it noticeably outperforms Top-$k$.</description>

      <title>UAV Swarm-enabled Collaborative Post-disaster Communications in Low Altitude Economy via a Two-stage Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) plays an indispensable role in cargo transportation, healthcare, infrastructure inspection, and especially post-disaster communication. Specifically, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as one of the core technologies of the LAE, can be deployed to provide communication coverage, facilitate data collection, and relay data for trapped users, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of post-disaster response efforts. In this paper, we design an efficient and robust UAV-swarm enabled collaborative self-organizing network to facilitate post-disaster communications. Specifically, a ground device transmits data to UAV swarms, which then use collaborative beamforming (CB) technique to form virtual antenna arrays and relay the data to a remote access point (AP) efficiently. Then, we formulate a rescue-oriented post-disaster transmission rate maximization optimization problem (RPTRMOP). Then, we propose a two-stage optimization approach to address it. In the first stage, the optimal traffic routing and the theoretical upper bound on the transmission rate of the network are derived. In the second stage, we transform the formulated RPTRMOP into a variant named V-RPTRMOP, and a diffusion model-enabled particle swarm optimization (DM-PSO) algorithm is proposed to deal with the V-RPTRMOP. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage optimization approach in improving the transmission rate of the constructed network, which demonstrates the great potential for post-disaster communications. Moreover, the robustness of the constructed network is also validated via evaluating the impact of two unexpected situations on the system transmission rate.</description>

Abstract: Power Doppler ultrasound is in widespread clinical use for non-invasive vascular imaging but the most common current method - Delay and Sum (DAS) beamforming - suffers from limited resolution and high side-lobes. Here we propose the Sub-Aperture Angular Multiply and Sum (SAMAS) algorithm; it combines the advantages of two recent non-linear beamformers, Frame Multiply and Sum (FMAS) which uses signal temporal coherence and the acoustic sub-aperture (ASAP) algorithm, which uses signal spatial coherence, respectively. Following in vitro experiments to optimise the algorithm, particularly the use of phase information and sub-aperture pairing, it was evaluated in vivo, first in a rabbit kidney and then in human lymph node, using ultrafast ultrasound images obtained with intravenous contrast agents. The SAMAS algorithm improved the CNR and SNR across all tests, on average raising the CNR by 11 dB and the SNR by 18 dB over DAS in vivo. This work demonstrates a promising vascular imaging method that could have widespread clinical utility.</description>

      <title>Deep Variational Sequential Monte Carlo for High-Dimensional Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), or particle filtering, is widely used in nonlinear state-space systems, but its performance often suffers from poorly approximated proposal and state-transition distributions. This work introduces a differentiable particle filter that leverages the unsupervised variational SMC objective to parameterize the proposal and transition distributions with a neural network, designed to learn from high-dimensional observations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms established baselines in tracking the challenging Lorenz attractor from high-dimensional and partial observations. Furthermore, an evidence lower bound based evaluation indicates that our method offers a more accurate representation of the posterior distribution.</description>

      <title>BRIGHT: A globally distributed multimodal building damage assessment dataset with very-high-resolution for all-weather disaster response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 12 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.</description>

      <title>B1+ mapping near metallic implants using turbo spin echo pulse sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To propose a B1+ mapping technique for imaging of body parts containing metal hardware, based on magnitude images acquired with turbo spin echo (TSE) pulse sequences. Theory and Methods: To encode the underlying B1+, multiple (two to four) TSE image sets with various excitation and refocusing flip angles were acquired. To this end, the acquired signal intensities were matched to a database of simulated signals which was generated by solving the Bloch equations taking into account the exact sequence parameters. The retrieved B1+ values were validated against gradient-recalled and spin echo dual angle methods, as well as a vendor-provided turboFLASH-based mapping sequence, in gel phantoms and human subjects without and with metal implants. Results: In the absence of metal, phantom experiments demonstrated excellent agreement between the proposed technique using three or four flip angle sets and reference dual angle methods. In human subjects without metal implants, the proposed technique with three or four flip angle sets showed excellent correlation with the spin echo dual angle method. In the presence of metal, both phantoms and human subjects revealed a narrow range of B1+ estimation with the reference techniques, whereas the proposed technique successfully resolved B1+ near the metal. In select cases, the technique was implemented in conjunction with multispectral metal artifact reduction sequences and successfully applied for B1+ shimming. Conclusion: The proposed technique enables resolution of B1+ values in regions near metal hardware, overcoming susceptibility-related and narrow-range limitations of standard mapping techniques.</description>

      <title>Distilling Calibration via Conformalized Credal Inference</title>

Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.</description>

      <title>GR-WiFi: A GNU Radio based WiFi Platform with Single-User and Multi-User MIMO Capability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its first release, WiFi has been highly successful in providing wireless local area networks. The ever-evolving IEEE 802.11 standards continue to add new features to keep up with the trend of increasing numbers of mobile devices and the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Unfortunately, the lack of open-source IEEE 802.11 testbeds in the community limits the development and performance evaluation of those new features. Motivated by an existing popular open-source software-defined radio (SDR) package for single-user single-stream transmission based on the IEEE 802.11/a/g/p standard, in this paper we present GR-WiFi, an open-source package for single-user and multi-user multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmissions based on 802.11n and 802.11ac standards. The distinct features of GR-WiFi include the support of parallel data streams to single or multiple users, and the compatible preamble processing to allow the co-existence of conventional, high-throughput (HT) and very-high-throughput (VHT) traffics. The performance of GR-WiFi is evaluated through both extensive simulation and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fusion for 802.11ax Wi-Fi-based Passive Radars Exploiting Beamforming Feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive Wi-Fi-based radars (PWRs) are devices that enable the localization of targets using Wi-Fi signals of opportunity transmitted by an access point. Unlike active radars that optimize their transmitted waveform for localization, PWRs align with the 802.11 amendments. Specifically, during the channel sounding session preceding a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output downlink transmission, an access point isotropically transmits a null data packet (NDP) with a known preamble. From these known symbols, client user equipments derive their channel state information and transmit an unencrypted beamforming feedback (BFF) back to the access point. The BFF comprises the right singular matrix of the channel and the corresponding stream gain for each subcarrier, which allows the computation of a beamforming matrix at the access point. In a classical PWR processing, only the preamble symbols from the NDP are exploited during the channel sounding session. In this study, we investigate multiple target localization by a PWR exploiting hybrid information sources. On one hand, the joint angle-of-departure and angle-of-arrival evaluated from the NDP. On another hand, the line-of-sight angle-of-departures inferred from the BFFs. The processing steps at the PWR are defined and an optimal hybrid fusion rule is derived in the maximum likelihood framework. Monte-Carlo simulations assess the enhanced accuracy of the proposed combination method compared to classical PWR processing based solely on the NDP, and compare the localisation performance between client and non-client targets.</description>

      <title>Rotatable and Movable Antenna-Enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is regarded as a promising technology for next-generation communication networks. As the demand for communication performance significantly increases, extremely large-scale antenna arrays and tremendously high-frequency bands get widely applied in communication systems, leading to the expansion of the near-field region. On a parallel track, movable antennas (MAs) and six-dimensional MAs (6DMAs) are proposed as emerging technologies to improve the performance of communication and sensing. Based on such a background, this paper investigates the performance of ISAC systems in the near-field region, focusing on a novel system architecture that employs rotatable MAs (RMAs). Additionally, a spherical wave near-field channel model with respect to RMAs' rotations and positions is derived by considering the effective aperture loss. Two designs are explored: a sensing-centric design that minimizes the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, and a communication-centric design that maximizes the sum-rate with a CRB constraint. To solve the formulated optimization problems, the paper proposes two alternating optimization (AO) based algorithms composed of the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the superiority of the proposed setups for both sensing and communication performance compared to traditional fixed antenna systems, highlighting the potential of RMAs to enhance ISAC systems in near-field scenarios.</description>

      <title>Log-Scale Quantization in Distributed First-Order Methods: Gradient-based Learning from Distributed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized strategies are of interest for learning from large-scale data over networks. This paper studies learning over a network of geographically distributed nodes/agents subject to quantization. Each node possesses a private local cost function, collectively contributing to a global cost function, which the considered methodology aims to minimize. In contrast to many existing papers, the information exchange among nodes is log-quantized to address limited network-bandwidth in practical situations. We consider a first-order computationally efficient distributed optimization algorithm (with no extra inner consensus loop) that leverages node-level gradient correction based on local data and network-level gradient aggregation only over nearby nodes. This method only requires balanced networks with no need for stochastic weight design. It can handle log-scale quantized data exchange over possibly time-varying and switching network setups. We study convergence over both structured networks (for example, training over data-centers) and ad-hoc multi-agent networks (for example, training over dynamic robotic networks). Through experimental validation, we show that (i) structured networks generally result in a smaller optimality gap, and (ii) log-scale quantization leads to a smaller optimality gap compared to uniform quantization.</description>

      <title>Communication Constellation Design of Minimum Number of Satellites with Continuous Coverage and Inter-Satellite Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement in research on distributed space systems that operate a large number of satellites as a single system urges the need for the investigation of satellite constellations. Communication constellations can be used to construct global or regional communication networks using inter-satellite and ground-to-satellite links. This study examines two challenges of communication constellations: continuous coverage and inter-satellite link connectivity. The bounded Voronoi diagram and APC decomposition are presented as continuous coverage analysis methods. For continuity analysis of the inter-satellite link, the relative motion between adjacent orbital planes is used to derive analytic solutions. The Walker-Delta constellation and common ground-track constellation design methods are introduced as examples to verify the analysis methods. The common ground-track constellations are classified into quasi-symmetric and optimal constellations. The optimal common ground-track constellation is optimized using the BILP algorithm. The simulation results compare the performance of the communication constellations according to various design methods.</description>
