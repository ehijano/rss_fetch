      <title>Effect of Clinical History on Predictive Model Performance for Renal Complications of Diabetes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diabetes is a chronic disease characterised by a high risk of developing diabetic nephropathy, which, in turn, is the leading cause of end-stage chronic kidney disease. The early identification of individuals at heightened risk of such complications or their exacerbation can be of paramount importance to set a correct course of treatment. In the present work, from the data collected in the DARWIN-Renal (DApagliflozin Real-World evIdeNce-Renal) study, a nationwide multicentre retrospective real-world study, we develop an array of logistic regression models to predict, over different prediction horizons, the crossing of clinically relevant glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) thresholds for patients with diabetes by means of variables associated with demographic, anthropometric, laboratory, pathology, and therapeutic data. In doing so, we investigate the impact of information coming from patient's past visits on the model's predictive performance, coupled with an analysis of feature importance through the Boruta algorithm. Our models yield very good performance (AUROC as high as 0.98). We also show that the introduction of information from patient's past visits leads to improved model performance of up to 4%. The usefulness of past information is further corroborated by a feature importance analysis.</description>

      <title>Hybrid methods in reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of stochastic spatially-extended systems is a challenging problem. The fundamental quantities in these models are individual entities such as molecules, cells, or animals, which move and react in a random manner. In big systems, accounting for each individual is inefficient. If the number of entities is large enough, random effects are negligible, and often partial differential equations (PDEs) are used in which the fluctuations are neglected. When the system is heterogeneous, so that the number of individuals is large in certain regions and small in others, the PDE description becomes inaccurate in certain regions. To overcome this problem, the so-called hybrid schemes have been proposed that couple a stochastic description in parts of the domain with its mean field limit in the others. In this chapter, we review the different formulations of this approach and our recent contributions to overcome several of the limitations of previous schemes, including the extension of the concept to multiscale models of cell populations.</description>

      <title>bioSBM: a random graph model to integrate epigenomic data in chromatin structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial organization of chromatin within the nucleus plays a crucial role in gene expression and genome function. However, the quantitative relationship between this organization and nuclear biochemical processes remains under debate. In this study, we present a graph-based generative model, bioSBM, designed to capture long-range chromatin interaction patterns from Hi-C data and, importantly, simultaneously, link these patterns to biochemical features. Applying bioSBM to Hi-C maps of the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line, we identified a latent structure of chromatin interactions, revealing 12 distinct communities that strongly align with known biological annotations. Additionally, we infer a linear transformation that maps biochemical observables, such as histone marks, to the parameters of the generative graph model, enabling accurate genome-wide predictions of chromatin contact maps on out-of-sample data, both within the same cell line, and on the completely unseen HCT116 cell line under RAD21 depletion. These findings highlight bioSBM's potential as a powerful tool for elucidating the relationship between biochemistry and chromatin architecture and predicting long-range genome organization from independent biochemical data.</description>

      <title>Protein-Mamba: Biological Mamba Models for Protein Function Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein function prediction is a pivotal task in drug discovery, significantly impacting the development of effective and safe therapeutics. Traditional machine learning models often struggle with the complexity and variability inherent in predicting protein functions, necessitating more sophisticated approaches. In this work, we introduce Protein-Mamba, a novel two-stage model that leverages both self-supervised learning and fine-tuning to improve protein function prediction. The pre-training stage allows the model to capture general chemical structures and relationships from large, unlabeled datasets, while the fine-tuning stage refines these insights using specific labeled datasets, resulting in superior prediction performance. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Protein-Mamba achieves competitive performance, compared with a couple of state-of-the-art methods across a range of protein function datasets. This model's ability to effectively utilize both unlabeled and labeled data highlights the potential of self-supervised learning in advancing protein function prediction and offers a promising direction for future research in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>BranchPoseNet: Characterizing tree branching with a deep learning-based pose estimation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an automated pipeline for detecting tree whorls in proximally laser scanning data using a pose-estimation deep learning model. Accurate whorl detection provides valuable insights into tree growth patterns, wood quality, and offers potential for use as a biometric marker to track trees throughout the forestry value chain. The workflow processes point cloud data to create sectional images, which are subsequently used to identify keypoints representing tree whorls and branches along the stem. The method was tested on a dataset of destructively sampled individual trees, where the whorls were located along the stems of felled trees. The results demonstrated strong potential, with accurate identification of tree whorls and precise calculation of key structural metrics, unlocking new insights and deeper levels of information from individual tree point clouds.</description>

      <title>A single-snapshot inverse solver for two-species graph model of tau pathology spreading in human Alzheimer disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method that uses a two-species ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to characterize misfolded tau (or simply tau) protein spreading in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and calibrates it from clinical data. The unknown model parameters are the initial condition (IC) for tau and three scalar parameters representing the migration, proliferation, and clearance of tau proteins. Driven by imaging data, these parameters are estimated by formulating a constrained optimization problem with a sparsity regularization for the IC. This optimization problem is solved with a projection-based quasi-Newton algorithm. We investigate the sensitivity of our method to different algorithm parameters. We evaluate the performance of our method on both synthetic and clinical data. The latter comprises cases from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets: 455 cognitively normal (CN), 212 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 45 AD subjects. We compare the performance of our approach to the commonly used Fisher-Kolmogorov (FK) model with a fixed IC at the entorhinal cortex (EC). Our method demonstrates an average improvement of 25.7% relative error compared to the FK model on the AD dataset. HFK also achieves an R-squared score of 0.664 for fitting AD data compared with 0.55 from FK model results under the same optimization scheme. Furthermore, for cases that have longitudinal data, we estimate a subject-specific AD onset time.</description>
