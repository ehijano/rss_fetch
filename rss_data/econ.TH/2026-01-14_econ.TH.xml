      <title>Cities at Play: Improving Equilibria in Urban Neighbourhood Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How should cities invest to improve social welfare when individuals respond strategically to local conditions? We model this question using a game-theoretic version of Schelling's bounded neighbourhood model, where agents choose neighbourhoods based on concave, non-monotonic utility functions reflecting local population. While naive improvements may worsen outcomes - analogous to Braess' paradox - we show that carefully designed, small-scale investments can reliably align individual incentives with societal goals. Specifically, modifying utilities at a total cost of at most $0.81 \epsilon^2 \cdot \texttt{opt}$ guarantees that every resulting Nash equilibrium achieves a social welfare of at least $\epsilon \cdot \texttt{opt}$, where $\texttt{opt}$ is the optimum social welfare. Our results formalise how targeted interventions can transform supra-negative outcomes into supra-positive returns, offering new insights into strategic urban planning and decentralised collective behaviour.</description>

      <title>Motivated Reasoning and the Political Economy of Climate Change Inaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20982v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how motivated reasoning affects the provision of climate policy in an electoral competition framework. Voters experience anticipatory disutility when future outcomes appear grim and may therefore distort beliefs in response to adverse information. We develop a game-theoretic model in which voters and politicians receive signals about the severity of climate change. When the anticipated welfare losses from severe climate change are sufficiently large, voters optimally ignore unfavorable information, inducing politicians to campaign on policies appropriate for mild climate change only. When welfare losses are moderate, the model admits a second, efficient equilibrium in which voters trust politicians to implement welfare-maximizing policies and vote informatively, thereby creating incentives for politicians to propose adequate climate policy. The model shows how motivated belief formation and voters' expectations about policy responsiveness jointly determine equilibrium selection between effective climate policy and persistent political inaction.</description>

      <title>Waiting for Trade in Markets with Aggregate Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies learning in markets with aggregate uncertainty about whether trade is efficient. A long-lived seller offers prices to buyers, who are short-lived and arrive according to a Poisson process. A hidden state determines whether the buyers' common value exceeds the seller's reservation value. All parties observe noisy, private signals about the state. With small intertemporal frictions and when the seller has commitment power, the seller waits for a buyer with the most favorable signal to arrive up to an exit time that depends on the seller's private information. This strategy profile maximizes both the seller's profit and the expected surplus. Without commitment, the commitment profit is unattainable. Instead, there is an equilibrium in which the seller also waits for a buyer with the most favorable signal, but, relative to the commitment case, the seller exits inefficiently late, and the trade probability is inefficiently high.</description>

      <title>Perceived Fairness in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual definitions of algorithmic fairness focus on population-level statistics, such as demographic parity or equal opportunity. However, in many social or economic contexts, fairness is not perceived globally, but locally, through an individual's peer network and comparisons. We propose a theoretical model of perceived fairness networks, in which each individual's sense of discrimination depends on the local topology of interactions. We show that even if a decision rule satisfies standard criteria of fairness, perceived discrimination can persist or even increase in the presence of homophily or assortative mixing. We propose a formalism for the concept of fairness perception, linking network structure, local observation, and social perception. Analytical and simulation results highlight how network topology affects the divergence between objective fairness and perceived fairness, with implications for algorithmic governance and applications in finance and collaborative insurance.</description>

      <title>The disclosure of information about the range of asset value in market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information released to investors in financial markets has various forms. We refer to range information as information about the upper and lower bound which the payoff of a risky asset may reach in the future. This study develops rational expectation models to explore the market impacts of disclosure of range information. Our model shows that its disclosure can decrease the sensitivity of market price to private signal and increase market liquidity. The market impact of its disclosure depends on the position and precision of the disclosed range. When the linear combination of private signal and noise trading volume is distant from the disclosed range, the reaction of price to a variation in private signal will almost vanish, whereas a movement of the disclosed range can affect the price efficiently. If the midpoint of the disclosed range is higher (lower) than a criterion which is specified in this study, the disclosure will reduce (raise) asset premium.</description>
