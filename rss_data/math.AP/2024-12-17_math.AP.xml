      <title>Non-uniqueness of weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in R^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To our knowledge, the convex integration method has been widely applied to the study of non-uniqueness of solutions to the Naiver-Stokes equations in the periodic region, but there are few works on applying this method to the corresponding problems in the whole space or other regions. In this paper, we prove that weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations are not unique in the class of weak solutions with finite kinetic energy in the whole space, which extends the non uniqueness result for the Navier-Stokes equations on torus T3in the groundbreaking work (Buckmaster and Vicol, Ann. of Math., 189 (2019), pp.101-144) to R3. The critical ingredients of the proof include developing an iterative scheme in which the approximation solution is refined by decomposing it into local and non-local parts. For the non-local part, we introduce the localized corrector which plays a crucial role in balancing the compact support of the Reynolds stress error with the non-compact support of the solution. As applications of this argument, we first prove that there exist infinitely many weak solutions that dissipate the kinetic energy in smooth bounded domain. Moreover, we show the instability of the Navier-Stokes equations near Couette flow in L2(R3).</description>

      <title>Pullback attractors for nonclassical diffusion equations with a delay operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the asymptotic behavior of weak solutions for nonclassical non-autonomous diffusion equations with a delay operator in time-dependent spaces when the nonlinear function $g$ satisfies subcritical exponent growth conditions, the delay operator $\varphi(t, u_t)$ contains some hereditary characteristics and the external force $k \in L_{l o c}^{2}\left(\mathbb{R} ; L^{2}(\Omega)\right)$. First, we prove the well-posedness of solutions by using the Faedo-Galerkin approximation method. Then after a series of elaborate energy estimates and calculations, we establish the existence and regularity of pullback attractors in time-dependent spaces $C_{\mathcal{H}_{t}(\Omega)}$ and $C_{\mathcal{H}^{1}_{t}(\Omega)}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On concentrated vortices of 3D incompressible Euler equations under helical symmetry: with swirl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence of concentrated helical vortices of 3D incompressible Euler equations with swirl. First, without the assumption of the orthogonality condition, we derive a 2D vorticity-stream formulation of 3D incompressible Euler equations under helical symmetry. Then based on this system, we deduce a non-autonomous second order semilinear elliptic equations in divergence form, whose solutions correspond to traveling-rotating invariant helical vortices with non-zero helical swirl. Finally, by using Arnold's variational method, that is, finding maximizers of a properly defined energy functional over a certain function space and proving the asymptotic behavior of maximizers, we construct families of concentrated traveling-rotating helical vortices of 3D incompressible Euler equations with non-zero helical swirl in infinite cylinders. As parameter $ \varepsilon\to0 $, the associated vorticity fields tend asymptotically to a singular helical vortex filament evolved by the binormal curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup in a five- and higher-dimensional chemotaxis model with indirect signal production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a three-component chemotaxis model accounting for indirect signal production, reading as $u_t = \nabla\cdot(\nabla u - u\nabla v)$, $v_t = \Delta v - v + w$ and $0 = \Delta w - w + u$, posed on a smoothly bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.
  It is suggested that the system has a four-dimensional critical mass phenomenon concerning blowup in finite or infinite time according to work of Fujie and Senba [J. Differential Equations, 263 (2017), 88--148; 266 (2019), 942--976]. In this paper, we prove that positive initial data with low energy enforce occurrence of finite-time blowup in higher dimensions ($n\geq5$) under radial settings.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity results for a subcritical Hamiltonian system with concave-convex nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the {\it Hamiltonian elliptic system} \begin{eqnarray}\label{HS1-abstract} \left\{ \begin{aligned} -\Delta u &amp; = \lambda |v|^{r-1}v +|v|^{p-1}v \qquad &amp;\hbox{in} \ \ \Omega ,\\ -\Delta v &amp; = \mu |u|^{s-1}u +|u|^{q-1}u \qquad &amp;\hbox{in} \ \ \Omega ,\\ u &amp;&gt;0, \ v&gt;0 \qquad \, &amp;\hbox{in} \ \ \Omega ,\\ u &amp;=v = 0 \qquad \quad &amp;\hbox{on} \quad \partial \Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{eqnarray} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb {R}^N$ is a smooth bounded domain, $\lambda$ and $ \mu $ are nonnegative parameters and $r,s,p,q&gt;0$. Our study includes the case in which the nonlinearities in \eqref{HS1-abstract} are concave near the origin and convex near infinity, and we focus on the region of non-negative {\it pairs of parameters} \red{$(\lambda,\mu)$} that guarantee exis\-tence and multiplicity of solutions of \eqref{HS1-abstract}. \red{In particular, we show the existence of a strictly decreasing curve $\lambda_*(\mu)$ on an interval $[0, \mu]$ with $\lambda_*(0)&gt; 0, \lambda_*(\mu) = 0$ and such that the system has two solutions for $(\lambda,\mu)$ below the curve, one solution for $(\lambda, \mu)$ on the curve and no solution for $(\lambda, \mu)$ above the curve. A similar statement holds reversing $\lambda$ and $\mu$.} This work is motivated by some of the results by Ambrosseti, BRezis and Cerami from 1993.</description>

      <title>Weak martingale solutions to the stochastic 1D Quantum-Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence of global weak dissipative martingale solutions for a one-dimensional compressible fluid model with capillarity and density dependent viscosity, driven by random initial data and a stochastic forcing term. These solutions are weak in both PDEs and Probability sense and may have vacuum regions. The proof relies on the construction of an approximating system which provides extra dissipation properties and the convergence is based on an appropriate truncation of the velocity field in the momentum equation and a stochastic compactness argument</description>

      <title>Stability of the Couette flow for 3D Navier-Stokes equations with rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation significantly influences the stability characteristics of both laminar and turbulent shear flows. This study examines the stability threshold of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with rotation, in the vicinity of the Couette flow at high Reynolds numbers ($\mathbf{Re}$) in the periodical domain $\mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$, where the rotational strength is equivalent to the Couette flow. Compared to the classical Navier-Stokes equations, rotation term brings us more two primary difficulties: the linear coupling term involving in the equation of $u^2$ and the lift-up effect in two directions. To address these difficulties, we introduce two new good unknowns that effectively capture the phenomena of enhanced dissipation and inviscid damping to suppress the lift-up effect. Moreover, we establish the stability threshold for initial perturbation $\left\|u_{\mathrm{in}}\right\|_{H^{\sigma}} &lt; \delta \mathbf{Re}^{-2}$ for any $\sigma &gt; \frac{9}{2}$ and some $\delta=\delta(\sigma)&gt;0$ depending only on $\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Solitary wave formation in the compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of perturbations in a compressible one-dimensional inviscid gas with an ambient state consisting of constant pressure and periodically-varying density. We show through asymptotic analysis that long-wavelength perturbations approximately obey a system of dispersive nonlinear wave equations. Computational experiments demonstrate that solutions of the 1D Euler equations agree well with this dispersive model, with solutions consisting mainly of solitary waves. Shock formation seems to be avoided for moderate-amplitude initial data, while shock formation occurs for larger initial data. We investigate the threshold for transition between these behaviors, validating a previously-proposed criterion based on further computational experiments. These results support the existence of large-time non-breaking solutions to the 1D compressible Euler equations, as hypothesized in previous works.</description>

      <title>The Lagrange Problem from the Viewpoint of Toric Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I mainly prove the following conclusions. For the Lagrange problem, when the energy value is below the minimum value of the first, second and third critical points, the toric domain defined for the bounded component of the regularized energy hypersurface is strictly monotone and is dynamically convex as a corollary. For the Euler problem as a special case of the Lagrange problem, When the energy is negative, the toric domain defined for the bounded component near the positive mass of the regularized energy hypersurface with one positive mass and one absolutely smaller non-positive masses is convex. Together with Gabriella Pinzari's result, the toric domain defined above is concave when the second mass is non-negative, convex when the second mass is non-positive.</description>

      <title>An Onsager-type Theorem for General 2D Active Scalar Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the Onsager-type problem for general 2-dimensional active scalar equations of the form: $\partial_t \theta+u\cdot\nabla \theta= 0$, with $u=T[\theta]$ being a divergence-free velocity field and $T$ being a Fourier multiplier operator with symbol $m$. It is shown that if $m$ is a odd and homogeneous symbol of order $\delta$: $m(\lambda\xi)=\lambda^{\delta} m(\xi)$, where $\lambda&gt;0, -1\le\delta\le0$, then there exists a nontrivial temporally compact-supported weak solution $\theta\in C_t^0 C_x^{\frac{2\delta}{3}-}$, which fails to conserve Hamiltonian. This result is sharp since all weak solutions of class $C_t^0C_x^{\frac{2\delta}{3}+}$ will necessarily conserve the Hamiltonian (\cite{IMnew}) and thus resolves the flexible part of the generalized Onsager conjecture for general 2D odd active scalar equations. Also, in the appendix, analogous results have been obtained for general 2D and 3D even active scalar equations. The proof is achieved by using convex integration scheme at the level $v=-\nabla^{\perp}\cdot\theta$ together with a Newton scheme recently introduced in \cite{GR23}. Moreover, a novel algebraic lemma and sharp estimates for some complicated trilinear Fourier multipliers are established to overcome the difficulties caused by the generality of the equations.</description>

      <title>Global existence and decay rates of strong solutions to the diffusion approximation model in radiation hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global well-posedness and optimal time decay rates of strong solutions to the diffusion approximation model in radiation hydrodynamics in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This model consists of the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations and the radiative diffusion equation which describes the influence and interaction between thermal radiation and fluid motion. Supposing that the initial perturbation around the equilibrium is sufficiently small in $H^2$-norm, we obtain the global strong solutions by utilizing method of the frequency decomposition. Moreover, by performing Fourier analysis techniques and using the delicate energy method, we consequently derive the optimal decay rates (including highest-order derivatives) of solutions for this model.</description>

      <title>On sharpened singular Adams' type inequalities and applications to $(p,\frac{n}{2})$-biharmonic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to establish a sharp version of Adams' type inequality in a suitable higher order function space with singular weight in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In addition, we also provide the proof of a sharp singular concentration-compactness principle due to Lions' as an improvement of this singular Adams' inequality. Despite this, we shall demonstrate a new compact embedding, which plays a crucial role in our arguments. Moreover, as an application of these results, by employing the mountain pass theorem, we study the existence of nontrivial solutions to a class of nonhomogeneous quasilinear elliptic equations involving $(p,\frac{n}{2})$-biharmonic operator with singular exponential growth as follows $$
  \Delta^2_p u+\Delta^2_{\frac{n}{2}} u=\frac{g(x,u)}{|x|^\gamma}\quad\text{in}\quad \mathbb{R}^n, $$ with $n\geq 4$, $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{n}{2}$, $\gamma\in(0,n)$ and the nonlinear term $g:\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is a Carath\'eodory function, which behaves like $\exp{(\alpha|s|^{\frac{n}{n-2}})}$ as $|s|\to~+\infty$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Polarized Light and Temperature in a Stratified Atmosphere with a Slowly Varying Refractive Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is an attempt to elucidate the effect of a slowly varying refractive index on the temperature in a stratified atmosphere, with a particular focus on greenhouse gases such as CO2. It validates an iterative method for the vector radiative transfer equations (VVRTE) called Iterations on the Source. As the system proposed by Chandrasekhar and Pomraning is not well posed for all rays directions when the refractive index varies, so instead we solve an integral representation of VRTE without the problematic rays. A mathematical proof is given showing monotonicity, convergence of the iterations and existence and uniqueness. Furthermore the convergence is geometric if the absorption is not too large. Some numerical tests are performed showing the effect of a layer of cloud with a refractive index greater than air, polarisation and scattering.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet problem on lower dimensional boundaries: Schauder estimates via perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Dirichlet problem on lower dimensional manifolds for a class of weighted elliptic equations with coefficients that are singular on such sets. Specifically, we study the problem \[\begin{cases} -{\rm div}(|y|^a A(x,y) \nabla u) = |y|^a f + {\rm div}(|y|^a F), \\ u = \psi, \quad \text{ on } \Sigma_0, \end{cases} \] where $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^{d-n} \times \mathbb{R}^n$, $2 \leq n \leq d$, $a + n \in (0,2)$, and $\Sigma_0 = \{|y| = 0\}$ is the lower dimensional manifold where the equation loses uniform ellipticity. Our primary objective is to establish $C^{0,\alpha}$ and $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity estimates up to $\Sigma_0$, under suitable assumptions on the coefficients and the data. Our approach combines perforated domain approximations, Liouville-type theorems and a fine blow-up argument.</description>

      <title>Volume-surface systems with sub-quadratic intermediate sum on the surface: Global existence and boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global existence and boundness of solutions to volume-surface reaction diffusion systems with a mass control condition are investigated. Such systems arise typically in e.g. cell biology, ecology or fluid mechanics, when some concentrations or densities are inside a domain and some others are on its boundary. Comparing to previous works, the difficulty of systems under consideration here is that the nonlinearities on the surface can have a sub-quadratic growth rates in all dimensions. To overcome this, we first use the Moser iteration to get some uniform bounds of the time integration of the solutions. Then by combining these bounds with an $L^p$-energy method and a duality argument, we obtain the global existence of solutions. Moreover, under mass dissipation conditions, the solution is shown to be bounded uniformly in time.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with the inverse-square potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dispersive decay estimates for solution to the $3\mathrm{D}$ energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an inverse-square operator $\mathcal{L}_a$ where the operator is denoted by $\mathcal{L}_{a}:=-\Delta+\frac{a}{|x|^2}$ with the constant $a\geq0$. Inspired by the work of \cite{KMVZZ1,K}, we first establish that the solutions exhibit $\dot{H}^1(\R^3)$ uniform regularity, derive the Lorentz-Strichartz estimates, and then obtain the desired decay estimates using the bootstrap argument. The key ingredients of our approach include the equivalence of Sobolev norms and the fractional product rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the existence and regularity results of normalized solutions to the following quasilinear elliptic Choquard equation with critical Sobolev exponent and mixed diffusion type operators:
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{rcl}
  -\Delta_p u+(-\Delta_p)^su &amp; = &amp; \lambda |u|^{p-2}u +|u|^{p^*-2}u+ \mu(I_{\alpha}*|u|^q)|u|^{q-2}u\;\;\text{in } \mathbb{R}^N,
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^pdx &amp; = &amp; \tau,
  \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  where $N\geq 3$, $\tau&gt;0$, $\frac{p}{2}(\frac{N+\alpha}{N})&lt;q&lt;\frac{p}{2}(\frac{N+\alpha}{N-p})$, $I_{\alpha}$ is the Riesz potential of order $\alpha\in (0,N)$, $\mu&gt;0$ is a parameter, $(-\Delta_p)^s$ is the fractional p-laplacian operator, $p^*=\frac{Np}{N-p}$ is the critical Sobolev exponent and $\lambda$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier.</description>

      <title>Positive solutions for a weighted critical problem with mixed boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions to a nonlocal elliptic problem involving the spectral fractional Laplace operator endowed with homogeneous mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions and weighted critical nonlinearities. By means of variational methods and the Nehari manifold approach, we deduce the existence of multiple positive solutions under some assumptions on the behavior of the weight function around its maximum points. Such a behavior, formulated in terms of some rate growth, is explicitly determined and depends on the relation between the dimension, the order of the operator and the subcritical perturbation. In this way we extend and improve the results in "J.F. Liao, J. Liu, P. Zhang, C.L. Tang, Existence and multiplicity of positive solutions for a class of elliptic equations involving critical Sobolev exponents, RACSAM 110 (2016) 483--501", dealing with the Dirichlet problem for the classical Laplace operator, to the nonlocal setting involving mixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A Rellich type theorem for discrete Maxwell operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Rellich type theorem (RT) for the Maxwell operator $\hat H^D=\hat D\hat H_0$ on ${\bf Z}^3$ with constant anisotropic medium, i.e. the permittivity and permeability of which are non-scalar constant diagonal matrices. We also study the unique continuation theorem for the perturbed Maxwell operator $\hat H^{D_p}=\hat {D}_p\hat H_0$ on ${\bf Z}^3$ where the permittivity and permeability are locally perturbed from a constant matrix on a compact set in ${\bf Z}^3$. It then implies that, if $\hat H^D- \lambda$ satisfies (RT), then all distributions $\hat u$ in Besov space $\mathcal B_0^{\ast}({\bf Z}^3;{\bf C}^3)$ satisfying the equation $(\hat H^{D_p} - \lambda) \hat u = 0$ outside a compact set vanish near infinity.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal double phase Neumann and Robin problem with variable $s(\cdot,\cdot)-$order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop some properties of the $a_{x,y}(\cdot)$-Neumann derivative for the nonlocal $s(\cdot,\cdot)$-order operator in fractional Musielak-Sobolev spaces with variable $s(\cdot,\cdot)-$order. Therefore we prove the basic proprieties of the correspondent function spaces. In the second part of this paper, by means of Ekeland's variational principal and direct variational approach, we prove the existence of weak solutions to the following double phase Neumann and Robin problem with variable $s(\cdot,\cdot)-$order: $$\left\{\begin{array}  (-\Delta)^{s_1(x,\cdot)}_{a^1_{(x,\cdot)}} u+(-\Delta)^{s_2(x,\cdot)}_{a^2_{(x,\cdot)}} u +\widehat{a}^1_x(|u|)u+\widehat{a}^2_x(|u|)u &amp;= \lambda f(x,u) \quad {\rm in\ } \Omega, \\ \mathcal{N}^{s_1(x,\cdot)}_{a^1(x,\cdot)}u+\mathcal{N}^{s_2(x,\cdot)}_{a^2(x,\cdot)}u+\beta(x)\left( \widehat{a}^1_x(|u|)u+\widehat{a}^2_x(|u|)u \right) &amp;= 0 \quad {\rm in\ } \mathbb{R}^N\setminus \Omega, \end{array} \right. $$ where $(-\Delta)^{s_i(x,\cdot)}_{a^i_{(x,\cdot)}}$ and $\mathcal{N}^{s_i(x,\cdot)}_{a^i(x,\cdot)}$ denote the variable $s_i(\cdot,\cdot)$-order fractional Laplace operator and the nonlocal normal $a_i(\cdot,\cdot)$-derivative of $s_i(\cdot,\cdot)$-order, respectively.</description>

      <title>Intervals of bifurcation points for semilinear elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the behavior of multiple continua of solutions to the semilinear elliptic problem \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u = \lambda f(u) &amp;\text{ in } \Omega,
  u=0 &amp;\text{ on } \partial\Omega,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\re^N$ and $f$ is a nonnegative continuous real function with multiple zeros. We analyze both the behavior of unbounded continua of solutions having norm between consecutive zeros of $f$, and the asymptotic behavior of the multiple unbounded continua in the case in which $f$ has a countable infinite set of positive zeros. In both cases, we pay special attention to the multiplicity results they give rise to. For the model cases $f(t) = t^r(1+\sin t)$ and $f(t) = t^r \left(1+\sin \frac{1}{t}\right)$ with $r\geq 0$ we show the surprising fact that there are some values of $r$ for which every $\lambda&gt;0$ is a bifurcation point (either from infinity or from zero) that is not a branching point.</description>

      <title>On Second-Order $L^\infty$ Variational Problems with Lower-Order Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study $2$nd order $L^\infty$ variational problems, through seeking to minimise a supremal functional involving the Hessian of admissible functions as well as lower-order terms. Specifically, given a bounded domain $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb R^n$ and $\mathrm H : \Omega\times\big(\mathbb R \times\mathbb R^n \times \mathbb R^{n^{\otimes2}}_s \big) \to \mathbb R$, we consider the functional \[ \mathrm{E}_\infty(u,\Omega') :=\underset{\Omega'}{\mathrm{ess}\sup}\hspace{1mm}\mathrm H (\cdot,u,\mathrm D u,\mathrm D^2u ) , \ \ u\in W^{2,\infty}(\Omega), \ \Omega' \subseteq \Omega \text{ measurable}. \] We establish the existence of minimisers subject to (first-order) Dirichlet data on $\partial \Omega$ under natural assumptions, and, when $n=1$, we also show the existence of absolute minimisers. We further derive a necessary fully nonlinear PDE of third-order which arises as the analogue of the Euler-Lagrange equation for absolute minimisers, and is given by
  $$ \ \ \mathrm H_{\mathrm X}(\cdot,u,\mathrm D u,\mathrm D^2u): \mathrm D\big(\mathrm H(\cdot,u,\mathrm D u,\mathrm D^2u)\big)\otimes \mathrm D\big(\mathrm H(\cdot,u,\mathrm D u,\mathrm D^2u)\big)=0\ \ \text{ in }\Omega.
  $$ We then rigorously derive this PDE from smooth absolute minimisers, and prove the existence of generalised D-solutions to the (first-order) Dirichlet problem. Our work generalises the key results obtained in [26] which first studied problems of this type with pure Hessian dependence only, providing at the same time considerably simpler streamlined proofs.</description>

      <title>Non-local non-homogeneous phase transitions: regularity of optimal profiles and sharp-interface limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a novel sharp-interface analysis via Gamma-convergence for a non-local and non-homogeneous diffuse-interface model for phase transitions, featuring an interplay between a non-local interaction kernel and a spatially dependent double-well potential. This interaction requires the development of new strategies both for the Gamma-liminf inequality and for the construction of recovery sequences. A key element of our approach is an asymptotic calibration, used to establish the Gamma-liminf lower bound. The study of the optimality of the lower bound hinges upon a novel analysis of the regularity dependence of one-dimensional optimal profiles on a family of parameters. In particular, we show how such regularity is influenced by the singularity of the interaction kernel at the origin, providing a precise and previously unexplored link between the two. Our results rely solely on the assumption of H\"older continuity for the moving wells, and also account for the compactness of sequences with equibounded energies.</description>

      <title>Sharp local existence and nonlinear smoothing for dispersive equations with higher-order nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general nonlinear dispersive equation with monomial nonlinearity of order $k$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$. We construct a rigorous theory which states that higher-order nonlinearities and higher dimensions induce sharper local well-posedness theories. More precisely, assuming that a certain positive multiplier estimate holds at order $k_0$ and in dimension $d_0$, we prove a sharp local well-posedness result in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for any $k\ge k_0$ and $d\ge d_0$. Moreover, we give an explicit bound on the gain of regularity observed in the difference between the linear and nonlinear solutions, confirming the conjecture made in [CorreiaOliveiraSilva24] (doi.org/10.1137/23M156923X). The result is then applied to generalized Korteweg-de Vries, Zakharov-Kuznetsov and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we primarily study the Pogorelov-type $C^2$ estimates for $(k-1)$-convex solutions of the sum Hessian equation under the assumption of semi-convexity, and apply these estimates to obtain a rigidity theorem for global solutions satisfying the corresponding conditions. Furthermore, we investigate the Pogorelov estimates and rigidity theorems for solutions to the parabolic versions under similar conditions. These results extend the works of \cite{He-Sheng-Xiang-Zhang-2022-CCM} and \cite{Liu-Ren-2023-JFA}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the circle, without external parameters, admits plenty of almost periodic solutions. Indeed, we prove that arbitrarily close to most of the finite dimensional KAM tori constructed by Kuksin--Poschel in 1996, there exist infinite dimensional non resonant Kronecker tori, i.e. rotational invariant tori. This result answers a natural and longstanding question, well identified by the Hamiltonian PDE community since the first KAM-type result for PDEs by Kuksin in 1987.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds for the operator pencil of an elliptic system in an angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model problem of a plane angle for a second-order elliptic system with Dirichlet, mixed, and Neumann boundary conditions is analyzed. The existence of solutions of the form $r^\lambda v$ is, for each boundary condition, reduced to solving a matrix equation. Leveraging these matrix equations and focusing on Dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions, optimal bounds on $|\Re \lambda|$ are derived, employing tools from numerical range analysis and accretive operator theory. The developed framework is novel and recovers known bounds for Dirichlet boundary conditions. The results for mixed boundary conditions are new and represent the central contribution of this work. Immediate applications of these findings are new regularity results in linear elasticity.</description>

      <title>Validity of the stochastic Landau approximation for super-pattern forming systems with a spatial 1:3 resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Kuramoto-Shivashinsky like equation close to the threshold of instability with additive white noise and spatially periodic boundary conditions which simultaneously exhibit Turing bifurcations with a spatial 1:3 resonance of the critical wave numbers. For the description of the bifurcating solutions we derive a system of coupled stochastic Landau equations. It is the goal of this paper to prove error estimates between the associated approximation obtained through this amplitude system and true solutions of the original system. The Kuramoto-Shivashinsky like equation serves as a prototype model for so-called super-pattern forming systems with quadratic nonlinearity and additive white noise.</description>

      <title>Capacitary measures in fractional order Sobolev spaces: Compactness and applications to minimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capacitary measures form a class of measures that vanish on sets of capacity zero. These measures are compact with respect to so-called $\gamma$-convergence, which relates a sequence of measures to the sequence of solutions of relaxed Dirichlet problems. This compactness result is already known for the classical $H^1(\Omega)$-capacity. This paper extends it to the fractional capacity defined for fractional order Sobolev spaces $H^s(\Omega)$ for $s\in (0,1)$. The compactness result is applied to obtain a finer optimality condition for a class of minimization problems in $H^s(\Omega)$.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of positive solutions to a general class of overdetermined semilinear elliptic boundary problems on suitable bounded open sets $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. Specifically, for $n\leq 4$ and under mild technical hypotheses on the coefficients and the nonlinearity, we show that there exist open sets $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary and of any prescribed volume where the overdetermined problem admits a positive solution. The proof builds on ideas of Alt and Caffarelli on variational problems for functions defined on a bounded region. In our case, we need to consider functions defined on the whole $\mathbb{R}^n$, so the key challenge is to obtain uniform bounds for the minimizer and for the diameter of its support. Our methods extend to higher dimensions, although in this case the free boundary $\partial\Omega$ could have a singular set of codimension 5. The results are new even in the case of the Poisson equation $-\Delta v =g(x)$ with constant Neumann data.</description>

      <title>A Note on Hyperbolic Relaxation of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system for incompressible two-phase flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-phase dynamics of two incompressible and immiscible fluids. As a mathematical model we rely on the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system that belongs to the class of diffuse-interface models. Solutions of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system exhibit strong non-local effects due to the velocity divergence constraint and the fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard operator. We suggest a new first-order approximative system for the inviscid sub-system. It relies on the artificial-compressibility ansatz for the Navier-Stokes equations, a friction-type approximation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and a relaxation of a third-order capillarity term. We show under reasonable assumptions that the first-order operator within the approximative system is hyperbolic; precisely we prove for the spatially one-dimensional case that it is equipped with an entropy-entropy flux pair with convex (mathematical) entropy. For specific states we present a numerical characteristic analysis. Thanks to the hyperbolicity of the system, we can employ all standard numerical methods from the field of hyperbolic conservation laws. We conclude the paper with preliminary numerical results in one spatial dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For large classes of convex incoming waves and convex obstacles, we verify the grazing sets are $C^1$ co-dimensional two submanifolds, and the reflected flow maps are diffeomorphisms in the illuminable region and homeomorphisms up to the shadow boundaries. We also construct explicit examples of convex obstacles with smooth boundaries, for which the grazing set for planar or spherical incident waves are not $C^1$. As an application, we state a theorem on the propagation of semilinear wave oscillations grazing a convex obstacle to arbitrary high finite or infinite order in low regularity spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of initial condition in the presence of two topological insulators without magnetic field where the interface is a smooth connected not compact curve without boundaries. The solution is governed by an adiabatic modulation of a Dirac operator with a variable mass. We determine the evolution of the semiclassical measure of the solution with a two-scale Wigner measure method by reducing the Dirac operator to a normal form.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for massive Dirac equation in a constant magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deacy and Strichartz estimates for the massive Dirac Hamiltonian in a constant magnetic fields in $\mathbb{R}_t\times\mathbb{R}^2_x$: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  i\partial_tu(t,x)-\mathcal{D}_Au(t,x)=0,
  u(0,x)=f,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\mathcal{D}_A=-i{\bf \sigma}\cdot (\nabla-i{\bf A}(x))+\sigma_3m$ with $m\geq0$ being the mass and $\sigma_i$ being the Dirac matrices and the potential ${\bf A}(x)=\frac{B_0}{2}(-x_2,x_1),\,B_0&gt;0$. In particular, we show the $L^1(\mathbb{R}^2)\to L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2)$ type micro-localized decay estimates, for any finite time $T&gt;0$, there exists a constant $C_T$ such that \begin{equation*} \|e^{it\mathcal{D}_{A}}\varphi(2^{-j}|\mathcal{D}_{A}|)f(x)\|_{[L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)]^2} \leq C_T 2^{2j}(1+2^{j}|t|)^{-\frac12} \|\varphi(2^{-j}|\mathcal{D}_{A}|)f\|_{[L^1{(\mathbb{R}^2)]^2}}, \quad |t|\leq T, \end{equation*}
  and we further prove the local-in-time Strichartz estimates for the Dirac equations with this unbounded potential.</description>

      <title>Fast 3D Partial Boundary Data EIT Reconstructions using Direct Inversion CGO-based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first partial boundary data complex geometrical optics based methods for electrical impedance tomography in three dimensions are developed, and tested, on simulated and experimental data. The methods provide good localization of targets for both absolute and time-difference imaging, when large portions of the domain are inaccessible for measurement. As most medical applications of electrical impedance tomography are limited to partial boundary data, the development of partial boundary algorithms is highly desirable. While iterative schemes have been used traditionally, their high computational cost makes them cost-prohibitive for applications that need fast imaging. The proposed algorithms require no iteration and provide informative absolute or time-difference images exceptionally quickly in under 2 seconds. Reconstructions are compared to reference reconstructions from standard linear difference imaging (30 seconds) and total variation regularized absolute imaging (several minutes) The algorithms perform well under high levels of noise and incorrect domain modeling.</description>

      <title>Classification of ancient noncollapsed flows in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all noncollapsed singularities of the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Specifically, we prove that any ancient noncollapsed solution either is one of the classical historical examples (namely $\mathbb{R}^j\times S^{3-j}$, $\mathbb{R}\times $2d-bowl, $\mathbb{R}\times $2d-oval, the rotationally symmetric 3d-bowl, or a cohomogeneity-one 3d-oval), or belongs to the 1-parameter family of $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathrm{O}_2$-symmetric 3d-translators constructed by Hoffman-Ilmanen-Martin-White, or belongs to the 1-parameter family of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2\times \mathrm{O}_2$-symmetric ancient 3d-ovals constructed by Du-Haslhofer.
  In light of the five prior papers on the classification program in $\mathbb{R}^4$ from our collaborations with Du, Hershkovits, and Choi-Daskalopoulos-Sesum, the major remaining challenge is the case of mixed behaviour, where the convergence to the round bubble-sheet is fast in $x_1$-direction, but logarithmically slow in $x_2$-direction. To address this, we prove a differential neck theorem, which allows us to capture the (dauntingly small) slope in $x_1$-direction. To establish the differential neck theorem, we introduce a slew of new ideas of independent interest, including switch and differential Merle-Zaag dynamics, anisotropic barriers, and propagation of smallness estimates. Applying our differential neck theorem, we show that every noncompact strictly convex solution is selfsimilarly translating, and also rule out exotic ovals.</description>

      <title>Hypocoercivity meets lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unify the variational hypocoercivity framework established by D. Albritton, S. Armstrong, J.-C. Mourrat, and M. Novack, with the notion of second-order lifts of reversible diffusion processes, recently introduced by A. Eberle and F. L\"orler. We give an abstract, yet fully constructive, presentation of the theory, so that it can be applied to a large class of linear kinetic equations. As this hypocoercivity technique does not twist the reference norm, we can recover accurate and sharp convergence rates in various models. Among those, adaptive Langevin dynamics (ALD) is discussed in full detail and we show that for near-quadratic potentials, with suitable choices of parameters, it is a near-optimal second-order lift of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. As a further consequence, we observe that the Generalised Langevin Equation (GLE) is a also a second-order lift, as the standard (kinetic) Langevin dynamics are, of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. Then, convergence of (GLE) cannot exceed ballistic speed, i.e.~the square root of the rate of the overdamped regime. We illustrate this phenomenon with explicit computations in a benchmark Gaussian case.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if we fill without gaps a bag with infinitely many potatoes, in such a way that they touch each other in few points, then the total surface area of the potatoes must be infinite. In this context potatoes are measurable subsets of the Euclidean space, the bag is any open set of the same space. As we show, this result also holds in the general context of doubling (even locally) metric measure spaces satisfying Poincar\'e inequality, in particular in smooth Riemannian manifolds and even in some sub-Riemannian spaces.</description>

Both representations are unified through the so-called $(p,q)$-differential operator, for which a kernel-like function is provided, generating the sequence of $(p,q)$-factorials.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel and local index theorem for open complex manifolds with $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a complex manifold $\Sigma $ with $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action, we define the $m$-th $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$ Fourier-Dolbeault cohomology group and consider the $m$-index on $\Sigma $. By applying the method of transversal heat kernel asymptotics, we obtain a local index formula for the $m$-index. We can reinterpret Kawasaki's Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for a compact complex orbifold with an orbifold holomorphic line bundle by our integral formulas over a (smooth) complex manifold and finitely many complex submanifolds arising from singular strata. We generalize $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action to complex reductive Lie group $G$-action on a compact or noncompact complex manifold. Among others, we study the nonextendability of open group action and the space of all $G$-invariant holomorphic $p$-forms. Finally, in the case of two compatible holomorphic $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-actions, a mirror-type isomorphism is found between two linear spaces of holomorphic forms, and the Euler characteristic associated with these spaces can be computed by our $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$ local index formula on the total space. In the perspective of the equivariant algebraic cobordism theory $\Omega _{\ast }^{\mathbb{C}^{\ast }}(\Sigma ),$ a speculative connection is remarked. Possible relevance to the recent development in physics and number theory is briefly mentioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Lorentz gas proposed by Bobylev et al. [4], which describes a point particle moving in a random distribution of hard-disk obstacles in $\mathbb{R}^2$ under the influence of a constant magnetic field perpendicular to the plane. We show that, in the coupled low-density and diffusion limit, when the intensity of the magnetic field is smaller than $\frac{8\pi}{3}$, the non-Markovian effects induced by the magnetic field become sufficiently weak. Consequently, the particle's probability distribution converges to the solution of the heat equation with a diffusion coefficient dependent on the magnetic field and given by the Green-Kubo formula. This formula is derived from the generator of the generalized Boltzmann process associated with the generalized Boltzmann equation, as predicted in [4].</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Bounds for generative diffusion models with Gaussian tail targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an estimate of the Wasserstein distance between the data distribution and the generation of score-based generative models, assuming an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation of the score and a Gaussian-type tail behavior of the data distribution. The complexity bound in dimension is $O(\sqrt{d})$, with a logarithmic constant. Such Gaussian tail assumption applies to the distribution of a compact support target with early stopping technique and the Bayesian posterior with a bounded observation operator. Corresponding convergence and complexity bounds are derived.
  The crux of the analysis lies in the Lipchitz bound of the score, which is related to the Hessian estimate of a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation (vHJ). This latter is demonstrated by employing a dimension independent kernel estimate. Consequently, our complexity bound scales linearly (up to a logarithmic constant) with the square root of the trace of the covariance operator, which relates to the invariant distribution of forward process. Our analysis also extends to the probabilistic flow ODE, as the sampling process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An inductive procedure is developed to calculate the asymptotic behavior at time zero of a diffusion with polynomial drift and degenerate, additive noise. The procedure gives rise to two different rescalings of the process; namely, a functional law of the iterated logarithm rescaling and a distributional rescaling. The limiting behavior of these rescalings is studied, resulting in two related control problems which are solved in nontrivial examples using methods from geometric control theory. The control information from these problems gives rise to a practical criteria for points to be regular on the boundary of a domain in $\mathbf{R}^n$ for such diffusions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a new class of stochastic control problems characterized by specific control constraints. Specifically, the admissible controls are subject to the ratcheting constraint, meaning they must be non-decreasing over time and are thus self-path-dependent. This type of problems is common in various practical applications, such as optimal consumption problems in financial engineering and optimal dividend payout problems in actuarial science. Traditional stochastic control theory does not readily apply to these problems due to their unique self-path-dependent control feature. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new class of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, which are variational inequalities concerning the derivative of a new spatial argument that represents the historical maximum control value. Under the standard Lipschitz continuity condition, we demonstrate that the value functions for these self-path-dependent control problems are the unique solutions to their corresponding HJB equations in the viscosity sense.</description>

      <title>The focusing complex mKdV equation with nonzero background: Large $N$-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons and related Painlev\'{e}-III hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the large-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons of the focusing complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (c-mKdV) equation with nonzero background via the Riemann-Hilbert problems. First, based on the Lax pair, inverse scattering transform, and a series of deformations, we construct a multi-rational soliton of the c-mKdV equation via a solvable Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP). Then, through a scale transformation, we construct a RHP corresponding to the limit function which is a new solution of the c-mKdV equation in the rescaled variables $X,\,T$, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the RHP's solution. Moreover, we also find that the limit function satisfies the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to space $X$ and time $T$, respectively. The ODEs with respect to space $X$ are identified with certain members of the Painlev\'{e}-III hierarchy. We study the large $X$ and transitional asymptotic behaviors of near-field limit solutions, and we provide some part results for the case of large $T$. These results will be useful to understand and apply the large-order rational solitons in the nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>A particle system approach towards the global well-posedness of master equations for potential mean field games of control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the $N$-particle systems as well as the HJB/master equations for a class of generalized mean field control (MFC) problems and the corresponding potential mean field games of control (MFGC). A local in time classical solution for the HJB equation is generated via a probabilistic approach based on the mean field maximum principle. Given an extension of the so called displacement convexity condition, we obtain the uniform estimates on the HJB equation for the $N$-particle system. Such estimates imply the displacement convexity/semi-concavity and thus the prior estimates on the solution to the HJB equation for generalized MFC problems. The global well-posedness of HJB/master equation for generalized MFC/potential MFGC is then proved thanks to the local well-posedness and the prior estimates. In view of the nature of the displacement convexity condition, such well-posedness is also true for the degenerated case. Our analysis on the $N$-particle system also induces an Lipschitz approximator to the optimal feedback function in generalized MFC/potential MFGC where an algebraic convergence rate is obtained. Furthermore, an alternative approximate Nash equilibrium is proposed based on the $N$-particle system, where the approximation error is quantified thanks to the aforementioned uniform estimates.</description>

Abstract: Pseudospherical surfaces determined by Cauchy problems involving the Camassa-Holm equation are considered herein. We study how global solutions influence the corresponding surface, as well as we investigate two sorts of singularities of the metric: the first one is just when the co-frame of dual form is not linearly independent. The second sort of singularity is that arising from solutions blowing up. In particular, it is shown that the metric blows up if and only if the solution breaks in finite time.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability for Relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau System in Bounded Domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of plasma-wall interactions is crucial to fusion devices from both physical and mathematical perspectives. It is well known that a magnetic field satisfying the classical perfect conducting conditions at the wall, $$
  \mathbf{E} \times n_x = 0, \quad \mathbf{B} \cdot n_x = 0, $$ plays an important role in fusion plasma dynamics studies. Since the early 1990s, it has been understood that the Lorentz force can penetrate into the domain at the boundary and create a singularity. Consequently, the uniqueness for any nonlinear kinetic plasma models in the presence of a perfectly conducting boundary remained open until our recent local well-posedness result. In this paper, we finally establish a global well-posedness theory for the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system in a general $3D$ domain with a specularly reflective, perfectly conducting boundary.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of high-contrast dielectric elastomer composites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the homogenization of high-contrast dielectric elastomer composites, materials that deform in response to electrical stimulation. The considered heterogeneous material consisting of an ambient material with inserted particles is described by a weakly coupled system of an electrostatic equation with an elastic equation enriched with electrostriction. It is assumed that particles gradually become rigid as the fine-scale parameter approaches zero. This study demonstrates that the effective response of this system entails a homogeneous dielectric elastomer, described by a weakly coupled system of PDEs. The coefficients of the homogenized equations are dependent on various factors, including the composite's geometry, the original microstructure's periodicity, and the coefficients characterizing the initial heterogeneous material. Particularly, these coefficients are significantly influenced by the high-contrast nature of the fine-scale problem's coefficients. Consequently, as anticipated, the high-contrast coefficients of the original yield non-local effects in the homogenized response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the Helmholtz equation in a junction of two periodic half-spaces. When the overall medium is periodic in the direction of the interface, Fliss and Joly (2019) proposed a method which consists in applying a partial Floquet-Bloch transform along the interface, to obtain a family of waveguide problems parameterized by the Floquet variable. In this paper, we consider two model configurations where the medium is no longer periodic in the direction of the interface. Inspired by the works of G\'erard-Varet and Masmoudi (2011, 2012), and Blanc, Le Bris, and Lions (2015), we use the fact that the overall medium has a so-called quasiperiodic structure, in the sense that it is the restriction of a higher dimensional periodic medium. Accordingly, the Helmholtz equation is lifted onto a higher dimensional problem with coefficients that are periodic along the interface. This periodicity property allows us to adapt the tools previously developed for periodic media. However, the augmented PDE is elliptically degenerate (in the sense of the principal part of its differential operator) and thus more delicate to analyse.</description>

Abstract: The trend to equilibrium for reaction-diffusion systems modelling chemical reaction networks is investigated, in the case when reaction processes happen on subsets of the domain. We prove the convergence to equilibrium by directly showing functional inequalities in terms of entropy method. Our approach allows us to deal with nonlinearities of arbitrary orders, for which only global renormalised solutions are known to globally exist. For bounded solutions, we also prove the convergence to equilibrium when the diffusion as well as the reaction are degenerate, that is both diffusion and reaction processes only act on specific subsets of the domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to discretize the von Neumann equation, which is efficient in the semi-classical limit. This method is first based on the so called Weyl's variables to address the stiffness associated with the equation. Then, by applying a truncated Hermite expansion of the density operator, we successfully handle this stiffness. Additionally, we develop a finite volume approximation for practical implementation and conduct numerical simulations to illustrate the efficiency of our approach. This asymptotic preserving numerical approximation, combined with the use of Hermite polynomials, provides an efficient tool for solving the von Neumann equation in all regimes, near classical or not.</description>

Abstract: Ultrasound contrast imaging is a specialized imaging technique that applies microbubble contrast agents to traditional medical sonography, providing real-time visualization of blood flow and vessels. Gas-filled microbubbles are injected into the body, where they undergo compression and rarefaction and interact nonlinearly with the ultrasound waves. Therefore, the propagation of sound through a bubbly liquid is a strongly nonlinear problem that can be modeled by a nonlinear acoustic wave equation for the propagation of the pressure waves coupled via the source terms to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation of Rayleigh-Plesset type for the bubble dynamics. In this work, we first derive a hierarchy of such coupled models based on constitutive laws. We then focus on the coupling of Westervelt's acoustic equation to Rayleigh-Plesset type equations, where we rigorously show the existence of solutions locally in time under suitable conditions on the initial pressure-microbubble data and final time. Thirdly, we devise and discuss numerical experiments on both single-bubble dynamics and the interaction of microbubbles with ultrasound waves.</description>

Abstract: We prove existence of smooth solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations with divergence free Schwartz initial data. We demonstrate the latter by considering an iterative procedure involving solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations approximated via the retarded mollification. In particular, we use $L^\infty#to L^\infty$ and a new $L^\infty \to L^1\cap L^infty$ estimate of the Leray projektor.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity and asymptotic behavior of normalized solutions to p-Kirchhoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a type of p-Kirchhoff equation $$
  -\left( a+b\int_{\mathbb{R} ^3}{\left| \nabla u \right|^pdx} \right) \varDelta _pu=\lambda \left| u \right|^{p-2}u+\left| u \right|^{q-2}u, x \in \mathbb{R}^3 $$ with the prescribed mass $$ \left(\int_{\mathbb{R} ^3}{\left| u \right|^{p}dx}\right)^\frac{1}{p} = c &gt; 0 $$ where $a&gt;0, b &gt; 0,\frac{3}{2} &lt;p &lt;3, p &lt; q &lt; p^{\ast}:=\frac{3p}{3-p} $,$\varDelta _pu=div\left( \left| \nabla u \right|^{p-2}\nabla u \right)$ is the $p$-Laplacian of $u$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is Lagrange multiplier. We consider both $L^p$-subcritical , $L^p$-critical and $L^p$-supercritical cases. Precisely, in the $L^p$-subcritical and $L^p$-critical cases, we obtain the existence and nonexistence of the normalized solutions for the $p$-Kirchhoff equation. In the $L^p$-supercritical case, we obtain the existence of radial ground sates and multiplicity of radial normalized solutions for the $p$-Kirchhoff equation. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behavior of normalized solutions when $b \rightarrow 0^+$. Besides, when $\frac{3}{2} &lt; p \leq 2$, benefit from the uniqueness(up to translations) of optimizer for Gargliardo-Nirenberg inequality, we show the existence and uniqueness of normalized solutions and provide the accurate descriptions.</description>

      <title>Transition layers to chemotaxis-consumption models with volume-filling effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the dynamical behaviors of solutions to a parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis-consumption model with a volume-filling effect on a bounded interval, where the physical no-flux boundary condition for the bacteria and mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition for the oxygen are prescribed. By taking a continuity argument, we first show that the model admits a unique nonconstant steady state. Then we use Helly's compactness theorem to show that the asymptotic profile of steady state is a transition layer as the chemotactic coefficient goes to infinity. Finally, based on the energy method along with a cancellation structure of the model, we show that the steady state is nonlinearly stable under appropriate perturbations. Moreover, we do not need any assumption on the parameters in showing the stability of steady state.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves to a logarithmic chemotaxis model with fast diffusion and singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a chemotaxis model with logarithmic sensitivity and fast diffusion, which possesses strong singularities for the sensitivity at zero-concentration of chemical signal, and for the diffusion at zero-population of cells, respectively. The main purpose is to show the existence of traveling waves connecting the singular zero-end-state, and particularly, to show the asymptotic stability of these traveling waves. The challenge of the problem is the interaction of two kinds of singularities involved in the model: one is the logarithmic singularity of the sensitivity; and the other is the power-law singularity of the diffusivity. To overcome the singularities for the wave stability, some new techniques of weighted energy method are introduced artfully. Numerical simulations are also carried out, which further confirm our theoretical stability results, in particular, the numerical results indicate that the effect of fast diffusion to the structure of traveling waves is essential, which causes the traveling waves much steeper like shock waves. This new phenomenon is a first observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.11988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the parameter dependence of complex geodesics with prescribed boundary value and direction on bounded strongly linearly convex domains. As an important application we establish a quantitative relationship between the regularity of the pluricomplex Poisson kernel of such a domain, which is a solution to a homogeneous complex Monge--Amp\`{e}re equation with boundary singularity, and the regularity of the boundary of the domain. Our results greatly improve the previous results of Chang--Hu--Lee and Bracci--Patrizio in this direction.</description>

      <title>A Convergent Numerical Algorithm for $\alpha$-Dissipative Solutions of the Hunter-Saxton Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A convergent numerical method for $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation is derived. The method is based on applying a tailor-made projection operator to the initial data, and then solving exactly using the generalized method of characteristics. The projection step is the only step that introduces any approximation error. It is therefore crucial that its design ensures not only a good approximation of the initial data, but also that errors due to the energy dissipation at later times remain small. Furthermore, it is shown that the main quantity of interest, the wave profile, converges in $L^{\infty}$ for all $t \geq 0$, while a subsequence of the energy density converges weakly for almost every time.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation to the time fractional Vakhnenko Parkes equation for modeling the propagation of high frequency waves in relaxation medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with solving the time fractional Vakhnenko Parkes equation using the reproducing kernels. Reproducing kernel theory, the normal basis, some important Hilbert spaces, homogenization of constraints, and the orthogonalization process are the main tools of this technique. The main advantage of reproducing kernel method is it is truly meshless. The solutions obtained by the implementation reproducing kernels Hilbert space method on the time-fractional Vakhnenko Parkes equation is in the form of a series. The obtained solution converges to the exact solution uniquely. It is observed that the implemented method is highly effective. The effectiveness of reproducing kernel Hilbert space method is presented through the tables and graphs. The perfectness of this method is tested by taking different error norms and the order of convergence of the errors.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure in the infinite volume limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure on the one-dimensional torus in the infinite volume limit. This measure is an invariant Gibbs measure for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. It had previously been shown by B. Rider that the measure is strongly concentrated around a family of minimizers of the Hamiltonian associated with the measure. These exhibit increasingly sharp spatial concentration, resulting in a trivial limit to first order. We study the fluctuations around this soliton manifold. We show that the scaled field under the Gibbs measure converges to white noise in the limit, identifying the next order fluctuations predicted by B. Rider.</description>
