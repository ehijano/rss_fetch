      <title>Silicon Nitride Photonic Waveguide-Based Young's Interferometer for Molecular Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Devices based on photonic integrated circuits play a crucial role in the development of low-cost, high-performance, industry-scale manufacturable sensors. We report the design, fabrication, and application of a silicon nitride waveguide-based integrated photonic sensor in Young's interferometer configuration combined with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) imaging detection. We use a finite-difference time-domain method to analyze the performance of the sensor device and optimize the sensitivity of the fundamental transverse-electric (TE) mode. We develop a low-cost fabrication method for the photonic sensor chip, using photolithography-compatible dimensions, and produce the sensing region with wet-etching of silicon dioxide. We demonstrate the sensor's functioning by measuring the optical phase shift with glucose concentration in an aqueous solution. We obtain consistent interference patterns with fringe visibility exceeding 0.75 and measure the phase differences for glucose concentrations in the 10 ug/ml order, corresponding to the order of 10^7 molecules in the sensing volume. We envision extending this work to functionalized surface sensors based on molecular binding. Our work will impact biosensing applications and, more generally, the fabrication of interferometric-based photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Remote Analysis of Femoroacetabular Impingement by a triade of label-free optical spectroscopy techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the combination of Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), Raman spectroscopy (RS) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in the field of biomedical research. Thereby, the results from RS and LIBS are combined with previous DRS results. These noninvasive optical methods, used together, offer thorough analysis of the absorptive and scattering behaviour, elemental composition, and molecular bindings of tissue, without resulting in considerable harm or changes to the sample or the requirement of markers. The study centres on applying this triad of techniques to tissues affected by Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI), a condition characterised by reduced hip mobility due to developmental deformities of the hip joint. The research results in a biochemical pathway model of the condition causing the red staining caused by FAI which origin was unknown until now. This proves that this approach may have significant implications for numerous medical applications and support in exploring complex chemical and biochemical pathways.</description>

      <title>Spatial polarization gating of high-harmonic generation in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation from solids can be utilized as probe of ultrafast dynamics, but thus far only over extended sample areas, since its spatial resolution is diffraction-limited. Here we propose spatial polarization gating, that is using a spatially varying ellipticity of a driving laser pulse to reduce the spatial profile of high-harmonic emission below the diffraction limit and hence increase spatial resolution. We show experimentally and by numerical simulations that our method is generally applicable as suppressing high harmonics in elliptical fields is a common response in all solids. We also briefly explore the possibility of applying this technique to widefield imaging, specifically to nonlinear structured illumination microscopy. Our findings indicate that spatial polarization gating can enable all-optical femto-to-attosecond label-free imaging beyond the Abbe limit.</description>

      <title>Compact, folded multi-pass cells for energy scaling of post-compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining high peak and high average power has long been a key challenge of ultrafast laser technology, crucial for applications such as laser-plasma acceleration and strong-field physics. A promising solution lies in post-compressed ytterbium lasers, but scaling these to high pulse energies presents a major bottleneck. Post-compression techniques, particularly Herriott-type multi-pass cells (MPCs), have enabled large peak power boosts at high average powers but their pulse energy acceptance reaches practical limits defined by setup size and coating damage threshold. In this work, we address this challenge and demonstrate a novel type of compact, energy-scalable MPC (CMPC). By employing a novel MPC configuration and folding the beam path, the CMPC introduces a new degree of freedom for downsizing the setup length, enabling compact setups even for large pulse energies. We experimentally and numerically verify the CMPC approach, demonstrating post-compression of 8 mJ pulses from 1 ps down to 51 fs in atmospheric air using a cell roughly 45 cm in length at low fluence values. Additionally, we discuss the potential for energy scaling up to 200 mJ with a setup size reaching 2.5 m. Our work presents a new approach to high-energy post-compression, with up-scaling potential far beyond the demonstrated parameters. This opens new routes for achieving the high peak and average powers necessary for demanding applications of ultrafast lasers.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mid-IR chirality and chiral thermal emission from twisted bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to detect and engineer chirality plays a defining role in understanding nature, presenting itself in various phenomena ranging from the formation of DNA to enzymatic activities and digital encoding. Inducing a chiral response using nanophotonic practices typically entails lithographic efforts to create micro- and nano-structures that break mirror symmetry. Even with such configurations and despite the ubiquitousness of thermal radiation, generating chiral light at mid-infrared frequencies through thermal emission remains a challenge, since incandescence is by nature incoherent and unpolarized. In contrast to lithography-based approaches, we demonstrate that unpatterned twisted bilayers of in-plane anisotropic materials serve as a new material platform for intrinsic mid-infrared chirality engineering. Via absorption spectroscopy as well as direct thermal emission measurements, we report large circular dichroism and asymmetric circularly polarized thermal emission from exfoliated twisted bilayers of $\alpha$-molybdenum trioxide ($\alpha$-MoO$_3$). These findings highlight the potential of twisted layered van der Waals materials for polarization control and advanced thermal infrared technologies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limit on the open circuit voltage of solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new thermodynamic limit for the open circuit voltage of solar cells that includes thermalization is obtained in terms of photon entropy. A simple graphical construction makes it possible to link this limit to the existing limits for single junction cells due to Trivich and Flinn, Shockley and Queisser and W\"urfel, and the thermodynamic Carnot-type limit for hot-carrier solar cell. At the fundamental level, this limit points to similarity between photovoltaic and thermoelectric energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Million-Q Free Space Meta-Optical Resonator at Visible Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality (Q)-factor optical resonators with extreme temporal coherence are of both technological and fundamental importance in optical metrology, continuous-wave lasing, and semiconductor quantum optics. Despite extensive efforts in designing high-Q resonators across different spectral regimes, the experimental realization of very large Q-factors at visible wavelengths remains challenging due to the small feature size that is sensitive to fabrication imperfections, and thus is typically implemented in integrated photonics. In the pursuit of free-space optics with the benefits of large space-bandwidth product and massive parallel operations, here we design and fabricate a visible-wavelength etch-free metasurface with minimized fabrication defects and experimentally demonstrate a million-scale ultrahigh-Q resonance. A new laser-scanning momentum-space-resolved spectroscopy technique with extremely high spectral and angular resolution is developed to characterize the record-high Q-factor as well as the dispersion of the million-Q resonance in free space. By integrating monolayer WSe2 into our ultrahigh-Q meta-resonator, we further demonstrate laser-like highly unidirectional and narrow-linewidth exciton emission, albeit without any operating power density threshold. Under continuous-wave laser pumping, we observe pump-power-dependent linewidth narrowing at room temperature, indicating the potential of our meta-optics platform in controlling coherent quantum light-sources. Our result also holds great promise for applications like optical sensing, spectral filtering, and few-photon nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Laser cooling a centimeter-scale torsion pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We laser cool a centimeter-scale torsion pendulum to a temperature of 10 mK (average occupancy of 6000 phonons) starting from room temperature (equivalent to $2\times 10^8$ phonons). This is achieved by optical radiation pressure forces conditioned on a quantum-noise-limited optical measurement of the pendulum's angular displacement with an imprecision 13 dB below that at the standard quantum limit (SQL). The measurement sensitivity is the result of a novel `mirrored' optical lever that passively rejects extraneous spatial-mode noise by 60 dB. The high mechanical quality ($10^7$) and quantum-noise-limited sub-SQL measurement imprecision demonstrate the necessary ingredients for realizing the quantum ground state of torsional motion -- a pre-requisite for mechanical tests of gravity's alleged quantum nature.</description>

      <title>Review and Novel Formulae for Transmittance and Reflectance of Wedged Thin Films on absorbing Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, spectroscopic techniques have been essential for studying the optical properties of thin solid films. However, existing formulae for both normal transmission and reflection spectroscopy often rely on simplified theoretical assumptions, which may not accurately align with real-world conditions. For instance, it is common to assume (1) that the thin solid layers are deposited on completely transparent thick substrates and (2) that the film surface forms a specular plane with a relatively small wedge angle. While recent studies have addressed these assumptions separately, this work presents an integrated framework that eliminates both assumptions simultaneously. In addition, the current work presents a deep review of various formulae from the literature, each with their corresponding levels of complexity. Our review analysis highlights a critical trade-off between computational complexity and expression accuracy, where the newly developed formulae offer enhanced accuracy at the expense of increased computational time. Our user-friendly code, which includes several classical transmittance and reflectance formulae from the literature and our newly proposed expressions, is publicly available in both Python and Matlab at this link.</description>

      <title>Data-driven 2D stationary quantum droplets and wave propagations in the amended GP equation with two potentials via deep neural networks learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic deep learning approach to solve two-dimensional (2D) stationary quantum droplets (QDs) and investigate their wave propagation in the 2D amended Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Lee-Huang-Yang correction and two kinds of potentials. Firstly, we use the initial-value iterative neural network (IINN) algorithm for 2D stationary quantum droplets of stationary equations. Then the learned stationary QDs are used as the initial value conditions for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to explore their evolutions in the some space-time region. Especially, we consider two types of potentials, one is the 2D quadruple-well Gaussian potential and the other is the PT-symmetric HO-Gaussian potential, which lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking and the generation of multi-component QDs. The used deep learning method can also be applied to study wave propagations of other nonlinear physical models.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-limit spin squeezing with spin Bogoliubov Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the optimal spin squeezing under a one-axis-twisting Hamiltonian follows a scaling law of $J^{-2/3}$ for $J$ interacting atoms after a quench dynamics. Here we prove analytically and numerically that the spin squeezing of the ground state of the one-axis-twisting Hamiltonian actually reaches the Heisenberg limit $J^{-1}$. By constructing a bilinear Bogoliubov Hamiltonian with the raising and lowering spin operators, we exactly diagonalize the spin Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, which includes the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian as a limiting case. The ground state of the spin Bogoliubov Hamiltonian exhibits wonderful spin squeezing, which approaches to the Heisenberg limit in the case of the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian. It is possible to realize experimentally the spin squeezed ground state of the one-axis-twisting Hamiltonian in dipolar spinor condensates, ultracold atoms in optical lattices, spins in a cavity, or alkali atoms in a vapor cell.</description>

      <title>Complete vectorial optical mode converter using multi-layer metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vectorial optical mode converter that can transform an orthogonal set of multiple input vector beams into another orthogonal set of vector beams is attractive for a wide range of applications in optics and photonics. While multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) and metasurface (MS) technologies have been explored to individually address multiple spatial mode conversion and polarization mode manipulation, there has been no universal methodology to simultaneously convert a set of multiple vectorial modes, having non-uniform spatial distributions in both their complex amplitude and polarization, to another set of multiple vectorial modes. In this paper, we demonstrate versatile devices based on the MPLC concept incorporating multi-layer locally birefringent MSs and present a general design formalism for complete vectorial mode conversion in arbitrary cases. The effectiveness of our proposed method is confirmed experimentally by demonstrating a 6-mode (3 spatial modes $\times$ 2 polarization modes) multiplexer, fabricated on a compact chip with a ~0.65 mm$^2$ lateral size in a folded MS configuration. Additionally, we verify its applicability to more advanced functional devices through numerical demonstration of a mode-division-multiplexed dual-polarization coherent receiver and spatial-mode-multiplexed vectorial holography. The versatility of our protocol makes it suitable for designing a myriad of multi-input-multi-output devices, providing a powerful tool for realizing universal optical mode converters for a wide range of applications.</description>

Abstract: In multimode interferometers, the interaction between several modes brings a high level of complexity to the interpretation of its light patterns. With recent advances, it is possible to selectively excite only a couple of modes inside the device. This paper presents an analytical method for determining the phase difference between two propagating modes in the multimode interferometer, in an effort to simplify the usage and expand the range of applications for this type of optical devices.</description>

      <title>Tandem Photovoltaics from 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The demand for high-efficiency photovoltaic systems necessitates innovations that transcend the efficiency limitations of single-junction solar cells. This study investigates a tandem photovoltaic architecture comprising a top-cell with a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) superlattice absorber and a bottom-cell of crystalline silicon (c-Si), focusing on optimizing the light absorption and electrical performance of the combined structure. Through the transfer matrix method and electrical simulations, we optimized the geometry of the superlattice, determining that a siz-layer MoSe2 configuration with a 40 nm SiO2 antireflective layer maximizes photon absorption while mitigating additional weight and preserving the cell's structural integrity. The results show that the optimized TMDC superlattice significantly improves the PCE of the tandem design to 28.96%, and increase of 5.68% over the original single-junction c-Si solar cell's efficiency. This advancement illustrates the potential of TMDC material in next-generation solar cells and presents a promising avenue for the development of highly efficient, tandem photovoltaic systems via van der Waals integration of the top cell on c-Si</description>

Abstract: A quantum emitter interacting with photons in a single optical-mode constitutes a one-dimensional atom. A coherent and efficiently coupled one-dimensional atom provides a large nonlinearity, enabling photonic quantum gates. Achieving a high coupling efficiency ($\beta$-factor) and low dephasing is challenging. Here, we use a semiconductor quantum dot in an open microcavity as an implementation of a one-dimensional atom. With a weak laser input, we achieve an extinction of $99.2\%$ in transmission and a concomitant bunching in the photon statistics of $g^{(2)}(0) = 587$, showcasing the reflection of the single-photon component and the transmission of the multi-photon components of the coherent input. The tunable nature of the microcavity allows $\beta$ to be adjusted and gives control over the photon statistics -- from strong bunching to anti-bunching -- and the phase of the transmitted photons. We obtain excellent agreement between experiment and theory by going beyond the single-mode Jaynes-Cummings model. Our results pave the way towards the creation of exotic photonic states and two-photon phase gates.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal Method for Quasinormal Modes of Non-Relativistic Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01487v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently reported compactified hyperboloidal method has found wide use in the numerical computation of quasinormal modes, with implications for fields as diverse as gravitational physics and optics. We extend this intrinsically relativistic method into the non-relativistic domain, demonstrating its use to calculate the quasinormal modes of the Schr\"odinger equation and solve related bound-state problems. We also describe how to further generalize this method, offering a perspective on the importance of non-relativistic quasinormal modes for the programme of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Based Construction of Molecular Potential and Its Application in Exploring the Deep-Lying-Orbital Effect in High-Order Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating soft-Coulomb-type (SC) molecular potential within single-active-electron approximation (SAE) is essential since it allows solving time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with fewer computational resources compared to other multielectron methods. The current available SC potentials can accurately reproduce the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is sufficient for analyzing nonlinear effects in laser-molecule interactions like high-order harmonic generation (HHG). However, recent discoveries of significant effects of deep-lying molecular orbitals call for more precise potentials to analyze them. In this study, we present a fast and accurate method based on machine learning to construct SC potentials that simultaneously reproduce various molecular features, including energies, symmetries, and dipole moments of HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2. We use this ML model to create SC SAE potentials of the HCN molecule and then comprehensively analyze the fingerprints of lower-lying orbitals in HHG spectra emitted during the H-CN stretching. Our findings reveal that HOMO-1 plays a role in forming the second HHG plateau. Additionally, as the H-C distance increases, the plateau structure and the smoothness of HHG spectra are altered due to the redistribution of orbital electron density. These results are in line with other experimental and theoretical studies. Lastly, the machine learning approach using deconvolution and convolution neural networks in the present study is so general that it can be applied to construct molecular potential for other molecules and molecular dynamic processes.</description>
