      <title>CavDetect: A DBSCAN Algorithm based Novel Cavity Detection Model on Protein Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavities on the structures of proteins are formed due to interaction between proteins and some small molecules, known as ligands. These are basically the locations where ligands bind with proteins. Actual detection of such locations is all-important to succeed in the entire drug design process. This study proposes a Voronoi Tessellation based novel cavity detection model that is used to detect cavities on the structure of proteins. As the atom space of protein structure is dense and of large volumes and the DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm can handle such type of data very well as well as it is not mandatory to have knowledge about the numbers of clusters (cavities) in data as priori in this algorithm, this study proposes to implement the proposed algorithm with the DBSCAN algorithm.</description>

      <title>Interpreting artificial neural networks to detect genome-wide association signals for complex traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the genetic architecture of complex diseases is challenging due to the highly polygenic and interactive landscape of genetic and environmental factors. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants for multiple complex phenotypes, conventional statistical approaches can be limited by simplified assumptions such as linearity and lack of epistasis models. In this work, we trained artificial neural networks for predicting complex traits using both simulated and real genotype/phenotype datasets. We extracted feature importance scores via different post hoc interpretability methods to identify potentially associated loci (PAL) for the target phenotype. Simulations we performed with various parameters demonstrated that associated loci can be detected with good precision using strict selection criteria, but downstream analyses are required for fine-mapping the exact variants due to linkage disequilibrium, similarly to conventional GWAS. By applying our approach to the schizophrenia cohort in the Estonian Biobank, we were able to detect multiple PAL related to this highly polygenic and heritable disorder. We also performed enrichment analyses with PAL in genic regions, which predominantly identified terms associated with brain morphology. With further improvements in model optimization and confidence measures, artificial neural networks can enhance the identification of genomic loci associated with complex diseases, providing a more comprehensive approach for GWAS and serving as initial screening tools for subsequent functional studies.

      <title>Small Molecule Optimization with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have opened new possibilities for generative molecular drug design. We present Chemlactica and Chemma, two language models fine-tuned on a novel corpus of 110M molecules with computed properties, totaling 40B tokens. These models demonstrate strong performance in generating molecules with specified properties and predicting new molecular characteristics from limited samples. We introduce a novel optimization algorithm that leverages our language models to optimize molecules for arbitrary properties given limited access to a black box oracle. Our approach combines ideas from genetic algorithms, rejection sampling, and prompt optimization. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple molecular optimization benchmarks, including an 8% improvement on Practical Molecular Optimization compared to previous methods. We publicly release the training corpus, the language models and the optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>An optimal transport model for dynamical shapes, collective motion and cellular aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many biological systems such as cell aggregates, tissues or bacterial colonies behave as unconventional systems of particles that are strongly constrained by volume exclusion and shape interactions. Understanding how these constraints lead to macroscopic self-organized structures is a fundamental question in e.g. developmental biology. To this end, various types of computational models have been developed: phase fields, cellular automata, vertex models, level-set, finite element simulations, etc. We introduce a new framework based on optimal transport theory to model particle systems with arbitrary dynamical shapes and deformability. Our method builds upon the pioneering work of Brenier on incompressible fluids and its recent applications to materials science. It lets us specify the shapes of individual cells and supports a wide range of interaction mechanisms, while automatically taking care of the volume exclusion constraint at an affordable numerical cost. We showcase the versatility of this approach by reproducing several classical systems in computational biology.

      <title>Automated detection of gibbon calls from passive acoustic monitoring data using convolutional neural networks in the "torch for R" ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated detection of acoustic signals is crucial for effective monitoring of vocal animals and their habitats across ecologically-relevant spatial and temporal scales. Recent advances in deep learning have made these approaches more accessible. However, there are few deep learning approaches that can be implemented natively in the R programming environment; approaches that run natively in R may be more accessible for ecologists. The "torch for R" ecosystem has made the use of transfer learning with convolutional neural networks accessible for R users. Here, we evaluate a workflow that uses transfer learning for the automated detection of acoustic signals from passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data. Our specific goals include: 1) present a method for automated detection of gibbon calls from PAM data using the "torch for R" ecosystem; 2) compare the results of transfer learning for six pretrained CNN architectures; and 3) investigate how well the different architectures perform on datasets of the female calls from two different gibbon species: the northern grey gibbon (Hylobates funereus) and the southern yellow-cheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus gabriellae). We found that the highest performing architecture depended on the test dataset. We successfully deployed the top performing model for each gibbon species to investigate spatial of variation in gibbon calling behavior across two grids of autonomous recording units in Danum Valley Conservation Area, Malaysia and Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, Cambodia. The fields of deep learning and automated detection are rapidly evolving, and we provide the methods and datasets as benchmarks for future work.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Peak Assignment in 13C NMR Spectroscopy: A Novel Approach Using Multimodal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13817v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays an essential role in deciphering molecular structure and dynamic behaviors. While AI-enhanced NMR prediction models hold promise, challenges still persist in tasks such as molecular retrieval, isomer recognition, and peak assignment. In response, this paper introduces a novel solution, Multi-Level Multimodal Alignment with Knowledge-Guided Instance-Wise Discrimination (K-M3AID), which establishes correspondences between two heterogeneous modalities: molecular graphs and NMR spectra. K-M3AID employs a dual-coordinated contrastive learning architecture with three key modules: a graph-level alignment module, a node-level alignment module, and a communication channel. Notably, K-M3AID introduces knowledge-guided instance-wise discrimination into contrastive learning within the node-level alignment module. In addition, K-M3AID demonstrates that skills acquired during node-level alignment have a positive impact on graph-level alignment, acknowledging meta-learning as an inherent property. Empirical validation underscores K-M3AID's effectiveness in multiple zero-shot tasks.</description>

      <title>animal2vec and MeerKAT: A self-supervised transformer for rare-event raw audio input and a large-scale reference dataset for bioacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bioacoustic research, vital for understanding animal behavior, conservation, and ecology, faces a monumental challenge: analyzing vast datasets where animal vocalizations are rare. While deep learning techniques are becoming standard, adapting them to bioacoustics remains difficult. We address this with animal2vec, an interpretable large transformer model, and a self-supervised training scheme tailored for sparse and unbalanced bioacoustic data. It learns from unlabeled audio and then refines its understanding with labeled data. Furthermore, we introduce and publicly release MeerKAT: Meerkat Kalahari Audio Transcripts, a dataset of meerkat (Suricata suricatta) vocalizations with millisecond-resolution annotations, the largest labeled dataset on non-human terrestrial mammals currently available. Our model outperforms existing methods on MeerKAT and the publicly available NIPS4Bplus birdsong dataset. Moreover, animal2vec performs well even with limited labeled data (few-shot learning). animal2vec and MeerKAT provide a new reference point for bioacoustic research, enabling scientists to analyze large amounts of data even with scarce ground truth information.</description>
