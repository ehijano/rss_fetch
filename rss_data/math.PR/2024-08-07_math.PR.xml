      <title>A Koml\'os dichotomy for the \'Emery topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the spirit of Koml\'os's theorem, we investigate when a sequence of semimartingales satisfying a boundedness condition admits forward convex combinations converging in the \'Emery topology. A dichotomy into two classes of universal counterexamples to a Koml\'os-type theorem is established, mirroring a result of M\'emin. As an application of this classification, we obtain a remarkable Koml\'os-type theorem for semimartingales, with convergence in a $\sigma$-localized$\unicode{x2014}$in the sense of Kallsen$\unicode{x2014}$version of the \'Emery topology. This provides the first general convex compactness principle for semimartingales in the literature for which the limit $X$ is necessarily a semimartingale, solving a serious gap in previous results that limited the possible wealth processes vis-\`a-vis $X$ to those arising from predictable finite variation integrands, a severe restriction in applications to mathematical finance.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet forms of diffusion processes on Thoma simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a prominent two-parametric family of diffusion processes $X_{z,z'}$ on an infinite-dimensional Thoma simplex. The family was constructed by Borodin and Olshanski in 2007 and it closely resembles Ethier-Kurtz's infinitely-many-neutral-allels diffusion model on Kingman simplex (1981) and Petrov's extension of Ethier-Kurtz's model (2007). The processes $X_{z,z'}$ have unique symmetrizing measures, namely, the boundary $z$-measures, which play the role of Poisson-Dirichlet measures in our context.
  We establish the following behavior of diffusions $X_{z,z'}$: immediately after the initial moment they jump into a dense face of Thoma simplex and then always stay there. In other words, the face acts as a natural state space for the diffusions, while other points of the simplex act like an entrance boundary for our process. As a key intermediate step we study the Dirichlet forms of the diffusions $X_{z,z}$ and find a new description for them.</description>

      <title>Mixed Hegselmann-Krause Dynamics on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixed Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model covers the synchronous Hegselmann-Krause model, the asynchronous Hegselmann-Krause model and the Deffuant model. Previous study~\cite{mHK, mHK2} deals with the mixed HK model on finite graphs. In the study, we discuss the mixed HK model on infinite graphs which also covers the HK model and the Deffuant model on infinite graphs. We investigate conditions under which asymptotic stability holds or any two vertices in the same component approaches each other after some finite time.</description>

      <title>A straightforward proof of the critical value in the Hegselmann-Krause model: up to one-half</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Hegselmann-Krause model, an agent updates its opinion by averaging with others whose opinions differ by at most a given confidence threshold. With agents' initial opinions uniformly distributed on the unit interval, we provide a straightforward proof that establishes the critical value is up to one-half. This implies that the probability of consensus approaches one as the number of agents tends to infinity for confidence thresholds larger than or equal to one-half.</description>

      <title>Recurrence of multidimensional affine recursions in the critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove, under different natural hypotheses, that the random multidimensional affine recursion $X_n=A_nX_{n-1}+B_n\in\mathbb{R}^d, n \geq 1,$ is recurrent in the critical case. In particular we cover the cases where the matrices $A_n$ are similarities, invertible, rank 1 or with non negative coefficients.
  These results are a consequence of a criterion of recurrence for a large class of affine recursions on $\mathbb R^d$, based on some moment assumptions of the so-called ``reverse norm control random variable".</description>

      <title>Boolean models in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The union of the particles of a stationary Poisson process of compact (convex) sets in Euclidean space is called Boolean model and is a classical topic of stochastic geometry. In this paper, Boolean models in hyperbolic space are considered, where one takes the union of the particles of a stationary Poisson process in the space of compact (convex) subsets of the hyperbolic space. Geometric functionals such as the volume of the intersection of the Boolean model with a compact convex observation window are studied. In particular, the asymptotic behavior for balls with increasing radii as observation windows is investigated. Exact and asymptotic formulas for expectations, variances, and covariances are shown and univariate and multivariate central limit theorems are derived. Compared to the Euclidean framework, some new phenomena can be observed.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Low-rank Tensor Recovery from Uniformly Random Entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a generic tensor $T\in \mathbb{F}^{n\times n\times \dots\times n}$ of order $k$ and CP rank $d$ can be uniquely recovered from $n\log n+dn\log \log n +o(n\log \log n) $ uniformly random entries with high probability if $d$ and $k$ are constant and $\mathbb{F}\in \{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$. The bound is tight up to the coefficient of the second leading term and improves on the existing $O(n^{\frac{k}{2}}{\rm polylog}(n))$ upper bound for order $k$ tensors. The bound is obtained by showing that the projection of the Segre variety to a random axis-parallel linear subspace preserves $d$-identifiability with high probability if the dimension of the subspace is $n\log n+dn\log \log n +o(n\log \log n) $ and $n$ is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms (complex generalized H\'{e}non maps and their conjugate maps) of $\Bbb{C}^{2}.$ We show that a generic random dynamical system of polynomial automorphisms has ``mean stablity'' on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$. Further, we show that if a system has mean stability, then (1) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma =(\gamma _{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ of maps, the Lyapunov exponents of $\gamma $ at $z$ are negative, (2) there are only finitely many minimal sets of the system, (3) each minimal set is attracting, and (4) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma $ of maps, the orbit $\{ \gamma _{n}\cdots \gamma _{1}(z) \} _{n=1}^{\infty }$ tends to one of the minimal sets of the system. Note that (1)--(4) cannot hold for any deterministic iteration dynamical system of a single complex generalized H\'{e}non map. We observe many new phenomena in random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms of $\Bbb{C}^{2}$ and observe the mechanisms. We provide new strategies and methods to study higher-dimensional random holomorphic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Bayes-optimal learning of an extensive-width neural network from quadratically many samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a target function corresponding to a single hidden layer neural network, with a quadratic activation function after the first layer, and random weights. We consider the asymptotic limit where the input dimension and the network width are proportionally large. Recent work [Cui &amp; al '23] established that linear regression provides Bayes-optimal test error to learn such a function when the number of available samples is only linear in the dimension. That work stressed the open challenge of theoretically analyzing the optimal test error in the more interesting regime where the number of samples is quadratic in the dimension. In this paper, we solve this challenge for quadratic activations and derive a closed-form expression for the Bayes-optimal test error. We also provide an algorithm, that we call GAMP-RIE, which combines approximate message passing with rotationally invariant matrix denoising, and that asymptotically achieves the optimal performance. Technically, our result is enabled by establishing a link with recent works on optimal denoising of extensive-rank matrices and on the ellipsoid fitting problem. We further show empirically that, in the absence of noise, randomly-initialized gradient descent seems to sample the space of weights, leading to zero training loss, and averaging over initialization leads to a test error equal to the Bayes-optimal one.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of crossing probabilities in the dilute Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10979v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent paper due to Duminil-Copin and Tassion from 2019 introduces a novel argument for obtaining estimates on horizontal crossing probabilities of the random cluster model, in which a range of four possible behaviors is established. To apply the novel renormalization of crossing probabilities that the authors propose can be studied in other models of interest that are not self-dual, we collect results to formulate vertical and horizontal strip, and renormalization, inequalities for the dilute Potts model, whose measure is obtained from the high temperature expansion of the loop $O(n)$ measure supported over the hexagonal lattice in the presence of two external fields. The dilute Potts model was originally introduced in $1991$ by Nienhuis and is another model that enjoys the RSW box crossing property in the Continuous Critical phase, which is one of the four possible behaviors that the model is shown to enjoy. Through a combination of the Spatial Markov Property (SMP) and Comparison between Boundary Conditions (CBC) of the high-temperature spin measure, four phases of the dilute Potts model can be analyzed, exhibiting a class of boundary conditions upon which the probability of obtaining a horizontal crossing is significantly dependent. The exponential factor that is inserted into the Loop $O(n)$ model to quantify properties of the high-temperature phase is proportional to the summation over all spins, and the number of monochromatically colored triangles over a finite volume, which is in exact correspondence with the parameter of a Boltzmann weight introduced in Nienhuis' 1991 paper detailing extensions of the $q$-state Potts model. Asymptotically, in the infinite volume limit we obtain strip and renormalization inequalities that provide conditions on the RSW constants $1-c$ and $c$.</description>

      <title>The phase transition for the Gaussian free field is sharp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the phase transition for the Gaussian free field (GFF) is sharp. In comparison to a previous argument due to Rodriguez in 2017 which characterized a $0-1$ law for the Massive Gaussian Free Field by analyzing crossing probabilities below a threshold $h_{**}$, we implement a strategy due to Duminil-Copin and Manolescu in 2016, which establishes that two parameters are equal, one of which encapsulates the probability of obtaining an infinite connected component under free boundary conditions, while the other encapsulates the natural logarithm of the probability of obtaining a connected component from the origin to the box of length $n$ which is also taken under free boundary conditions. We quantify the probability of obtaining crossings in easy and hard directions, without imposing conditions that the graph is invariant with respect to reflections, in addition to making use of a differential inequality adapted for the GFF. The sharpness of the phase transition is characterized by the fact that below a certain height parameter of the GFF, the probability of obtaining an infinite cluster a.s. decays exponentially fast, while above the parameter, the probability of obtaining an infinite cluster occurs a.s. with good probability.</description>

      <title>Rumour Spreading Depends on the Latent Geometry and Degree Distribution in Social Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study push-pull rumour spreading in small-world models for social networks where the degrees follow a power-law. In a non-geometric setting Fountoulakis, Panagiotou and Sauerwald have shown that rumours always spread fast (SODA 2012). On the other hand, Janssen and Mehrabian have found that rumours spread slowly in a spatial preferential attachment model (SIDMA 2017). We study the question systematically for the model of geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs), which has been found to be a good theoretical and empirical fit for social networks. Our result is two-fold: with classical Euclidean geometry both slow and fast rumour spreading may occur, depending on the exponent of the power law and the prevalence of weak ties in the networks, and we fully characterise the phase boundaries between those two regimes. Depending on the parameters, fast spreading may either mean polylogarithmic time or even doubly logarithmic time. Secondly, we show that rumour spreading is always fast in a non-metric geometry. The considered non-metric geometry allows to model social connections where resemblance of vertices in a single attribute, such as familial kinship, already strongly indicates the presence of an edge. Classical Euclidean Geometry fails to capture such ties.
  For some regimes in the Euclidean setting, the efficient pathways for spreading rumours differ from previously identified paths. A vertex of degree $d$ can transmit the rumour efficiently to a vertex of larger degree by a chain of length $3$, where one of the two intermediaries has constant degree, and the other has degree $d^{c}$ for some constant $c&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Quantum inverse scattering for the 20-vertex model up to Dynkin automorphism: crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, weak integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a novel application of the quantum-inverse scattering method for the 20-vertex model, building upon seminal work from Faddeev and Takhtajan on the study of Hamiltonian systems, with applications to crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, and integrability. In comparison to a previous work of the author in late $2023$ which characterized integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the 6-vertex model from integrability of inhomogeneous limit shapes, formalized in a work of Keating, Reshetikhin and Sridhar, notions similar to those of integrability can be realized for the 20-vertex model by studying new classes of higher-dimensional L-operators. In comparison to two-dimensional L-operators expressed in terms of Pauli basis elements, three-dimensional L-operators provided by Boos and colleagues have algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric, qualities, all of which impact leading order approximations of correlations, products of L-operators, the transfer matrix, and the quantum monodromy matrix in finite volume. In comparison to the inhomogeneous 6-vertex model, the 20-vertex model does not enjoy as strong of an integrability property through the existence of suitable action-angle variables, which is of interest to further explore, possibly from information on limit shapes given solutions to the three-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>
