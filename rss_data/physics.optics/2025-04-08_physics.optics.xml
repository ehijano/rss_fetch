      <title>Free Space Few-Photon Nonlinearity in Critically Coupled Polaritonic Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-photon optical nonlinearity in planar solid-state systems is challenging yet crucial for quantum and classical optical information processing. Polaritonic nonlinear metasurfaces have emerged as a promising candidate to push the photon number down -- but have often been hindered by challenges like the poor photon-trapping efficiency and lack of modal overlap. Here, we address these issues in a self-hybridized perovskite metasurface through critical coupling engineering, and report strong polaritonic nonlinear absorption at an ultra-low incident power density of only 519 W/cm2 (2 orders of magnitude lower than the state of art in free-space planar devices), with an estimated photon number of 6.12 per cavity lifetime. Taking advantage of a quasi-bound-state-in-the-continuum design with asymmetry-controlled quality-(Q)-factor, we systematically examine the Q-dependent device nonlinearity and determine the optimal cavity critical coupling condition. With the optimized device, we demonstrate at 6 Kelvin a tunable nonlinear response from reverse saturable absorption to saturable absorption at varying pump powers, with a maximal effective nonlinear absorption coefficient up to 29.4+-5.8 cm/W (6 orders of magnitude larger than unpatterned perovskites) at 560 nm wavelength. In addition, the cavity-exciton detuning dependent device response is analyzed and well explained by a phase-space-filling model, elucidating the underlying physics and the origin of giant nonlinearity. Our study paves the way towards practical flat nonlinear optical devices with large functional areas and massive parallel operation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Engineering nonlinear activation functions for all-optical neural networks via quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-optical neural networks (AONNs) harness the wave nature of light to achieve unparalleled speed and energy efficiency for artificial intelligence tasks, outperforming their electronic counterparts. Despite their potential, the development of deep AONNs is constrained by the high optical power demands of conventional nonlinear optical processes, which limits scalability. This work introduces a novel low-power nonlinear optical activation function scheme based on a three-level quantum medium driven by two laser fields. Unlike traditional single-input, single-output activations, our design offers two-port optical nonlinear activation functions with both self- and cross-nonlinearities, making them great candidates for multi-input, multi-output networks. The approach allows precise control of nonlinear optical behavior, achieving sigmoid and rectified linear unit (ReLU)functions at ultralow power levels (~ 17 uW per neuron). Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of constructing large-scale, deep AONNs with millions of neurons powered by less than 100 W of optical power. This advancement represents a significant step toward scalable, high-speed, and energy-efficient AONNs for next-generation AI hardware.</description>

      <title>Scattering modeling by a nonlinear slab: exact solution of the full vector problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the computation of the scattering of light by a non-linear slab for conical incidence and arbitrary polarization. We consider an anisotropic slab, defined entirely by its susceptibility tensors, consequently we must consider the full vector problem. The 2-dimensional problem is reduced to a 1-dimensional problem using symmetry arguments, which is then solved by an iterative process using the finite element method. Energetic considerations are also addressed. Several numerical experiments are shown, including the incident TE and TM cases.</description>

      <title>Erbium-doped lithium niobate waveguide amplifier enhanced by an inverse-designed on-chip reflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a 3.6-cm-long erbium-doped lithium niobate waveguide amplifier enhanced by an inverse-designed on-chip reflector. Integrating the reflector at the waveguide end yielded an internal net gain of 40.5 dB, achieving a 17.3 dB gain improvement compared to a comparable reflector-free amplifier under small signal conditions. By eliminating bidirectional pumping requirements, the system complexity was reduced. These results highlight a novel strategy for optimizing integrated optical amplifiers, combining high gain with simplified architecture. The approach holds promise for advancing high-density photonic integrated systems, demonstrating the efficacy of inverse design in tailoring photonic device performance for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) are essential for high-speed and compact optoelectronic applications, yet efficient optical coupling to PIC remains a critical challenge, where minimizing insertion losses is crucial for high-performance applications. Fiber arrays are commonly used as edge couplers for PICs. In this work, we demonstrate the fabrication of semi-cylindrical channels on glass substrates using femtosecond laser micromachining for fiber arrays edge couplers. This method enables the formation of narrow, well-defined grooves in glass substrates with submicron accuracy, facilitating reliable fiber positioning for improved coupling efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for dense fiber arrays, with a narrow separation of \sim 3 {\mu}m.</description>

      <title>Feedback suppression in 405 nm superluminescent diodes via engineered scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superluminescent diodes are promising devices for applications in which low coherence, high efficiency, small foot-print and good optoelectronic integration are required. Blue emitting superluminescent diodes with good performances and easy fabrication process are sought for next generation solid state lighting devices, micro-projectors and displays. These devices are laser diodes in which the optical feedback is inhibited, and lasing action avoided. Conventional fabrication processes minimize optical feedback by ad-hoc designs, e.g. anti-reflection coating, tilted waveguide or absorber sections, requiring specific fabrication steps. In this work, we propose and demonstrate the introduction of scattering defects in the device waveguide as a method for feedback inhibition. By performing pulsed laser ablation on a commercial 405 nm GaN laser diode we demonstrate a superluminescent diode, featuring a maximum output power of 2 mW and a spectral width of 5.7 nm.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Coherent Diffractive Imaging via Titled-Incidence Multi-Rotation-Angle Fusion Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04401v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) enables lensless imaging with experimental simplicity and a flexible field of view, yet its resolution is fundamentally constrained by the Abbe diffraction limit. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Tilted-Incidence Multi-Rotation-Angle Fusion Ptychography technique. This approach leverages a tilted-incidence geometry to extend the collection angle beyond the Abbe limit, achieving up to a -fold resolution enhancement. By acquiring diffraction patterns at multiple sample rotation angles, we capture complementary spatial frequency information. A tilted-incidence multi-rotation-angle fusion ptychographic iterative engine (tmf-PIE) algorithm is then employed to integrate these datasets, enabling super-resolution image reconstruction. Additionally, this method mitigates the anisotropic resolution artifacts inherent to tilted CDI geometries. Our technique represents a novel advancement in super-resolution imaging, providing a novel alternative alongside established methods such as STED, SIM, and SMLM.</description>

      <title>A sectorial arrangement of spatially-shifted grating for composite Laguerre-Gaussian OAM beam generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first diffraction order of a planar 1D grating has a plane wavefront for a plane wave incidence. We propose an algorithm to tailor the shape of this wavefront to the desired propagation mode. The algorithm works by segmenting the 1D grating into sectors and shifting gratings in each sector along the grating vector by some fraction of the grating period. The algorithm determines the fractional shift required in each sector to impart a desired shape to the wavefront. Through simulations and experiments, we show the applicability of the design process by demonstrating the coaxial generation of one or multiple Laguerre-Gaussian orbital angular momentum beams. In addition, we demonstrate the independent regulation of relative intensities and phases of components in the generated beam.</description>

      <title>Atomic Localization Fluorescent Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution microscopy has revolutionized the imaging of complex physical and biological systems by surpassing the Abbe diffraction limit. Recent advancements, particular in single-molecular localization microscopy (SMLM), have pushed localization below nanometer precision, by applying prior knowledge of correlated fluorescence emission from single emitters. However, achieving a refinement from 1 nm to 1 Angstr\"om demands a hundred-fold increase in collected photon signal. This quadratic resource scaling imposes a fundamental barrier in SMLM, where the intense photon collection is challenged by photo-bleaching, prolonged integration times, and inherent practical constraints. Here, we break this limit by harnessing the periodic nature of the atomic lattice structure. Specifically, applying this discrete grid imaging technique (DIGIT) in a quantum emitter system, we observe an exponential collapse of localization uncertainty once surpassing the host crystal's atomic lattice constant. We further applied DIGIT to a large-scale quantum emitter array, enabling parallel positioning of each emitter through wide-field imaging. These results showcase that DIGIT unlocks a potential avenue to applications ranging from identifying solid-state quantum memories in crystals to the direct observation of optical transitions in the electronic structure of molecules.</description>

      <title>Topological Anderson Phase Transitions in Y-shaped Plasmonic Valley Metal-slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout history, all developmental trajectories of civilization - encompassing progress, creation, and innovation - have fundamentally pursued the paradigm shift 'from disorder to order'. In photonics, investigations into disordered systems have primarily focused on foundational principles governing signal diffusion and localization. This paper addresses terahertz device development by examining the dual role of disorder in photonic systems: while potentially compromising optical transmission stability, it simultaneously inspires innovative topological protection mechanisms. Building upon the symmetry-breaking induced valley-Hall topological Anderson phase transition in Y-shaped metallic structures, we achieve valley Chern number modulation through random rotation of constituent units, demonstrating progressive emergence of in-gap topological states with increasing disorder parameters and observing topological negative refraction phenomena. Furthermore, an effective Dirac two-band model is established to quantitatively characterize the evolution of bulk transport states under disorder variation. By strategically regulating disordered configurations to induce valley-Hall topological Anderson phase transitions, this research provides new pathways for overcoming critical technical challenges in terahertz devices, particularly transmission loss limitations.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional abruptly autofocusing by counter-propagating Airy pulses with radial Airy beam profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of a three-dimensional abruptly autofocusing effect by synthesizing a radially distributed Airy beam with two counter-propagating Airy pulses in time. As the wave packet propagates in a dispersive medium, the radially distributed Airy beam converges inward to the center point. Two Airy pulses counter-propagate toward each other to merge to form a high peak power pulse. As the result, the high intensity emerges abruptly as the wave packet achieves three-dimensional focusing. This autofocusing effect is believed to have potential applications such as material modification, plasma physics, nanoparticle manipulations, etc.</description>

      <title>Precision Thermo-Welding of Polymer Microspheres into Periodically Organized, Hybrid, Mechanically Rollable Coupled-Resonator Optical Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer microspherical resonators that trap light are crucial structures for on-chip and on-board integration in nanophotonic applications. Using advanced micromanipulation and thermo-welding methods, we successfully create welded polystyrene-based coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) with customized lengths, shapes, and optical characteristics. Through the thermal fusion of blue, green, and red fluorophore-doped polystyrene microspheres, multi-fluorescent cohesive units are created from dimeric to henicosameric periodic arrangements. Detailed micro-spectroscopy studies reveal CROWs' capability to support optical whispering-gallery modes. The periodic arrangements of different fluorophore-doped resonators within the CROW facilitate efficient guided transmission of light via both active and passive mechanisms in opposite directions. The welded structures exhibit mechanically driven rolling motion, confirming their integration as cohesive units. These findings highlight the versatility and performance of thermo-welded polymer microsphere-based waveguides, paving the way for scalable, low-cost photonic devices in sensing, modulation, and light guiding, emphasizing their role in future integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Design and simulation of GaSe hybrid photonic waveguides on a \b{eta}-Ga2O3 platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of a novel material platform combining Gallium Selenide (GaSe) with a \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrate and Al2O3 cladding for advanced photonic waveguides. The numerical investigation of the optical performance of GaSe-based waveguides focuses on key parameters such as power confinement factor (PCF), propagation loss, and effective mode index for both of the modes of Transverse Electric (TE) as well as Transverse Magnetic (TM). The results demonstrate that the GaSe/Al2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 waveguide exhibits excellent optical confinement, with PCF values exceeding 96% for both the TE and TM modes at a wavelength of 1.55 {\mu}m. The waveguide also shows low propagation losses, particularly for the TM mode, making it suitable for long-wavelength applications. Furthermore, the study highlights the impact of core dimensions and cladding height on waveguide performance, providing insights into optimizing the design for minimal loss and maximal efficiency that demonstrates the potential of III-VI compound-based waveguides. This treatise also focuses on the bending losses by varying the wavelength and bending radius for both of the TE and TM mode of the GaSe-based waveguide. The waveguide shows the reflecting loss of -25.08 dB and transmission loss of -5.97 dB for the bending radius of 2 {\mu}m and wavelength of 1.55 {\mu}m. This work underscores the potential of GaSe-based waveguides on a \b{eta}-Ga2O3 platform for next-generation photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Taming Flat Bands with Breathing Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands have become a pillar of modern condensed matter physics and photonics owing to the vanishing group velocity and diverging density of states. Here, we present a paradigmatic scheme to construct arbitrary flat bands on demand by introducing a new type breathing superlattice, where both the number and spectral positions of isolated flat bands can be continuously tailored by simply controlling the breathing strength. Microscopically, the momentum-independent interband scatterings near the band edge protect them robust against weak intra-cell disorder. By dimensional reduction, we establish a duality between the one-dimensional (1D) breathing superlattice and the 2D Harper-Hofstadter model, where cascade flat bands naturally emerge as the different orders of Landau levels in the weak magnetic flux limit. As a proof of concept, photonic flat bands at optical frequencies are experimentally demonstrated with all-dielectric photonic crystal slabs. Finally, we generalize our scheme to 2D systems to realize partial and omnidirectional flat bands, and discuss the achievement of high-quality factors. Our findings shed new light on the manipulation of flat bands with high band flatness and large usable bandwidth, paving the way for the development of advanced optical devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamic fabrication method of SNAP microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) technology has demonstrated the record subangstrom fabrication precision of optical microresonators and resonant photonic circuits at the optical fiber surface. However, fabrication errors arising from fluctuations of temperature, inscription parameters, alignment inconsistencies, and other factors did not allow researchers to achieve the subangstrom precision without sophisticated postprocessing. Here we show that the key fabrication method of SNAP structures -- CO$_2$ laser beam optical fiber annealing -- suffers from significant fiber displacements which may introduce a few percent fabrication errors. To suppress the effects of misalignment, we develop a dynamic fabrication method employing a translating beam exposure and demonstrate its excellent precision. The effective fiber radius variation of $\sim 10 $nm is introduced with an error of $\sim 0.1 $angstrom. We suggest that the remaining fabrication errors can be attributed to laser power fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Parametrically driven Kerr temporal soliton crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the excitation, dynamics of parametrically driven soliton crystals and their resulting frequency combs in doubly resonant cavities with quadratic and cubic nonlinearities. We demonstrate that soliton crystal states act as strong attractors, where pump depletion and pump phase play crucial roles in their stabilization by ensuring equal soliton spacing and coherence. The number of solitons is primarily determined by driving strength. Additionally, we identify a novel nonlinear state in parametric soliton crystals in which circulating solitons periodically alternate their intensities and group velocities, a phenomenon we term the soliton-pursuing states. Furthermore, due to the phase-selective nature of the optical parametric process, we show how different configurations of soliton phases influence the optical frequency combs, which may enable generating odd harmonic combs.</description>

      <title>Crossed Ponderomotive Lenses for Spherical Aberration Correction in Electron Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article evaluates the lens characteristics of a non-rotationally symmetric electron lens based on a ponderomotive potential (i.e., a ponderomotive lens) formed by intersecting one or more optical beams perpendicular to an electron beam. Based on geometric optics, design formulas are derived for the focal length and general spherical aberration coefficients of specifically crossed ponderomotive lenses. Numerical calculations demonstrate that a pair of these crossed ponderomotive lenses can effectively correct spherical aberration in the objective lens of an electron microscope. Unlike rotationally symmetric ponderomotive lenses, which require the optical beam to be coaxially aligned with the electron beam, the crossed ponderomotive lens avoids the need to place optical mirrors and lenses directly on the beam axis. Thus, it offers practical advantages in designing and building electron optical instruments and contributes to system miniaturization. With lens properties similar to multipole lenses, the proposed crossed ponderomotive lens is expected to facilitate diverse developments in electron optical systems incorporating ponderomotive potentials.</description>

      <title>Achieving precision in measuring birefringence characteristics of a periodically-poled Lithium Niobate waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The refraction of light in an optical medium is not only a subject of fundamental interest, but the refractive index also plays a crucial role in applications involving integrated and non-linear optics. One such application is photon-pair generation in waveguides with second-order non-linearity. The spectral properties of the generated photon pairs are governed by the effective group refractive indices of the interacting modes, which normally are calculated via Sellmeier's equations for bulk crystals. However, in integrated optics, the effective group refractive indices experienced by the propagating modes can differ from those in bulk materials. Therefore, we present an accurate, in-situ measurement technique for determining the birefringence characteristics of a structure with high reflective end facets by performing a Fourier transformation of the light transmission spectrum and apply this method to a periodically-poled Lithium Niobate waveguide resonator in the telecom wavelength range. We directly predict important spectral figures of merit of the photon-pair generation process, which depend on the optical path length difference that can be resolved with a high precision of more than 16 standard deviations.</description>

      <title>Real-time tuneable bright bonding plasmonic modes in Ga nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise control of nanogaps is crucial for plasmonic nanoassemblies, where plasmon hybridization is highly sensitive to gap size and geometry. This sensitivity enables fine-tuning of the resonance wavelength and near-field enhancement, offering the potential for advanced optical applications. However, conventional lithographic techniques for gap modulation are constrained to discrete values and face challenges in achieving nanometer order of separations. Such limitations hinder the comprehensive study of plasmon coupling across varying interaction regimes. Overcoming these challenges is essential for advancing nanoplasmonic research and its practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate a tuneable plasmonic device in which real-time tunability of this hybridization mode is achieved via manipulation of the inter-droplet gap of liquid metal nanoparticles by macroscopic physical deformation. In particular, we show that the optical spectra obtained from the sample shift towards higher energy on the application of a linear strain, resulting in an increase of inter-droplet gaps leading to a direct probing of the bright modes in situ. Our method thus offers a novel means of exploring the fundamental concept of real-time tuneable plasmon hybridization as well as tuning of nanoparticle assembly with any desired gap in a controlled manner.</description>

      <title>Analog phase-sensitive time-reversal of optically-carried radiofrequency signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving low-latency time-reversal of broadband radiofrequency signals is crucial for reliable communications in dynamic, uncontrolled environments. However, existing approaches are either digitally assisted -- making broadband extension challenging -- or limited to amplitude modulation. In this work, we report the very first experimental realization of a fully analog, phase-preserving time-reversal architecture for optically-carried radiofrequency signals. The method exploits the exceptional coherence properties of rare-earth ion-doped materials, and leverages the well-established photon echo mechanism, widely used in quantum technologies. While our demonstration is conducted with a modest bandwidth, we identify the fundamental cause of this limitation and propose solutions for future scalability.</description>

Abstract: Chiral optical forces present an exciting avenue into the separation of enantiomers in an all-optical fashion. In this work, we explore via numerical simulations and analytical calculations the feasibility of the separation of chiral molecules by using guided light in a dielectric slot waveguide. Our results suggest that it is possible to separate [6]helicene enantiomers suspended in gas within several hours when applying optical powers of 100 mW.</description>

      <title>Topological links and knots of speckled light mediated by coherence singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Links and knots are exotic topological structures that have garnered significant interest across multiple branches of natural sciences. Coherent links and knots, such as those constructed by phase or polarization singularities of coherent light, have been observed in various three-dimensional optical settings. However, incoherent links and knots - knotted or connected lines of coherence singularities - arise from a fundamentally different concept. They are hidden in the statistic properties of a randomly fluctuating field, making their presence often elusive or undetectable. Here, we theoretically construct and experimentally demonstrate such topological entities of incoherent light. By leveraging a state-of-the-art incoherent modal-decomposition scheme, we unveil incoherent topological structures from fluctuating light speckles, including Hopf links and Trefoil knots of coherence singularities that are robust against coherence and intensity fluctuations. Our work is applicable to diverse wave systems where incoherence or practical coherence is prevalent, and may pave the way for design and implementation of statistically-shaped topological structures for various applications such as high-dimensional optical information encoding and optical communications.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Bulk-Radiation Correspondence in Radiative Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological characteristics of energy bands in crystalline systems are encapsulated in the Berry curvature of the bulk Bloch states. In photonic crystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a non-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of how the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses. Within this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field polarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the crystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the honeycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk topology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is contingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence completely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can hold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational symmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys of the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on generalized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with localized couplings and Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>A Telecentric Offset Reflective Imaging System (TORIS) for Terahertz Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging has emerged as a promising technology in medical diagnostics due to its non-ionizing radiation and high sensitivity to water content. However, conventional THz imaging systems face limitations such as slow mechanical scanning, restricted field of view, and poor telecentricity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Telecentric Offset Reflective Imaging System (TORIS), a novel dual-mirror scanning design optimized for high-speed, distortion-free imaging. The system employs a telecentric f-theta lens and is validated using ray tracing and physical optics simulations. It achieves uniform resolution across a 50 mm x 50 mm field of view without the need for mechanical translation stages. Broadband spectral imaging of a USAF resolution test target across WR-2.2 (325-500 GHz) and WR-1.5 (500-700 GHz) frequency bands demonstrates consistent beam focus and minimal distortion, with a maximum deviation of 2.7 degrees from normal incidence and a beam waist of 2.1 lambda at the field edge in the WR-1.5 band. The system's sensitivity to hydration dynamics is further validated through imaging of wet tissue paper, capturing temporal changes in water content. In vivo imaging of human skin after capsaicin patch application reveals localized hydration variations due to biochemical response and adhesive removal. These findings confirm the system's potential for real-time hydration sensing and dermatological evaluation. TORIS sets a new benchmark in THz imaging, with applications in clinical diagnostics, wound assessment, and material characterization.</description>

      <title>Two-photon resonance single ionization of the K-shell of an atomic ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical structure and absolute values of the generalized cross-section of the two-photon resonance single ionization of the K-shell of a heavy neon-like ion of an iron atom (Fe$^{16+}$) were theoretically predicted. A pronounced resonant subthreshold structure of the generalized cross-section and the effect of destructive quantum interference of the probability amplitudes of radiation transitions into virtual excited states of p-symmetry have been established. The presence of a valence 2p$^6$-shell in the ion backbone causes the production of an additional giant resonance of the generalized cross-section as the effect of the "reverse" hard X-ray emission of K$\alpha$-type 1s$^2$(2s$^2$)2p$^5$ + $\hbar\omega \to$ 1s(2s$^2$)2p$^6$. A scheme of the proposed experiment with linearly polarized X-ray photons is presented to verify the theoretical results obtained.</description>

Abstract: In 1924, Einstein received a short manuscript in the mail from the Indian physicist S.N. Bose. He quickly translated Bose's manuscript to German and submitted it to Zeitschrift f\"ur Physik. Within a few weeks, Einstein presented his own findings (using a generalization of Bose's counting method) to a session of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Whereas Bose had suggested a new counting method for the quanta of the electromagnetic field -- one that yielded Planck's blackbody radiation formula -- Einstein applied Bose's method to an ideal monoatomic gas. Shortly afterward, Einstein presented to the Academy a follow-up paper in which he described the Bose-Einstein condensation for the first time. The present paper describes some of the fascinating issues that Einstein struggled with as he attempted to unify the quantum-statistical properties of matter with those of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Quantum Key Distribution with Qubit-like States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols most often use two conjugate bases in order to verify the security of the quantum channel. In the majority of protocols, these bases are mutually unbiased to one another, which is to say they are formed from balanced superpositions of the entire set of states in the opposing basis. Here, we introduce a high-dimensional QKD protocol using qubit-like states, referred to as Fourier-qubits (or $\textit{F}$-qubits). In our scheme, each $\textit{F}$-qubit is a superposition of only two computational basis states with a relative phase that can take $d$ distinct values, where $d$ is the dimension of the computational basis. This non-mutually unbiased approach allows us to bound the information leaked to an eavesdropper, maintaining security in high-dimensional quantum systems despite the states' seemingly two-dimensional nature. By simplifying state preparation and measurement, our protocol offers a practical alternative for secure high-dimensional quantum communications. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol for a noisy high-dimensional QKD channel using the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom of light and discuss the potential benefits for encoding in other degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmonic generation in underdense spatially homogeneous plasma is generally expected to be inefficient: in an unmagnetized uniform plasma the fundamental and its harmonics cannot be phase-matched, resulting in third-harmonic generation efficiencies of no more than $10^{-5}$. Here, we describe how a strong uniform magnetic field allows phase-matched harmonic generation in constant-density plasma. We derive phase-matching relations for Type I and Type II second-, third-, and fourth-harmonic generation, and confirm these relations with particle-in-cell simulations. These simulations show that for weakly relativistic femtosecond pulses the efficiencies of second-, third-, and fourth-harmonic generation can reach at least 70%, 14%, and 2% respectively. Additionally, if driven by a two-color beam, third harmonic generation is found to be over 70% efficient and fourth harmonic generation is found to be over 30% efficient.</description>

      <title>Spreading dynamics in the Hatano-Nelson model with disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is the accumulation of eigenstates at the boundaries, reflecting the system's nonreciprocity. Introducing disorder leads to a competition between the skin effect and Anderson localization, giving rise to the skin-Anderson transition. Here, we investigate wave packet spreading in the disordered Hatano-Nelson model and uncover distinct dynamical behaviors across different regimes. In the clean limit, transport is unidirectionally ballistic ({\Delta}x ~ t) due to nonreciprocity. For weak disorder, where skin and Anderson-localized modes coexist, transport transitions from ballistic at early times to superdiffusive ({\Delta}x ~ t^{2/3}) at long times. In the deeply Anderson-localized regime, initial diffusion ({\Delta}x ~ t^{1/2}) eventually gives way to superdiffusive spreading. We examine how these scaling behaviors emerge from the system's spectral properties and eigenstate localization behaviors. Our work unveils the rich dynamics driven by nonreciprocity and disorder in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence in non-chiral non-unitary quantum dynamics of single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The breakdown of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, a cornerstone of topological physics, is one of counter-intuitive phenomena in non-Hermitian systems, that is deeply rooted in symmetry. In particular, preserved chiral symmetry is one of the key ingredients, which plays a pivotal role in determining non-Hermitian topology. Nevertheless, chiral symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian systems disrupts topological protection, modifies topological invariants, and substantially reshapes spectral and edge-state behavior. The corresponding fundamentally important bulk-boundary correspondence thus needs to be drastically reconstructed. However, it has so far eluded experimental efforts. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system with chiral symmetry breaking in discrete-time non-chiral non-unitary quantum walks of single photons. Through constructing a domain-wall configuration, we experimentally observe the photon localization at the interface of domain-wall structure, clearly indicating the presence of the topological edge mode. The appearance of that matches excellently with the prediction of our introduced non-chiral non-Bloch topological invariants pair. Our work thus unequivocally builds the non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence as a general principle for studying topological physics in non-Hermitian systems with chiral symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>An all optical broadband tunable quantum frequency shifter</title>

Abstract: A frequency shifter of the photon is a key component for frequency-multiplexed high-capacity quantum communications and frequency-encoded quantum computation. Existed methods for shifting the frequency of a photon based on electro-optical, or acousto-optical effect, however, suffer the limited frequency shift up to a few hundreds of GHz, furthermore, high-quality micro-wave electronics are required. The frequency of a photon can also be shifted with the frequency difference equal to the frequency of pump laser by using an all optical-wave-mixing approach, which is usually about tens of THz. So, there is a big frequency shifting gap between these methods. Here, we propose a new scheme of a quantum frequency shifter based on an all-optical wave-mixing process, which can theoretically achieve a frequency shift ranging from GHz to a few THz, therefore bridging the gap. As a principle of poof, by using two pump beams in a three-wave mixing cascading process, a heralded single photon is frequency-shifted more than 400GHz, and the shift can be tuned continuously over broadband by changing the frequency difference between two pump lasers. Besides, high coincidence to accidence ratio between the shifted photons and the heralded photon indicates the preserve of quantum properties. The present quantum frequency shifter is in analog to an electro-optical based shifter, but with much broader tuning ability. Our all-optical quantum frequency shifter will become a fundamental building block for high-speed quantum communication networks and frequency domain photonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum walk with coherent multiple translations induces fast quantum gate operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks with one-dimensional translational symmetry are important for quantum algorithms, where the speed-up of the diffusion speed can be reached if long-range couplings are added. Our work studies a scheme of a ring under the strong resonant modulation that can support discrete-time quantum walk including coherent multiple long-range translations in a natural way along synthetic frequency dimension. These multiple translation paths are added in a coherent way, which makes the walker evolve under the topological band. Therein, not only the fast diffusion speed is expected, but more importantly, we find that single quantum gate operations can be performed in the quasi-momentum space. In particular, we show the arbitrary single-qubit state preparation and an example of CNOT two-qubit gate with only one time step, dramarically increasing quantum algorithms. Our study uses a single ring to provide fast quantum gate operations based on coherent multiple path quantum walk, which may provide unique designs for efficient quantum operations on photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Entangling two Rydberg Superatoms via Heralded Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heralded storage of photons is crucial for advancing quantum networks. Previous realizations have primarily relied on single atoms strongly coupled to optical cavities. In this work, we present the experimental realization of heralded storage using a Rydberg superatom, a mesoscopic atomic ensemble operating in the strong blockade regime. In our approach, an input photon is initially stored in the superatom via electromagnetically induced transparency. Subsequently, a second photon is emitted conditioned on the success of the first photon's storage. Due to the collectively enhanced interaction, both the storage and the emission of the herald photon can be rather efficient in principle. As a demonstration of this technique, we use it to entangle two remote Rydberg superatoms. This method obviates the need for an intermediate node, which is commonly employed in traditional interference-based remote entanglement schemes. Our results showcase the potential of performing cavity-QED-like experiments with Rydberg superatoms. This work opens pathways for numerous applications in quantum networks and linear optical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Intensity Correlation Measurement to Simulate Two-body BICs and Probe Nonlinear Discrete Breathers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Hanbury Brown-Twiss spatial intensity correlations in femtosecond laser-fabricated photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices using coherent input states with tunable phases. By mapping intensity correlations to the two-body quantum walk, we experimentally simulate edge bound states in the continuum (BICs) of two indistinguishable bosons. These two-body edge BICs show remarkable robustness in the presence of disorder. We then discuss how intensity correlations can capture the dynamics of two identical fermions for which BICs do not exist on the same edge of the lattice. The localization of intensity correlation, observed in the linear regime, persists at weak nonlinearity due to the formation of long-lived edge breathers -- spatially localized nonlinear states with oscillating intensity along the propagation distance. For stronger nonlinearities, localized edge states are not formed for a range of phases, destroying the localization of the intensity correlation. Our results highlight the interplay of band structure, initial state, and nonlinearity influencing transport and intensity correlations.</description>

      <title>Unlocking new dimensions in photonic computing using optical Skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16311v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decline of Moore's law coupled with the growing dominance of artificial intelligence has recently motivated research into photonic computing as a high-bandwidth, low-power strategy to accelerate digital electronics. However, modern-day photonic computing strategies are predominantly analog, making them susceptible to noise and intrinsically difficult to scale. The optical Skyrmion offers a route to overcoming these limitations through digitization in the form of a discrete topological number that can be assigned to the analog optical field. Apart from an intrinsic robustness against perturbations, optical Skyrmions represent a new dimension that has yet to be exploited for photonic computing, namely spatially varying polarization. Here, we propose a method of performing perturbation-resilient integer arithmetic with this new dimension of optical Skyrmions through passive optical components and present experimental evidence demonstrating its feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such discrete mathematical operations have been directly achieved using optical Skyrmions without external energy input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waveguide design is crucial in developing efficient light delivery systems, requiring meticulous material selection, precise manufacturing, and rigorous performance optimization, including dispersion engineering. Here, we introduce universal diffractive waveguide designs that can match the performance of any conventional dielectric waveguide and achieve various functionalities. Optimized using deep learning, our diffractive waveguide designs can be cascaded to each other to form any desired length and are comprised of transmissive diffractive surfaces that permit the propagation of desired guided modes with low loss and high mode purity. In addition to guiding the targeted modes along the propagation direction through cascaded diffractive units, we also developed various waveguide components and introduced bent diffractive waveguides, rotating the direction of mode propagation, as well as spatial and spectral mode filtering and mode splitting diffractive waveguide designs, and mode-specific polarization-maintaining diffractive waveguides, showcasing the versatility of this platform. This diffractive waveguide framework was experimentally validated in the terahertz (THz) spectrum using 3D-printed diffractive layers to selectively pass certain spatial modes while rejecting others. Diffractive waveguides can be scaled to operate at different wavelengths, including visible and infrared parts of the spectrum, without the need for material dispersion engineering, providing an alternative to traditional waveguide components. This advancement will have potential applications in telecommunications, imaging, sensing and spectroscopy, among others.</description>

      <title>Shannon Entropy Helps Optimize the Performance of a Frequency-Multiplexed Extreme Learning Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowing the dynamics of neuromorphic photonic schemes would allow their optimization for controlled data-processing capability at possibly minimized energy consumption levels. In nonlinear substrates such as optical fibers or semiconductors, these dynamics can widely vary depending on each optical input encoded with information to process and are in general difficult to estimate. Thus, other approaches are required to optimize the schemes. Using a frequency-multiplexed fiber-based Extreme Learning Machine as an example for a classification task, I use Shannon entropy for optical power and introduce Shannon entropy for optical phase and spectrum, all averaged only over a small subset of the dataset to process. I show that the maximum and upper moderate optical power and phase entropies relate to the best data-processing capability of the Machine and, thus, can be used to find optimal system parameters such as fiber length, input power, and group-velocity dispersion in a more time-efficient manner than running numerical simulations emulating the scheme. Shannon entropy of the spectrum provides the information for what parameter space broadest possible frequency combs can be expected and is interesting from the perspective of frequency comb and supercontinuum generation. The introduced entropies are general and can be easily applied to describe and optimize other neuromorphic-photonic or nonlinear-optics schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Snell's law dictates the phenomenon of light refraction at the interface between two media. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, arbitrary programming of light refraction through an engineered material where the direction of the output wave can be set independently for different directions of the input wave, covering arbitrarily selected permutations of light refraction between the input and output apertures. Formed by a set of cascaded transmissive layers with optimized phase profiles, this refractive function generator (RFG) spans only a few tens of wavelengths in the axial direction. In addition to monochrome RFG designs, we also report wavelength-multiplexed refractive functions, where a distinct refractive function is implemented at each wavelength through the same engineered material volume, i.e., the permutation of light refraction is switched from one desired function to another function by changing the illumination wavelength. As an experimental proof of concept, we demonstrate negative refractive function at the terahertz part of the spectrum using a 3D-printed material. Arbitrary programming of refractive functions enables new design capabilities for optical materials, devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics in Multiple Quantum Well P-I-N Photodiodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum well (QW) structures are widely used in lasers, semiconductor optical amplifiers, modulators, enabling their monolithic integration on the same substrate. As optoelectronic systems evolve to meet the growing bandwidth demands in the terahertz regime, a deep understanding of ultrafast carrier dynamics in QW structures becomes essential. We introduce a comprehensive model to analyze the ultrafast dynamics of interband photo-excited carriers in QW p-i-n structures and to calculate their frequency response. This model characterizes the entire photocarrier transport process, including carrier escape from QWs and movement across heterojunction interfaces. Additionally, we outline theoretical methods for calculating carrier escape times from both QWs and heterojunction interfaces. Using a GaAs/AlGaAs QW p-i-n structure as a case study, we discuss the effects of carrier escape times from QWs and heterojunction interfaces, as well as carrier transit time through the intrinsic region, on the frequency response of QW p-i-n structures.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a monolithically integrated terahertz optoelectronics (MITO) platform that uses quantum well (QW) structures to enable tunable terahertz signal generation and detection on a single chip. Through photomixing in QW PIN photodiodes, the MITO platform achieves terahertz generation and detection with substantially enhanced power efficiency and sensitivity over previous devices. By integrating semiconductor optical amplifiers, lasers, modulators, filters, demultiplexers, and other passive optical components with photomixers using commercially available photonic integrated circuit foundry processes, this platform supports the development of compact, scalable terahertz systems capable of high-speed data transfer, spectroscopy, and hyperspectral imaging. This advancement positions terahertz technology for widespread use, facilitating practical applications across remote sensing, communications, and medical diagnostics within portable devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we apply a thermodynamical approach to elucidate the primary constraints on the energy scaling of dissipative solitons (DS). We rely on the adiabatic theory of strongly chirped DS and define the DS energy scaling in terms of dissipative soliton resonance (DSR). Three main experimentally verifiable signatures identify a transition to DSR: i) growth of a Lorentzian spike at the centrum of the DS spectrum, which resembles a spectral condensation in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), ii) saturation of the spectrum broadening, and iii) asymptotical DS stretching. We connect the DSR breakup with three critical factors: i) decoupling of two correlation scales inherent in strongly chirped DS, ii) resulting rise of the DS entropy with energy, which provokes its disintegration, and iii) transition to a nonequilibrium phase, which is characterized by negative temperature. The breakup results in multiple stable DSs with lower energy. Theoretical results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data from a Kerr-lens mode-locked Cr$^{2+}$:ZnS chirped-pulse oscillator (CPO) that paves the way for optimizing high-energy femtosecond pulse generation in solid-state CPO and all-normal-dispersion fiber lasers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface of metal nanoparticles can support plasmonic excitations. These excitations dramatically amplify the electric field of incident light (by several orders of magnitude), potentially ionizing the irradiated nanoparticles in a strong field regime. Under specific conditions, a resonant enhancement of the electric field \textit{inside} a hollow nanoshell can be achieved with a laser pulse. We propose high-intensity laser irradiation of heavy water (${\rm D_2 O}$)-filled metal nanoshells to induce nuclear fusion via this enhancement. In this ``plasmonic confinement'' setup, deuteron nuclei are accelerated by the oscillating electric field within the nanoshell. We estimate that the characteristic momenta of the colliding deuterons reach approximately 10 MeV. This corresponds to an effective kinetic energy equivalent to that of deuterons in a thermonuclear plasma at temperatures around 25 keV (approximately $10^8$K). A laser with a peak pulse intensity of roughly 1 atomic unit is sufficient to generate the strong electric fields required for this plasmonic acceleration. We estimate the expected fusion rate and discuss the feasibility of a fusion reactor based on this proposed scheme.</description>

Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) phase approach-curves have significant potential for nanoscale material characterization, however, the availability of robust datasets and automated analysis tools has been limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for material identification using a high-dimensional dataset consisting of AFM phase approach-curves collected from five distinct materials: silicon, silicon dioxide, platinum, silver, and gold. Each measurement comprises 50 phase values obtained at progressively increasing tip-sample distances, resulting in 50x50x50 voxel images that represent phase variations at different depths. Using this dataset, we compare k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), and feedforward neural network (FNN) methods for material segmentation. Our results indicate that the FNN provides the highest accuracy and F1 score, outperforming more traditional approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of these segmented maps by generating simulated scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) images, highlighting how AFM phase approach-curves can be leveraged to produce detailed, predictive tools for nanoscale optical analysis.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Waves Determined by the Tangential Electric Field of Incident Plane Wave at a Charged and Lossy Planar Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the new decomposition of wave vectors and electric fields with respect to a charged planar interface between two isotropic lossy media, the incident, reflected, and refracted plane waves are found to be only determined by the tangential electric field of the incident plane wave. The complex wave vectors and their corresponding complex angles of the incident, reflected and refracted waves are easily calculated from the tangential wave vector based on the phase matching condition and Snell's law. The relationship between two different schemes of electric field compositions is interpreted and the electric field magnitudes of the incident, reflected and refracted waves were deduced from the tangential electric field magnitude of the incident wave where the tangential boundary condition of electric fields is directly utilized. The time-averaged Poynting vectors and the surface Joule heat density at the interface are also given to demonstrate the validity of our proposed methodology by the energy balance condition together with a specific example. It is also found that the external surface charges with a practical surface charge density have little effect on the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves since the surface conductivity of interface is negligibly small. Our work opens a new and fast route for calculating the reflected and transmitted waves at a charged and lossy planar interface without the need to perform the traditional polarization decomposition of arbitrarily polarized incident plane waves.</description>

      <title>Effective Mode Description for Macroscopic Fabry P\'{e}rot Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an effective modes formalism to describe how the quasi-continuum of photonic modes in an optical cavity effectively behaves in the strong light-matter coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics. By expressing these effective modes, we are able to show that the mode volumes of these effective modes are independent of the physical area of the Fabry-P\'erot cavity mirrors. Further, our theoretical framework shows that the photonic density of state for a Fabry-P\'erot exhibits a sharp peak at the normal incidence and is quality factor dependent. These results provide a possible explanation for the recently discovered experimental phenomenon in vibrational polaritons, where chemical reactivities can only be modified if the molecules are coupled in resonance to the normal-incidence mode in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity.</description>

      <title>A Trade-Off Between Path Entanglement and Quantum Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement often increases quantum measurement schemes' sensitivity. However, we find that in precision measurements with zero-mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed states, entanglement between different paths degrades measurement sensitivity. We prove an inverse relationship between entanglement entropy and sensitivity for measurements of single-mode phase shifts in multimode systems and for phase shifts on both modes in two-mode systems. In the two-mode case, which models devices such as interferometers, we find that entanglement strongly degrades differential phase sensitivity. Finally, we show that minimizing entanglement between paths maximizes the phase sensitivity of $N$-mode systems with zero-mean Gaussian state inputs.</description>

      <title>What Bohmian mechanic says about arrival times of 1D vacuum squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the time of arrival probability distribution of a quantum particle using the Bohmian formalism. The pilot-wave is given by the wave function of the one dimensional vacuum squeezed state but written in the Schr\"odinger representation. We made use of the unitary representation of the symplectic group in the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. The solution to the Bohmian equations are analytical function thus allowing for a closed expression of the time of arrival distribution which differs from the counterparts in the standard quantum mechanics formulation.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Robust entangled photon generation by Floquet-engineered two-colour pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters driven by resonant two-photon excitation are a leading source for deterministically generated entangled photon pairs, essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. However, conventional resonant schemes are highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional experimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies. Here, we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly improved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified using a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving: ultrafast all-optical Floquet engineering. This is achieved by employing two strongly and symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses, whose superposition generates a stroboscopic Hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and biexciton states. Moreover, a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob, introducing an effective magnetic field that concentrates the Bloch sphere trajectory at the biexciton state for a wide range of parameters, making biexciton preparation particularly robust. Experimentally, we achieve a biexciton occupation exceeding 96% and preserve photon-pair entanglement with a fidelity of 93.4%. Our scheme highlights the great impact of Floquet-engineered multicolour excitation protocols for on-demand quantum light sources.</description>
