      <title>Ground States of the Mean-Field Spin Glass with 3-Spin Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use heuristic optimization methods in extensive computations to determine with low systematic error ground state configurations of the mean-field $p$-spin glass model with $p=3$. Here, all possible triplets in a system of $N$ Ising spins are connected with a bond. This model has been of recent interest, since it exhibits the ``overlap gap condition'', which should make it prohibitive to find ground states asymptotically with local search methods when compared, for instance, with the $p=2$ case better-known as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model (SK). Indeed, it proves more costly to find good approximations for $p=3$ than for SK, even for our heuristic. Compared to SK, the ground-state behavior for $p=3$ is quite distinct also in other ways. For SK, finite-size corrections for large system sizes $N\to\infty$ of both, the ensemble average over ground state energy densities and the width of their distribution, vary anomalously with non-integer exponents. In the $p=3$ case here, the energy density and its distribution appear to scale with $\ln N/N$ and $1/N$ corrections, respectively. The distribution itself is consistent with a Gumbel form. Even more stark is the contrast for the bond-diluted case, where SK has shown previously a notable variation of the anomalous corrections exponent with the bond density, while for $p=3$ no such variation is found here. Hence, for the 3-spin model, all measured corrections scale the same as for the random energy model (REM), corresponding to $p=\infty$. This would suggest that all $p$-spin models with $p\geq3$ exhibit the same ground-state corrections as in REM.</description>

      <title>Random Quantum Circuits with Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal (TR) symmetry is crucial for understanding a wide range of physical phenomena, and plays a key role in constraining fundamental particle interactions and in classifying phases of quantum matter. In this work, we introduce an ensemble of random quantum circuits that are representative of the dynamics of generic TR-invariant many-body quantum systems. We derive a general statistical mechanics model describing entanglement, many-body quantum chaos and quantum information dynamics in such TR-invariant circuits. As an example of application of our formalism, we study the universal properties of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in monitored TR-invariant systems, with measurements performed in a TR-invariant basis. We find that TR-invariance of the unitary part of the dynamics does not affect the universality class, unless measurement outcomes are post-selected to satisfy the global TR-invariance of each quantum trajectory. We confirm these predictions numerically, and find, for both generic and Clifford-based evolutions, novel critical exponents in the case of ``strong'', i.e. global TR-invariance where each quantum trajectory is TR-invariant.</description>

      <title>Localization of Dirac modes in a finite temperature SU(2) Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-lying Dirac modes become localized at the finite-temperature transition in QCD and other gauge theories, indicating a strong connection between localization and deconfinement. This phenomenon can be understood through the "sea/islands" picture: in the deconfined phase, modes become trapped on "islands" of Polyakov loop fluctuations within a "sea" of ordered Polyakov loops. To test the universality of the "sea/islands" mechanism, we investigate whether changes in the localization properties of low modes occur across other thermal transitions where the Polyakov loop becomes ordered, beyond the usual deconfinement transition. The fixed-length SU(2)-Higgs model is appropriate for this study. After mapping out the phase diagram, we find that low Dirac modes become localized in the deconfined and Higgs phases, where the Polyakov loop is ordered. However, localization is absent in the confined phase. These findings confirm the "sea/islands" picture of localization.</description>

      <title>Duality breaking, mobility edges, and the connection between topological Aubrey-Andr\'e and quantum Hall insulators in atomic wires with fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the Aubry-Andr{\'e} model lacks mobility edges due to its energy-independent self-duality but may exhibit edge states. When duality is broken, we show that mobility regions arise and non-trivial topological phases emerge. By varying the degree of duality breaking, we identify mobility regions and establish a connection between Aubry-Andr{\'e} atomic wires with fermions and quantum Hall systems for a family of Hamiltonians that depends on the relative phase of laser fields, viewed as a synthetic dimension. Depending on the filling factor and the degree of duality breaking, we find three classes of non-trivial phases: conventional topological insulator, conventional topological Aubry-Andr{\'e} insulator, and unconventional (hybrid) topological Aubry-Andr{\'e} insulator. Finally, we discuss appropriate Chern numbers that illustrate the classification of topological phases of localized fermions in atomic wires.</description>

      <title>A simplified method for full-wave simulation of metamaterials: utilizing near-field decoupling technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the electromagnetic properties of large-scale, complex metamaterial structures demands significant time and memory resources. If these large-scale structures can be divided into smaller, simpler components, the overall cost of studying all the smaller structures could be much lower than directly simulating the entire structure. Unfortunately, decoupling complex structures has been challenging due to the unclear mechanisms of near-field coupling in metamaterials. In this paper, we identify that the key to understanding near-field coupling in metamaterials lies in evanescent wave interactions, which can be captured through full-wave simulations. Our findings suggest that by accounting for the influence of evanescent waves, it becomes possible to analytically decouple and then recouple structures, even when the types of metamaterial structures vary. Building on this insight, we successfully decomposed complex structures into multiple groups of simpler components. By studying these simpler components, the electromagnetic properties of the entire structure can be calculated analytically. This decoupling method dramatically reduces the computation time or memory required for research into the electromagnetic properties of metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking Dynamics in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a novel tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is first broken and then restored while in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, aligning with the concept of quantum thermalization. Entanglement asymmetry growth exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry displays two qualitatively different behaviors. Furthermore, quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the presence of weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic limits and approximate message-passing for high-dimensional time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional time series appear in many scientific setups, demanding a nuanced approach to model and analyze the underlying dependence structure. However, theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signals. In this contribution, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm and show that, despite a lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength Localisation in Disordered Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators and their material parameters are perturbed randomly. We elucidate the mechanism of wave localisation in such systems. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism, make precise the notions of bandgap and localised eigenmodes, study their stabilities with respect to fluctuations in the system, and highlight the importance of defect hybridisation and level repulsion in creating localised eigenmodes for a given arrangement of the resonators by randomly changing their material parameters. We also introduce a method of localised eigenmode prediction based on the discrete Green function of the disordered system of resonators and show the existence of hybridised bound eigenmodes in disordered systems where local translation invariance is broken.</description>
