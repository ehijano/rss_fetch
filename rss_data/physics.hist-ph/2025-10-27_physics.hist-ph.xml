      <title>Philip Warren Anderson</title>

Abstract: Philip Warren Anderson was a pioneering theoretical physicist whose work fundamentally shaped our understanding of complex systems. Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 for his groundbreaking research on localization and magnetism, yet he did so much more. His work on magnetism included antiferromagnetism, superexchange, the Kondo problem and local magnetic moments in metals. Anderson pointed out the importance of disorder through his work on localization, non-crystalline solids and spin glasses. In superconductivity, he is known for the dirty superconductor theorem, showing the gauge-invariance of the BCS theory, his study of flux creep, and for his collaboration with experimentalists to realize the Josephson effect. Anderson's resonating valence bond theory may yet play an important role in high temperature superconductivity. Anderson was also fascinated by broken symmetry, and he laid the theoretical groundwork for what is now known as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, showing how gauge bosons can acquire mass - an insight that played a foundational role in the Standard Model of particle physics. In his seminal "More is Different" paper, Anderson argued that the collective emergent phenomena that arise in complex interacting systems cannot be deduced from their fundamental parts. Anderson's legacy endures not only through the lasting impact of his scientific work but also through his influence on generations of physicists who continue to explore the rich landscape of collective behavior in nature.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference and the Limits of Separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory implies, and empirical evidence confirms, that while particles $\textit{can}$ exhibit wave-like behavior in interferometric experiments, this behavior is so limited as $\textit{not}$ to allow for third- and higher-order interference. The article at hand shows that this possibility-impossibility structure suggests the universal validity of a principle that regulates statistical correlations between spatiotemporally localized events, $\textit{independently}$ of the nature of the objects that may or may not partake in these events. Roughly, the said principle mandates that $\textit{any}$ joint influence of $m$ mutually spacelike separated events on $\textit{another}$ event, be such, that it can be separated by $\textit{at least}$ $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$ mediating events, and in some cases, by $\textit{no more}$ than $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$ mediating events. The structure of quantum interference thus teaches us that events can influence each other in a non-separable fashion, but that this non-separability has a certain exactly quantifiable limit.</description>
