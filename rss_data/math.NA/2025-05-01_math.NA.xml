      <title>Numerical Performance of the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method in OFP8, Bfloat16, Posit, and Takum Arithmetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of select eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large, sparse matrices is fundamental to a wide range of applications. Accordingly, evaluating the numerical performance of emerging alternatives to the IEEE 754 floating-point standard -- such as OFP8 (E4M3 and E5M2), bfloat16, and the tapered-precision posit and takum formats -- is of significant interest. Among the most widely used methods for this task is the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method, as implemented in ARPACK.
  This paper presents a comprehensive and untailored evaluation based on two real-world datasets: the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection, which includes matrices of varying sizes and condition numbers, and the Network Repository, a large collection of graphs from practical applications. The results demonstrate that the tapered-precision posit and takum formats provide improved numerical performance, with takum arithmetic avoiding several weaknesses observed in posits. While bfloat16 performs consistently better than float16, the OFP8 types are generally unsuitable for general-purpose computations.</description>

      <title>An $r$-adaptive finite element method using neural networks for parametric self-adjoint elliptic problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an $r$-adaptive finite element method (FEM) using neural networks (NNs). The method employs the Ritz energy functional as the loss function, currently limiting its applicability to symmetric and coercive problems, such as those arising from self-adjoint elliptic problems. The objective of the NN optimization is to determine the mesh node locations. For simplicity in two-dimensional problems, these locations are assumed to form a tensor product structure. The method is designed to solve parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). For each PDE parameter instance, the optimal $r$-adapted mesh generated by the NN is then solved with a standard FEM. The construction of FEM matrices and load vectors is implemented such that their derivatives with respect to mesh node locations, required for NN training, can be efficiently computed using automatic differentiation. However, the linear equation solver does not need to be differentiable, enabling the use of efficient, readily available `out-of-the-box' solvers. Consequently, the proposed approach retains the robustness and reliability guarantees of the FEM for each parameter instance, while the NN optimization adaptively adjusts the mesh node locations. The method's performance is demonstrated on parametric Poisson problems using one- and two-dimensional tensor product meshes.</description>

      <title>A Summation-Based Algorithm For Integer Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous methods have been considered to create a fast integer factorization algorithm. Despite its apparent simplicity, the difficulty to find such an algorithm plays a crucial role in modern cryptography, notably, in the security of RSA encryption. Some approaches to factoring integers quickly include the Trial Division method, Pollard's Rho and p-1 methods, and various Sieve algorithms.
  This paper introduces a new method that converts an integer into a sum in base-2. By combining a base-10 and base-2 representation of the integer, an algorithm on the order of $\sqrt{n}$ time complexity can convert that sum to a product of two integers, thus factoring the original number.</description>

      <title>Spectral Methods via FFTs in Emerging Machine Number Formats: OFP8, Bfloat16, Posit, and Takum Arithmetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is one of the most widely used algorithms in high performance computing, with critical applications in spectral analysis for both signal processing and the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). These data-intensive workloads are primarily constrained by the memory wall, motivating the exploration of emerging number formats -- such as OFP8 (E4M3 and E5M2), bfloat16, and the tapered-precision posit and takum formats -- as potential alternatives to conventional IEEE 754 floating-point representations.
  This paper evaluates the accuracy and stability of FFT-based computations across a range of formats, from 8 to 64 bits. Round-trip FFT is applied to a diverse set of images, and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to audio signals. The results confirm posit arithmetic's strong performance at low precision, with takum following closely behind. Posits show stability issues at higher precisions, while OFP8 formats are unsuitable and bfloat16 underperforms compared to float16 and takum.</description>

      <title>Virtual Element Method Applied to Two Dimensional Axisymmetric Elastic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a Virtual Element Method (VEM) formulation tailored for two-dimensional axisymmetric problems in linear elasticity. By exploiting the rotational symmetry of the geometry and loading conditions, the problem is reduced to a meridional cross-section, where all fields depend only on the radial and axial coordinates. The method incorporates the radial weight $r$ in both the weak formulation and the interpolation estimates to remain consistent with the physical volume measure of cylindrical coordinates. A projection operator onto constant strain fields is constructed via boundary integrals, and a volumetric correction term is introduced to account for the divergence of the stress field arising from axisymmetry. The stabilization term is designed to act only on the kernel of the projection and is implemented using a boundary-based formulation that guarantees stability without affecting polynomial consistency. Furthermore, an a priori interpolation error estimate is established in a weighted Sobolev space, showing optimal convergence rates. The implementation is validated through patch tests that demonstrate the accuracy, consistency, and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time weak error estimates of explicit full-discretization schemes for SPDEs with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to long-time weak approximations of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) evolving in a bounded domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \leq 3$, with non-globally Lipschitz and possibly non-contractive coefficients. Both the space-time white noise ($d=1$) and the trace-class noise in multiple dimensions $d=2,3$ are examined for the considered SPDEs. Based on a spectral Galerkin spatial semi-discretization, we propose a class of novel full-discretization schemes of exponential type, which are explicit, easily implementable and preserve the ergodicity of the original dissipative SPDEs with possibly non-contractive coefficients. The uniform-in-time weak approximation errors are carefully analyzed in a low regularity and non-contractive setting, with uniform-in-time weak convergence rates obtained. A key ingredient is to establish the uniform-in-time moment bounds (in $L^{4q-2}$-norm, $q \geq 1$) for the proposed fully discrete schemes in a super-linear setting. This is highly non-trivial for the explicit full-discretization schemes and new arguments are elaborated by fully exploiting a contractive property of the semi-group in $L^{4q-2}$, the dissipativity of the nonlinearity and the particular benefit of the taming strategy. Numerical experiments are finally reported to verify the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary precision computation of hydrodynamic stability eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that by using higher order precision arithmetic, i.e., using floating point types with more significant bits than standard double precision numbers, one may accurately compute eigenvalues for non-normal matrices arising in hydrodynamic stability problems. The basic principle is illustrated by a classical example of two $7\times 7$ matrices for which it is well known that eigenvalue computations fail when using standard double precision arithmetic. We then present an implementation of the Chebyshev tau-QZ method allowing the use of a large number of Chebyshev polynomials together with arbitrary precision arithmetic. This is used to compute the behavior of the spectra for Couette and Poiseuille flow at high Reynolds number. An experimental convergence analysis finally makes it evident that high order precision is required to obtain accurate results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore the Sibuya discrete probability distribution, which serves as the basis and the main instrument for numerical simulations of Grunwald--Letnikov fractional derivatives by the Monte Carlo method. We provide three methods for simulating the Sibuya distribution. We also introduce the Sibuya-like sieved probability distributions, and apply them to numerical fractional-order differentiation. Additionally, we use the Monte Carlo method for evaluating fractional-order integrals, and suggest the notion of the continuous Sibuya probability distribution. The developed methods and tools are illustrated by examples of computation. We provide the MATLAB toolboxes for simulation of the Sibuya probability distribution, and for the numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Low-rank computation of the posterior mean in Multi-Output Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GP) are a versatile tool in machine learning and computational science. We here consider the case of multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP) and present low-rank approaches for efficiently computing the posterior mean of a MOGP. Starting from low-rank spatio-temporal data we consider a structured covariance function, assuming separability across space and time. This separability, in turn, gives a decomposition of the covariance matrix into a Kronecker product of individual covariance matrices. Incorporating the typical noise term to the model then requires the solution of a large-scale Stein equation for computing the posterior mean. For this, we propose efficient low-rank methods based on a combination of a LRPCG method with the Sylvester equation solver KPIK adjusted for solving Stein equations. We test the developed method on real world street network graphs by using graph filters as covariance matrices. Moreover, we propose a degree-weighted average covariance matrix, which can be employed under specific assumptions to achieve more efficient convergence.</description>

      <title>Flow Through Porous Media: A Hopf-Cole Transformation Approach for Modeling Pressure-Dependent Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most organic liquids exhibit a pressure-dependent viscosity, making it crucial to consider this behavior in applications where pressures significantly exceed ambient conditions (e.g., geological carbon sequestration). Mathematical models describing flow through porous media while accounting for viscosity-pressure dependence are nonlinear (e.g., the Barus model). This nonlinearity complicates mathematical analysis and makes numerical solutions more time-intensive and prone to convergence issues. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Hopf-Cole transformation, originally developed for Burgers' equation, can recast the governing equations -- describing flow through porous media with pressure-dependent viscosity -- into a linear form. The transformed equations, resembling Darcy's equations in the transformed variables, enable (a) systematic mathematical analysis to establish uniqueness and maximum principles, (b) the derivation of a mechanics-based principle, and (c) the development of efficient numerical solutions using solvers optimized for Darcy equations. Notably, many properties of the linear Darcy equations naturally extend to nonlinear models that depend on pressure. For example, solutions to these nonlinear models adhere to a reciprocal relation analogous to that observed in Darcy's equations.</description>

      <title>Sparsity for Infinite-Parametric Holomorphic Functions on Gaussian Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sparsity of Wiener polynomial chaos expansions of holomorphic maps $\mathcal{G}$ on Gaussian Hilbert spaces, as arise in the coefficient-to-solution maps of linear, second order, divergence-form elliptic PDEs with log-Gaussian diffusion coefficient. Representing the Gaussian random field input as an affine-parametric expansion, the nonlinear map becomes a countably-parametric, deterministic holomorphic map of the coordinate sequence $\boldsymbol{y} = (y_j)_{j\in\mathbb{N}} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty$. We establish weighted summability results for the Wiener-Hermite coefficient sequences of images of affine-parametric expansions of the log-Gaussian input under $\mathcal{G}$. These results give rise to $N$-term approximation rate bounds for the full range of input summability exponents $p\in (0,2)$. We show that these approximation rate bounds apply to parameter-to-solution maps for elliptic diffusion PDEs with lognormal coefficients.</description>

      <title>A p-adaptive polytopal discontinuous Galerkin method for high-order approximation of brain electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale mathematical models have shown great promise in computational brain electrophysiology but are still hindered by high computational costs due to fast dynamics and complex brain geometries, requiring very fine spatio-temporal resolution. This paper introduces a novel p-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal grids (PolyDG) coupled with Crank-Nicolson time integration to approximate such models efficiently. The p-adaptive method enhances local accuracy via dynamic, element-wise polynomial refinement/de-refinement guided by a-posteriori error estimators. A novel clustering algorithm automatizes the selection of elements for adaptive updates, further improving efficiency. A wide set of numerical tests, including epileptic seizure simulations in a sagittal section of a human brain stem, demonstrate the method's ability to reduce computational load while maintaining the accuracy of the numerical solution in capturing the dynamics of multiple wavefronts.</description>

      <title>Approximation and regularity results for the Heston model and related processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Ph.D. thesis explores approximations and regularity for the Heston stochastic volatility model through three interconnected works.
  The first work focuses on developing high-order weak approximations for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process, essential for financial modelling but challenging due to the square root diffusion term preventing standard methods. By employing the random grid technique (Alfonsi &amp; Bally, 2021) built upon Alfonsi's (2010) second-order scheme, the work proves that weak approximations of any order can be achieved for smooth test functions. This holds under a condition that is less restrictive than the famous Feller's one. Numerical results confirm convergence for both CIR and Heston models and show significant computational time improvements.
  The second work extends the random grid technique to the log-Heston process. Two second-order schemes are introduced (one using exact volatility simulation, another using Ninomiya-Victoir splitting under a the same restriction used above). Convergence to any desired order is rigorously proven. Numerical experiments validate the schemes' effectiveness for pricing European and Asian options and suggest potential applicability to multifactor/rough Heston models.
  The third work investigates the partial differential equation (PDE) associated with the log-Heston model. It extends classical solution results and establishes the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions without relying on the Feller condition. Uniqueness is proven even for certain discontinuous initial data, relevant for pricing instruments like digital options. Furthermore, the convergence of a hybrid numerical scheme to the viscosity solution is shown under relaxed regularity (continuity) for the initial data.
  An appendix includes supplementary results for the CIR process.</description>

      <title>MAGNET: an open-source library for mesh agglomeration by Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MAGNET, an open-source Python library designed for mesh agglomeration in both two- and three-dimensions, based on employing Graph Neural Networks (GNN). MAGNET serves as a comprehensive solution for training a variety of GNN models, integrating deep learning and other advanced algorithms such as METIS and k-means to facilitate mesh agglomeration and quality metric computation. The library's introduction is outlined through its code structure and primary features. The GNN framework adopts a graph bisection methodology that capitalizes on connectivity and geometric mesh information via SAGE convolutional layers, in line with the methodology proposed by Antonietti et al. (2024). Additionally, the proposed MAGNET library incorporates reinforcement learning to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the model for predicting coarse partitions within a multilevel framework. A detailed tutorial is provided to guide the user through the process of mesh agglomeration and the training of a GNN bisection model. We present several examples of mesh agglomeration conducted by MAGNET, demonstrating the library's applicability across various scenarios. Furthermore, the performance of the newly introduced models is contrasted with that of METIS and k-means, illustrating that the proposed GNN models are competitive regarding partition quality and computational efficiency. Finally, we exhibit the versatility of MAGNET's interface through its integration with Lymph, an open-source library implementing discontinuous Galerkin methods on polytopal grids for the numerical discretization of multiphysics differential problems.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of the Consistent and Independent Second Moment Methods Applied to Thermal Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21784</link>

Abstract: The design of efficient numerical methods for modeling thermal radiative transfer (TRT) is challenging due to the stiff, nonlinear coupling between radiation and material energies, especially at the time scales of interest in high energy density physics and astrophysics. Here, we investigate the use of the Second Moment Method (SMM) to accelerate absorption-emission within the context of the multigroup, Discrete Ordinates transport equations with discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization. SMM employs a reduced-dimensional, diffusion-based model of radiation transport that, when coupled with suitable discrete closures, serves as a proxy for the transport equation, isolating the transport equation from the stiff absorption-emission physics. We use a gray low-order system to reduce the cost of solving the low-order system and leverage SMM low-order discretizations specifically designed to be scalably solvable with existing linear solver technology. Our algorithm robustly resolves the nonlinear TRT system while only relying on transport sweeps, linearly solving symmetric and positive definite, gray diffusion systems, and nonlinearly solving the spatially pointwise energy balance equation. This algorithm is used as a vehicle to compare the efficacy of low-order discretizations developed for steady-state, linear transport on gray and multigroup TRT problems in one and two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Frozen Gaussian Grid-point Correction For Semi-classical Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient reconstruction algorithm named the frozen Gaussian grid-point correction (FGGC) for computing the Schr\"odinger equation in the semi-classical regime using the frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA). The FGA has demonstrated its superior efficiency in dealing with semi-classical problems and high-frequency wave propagations. However, reconstructing the wave function from a large number of Gaussian wave-packets is typically computationally intensive. This difficulty arises because these wave-packets propagate along the FGA trajectories to non-grid positions, making the application of the fast Fourier transform infeasible. In this work, we introduce the concept of ``on-grid correction'' and derive the formulas for the least squares approximation of Gaussian wave-packets, and also provide a detailed process of the FGGC algorithm. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that the error introduced by the least squares approximation on each Gaussian wave-packet is independent of the semi-classical parameter $\varepsilon$. Numerical experiments show that the FGGC algorithm can significantly improve reconstruction efficiency while introducing only negligible error, making it a powerful tool for solving the semi-classical Schr\"odinger equation, especially in applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Patch bubbles for advection-dominated problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel variant of the \emph{residual-free bubble} method (RFB) for advection dominated problems is presented. Since the usual RFB still suffers from oscillations and strong under/overshoots, the bubble space is enriched by \emph{patch bubbles}, giving more freedom to the bubble space.
  We use a recursive and efficient approach to accurately compute the bubbles. Numerical experiments clearly demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the standard RFB.
  The method is similar to the \emph{enhanced residual-free bubble} method (eRFB) proposed by Cangiani and S\"uli in 2005, but differs in the definition of the additional bubbles.</description>

      <title>On feedback stabilisation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and its numerical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the stabilisation of solutions to the Cahn-Hilliard equation towards a given trajectory by means of a finite-dimensional static output feedback mechanism. Exponential stabilisation of the controlled state around the target trajectory is proven using careful energy estimates and a spectral condition which characterizes the strength of the feedback. The analysis is general enough to allow for pointwise and distributed measurements and actuation. The main results are derived via arguments that carry over to appropriate discretisation schemes which allows us to establish corresponding exponential stabilisation results also on the discrete level. The validity of our results and the importance of some of our assumptions are illustrated by numerical tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present the mathematical analysis of the convergence of the linearized Crank-Nicolson Galerkin method for a nonlinear Schrodinger problem related to a domain with a moving boundary. The convergence analysis of the numerical method is carried out for both semi-discrete and fully discrete problems. An optimal error estimate in the $L^2$-norm with order ${O}(\tau^2+ h^s),~ 2\leq s\leq r$, where $h$ is the finite element mesh size parameter, $\tau$ is the time step, and $r-1$ represents the degree of the finite element polynomial basis. Numerical simulations are provided to confirm the consistency between theoretical and numerical results, validating the method and the order of convergence for different degrees $p\geq 1$ of the Lagrange polynomials and also for Hermite polynomials (degree $p=3$), which form the basis of the approximate solution.</description>

      <title>Towards a fully well-balanced and entropy-stable scheme for the Euler equations with gravity: General equations of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work concerns the derivation of a fully well-balanced Godunov-type finite volume scheme for the Euler equations with a gravitational potential based on an approximate Riemann solver in a one-dimensional framework. It is an extension to general equations of states of the entropy-stable and fully well-balanced scheme for ideal gases recently forwarded in [Berthon et al., 2025]. The scheme is provably entropy-stable and positivity-preserving for all thermodynamic variables. Numerical test cases illustrate the performance and entropy stability of the new scheme, using six different equations of state as examples, four analytic and two tabulated ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a linear algebraic framework for performing density estimation. It consists of three simple steps: convolving the empirical distribution with certain smoothing kernels to remove the exponentially large variance; compressing the empirical distribution after convolution as a tensor train, with efficient tensor decomposition algorithms; and finally, applying a deconvolution step to recover the estimated density from such tensor-train representation. Numerical results demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity and convergence of two-relaxation-times lattice Boltzmann schemes for a non-linear conservation law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the convergence analysis of lattice Boltzmann methods for scalar non-linear conservation laws, focusing on two-relaxation-times (TRT) schemes. Unlike Finite Difference/Finite Volume methods, lattice Boltzmann schemes offer exceptional computational efficiency and parallelization capabilities. However, their monotonicity and $L^{\infty}$-stability remain underexplored. Extending existing results on simpler BGK schemes, we derive conditions ensuring that TRT schemes are monotone and stable by leveraging their unique relaxation structure. Our analysis culminates in proving convergence of the numerical solution to the weak entropy solution of the conservation law. Compared to BGK schemes, TRT schemes achieve reduced numerical diffusion while retaining provable convergence. Numerical experiments validate and illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Fast LDL factorization for dense and sparse symmetric matrices over an arbitrary field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While existing algorithms may be used to solve a linear system over a general field in matrix-multiplication time, the complexity of constructing a symmetric triangular factorization (LDL) has received relatively little formal study. The LDL factorization is a common tool for factorization of symmetric matrices, and, unlike orthogonal counterparts, generalizes to an arbitrary field. We provide algorithms for dense and sparse LDL factorization and for dense LU factorization that aim to minimize complexity for factorization over a general field. For LU of an $m\times n$ rank $R$ matrix, we obtain an algorithm with complexity $O(mnR^{\omega-2})$, where $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication complexity exponent. For LDL of an $n\times n$ matrix, we give an algorithm with complexity $O(n^\omega)$ and for a sparse matrix corresponding to a graph with treewidth $\tau$, we obtain $O(n\tau^{\omega-1})$. Our sparse LDL algorithm is based on an adaptation of the null-space method for solving saddle point systems of equations, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Computational Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes are an introduction to fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) and the formulation of numerical schemes for the resulting stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs). Fluctuating hydrodynamics was originally introduced by Landau and Lifshitz as a way to put thermal fluctuations into a continuum framework by including a stochastic forcing to each dissipative transport process (e.g., heat flux). While FHD has been useful in modeling transport and fluid dynamics at the mesoscopic scale, theoretical calculations have been feasible only with simplifying assumptions. As such there is great interest in numerical schemes for Computational Fluctuating Hydrodynamics (CFHD). There are a variety of algorithms (e.g., spectral, finite element, lattice Boltzmann) but in this introduction we focus on finite volume schemes. Accompanying these notes is a demonstration program in Python available on GitHub (https://github.com/AlejGarcia/IntroFHD).</description>

Abstract: We develop a versatile framework which allows us to rigorously estimate the Hausdorff dimension of maximal conformal graph directed Markov systems in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \geq 2$. Our method is based on piecewise linear approximations of the eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius operator via a finite element framework for discretization and iterative mesh schemes. One key element in our approach is obtaining bounds for the derivatives of these eigenfunctions, which, besides being essential for the implementation of our method, are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>BCAT: A Block Causal Transformer for PDE Foundation Models for Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce BCAT, a PDE foundation model designed for autoregressive prediction of solutions to two dimensional fluid dynamics problems. Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 3.5x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.18% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks. With fine-tuning on a turbulence dataset, we show that the method adapts to new settings with more than 40% better accuracy over prior methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems with different particle species are fundamental in quantum materials and quantum information science. In this work, we establish a rigorous theoretical framework proving that, given access to an unknown spin-boson type Hamiltonian, our algorithm achieves Heisenberg-limited estimation for all coupling parameters up to error $\epsilon$ with a total evolution time ${O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ using only ${O}({\rm polylog}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ measurements. It is also robust against small state preparation and measurement errors. In addition, we provide an alternative algorithm based on distributed quantum sensing, which significantly reduces the evolution time per measurement. To validate our method, we demonstrate its efficiency in hybrid Hamiltonian learning and spectrum learning, with broad applications in AMO, condensed matter and high energy physics. Our results provide a scalable and robust framework for precision Hamiltonian characterization in hybrid quantum platforms.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the analytic adjoint solution for two-dimensional (2D) incompressible potential flow for a cost function measuring aerodynamic force using the connection of the adjoint approach to Green's functions and also by establishing and exploiting its relation to the adjoint incompressible Euler equations. By comparison with the analytic solution, it is shown that the naive approach based on solving Laplace's equation for the adjoint variables can be ill-defined. The analysis of the boundary behavior of the analytic solution is used to discuss the proper formulation of the adjoint problem as well as the mechanism for incorporating the Kutta condition in the adjoint formulation</description>

      <title>Avoided-crossings, degeneracies and Berry phases in the spectrum of quantum noise through analytic Bloch-Messiah decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bloch-Messiah decomposition (BMD) is a fundamental tool in quantum optics, enabling the analysis and tailoring of multimode Gaussian states by decomposing linear optical transformations into passive interferometers and single-mode squeezers. Its extension to frequency-dependent matrix-valued functions, recently introduced as the "analytic Bloch-Messiah decomposition" (ABMD), provides the most general approach for characterizing the driven-dissipative dynamics of quantum optical systems governed by quadratic Hamiltonians. In this work, we present a detailed study of the ABMD, focusing on the typical behavior of parameter-dependent singular values and of their corresponding singular vectors. In particular, we analyze the hitherto unexplored occurrence of avoided and genuine crossings in the spectrum of quantum noise, the latter being manifested by nontrivial topological Berry phases of the singular vectors. We demonstrate that avoided crossings arise naturally when a single parameter is varied, leading to hypersensitivity of the singular vectors and suggesting the presence of genuine crossings in nearby systems. We highlight the possibility of programming the spectral response of photonic systems through the deliberate design of avoided crossings. As a notable example, we show that such control can be exploited to generate broad, flat-band squeezing spectra -- a desirable feature for enhancing degaussification protocols. This study provides new insights into the structure of multimode quantum correlations and offers a theoretical framework for experimental exploitation of complex quantum optical systems.</description>
