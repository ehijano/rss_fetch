      <title>Tensor renormalization group study of (1+1)-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model with and without finite chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study (1+1)-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model using the tensor renormalization group method with the infinite limit of the bond dimension $D_{\rm cut}\rightarrow \infty$. At the vanishing chemical potential $\mu=0$, we investigate the von Neumann and R\'enyi types of entanglement entropies. The central charge is determined to be $c=1.97(9)$ by using the asymptotic scaling properties of the entropies. We also examine the consistency between two entropies. In the finite density region with $\mu\ne 0$, where this model suffers from the sign problem in the standard Monte Carlo approach, we investigate the properties of the quantum phase transition. We determine the transition point $\mu_{\rm c}$ and the critical exponent of the correlation length $\nu$ from the $\mu$ dependence of the number density in the thermodynamic limit. The dynamical critical exponent $z$ is also extracted from the scaling behavior of the temporal correlation length as a function of $\mu$. This is the first successful calculation of the dynamical critical exponent with the TRG method.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Schwinger model via gauge-invariant VUMPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>

      <title>Effective Strings in QED$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective string theory describes the physics of long confining strings in theories, like Yang-Mills theory, where the mass gap $M_{gap}^2$ is of the same order as the string tension $T$. In $2+1$ dimensions, there is a class of confining theories, including massive QED$_3$ as first analyzed by Polyakov, for which $M_{gap}^2\ll T$. These theories are weakly coupled at low energies of order $M_{gap}$, and may be analyzed perturbatively. In this paper, we analyze the physics of strings in such theories, focusing on QED$_3$, at energies of order $M_{gap}$ (but still well below $\sqrt{T}$). We argue that the width of the string in these theories should be of order $1/M_{gap}$ independently of its length, as long as the string is not exponentially long. We also compute at leading order in perturbation theory the ground state energy of a confining string on a circle, and the scattering of Nambu-Goldstone bosons on the string worldsheet.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Vacuum in Discrete Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider introducing the Dirac sea in a discrete spacetime model of fermions which approximates the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, if we attempt to fill up the `negative' energy states, we run into a problem. A new boundary is created between positive and negative energy states, at which pair creation seems energetically favourable. This happens because of the modular nature of energy in discrete time models. We then suggest a possible remedy by amending the model, in order to pull states away from the new boundary.</description>

      <title>Proper Wilson flow time for calculating the topological charge density and the pseudoscalar glueball mass in quenched lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proper flow time for the Wilson flow in calculating the topological charge, topological susceptibility, and topological charge density correlator (TCDC) using the gluonic definition is analyzed. The proper flow time for the topological charge and TCDC is determined by different methods. The proper flow time may vary depending on whether the calculation is for the topological charge, topological density, topological susceptibility, or TCDC. Specifically, the flow time identified using the matching procedure is optimal for TCDC and a good choice for the topological susceptibility. Additionally, the pseudoscalar glueball is extracted from the TCDC using the bosonic definition at the identified proper flow time for three ensembles, and the continuum mass value is obtained through continuous extrapolation.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of Prony and Lanczos methods for Euclidean correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the oblique Lanczos method recently put forward in arXiv:2406.20009 for analysing Euclidean correlators in lattice field theories and show that it is analytically equivalent to the well known Prony Generalised Eigenvalue Method (PGEVM). Moreover, we discuss that the signal-to-noise problem is not aleviated by either of these two methods. Still, both methods show clear advantages when compared to the standard effective mass approach.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider asymptotically free gauge theories with gauge group $SU(N_c)$ and $N_f$ quarks with mass $m_q\ll \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ that undergo chiral symmetry breaking and confinement. We propose a bootstrap method to compute the S-matrix of the pseudo-Goldstone bosons (pions) that dominate the low energy physics. For the important case of $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, a numerical implementation of the method gives the phase shifts of the $S0$, $P1$ and $S2$ waves in good agreement with experimental results. The method incorporates gauge theory information ($N_c$, $N_f$, $m_q$, $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$) by using the form-factor bootstrap recently proposed by Karateev, Kuhn and Penedones together with a finite energy version of the SVZ sum rules. At low energy we impose constraints from chiral symmetry breaking. The only low energy numerical inputs are the pion mass $m_\pi$ and the quark and gluon condensates.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap for Finite N Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16925v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing finite $N$ lattice Yang-Mills theory and finite $N$ matrix models. Utilizing this framework, we examine the bootstrap approach to SU(2) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory in 2,3 and 4 dimensions. The SU(2) Makeenko-Migdal loop equations on the lattice are linear and closed exclusively on single-trace Wilson loops. This inherent linearity significantly enhances the efficiency of the bootstrap approach due to the convex nature of the problem, permitting the inclusion of Wilson loops up to length 24. The exact upper and lower margins for the free energy per plaquette, derived from our bootstrap method, demonstrate good agreement with Monte Carlo data, achieving precision within $0.1\%$ for the physically relevant range of couplings in both three and four dimensions. Additionally, our bootstrap data provides estimates of the string tension, in qualitative agreement with existing Monte Carlo computations.</description>

      <title>Correlations and fluctuations in a magnetized PNJL model with and without inverse magnetic catalysis effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlation $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$ and quadratic fluctuations $\chi^B_2,\ \chi^Q_2,\ \chi^T_2$ of baryon number $B$, electric charge $Q$ and temperature $T$ are investigated in a two-flavor Polyakov loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model at finite temperature and magnetic field. The inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect is introduced through the magnetic field dependent parameters $G(eB)$ or $T_0(eB)$, and we make comparison of the results in the cases with and without IMC effect. With nonvanishing magnetic field, the correlation $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$ and fluctuations $\chi^B_2,\ \chi^Q_2,\ \chi^T_2$ increase with temperature, and then show the peak around the pseudocritical temperatures of chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transitions in the cases with and without the IMC effect. The correlation and fluctuations along the phase transition line under external magnetic field are characterized by the scaled correlation ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ}=\frac{\chi_{11}^{BQ}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_{11}^{BQ}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ and scaled fluctuations ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{B(Q,T)}=\frac{\chi_2^{B(Q,T)}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_2^{B(Q,T)}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ at the pseudocritical temperature $T_{pc}^c$ of chiral restoration phase transition. ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ},\ {\hat {\chi}}_2^{B}$, and ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{Q}$ increase with magnetic fields, and the inclusion of IMC effect leads to some enhancement in their values. However, ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{T}$ is altered by the IMC effect. Without IMC effect, ${\hat \chi}^T_2$ slightly increases and then decreases with magnetic fields. Taking into account of the IMC effect by $G(eB)$, ${\hat \chi}^T_2$ monotonically increases with magnetic fields, and by $T_0(eB)$, it is a nonmonotonic function of magnetic field.</description>
