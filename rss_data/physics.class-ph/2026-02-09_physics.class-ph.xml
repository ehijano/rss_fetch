      <title>Hessian-Enhanced Alternating Frequency/Time method for Computing Resonance Backbone Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing resonance and anti-resonance backbone curves in complex nonlinear mechanical systems is of high engineering relevance but remains computationally challenging, especially for large finite-element (FE) models. Existing manifold-based approaches often rely on polynomial parameterizations, limiting their effectiveness for general smooth, non-polynomial nonlinearities. To overcome these limitations, we develop a direct optimization framework that employs a Lagrange multiplier formulation to determine the resonance backbone curve on the response surface constrained by the harmonic balance governing equations. Crucially, solving this formulation efficiently requires second-order sensitivity information. Therefore, the primary innovation of this work is the derivation of a analytical Hessian Tensor for generic $C^2$-continuous nonlinear elements. This is achieved by combining an extended Alternating Frequency/Time (AFT) method for computing second-order derivatives with local-coordinate tensor transformations. By integrating this analytical Hessian into the solver, the proposed framework ensures robust convergence and significantly reduces runtime, making it practical for large-scale models where numerical differentiation is computationally prohibitive. The method is validated on three benchmarks of increasing complexity: a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) system with cubic nonlinearity, a beam with cubic stiffness or hyperbolic tangent (tanh) friction nonlinearities, and an industrial-scale finite element model of a compressor bladed disk (blisk) with a friction ring damper. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework accurately and efficiently computes both resonance and anti-resonance backbone curves, providing a robust frequency-domain tool for structures with non-polynomial nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>From Kepler to Newton: Inductive Biases Guide Learned World Models in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can general-purpose AI architectures go beyond prediction to discover the physical laws governing the universe? True intelligence relies on "world models" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous "AI Physicist" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively "bake in" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations. Our results demonstrate that simple architectural choices determine whether an AI becomes a curve-fitter or a physicist, marking a critical step toward automated scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>High-Discretization Method of Moments for Capacitance Calculation: A Cube and a Hollow Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper employs the method of moments (MOM) to calculate the capacitances of a cube and a hollow cylinder. For the cube, each face was divided into a maximum of 600 x 600 sub-areas. By fully exploiting the geometric symmetry between sub-areas and incorporating parallel computing, computational resources were significantly conserved. Our results show that the calculated capacitance of the cube first increases and then decreases as the number of sub-areas increases. When each face was divided into 90 x 90 sub-areas, the capacitance of the unit cube (with an edge length of 1 m) reached a maximum reference value of 73.519014 pF. This indicates that higher accuracy cannot be achieved merely by indefinitely increasing the number of discretized sub-areas. Subsequently, the method was applied to compute the capacitance of a hollow cylinder. The results were compared with numerical solutions based on Lekner's theoretical formula and Cavendish's experimental values, showing good agreement among the three.</description>
