      <title>German Beams -- The Story of Particle Accelerators in Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though many of the experiments leading to the standard model of particle physics were done at large accelerator laboratories in the US and at CERN, many exciting developments happened in smaller national facilities all over the world. In this report we highlight the history of accelerator facilities in Germany.</description>

      <title>Laser wakefield acceleration of ions with a transverse flying focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme electric fields created in high-intensity laser-plasma interactions could generate energetic ions far more compactly than traditional accelerators. Despite this promise, laser-plasma accelerators have remained stagnant at maximum ion energies of 100 MeV/nucleon for the last twenty years. The central challenge is the low charge-to-mass ratio of ions, which has precluded one of the most successful approaches used for electrons: laser wakefield acceleration. Here we show that a laser pulse with a focal spot that moves transverse to the laser propagation direction enables wakefield acceleration of ions to GeV energies in underdense plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this relativistic-intensity "transverse flying focus" can trap ions in a comoving electrostatic pocket, producing a monoenergetic collimated ion beam. With a peak intensity of $10^{20}\,$W/cm$^2$ and an acceleration distance of $0.44\,$cm, we observe a proton beam with $23.1\,$pC charge, $1.6\,$GeV peak energy, and $3.7\,$% relative energy spread. This approach allows for compact high-repetition-rate production of high-energy ions, highlighting the capability of more generalized spatio-temporal pulse shaping to address open problems in plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Observing S-Matrix Pole Flow in Resonance Interplay: Cold Collisions of Ultracold Atoms in a Miniature Laser-based Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of experiments exploring resonances in the collision of ultracold clouds of atoms. Using a laser-based accelerator that capitalizes on the energy resolution provided by the ultracold atomic setting, we unveil resonance phenomena such as Feshbach and shape resonances in their quintessential form by literally photographing the halo of outgoing scattered atoms. We exploit the tunability of magnetic Feshbach resonances to instigate an interplay between scattering resonances. By experimentally recording the scattering in a parameter space spanned by collision energy and magnetic field, we capture the imprint of the $S$-matrix pole flow in the complex energy plane. After revisiting experiments that place a Feshbach resonance in the proximity of a shape resonance and an anti-bound state, respectively, we discuss the possibility of using $S$-matrix pole interplay between two Feshbach resonances to create a bound-state-in-the-continuum.</description>

      <title>Interplay of space charge, intrabeam scattering and synchrotron radiation in the Compact Linear Collider damping rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future ultra-low emittance rings for electron/positron colliders require extremely high beam brightness and can thus be limited by collective effects. In this paper, the interplay of effects such as synchrotron radiation, intra-beam scattering (IBS) and space charge in the vicinity of excited betatron resonances is assessed. In this respect, two algorithms were developed to simulate IBS and synchrotron radiation effects and integrated in the PyORBIT tracking code, to be combined with its widely used space charge module. The impact of these effects on the achievable beam parameters of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) Damping Rings was studied, showing that synchrotron radiation damping mitigates the adverse effects of IBS and space charge induced resonance crossing. The studies include also a full dynamic simulation of the CLIC damping ring cycle starting from the injection beam parameters. It is demonstrated that a careful working point choice is necessary, in order to accommodate the transition from a non-linear lattice induced detuning to a space-charge dominated one and thereby avoid excessive losses and emittance growth generated in the vicinity of strong resonances.</description>

      <title>Laser-Plasma Ion Beam Booster Based on Hollow-Channel Magnetic Vortex Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-driven ion acceleration provides ultra-short, high-charge, low-emittance beams, which are desirable for a wide range of high-impact applications. Yet after decades of research, a significant increase in maximum ion energy is still needed. This work introduces a quality-preserving staging concept for ultra-intense ion bunches that is seamlessly applicable from the non-relativistic plasma source to the relativistic regime. Full 3D particle-in-cell simulations prove robustness and capture of a high-charge proton bunch, suitable for readily available and near-term laser facilities.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Bayesian Active Learning for MeV-ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron diffraction using MeV energy beams(MeV-UED) has enabled unprecedented scientific opportunities in the study of ultrafast structural dynamics in a variety of gas, liquid and solid state systems. Broad scientific applications usually pose different requirements for electron probe properties. Due to the complex, nonlinear and correlated nature of accelerator systems, electron beam property optimization is a time-taking process and often relies on extensive hand-tuning by experienced human operators. Algorithm based efficient online tuning strategies are highly desired. Here, we demonstrate multi-objective Bayesian active learning for speeding up online beam tuning at the SLAC MeV-UED facility. The multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm was used for efficiently searching the parameter space and mapping out the Pareto Fronts which give the trade-offs between key beam properties. Such scheme enables an unprecedented overview of the global behavior of the experimental system and takes a significantly smaller number of measurements compared with traditional methods such as a grid scan. This methodology can be applied in other experimental scenarios that require simultaneously optimizing multiple objectives by explorations in high dimensional, nonlinear and correlated systems.</description>
