      <title>GeoAI-Enhanced Community Detection on Spatial Networks with Graph Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial networks are useful for modeling geographic phenomena where spatial interaction plays an important role. To analyze the spatial networks and their internal structures, graph-based methods such as community detection have been widely used. Community detection aims to extract strongly connected components from the network and reveal the hidden relationships between nodes, but they usually do not involve the attribute information. To consider edge-based interactions and node attributes together, this study proposed a family of GeoAI-enhanced unsupervised community detection methods called region2vec based on Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). The region2vec methods generate node neural embeddings based on attribute similarity, geographic adjacency and spatial interactions, and then extract network communities based on node embeddings using agglomerative clustering. The proposed GeoAI-based methods are compared with multiple baselines and perform the best when one wants to maximize node attribute similarity and spatial interaction intensity simultaneously within the spatial network communities. It is further applied in the shortage area delineation problem in public health and demonstrates its promise in regionalization problems.</description>

      <title>Transition Network Analysis: A Novel Framework for Modeling, Visualizing, and Identifying the Temporal Patterns of Learners and Learning Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analytical framework: Transition Network Analysis (TNA), an approach that integrates Stochastic Process Mining and probabilistic graph representation to model, visualize, and identify transition patterns in the learning process data. Combining the relational and temporal aspects into a single lens offers capabilities beyond either framework, including centralities to capture important learning events, community finding to identify patterns of behavior, and clustering to reveal temporal patterns. This paper introduces the theoretical and mathematical foundations of TNA. To demonstrate the functionalities of TNA, we present a case study with students (n=191) engaged in small-group collaboration to map patterns of group dynamics using the theories of co-regulation and socially-shared regulated learning. The analysis revealed that TNA could reveal the regulatory processes and identify important events, temporal patterns and clusters. Bootstrap validation established the significant transitions and eliminated spurious transitions. In doing so, we showcase TNA's utility to capture learning dynamics and provide a robust framework for investigating the temporal evolution of learning processes. Future directions include advancing estimation methods, expanding reliability assessment, exploring longitudinal TNA, and comparing TNA networks using permutation tests.</description>

      <title>How Media Competition Fuels the Spread of Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competition among news sources may encourage some sources to share fake news and misinformation to influence the public. While sharing misinformation may lead to a short-term gain in audience engagement, it may damage the reputation of these sources, resulting in a loss of audience. To understand the rationale behind sharing misinformation, we model the competition as a zero-sum sequential game, where each news source influences individuals based on its credibility-how trustworthy the public perceives it-and the individual's opinion and susceptibility. In this game, news sources can decide whether to share factual information to enhance their credibility or disseminate misinformation for greater immediate attention at the cost of losing credibility. We employ the quantal response equilibrium concept, which accounts for the bounded rationality of human decision-making, allowing for imperfect or probabilistic choices. Our analysis shows that the resulting equilibria for this game reproduce the credibility-bias distribution observed in real-world news sources, with hyper-partisan sources more likely to spread misinformation than centrist ones. It further illustrates that disseminating misinformation can polarize the public. Notably, our model reveals that when one player increases misinformation dissemination, the other player is likely to follow, exacerbating the spread of misinformation. We conclude by discussing potential strategies to mitigate the spread of fake news and promote a more factual and reliable information landscape.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Modelling Meets Generative AI in Social Network Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) has emerged as an essential tool for simulating social networks, encompassing diverse phenomena such as information dissemination, influence dynamics, and community formation. However, manually configuring varied agent interactions and information flow dynamics poses challenges, often resulting in oversimplified models that lack real-world generalizability. Integrating modern Large Language Models (LLMs) with ABM presents a promising avenue to address these challenges and enhance simulation fidelity, leveraging LLMs' human-like capabilities in sensing, reasoning, and behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing LLM-empowered agents to simulate social network users based on their interests and personality traits. The framework allows for customizable agent interactions resembling various social network platforms, including mechanisms for content resharing and personalized recommendations. We validate our framework using a comprehensive Twitter dataset from the 2020 US election, demonstrating that LLM-agents accurately replicate real users' behaviors, including linguistic patterns and political inclinations. These agents form homogeneous ideological clusters and retain the main themes of their community. Notably, preference-based recommendations significantly influence agent behavior, promoting increased engagement, network homophily and the formation of echo chambers. Overall, our findings underscore the potential of LLM-agents in advancing social media simulations and unraveling intricate online dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Transformer and LSTM Models for Detecting Suicidal Ideation on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suicide is a critical global health problem involving more than 700,000 deaths yearly, particularly among young adults. Many people express their suicidal thoughts on social media platforms such as Reddit. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the deep learning transformer-based models BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA and various Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based models in detecting suicidal ideation from user posts on Reddit. Toward this objective, we curated an extensive dataset from diverse subreddits and conducted linguistic, topic modeling, and statistical analyses to ensure data quality. Our results indicate that each model could reach high accuracy and F1 scores, but among them, RoBERTa emerged as the most effective model with an accuracy of 93.22% and F1 score of 93.14%. An LSTM model that uses attention and BERT embeddings performed as the second best, with an accuracy of 92.65% and an F1 score of 92.69%. Our findings show that transformer-based models have the potential to improve suicide ideation detection, thereby providing a path to develop robust mental health monitoring tools from social media. This research, therefore, underlines the undeniable prospect of advanced techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) while improving suicide prevention efforts.</description>

      <title>Haar-Laplacian for directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Laplacian matrix aiming to enable the construction of spectral convolutional networks and to extend the signal processing applications for directed graphs. Our proposal is inspired by a Haar-like transformation and produces a Hermitian matrix which is not only in one-to-one relation with the adjacency matrix, preserving both direction and weight information, but also enjoys desirable additional properties like scaling robustness, sensitivity, continuity, and directionality. We take a theoretical standpoint and support the conformity of our approach with the spectral graph theory. Then, we address two use-cases: graph learning (by introducing HaarNet, a spectral graph convolutional network built with our Haar-Laplacian) and graph signal processing. We show that our approach gives better results in applications like weight prediction and denoising on directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Best of Both Worlds: Advantages of Hybrid Graph Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern sequence models (e.g., Transformers, linear RNNs, etc.) emerged as dominant backbones of recent deep learning frameworks, mainly due to their efficiency, representational power, and/or ability to capture long-range dependencies. Adopting these sequence models for graph-structured data has recently gained popularity as the alternative to Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). There is, however, a lack of a common foundation about what constitutes a good graph sequence model, and a mathematical description of the benefits and deficiencies in adopting different sequence models for learning on graphs. To this end, we first present Graph Sequence Model (GSM), a unifying framework for adopting sequence models for graphs, consisting of three main steps: (1) Tokenization, which translates the graph into a set of sequences; (2) Local Encoding, which encodes local neighborhoods around each node; and (3) Global Encoding, which employs a scalable sequence model to capture long-range dependencies within the sequences. This framework allows us to understand, evaluate, and compare the power of different sequence model backbones in graph tasks. Our theoretical evaluations of the representation power of Transformers and modern recurrent models through the lens of global and local graph tasks show that there are both negative and positive sides for both types of models. Building on this observation, we present GSM++, a fast hybrid model that uses the Hierarchical Affinity Clustering (HAC) algorithm to tokenize the graph into hierarchical sequences, and then employs a hybrid architecture of Transformer to encode these sequences. Our theoretical and experimental results support the design of GSM++, showing that GSM++ outperforms baselines in most benchmark evaluations.</description>

      <title>Decoding Urban Industrial Complexity: Enhancing Knowledge-Driven Insights via IndustryScopeGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial parks are critical to urban economic growth. Yet, their development often encounters challenges stemming from imbalances between industrial requirements and urban services, underscoring the need for strategic planning and operations. This paper introduces IndustryScopeKG, a pioneering large-scale multi-modal, multi-level industrial park knowledge graph, which integrates diverse urban data including street views, corporate, socio-economic, and geospatial information, capturing the complex relationships and semantics within industrial parks. Alongside this, we present the IndustryScopeGPT framework, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte Carlo Tree Search to enhance tool-augmented reasoning and decision-making in Industrial Park Planning and Operation (IPPO). Our work significantly improves site recommendation and functional planning, demonstrating the potential of combining LLMs with structured datasets to advance industrial park management. This approach sets a new benchmark for intelligent IPPO research and lays a robust foundation for advancing urban industrial development. The dataset and related code are available at https://github.com/Tongji-KGLLM/IndustryScope.</description>

      <title>A Graph Neural Architecture Search Approach for Identifying Bots in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms, including X, Facebook, and Instagram, host millions of daily users, giving rise to bots-automated programs disseminating misinformation and ideologies with tangible real-world consequences. While bot detection in platform X has been the area of many deep learning models with adequate results, most approaches neglect the graph structure of social media relationships and often rely on hand-engineered architectures. Our work introduces the implementation of a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique, namely Deep and Flexible Graph Neural Architecture Search (DFG-NAS), tailored to Relational Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (RGCNs) in the task of bot detection in platform X. Our model constructs a graph that incorporates both the user relationships and their metadata. Then, DFG-NAS is adapted to automatically search for the optimal configuration of Propagation and Transformation functions in the RGCNs. Our experiments are conducted on the TwiBot-20 dataset, constructing a graph with 229,580 nodes and 227,979 edges. We study the five architectures with the highest performance during the search and achieve an accuracy of 85.7%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our approach not only addresses the bot detection challenge but also advocates for the broader implementation of NAS models in neural network design automation.</description>

      <title>Generating social networks with static and dynamic utility-maximization approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a conceptual framework that model human social networks as an undirected dot-product graph of independent individuals. Their relationships are only determined by a cost-benefit analysis, i.e. by maximizing an objective function at the scale of the individual or of the whole network. On this framework, we build a new artificial network generator in two versions. The first fits within the tradition of artificial network generators by being able to generate similar networks from empirical data. The second relaxes the computational efficiency constraint and implements the same micro-based decision algorithm, but in agent-based simulations with time and fully independent agents. This latter version enables social scientists to perform an in-depth analysis of the consequences of behavioral constraints affecting individuals on the network they form. This point is illustrated by a case study of imperfect information.</description>

      <title>The Virality of Hate Speech on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online hate speech is responsible for violent attacks such as, e.g., the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in 2018, thereby posing a significant threat to vulnerable groups and society in general. However, little is known about what makes hate speech on social media go viral. In this paper, we collect N = 25,219 cascades with 65,946 retweets from X (formerly known as Twitter) and classify them as hateful vs. normal. Using a generalized linear regression, we then estimate differences in the spread of hateful vs. normal content based on author and content variables. We thereby identify important determinants that explain differences in the spreading of hateful vs. normal content. For example, hateful content authored by verified users is disproportionally more likely to go viral than hateful content from non-verified ones: hateful content from a verified user (as opposed to normal content) has a 3.5 times larger cascade size, a 3.2 times longer cascade lifetime, and a 1.2 times larger structural virality. Altogether, we offer novel insights into the virality of hate speech on social media.</description>

      <title>Effects of Network Connectivity and Functional Diversity Distribution on Human Collective Ideation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human collective tasks in teams and organizations increasingly require participation of members with diverse backgrounds working in networked social environments. However, little is known about how network structure and the functional diversity of member backgrounds would interact with each other and affect collective processes. Here we conducted three sets of human-subject experiments which involved 617 university students who collaborated anonymously in a collective ideation task on a custom-made online social network platform. We found that spatially clustered collectives with assortative background distribution tended to explore more diverse ideas than in other conditions, whereas collectives with random background distribution consistently generated ideas with the highest utility. We also found that higher network connectivity may improve individuals' overall experience but may not improve the collective performance regarding idea generation, idea diversity, and final idea quality.</description>

      <title>Socio-spatial segregation and human mobility: A review of empirical evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Socio-spatial segregation is the physical separation of different social, economic, or demographic groups within a geographic space, often resulting in unequal access to resources, services, and opportunities. The literature has traditionally focused on residential segregation, examining how individuals' residential locations are distributed differently across neighborhoods based on various social attributes, e.g., race, ethnicity, and income. However, this approach overlooks the complexity of spatial segregation in people's daily activities, which often extend far beyond residential areas. Since the 2010s, emerging mobility data sources have enabled a new understanding of socio-spatial segregation by considering daily activities such as work, school, shopping, and leisure visits. From traditional surveys to GPS trajectories, diverse data sources reveal that daily mobility can result in spatial segregation levels that differ from those observed in residential segregation. This literature review focuses on three critical questions: (a) What are the strengths and limitations of segregation research incorporating extensive mobility data? (b) How do human mobility patterns relate to individuals' residential vs. experienced segregation levels? and (c) What key factors explain the relationship between one's mobility patterns and experienced segregation? Our literature review enhances the understanding of socio-spatial segregation at the individual level and clarifies core concepts and methodological challenges in the field. Our review explores studies of key themes: segregation, activity space, co-presence, and the built environment. By synthesizing their findings, we aim to offer actionable insights for reducing segregation.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Echo Chamber Research: Comparative Analysis of Conceptualizations, Operationalizations, and Varying Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This systematic review synthesizes current research on echo chambers and filter bubbles to highlight the reasons for the dissent in echo chamber research on the existence, antecedents, and effects of the phenomenon. The review of 112 studies reveals that the lack of consensus in echo chamber research is based on different conceptualizations and operationalizations of echo chambers. While studies that have conceptualized echo chambers with homophily and utilized data-driven computational social science (CSS) methods have confirmed the echo chamber hypothesis and polarization effects in social media, content exposure studies and surveys that have explored the full spectrum of media exposure have rejected it.
  Most of these studies have been conducted in the United States, and the review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how echo chambers work in systems with more than two parties and outside the Global North. To advance our understanding of this phenomenon, future research should prioritize conducting more cross-platform studies, considering algorithmic filtering changes through continuous auditing, and examining the causal direction of the association between polarization, fragmentation, and the establishment of online echo chambers. The review also provides the advantages and disadvantages of different operationalizations and makes recommendations for studies in the European Union (EU), which will become possible with the upcoming Digital Services Act (DSA). Overall, this systematic review contributes to the ongoing scholarly discussion on the existence, antecedents, and effects of echo chambers and filter bubbles.</description>

      <title>Generative AI may backfire for counterspeech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online hate speech poses a serious threat to individual well-being and societal cohesion. A promising solution to curb online hate speech is counterspeech. Counterspeech is aimed at encouraging users to reconsider hateful posts by direct replies. However, current methods lack scalability due to the need for human intervention or fail to adapt to the specific context of the post. A potential remedy is the use of generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to write tailored counterspeech messages. In this paper, we analyze whether contextualized counterspeech generated by state-of-the-art LLMs is effective in curbing online hate speech. To do so, we conducted a large-scale, pre-registered field experiment (N=2,664) on the social media platform Twitter/X. Our experiment followed a 2x2 between-subjects design and, additionally, a control condition with no counterspeech. On the one hand, users posting hateful content on Twitter/X were randomly assigned to receive either (a) contextualized counterspeech or (b) non-contextualized counterspeech. Here, the former is generated through LLMs, while the latter relies on predefined, generic messages. On the other hand, we tested two counterspeech strategies: (a) promoting empathy and (b) warning about the consequences of online misbehavior. We then measured whether users deleted their initial hateful posts and whether their behavior changed after the counterspeech intervention (e.g., whether users adopted a less toxic language). We find that non-contextualized counterspeech employing a warning-of-consequence strategy significantly reduces online hate speech. However, contextualized counterspeech generated by LLMs proves ineffective and may even backfire.</description>

      <title>Personality Profiling: How informative are social media profiles in predicting personal information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personality profiling has been utilised by companies for targeted advertising, political campaigns and public health campaigns. However, the accuracy and versatility of such models remains relatively unknown. Here we explore the extent to which peoples' online digital footprints can be used to profile their Myers-Briggs personality type. We analyse and compare four models: logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests. We discover that a SVM model achieves the best accuracy of 20.95% for predicting a complete personality type. However, logistic regression models perform only marginally worse and are significantly faster to train and perform predictions. Moreover, we develop a statistical framework for assessing the importance of different sets of features in our models. We discover some features to be more informative than others in the Intuitive/Sensory (p = 0.032) and Thinking/Feeling (p = 0.019) models. Many labelled datasets present substantial class imbalances of personal characteristics on social media, including our own. We therefore highlight the need for attentive consideration when reporting model performance on such datasets and compare a number of methods to fix class-imbalance problems.</description>

      <title>A GAN Approach for Node Embedding in Heterogeneous Graphs Using Subgraph Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) face significant challenges with class imbalance, leading to biased inference results. To address this issue in heterogeneous graphs, we propose a novel framework that combines Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to enhance classification for underrepresented node classes. The framework incorporates an advanced edge generation and selection module, enabling the simultaneous creation of synthetic nodes and edges through adversarial learning. Unlike previous methods, which predominantly focus on homogeneous graphs due to the difficulty of representing heterogeneous graph structures in matrix form, this approach is specifically designed for heterogeneous data. Existing solutions often rely on pre-trained models to incorporate synthetic nodes, which can lead to optimization inconsistencies and mismatches in data representation. Our framework avoids these pitfalls by generating data that aligns closely with the inherent graph topology and attributes, ensuring a more cohesive integration. Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the method's superiority over baseline models, particularly in tasks focused on identifying minority node classes, with notable improvements in performance metrics such as F-score and AUC-PRC score. These findings highlight the potential of this approach for addressing critical challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation for Supervised Graph Outlier Detection via Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge confronting supervised graph outlier detection algorithms is the prevalent problem of class imbalance, where the scarcity of outlier instances compared to normal instances often results in suboptimal performance. Recently, generative models, especially diffusion models, have demonstrated their efficacy in synthesizing high-fidelity images. Despite their extraordinary generation quality, their potential in data augmentation for supervised graph outlier detection remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GODM, a novel data augmentation for mitigating class imbalance in supervised Graph Outlier detection via latent Diffusion Models. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of GODM. The case study further demonstrated the generation quality of our synthetic data. To foster accessibility and reproducibility, we encapsulate GODM into a plug-and-play package and release it at PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/godm/.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Stance Detection on Social Media: New Directions and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern digital environments, users frequently express opinions on contentious topics, providing a wealth of information on prevailing attitudes. The systematic analysis of these opinions offers valuable insights for decision-making in various sectors, including marketing and politics. As a result, stance detection has emerged as a crucial subfield within affective computing, enabling the automatic detection of user stances in social media conversations and providing a nuanced understanding of public sentiment on complex issues. Recent years have seen a surge of research interest in developing effective stance detection methods, with contributions from multiple communities, including natural language processing, web science, and social computing. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of stance detection techniques on social media, covering task definitions, datasets, approaches, and future works. We review traditional stance detection models, as well as state-of-the-art methods based on large language models, and discuss their strengths and limitations. Our survey highlights the importance of stance detection in understanding public opinion and sentiment, and identifies gaps in current research. We conclude by outlining potential future directions for stance detection on social media, including the need for more robust and generalizable models, and the importance of addressing emerging challenges such as multi-modal stance detection and stance detection in low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Enriching GNNs with Text Contextual Representations for Detecting Disinformation Campaigns on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disinformation on social media poses both societal and technical challenges, requiring robust detection systems. While previous studies have integrated textual information into propagation networks, they have yet to fully leverage the advancements in Transformer-based language models for high-quality contextual text representations. This work addresses this gap by incorporating Transformer-based textual features into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fake news detection. We demonstrate that contextual text representations enhance GNN performance, achieving 33.8% relative improvement in Macro F1 over models without textual features and 9.3% over static text representations. We further investigate the impact of different feature sources and the effects of noisy data augmentation. We expect our methodology to open avenues for further research, and we made code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Urban Morphogenesis: A Morphospace Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cities emerged independently across different world regions and historical periods, raising fundamental questions: How did the first urban settlements develop? What social and spatial conditions enabled their emergence? Are these processes universal or context-dependent? Moreover, what distinguishes cities from other human settlements? This paper investigates the drivers behind the creation of cities through a hybrid approach that integrates urban theory, the biological concept of morphospace (the space of all possible configurations), and archaeological evidence. It explores the transition from sedentary hunter-gatherer communities to urban societies, highlighting fundamental forces converging to produce increasingly complex divisions of labour as a central driver of urbanization. Morphogenesis is conceptualized as a trajectory through morphospace, governed by structure-seeking selection processes that balance density, permeability, and information as critical dimensions. The study highlights the non-ergodic nature of urban morphogenesis, where configurations are progressively selected based on their fitness to support the diversifying interactions between mutually dependent agents. The morphospace framework effectively distinguishes between theoretical spatial configurations, non-urban and proto-urban settlements, and contemporary cities. This analysis supports the proposition that cities emerge and evolve as solutions balancing density, permeability, and informational organization, enabling them to support increasingly complex societal functions.</description>
