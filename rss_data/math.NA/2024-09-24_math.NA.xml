      <title>Asymptotic error distribution of accelerated exponential Euler method for parabolic SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic error distribution of numerical methods applied to stochastic ordinary differential equations has been well studied, which characterizes the evolution pattern of the error distribution in the small step-size regime. It is still open for stochastic partial differential equations whether the normalized error process of numerical methods admits a nontrivial limit distribution. We answer this question by presenting the asymptotic error distribution of the temporal accelerated exponential Euler (AEE) method when applied to parabolic stochastic partial differential equations. In order to overcome the difficulty caused by the infinite-dimensional setting, we establish a uniform approximation theorem for convergence in distribution. Based on it, we derive the limit distribution of the normalized error process of the AEE method by studying the limit distribution of its certain appropriate finite-dimensional approximation process. As applications of our main result, the asymptotic error distribution of a fully discrete AEE method for the original equation and that of the AEE method for a stochastic ordinary differential equation are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Inf-Sup Stability of Parabolic TraceFEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a parabolic inf-sup theory for a modified TraceFEM semi-discretization in space of the heat equation posed on a stationary surface embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We consider the normal derivative volume stabilization and add an $L^2$-type stabilization to the time derivative. We assume that the representation of and the integration over the surface are exact, however, all our results are independent of how the surface cuts the bulk mesh. For any mesh for which the method is well-defined, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for inf-sup stability of the proposed TraceFEM in terms of $H^1$-stability of a stabilized $L^2$-projection and of an inverse inequality constant that accounts for the lack of conformity of TraceFEM. Furthermore, we prove that the latter two quantities are bounded uniformly for a sequence of shape-regular and quasi-uniform bulk meshes. We derive several consequences of uniform discrete inf-sup stability, namely uniform well-posedness, discrete maximal parabolic regularity, parabolic quasi-best approximation, convergence to minimal regularity solutions, and optimal order-regularity energy and $L^2 L^2$ error estimates. We show that the additional stabilization of the time derivative restores optimal conditioning of time-discrete TraceFEM typical of fitted discretizations.</description>

      <title>Periodic micromagnetic finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic micromagnetic finite element method (PM-FEM) is introduced to solve periodic unit cell problems using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. PM-FEM is applicable to general problems with 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities. PM-FEM is based on a non-periodic FEM-based micromagnetic solver and extends it in several aspects to account for periodicities, including the computation of exchange and magnetostatic fields. For the exchange field, PM-FEM modifies the sparse matrix construction for computing the Laplace operator to include additional elements arising due to the periodicities. For the magnetostatic field, the periodic extensions include modifications in the local operators, such as gradient, divergence, and surface magnetic charges as well as the long-range superposition operator for computing the periodic scalar potential. The local operators are extended to account for the periodicities similar to handling the Laplace operator. For the long-range superposition operator, PM-FEM utilizes a periodic Green's function (PGF) and fast spatial convolutions. The PGF is computed rapidly via exponentially rapidly convergent sums. The spatial convolutions are accomplished via a modified fast Fourier transform based adaptive integral method that allows calculating spatial convolutions with non-uniform meshes in $O(N\log N)$ numerical operations. PM-FEM is implemented on CPU and GPU based computer architectures. PM-FEM allows efficiently handling cases of structures contained withing the periodic unit cell touching or not touching its boundaries as well as structures that protrude beyond the unit cell boundaries. PM-FEM is demonstrated to have about the same or even higher performance than its parent non-periodic code. The demonstrated numerical examples show the efficiency of PM-FEM for highly complex structures with 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities.</description>

      <title>Superconvergence of the local discontinuous Galerkin method with generalized numerical fluxes for one-dimensional linear time-dependent fourth-order equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we concentrate on the superconvergence of the local discontinuous Galerkin method with generalized numerical fluxes for one-dimensional linear time-dependent fourth-order equations. The adjustable numerical viscosity of the generalized numerical fluxes is beneficial for long time simulations with a slower error growth. By using generalized Gauss--Radau projections and correction functions together with a suitable numerical initial condition, we derive, for polynomials of degree $k$, $(2k+1)$th order superconvergence for the numerical flux and cell averages, $(k+2)$th order superconvergence at generalized Radau points, and $(k+1)$th order for error derivative at generalized Radau points. Moreover, a supercloseness result of order $(k+2)$ is established between the generalized Gauss--Radau projection and the numerical solution. Superconvergence analysis of mixed boundary conditions is also given. Equations with discontinuous initial condition and nonlinear convection term are numerically investigated, illustrating that the conclusions are valid for more general cases.</description>

      <title>High-order Space-time Flux Reconstruction Methods for Moving Domain Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-order space-time flux reconstruction (FR) method has been developed to solve conservation laws on moving domains. In the space-time framework, the moving domain simulation is similar to that on a stationary domain, except that the shape of the space-time elements varies with time (and space when a deforming grid is used). The geometric conservation law can be automatically satisfied to the level of the numerical resolution of the space-time schemes when the space-time discretization of the governing partial differential equations can resolve the geometric nonlinearity of curvilinear space-time elements. In this study, a space-time tensor product operation is used to construct the FR formulation, and the Gauss-Legendre quadrature points are used as solution points both in space and time. A dual time stepping method is used to solve the resulting space-time system. As has been proved by Huynh [J Sci Comput 96, 51 (2023)], in the temporal direction, the FR scheme with the Gauss-Legendre solution points is equivalent to the so-called DG-Gauss implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) scheme when the quadrature rule based on the solution points (i.e. quadrature points used in DG) is sufficiently accurate to integrate the space-time curvilinear elements. Specifically, we show that when linear space-time elements are adopted in moving domain simulations, the temporal FR scheme based on Gauss-Legendre solution points can always guarantee its equivalency to IRK DG-Gauss. The conditions, under which the moving domain simulation with the method of lines are consistent with those using the space-time formulation, are also discussed. The new space-time FR method can achieve arbitrarily high-order spatial and temporal accuracy without numerical constraints on the physical time step in moving domain simulations. The temporal superconvergence property for moving domain simulations have been demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The travel time tomography problem is a coefficient inverse problem for the eikonal equation. This problem has well known applications in seismic. The eikonal equation is considered here in the circular cylinder, where point sources run along its axis and measurements of travel times are conductes on the whole surface of this cylinder. A new version of the globally convergent convexification numerical method for this problem is developed. Results of numerical studies are presented.</description>

      <title>On structure preservation for fully discrete finite difference schemes of stochastic heat equation with L\'evy space-time white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structure preservation and convergence analysis of a class of fully discrete finite difference schemes for the stochastic heat equation driven by L\'evy space-time white noise. The novelty lies in the simultaneous preservation of intrinsic structures for the exact solution, in particular the weak intermittency of moments and the regularity of c\`adl\`ag path in negative fractional Sobolev spaces. The key in the proof is the detailed analysis of technical estimates for discrete Green functions of the numerical solution. This analysis is also crucial in establishing the mean-square convergence of the schemes with orders of almost $\frac12$ in space and almost $\frac14$ in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we comprehensively characterize the proximal operator of the $\ell_{1,q}$-norm with $0\!&lt;\!q\!&lt;\!1$ by exploiting the well-known proximal operator of the $\ell_q$-norm on the real line. In particular, much more explicit characterizations can be obtained whenever $q\!=\!1/2$ and $q\!=\!2/3$ due to the existence of closed-form expressions for the proximal operators of the $\ell_{1/2}$- and $\ell_{2/3}$-norms. Numerical experiments demonstrate potential advantages of the $\ell_{1,q}$-regularization in the group sparse vector recovery.</description>

      <title>Achieving $h$- and $p$-robust monolithic multigrid solvers for the Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical analysis of higher-order mixed finite-element discretizations for saddle-point problems, such as the Stokes equations, has been well-studied in recent years. While the theory and practice of such discretizations is now well-understood, the same cannot be said for efficient preconditioners for solving the resulting linear (or linearized) systems of equations. In this work, we propose and study variants of the well-known Vanka relaxation scheme that lead to effective geometric multigrid preconditioners for both the conforming Taylor-Hood discretizations and non-conforming ${\bf H}(\text{div})$-$L^2$ discretizations of the Stokes equations. Numerical results demonstrate robust performance with respect to FGMRES iteration counts for increasing polynomial order for some of the considered discretizations, and expose open questions about stopping tolerances for effectively preconditioned iterations at high polynomial order.</description>

      <title>Quasi-interpolation for high-dimensional function approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a general quasi-interpolation scheme for high-dimensional function approximation. To facilitate error analysis, we view our quasi-interpolation as a two-step procedure. In the first step, we approximate a target function by a purpose-built convolution operator (with an error term referred to as convolution error). In the second step, we discretize the underlying convolution operator using certain quadrature rules at the given sampling data sites (with an error term called discretization error). The final approximation error is obtained as an optimally balanced sum of these two errors, which in turn views our quasi-interpolation as a regularization technique that balances convolution error and discretization error. As a concrete example, we construct a sparse grid quasi-interpolation scheme for high-dimensional function approximation. Both theoretical analysis and numerical implementations provide evidence that our quasi-interpolation scheme is robust and capable of mitigating the curse of dimensionality for approximating high-dimensional functions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider p and hp least-squares spectral element methods for one-dimensional elliptic boundary layer problems. We derive stability estimates and design a numerical scheme based on minimizing the residuals in the sense of least squares in appropriate Sobolev norms. We prove parameter robust uniform error estimates i.e. error in the approximation is independent of the boundary layer parameter. For the p-version we prove a robust uniform convergence rate of O(sqrt(log W)/W) in the H2-norm, where W denotes the polynomial order used in approximation and for the hp-version the convergence rate is shown to be O(e^(-W/logW)). Numerical results are presented for a number of model elliptic boundary layer problems confirming the theoretical estimates and uniform convergence results for the p and hp versions.</description>

      <title>Deflation Techniques for Finding Multiple Local Minima of a Nonlinear Least Squares Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the technique of deflation to define two new methods to systematically find many local minima of a nonlinear least squares problem. The methods are based on the Gauss-Newton algorithm, and as such do not require the calculation of a Hessian matrix. They also require fewer deflations than for applying the deflated Newton method on the first order optimality conditions, as the latter finds all stationary points, not just local minima. One application of interest covered in this paper is the inverse eigenvalue problem (IEP) associated with the modelling of spectroscopic data of relevance to the physical and chemical sciences.

      <title>Unconditional energy stable IEQ-FEMs for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose several unconditionally energy stable invariant energy quadratization (IEQ) finite element methods (FEMs) to solve the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations. The time discretization of these IEQ-FEMs is based on the first- and second-order backward differentiation methods. The intermediate function introduced by the IEQ approach is positioned in different function spaces: the continuous function space, and a combination of the continuous function and finite element spaces. These methods offer distinct advantages. Consequently, we propose a new hybrid IEQ-FEM that combines the strengths of both schemes, offering computational efficiency and unconditional energy stability in the finite element space. We provide rigorous proofs of mass conservation and energy dissipation for the proposed IEQ-FEMs. Several numerical experiments are presented to validate the accuracy, efficiency, and solution properties of the proposed IEQ-FEMs.</description>

      <title>A convergent scheme for the Bayesian filtering problem based on the Fokker--Planck equation and deep splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical scheme for approximating the nonlinear filtering density is introduced and its convergence rate is established, theoretically under a parabolic H\"{o}rmander condition, and empirically for two examples. For the prediction step, between the noisy and partial measurements at discrete times, the scheme approximates the Fokker--Planck equation with a deep splitting scheme, and performs an exact update through Bayes' formula. This results in a classical prediction-update filtering algorithm that operates online for new observation sequences post-training. The algorithm employs a sampling-based Feynman--Kac approach, designed to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Our convergence proof relies on the Malliavin integration-by-parts formula. As a corollary we obtain the convergence rate for the approximation of the Fokker--Planck equation alone, disconnected from the filtering problem.</description>

      <title>BDF schemes for accelerated gradient flows in projection-free approximation of nonconvex constrained variational minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of novel accelerated gradient flow methods for solving quadratic energy minimization problems with nonconvex constraints. Our algorithms are built on novel evolutionary equations that combine projection-free approximations for nonconvex constraints with first- and higher-order backward differentiation formulas (BDFs) for {artificial} temporal derivatives. We focus on examining the asymptotic consistency of constraints achieved by the accelerated gradient flow using the BDF schemes. Both unconditional and conditional high-order estimates for constraint violations in these schemes are established. Numerical results not only validate our theoretical findings but also demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing gradient flow approaches in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Homogenization principle and numerical analysis for fractional stochastic differential equations with different scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with fractional stochastic differential equations with different scales. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for Caputo fractional stochastic differential systems under the non-Lipschitz condition. Based on the idea of temporal homogenization, we prove that the homogenization principle (averaging principle) holds in the sense of mean square ($L^2$ norm) convergence under a novel homogenization assumption. Furthermore, an Euler-Maruyama scheme for the non-autonomous system is constructed and its numerical error is analyzed. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to verify the theoretical results. Different from the existing literature, we demonstrate the computational advantages of the homogenized autonomous system from a numerical perspective.</description>

      <title>Fastest quotient iteration with variational principles for self-adjoint eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the generalized eigenvalue problem, a quotient function is devised for estimating eigenvalues in terms of an approximate eigenvector. This gives rise to an infinite family of quotients, all entirely arguable to be used in estimation. Although the Rayleigh quotient is among them, one can suggest using it only in an auxiliary manner for choosing the quotient for near optimal results. In normal eigenvalue problems, for any approximate eigenvector, there always exists a "perfect" quotient exactly giving an eigenvalue. For practical estimates in the self-adjoint case, an approximate midpoint of the spectrum is a good choice for reformulating the eigenvalue problem yielding apparently the fastest quotient iterative method there exists. No distinction is made between estimating extreme or interior eigenvalues. Preconditioning from the left results in changing the inner-product and affects the estimates accordingly. Preconditioning from the right preserves self-adjointness and can hence be performed without any restrictions. It is used in variational methods for optimally computing approximate eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Multiscale scattered data analysis in samplet coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multiscale scattered data interpolation schemes for globally supported radial basis functions, with a focus on the Mat\'ern class. The multiscale approximation is constructed through a sequence of residual corrections, where radial basis functions with different lengthscale parameters are employed to capture varying levels of detail. To apply this approach to large data sets, we suggest to represent the resulting generalized Vandermonde matrices in samplet coordinates. Samplets are localized, discrete signed measures exhibiting vanishing moments and allow for the sparse approximation of generalized Vandermonde matrices issuing from a vast class of radial basis functions. Given a quasi-uniform set of $N$ data sites, and local approximation spaces with geometrically decreasing dimension, the full multiscale system can be assembled with cost $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$. We prove that the condition numbers of the linear systems at each level remain bounded independent of the particular level, allowing us to use an iterative solver with a bounded number of iterations for the numerical solution. Hence, the overall cost of the proposed approach is $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$. The theoretical findings are accompanied by extensive numerical studies in two and three spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>A multi-fidelity adaptive dynamical low-rank based optimization algorithm for fission criticality problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the dominant eigenvalue is important in nuclear systems as it determines the stability of the system (i.e. whether the system is sub or supercritical). Recently, the work of Kusch, Whewell, McClarren and Frank \cite{KWMF} showed that performing a low-rank approximation can be very effective in reducing the high memory requirement and computational cost of such problems. In this work, we propose a rank adaptive approach that changes the rank during the inverse power iteration. This allows us to progressively increase the rank (i.e. changing the fidelity of the model) as we get closer to convergence, thereby further reducing computational cost. We then exploit this multi-fidelity approach to optimize a simplified nuclear reactor. In this case the system is parameterized and the values of the parameters that give criticality are sought.</description>

Abstract: We develop a simple two-step algorithm for enclosing Chebyshev expansions whose cost is linear in terms of the polynomial degree. The algorithm first transforms the expansion from Chebyshev to the Laurent basis and then applies the interval Horner method. It outperforms the existing eigenvalue-based methods if the degree is high or the evaluation point is close to the boundaries of the domain.</description>

      <title>A DOFs condensation based algorithm for solving saddle point systems in contact computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contact mechanics computation, the constraint conditions on the contact surfaces are typically enforced by the Lagrange multiplier method, resulting in a saddle point system. The mortar finite element method is usually employed to discretize the variational form on the meshed contact surfaces, leading to a large-scale discretized saddle point system. Due to the indefiniteness of the discretized system, it is a challenge to solve the saddle point algebraic system. For two-dimensional tied contact problem, an efficient DOFs condensation technique is developed. The essential of the proposed method is to carry out the DOFs elimination by using the tridiagonal characteristic of the mortar matrix. The scale of the linear system obtained after DOFs elimination is smaller, and the matrix is symmetric positive definite. By using the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method, the linear system can be solved efficiently. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>Sketched Lanczos uncertainty score: a low-memory summary of the Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current uncertainty quantification is memory and compute expensive, which hinders practical uptake. To counter, we develop Sketched Lanczos Uncertainty (SLU): an architecture-agnostic uncertainty score that can be applied to pre-trained neural networks with minimal overhead. Importantly, the memory use of SLU only grows logarithmically with the number of model parameters. We combine Lanczos' algorithm with dimensionality reduction techniques to compute a sketch of the leading eigenvectors of a matrix. Applying this novel algorithm to the Fisher information matrix yields a cheap and reliable uncertainty score. Empirically, SLU yields well-calibrated uncertainties, reliably detects out-of-distribution examples, and consistently outperforms existing methods in the low-memory regime.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the study of the electrodynamics of particles, we propose in this work an arbitrary-order discrete de Rham scheme for the treatment of elliptic problems with potential and flux jumps across a fixed interface. The scheme seamlessly supports general elements resulting from the cutting of a background mesh along the interface. Interface conditions are enforced weakly \`a la Nitsche. We provide a rigorous convergence of analysis of the scheme for a steady model problem and showcase an application to a physical problem inspired by the Leaky Dielectric Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the software package Cucheb, a GPU implementation of the filtered Lanczos procedure for the solution of large sparse symmetric eigenvalue problems. The filtered Lanczos procedure uses a carefully chosen polynomial spectral transformation to accelerate convergence of the Lanczos method when computing eigenvalues within a desired interval. This method has proven particularly effective for eigenvalue problems that arise in electronic structure calculations and density functional theory. We compare our implementation against an equivalent CPU implementation and show that using the GPU can reduce the computation time by more than a factor of 10.</description>

Abstract: In contact mechanics computation, the constraint conditions on the contact surfaces are typically enforced by the Lagrange multiplier method, resulting in a saddle point system. Given that the saddle point matrix is indefinite, solving these systems presents significant challenges. For a two-dimensional tied contact problem, an efficient two-level preconditioning method is developed. This method utilizes physical quantities for coarsening, introducing two types of interpolation operators and corresponding smoothing algorithms. Additionally, the constructed coarse grid operator exhibits symmetry and positive definiteness, adequately reflecting the contact constraints. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sketch-and-solve is a powerful paradigm for tackling large-scale computational problems by reducing their dimensionality using sketching matrices. This paper focuses on applying sketch-and-solve algorithms to efficiently solve the overdetermined least squares problem, which is fundamental in various domains such as machine learning, signal processing, and numerical optimization. We provide a comprehensive overview of the sketch-and-solve paradigm and analyze different sketching operators, including dense and sparse variants. We introduce the Sketch-and-Apply (SAA-SAS) algorithm, which leverages randomized numerical linear algebra techniques to compute approximate solutions efficiently. Through extensive experiments on large-scale least squares problems, we demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the traditional Least-Squares QR (LSQR) algorithm in terms of runtime while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of sketch-and-solve techniques in efficiently handling large-scale numerical linear algebra problems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the discrete-time approximation schemes for a class of backward stochastic differential equations driven by $G$-Brownian motion ($G$-BSDEs) which corresponds to the hedging pricing of European contingent claims. By introducing an auxiliary extended $\widetilde{G}$-expectation space, we propose a class of $\theta$-schemes to discrete $G$-BSDEs in this space. With the help of nonlinear stochastic analysis techniques and numerical analysis tools, we prove that our schemes admit half-order convergence for approximating $G$-BSDE in the general case. In some special cases, our schemes can achieve a first-order convergence rate. Finally, we give an implementable numerical scheme for $G$-BSDEs based on Peng's central limit theorem and illustrate our convergence results with numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: We develop a shape-Newton method for solving generic free-boundary problems where one of the free-boundary conditions is governed by the Bernoulli equation. The Newton-like scheme is developed by employing shape derivatives in the weak forms, which allows us to update the position of the free surface and the potential on the free boundary by solving a boundary-value problem at each iteration. To validate the effectiveness of the approach, we apply the scheme to solve a problem involving the flow over a submerged triangular obstacle.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the kinetic chemotaxis kernel using macroscopic data: well-posedness and ill-posedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05004v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacterial motion is steered by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is called chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, it is inferred by experimental data. We deploy a PDE-constrained optimization framework to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how invariant subspaces corresponding to a single eigenvalue will change when a matrix is perturbed. We focus on the invariant subspaces corresponding to an eigenvalue associated with the Jordan blocks that have the same size. An invariant subspace can be expressed as the range of a full column matrix. We characterize the perturbed invariant subspaces with such matrices expressed in a sum form that exhibits the fractional orders. We also provide the formulas for the coefficient matrices associated with the zero and first fractional orders. The results extend the standard invariant subspace perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Augmenting MRI scan data with real-time predictions of glioblastoma brain tumor evolution using faster exponential time integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a MATLAB code for exponential integrators method simulating the glioblastoma tumor growth. It employs the Fisher-Kolmogorov diffusion-reaction tumor brain model with logistic growth. The input is the MRI scans of the human head and the initial tumor location. The simulation uses the finite difference formulation in space and the ultra-fast exponential integrators method in time. The output from the code is the input data for ParaView visualization. While there are many brain tumor simulation codes, our method's novelty lies in its implementation using exponential integrators. We propose a new algorithm for the fast computation of exponential integrators. Regarding execution time on a laptop with Win10, using MATLAB, with 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11500H, 2.92 GHz, and 32 GB of RAM, the algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art routines from [A. Al-Mohy, N. Higham, Computing the action of the matrix exponential, with an application to exponential integrators. SIAM Journal On Scientific Computing (33) 488-511 (2011)]. We also compare our method with an implicit, unconditionally stable Crank-Nicolson time integration scheme based on the finite difference method. We show that our method is two orders of magnitude faster than the Crank-Nicolson method with finite difference discretization in space on a laptop equipped with MATLAB. The brain tumor two-year future prediction using 128x128x128 computational grid and 100-time steps, built over the MRI scans of the human head, takes less than 10 minutes on the laptop.</description>

      <title>Graph-based methods for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws using discontinuous space discretizations, Part I: building blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a graph-based numerical method for solving hyperbolic systems of conservation laws using discontinuous finite elements. This work fills important gaps in the theory as well as practice of graph-based schemes. In particular, four building blocks required for the implementation of flux-limited graph-based methods are developed and tested: a first-order method with mathematical guarantees of robustness; a high-order method based on the entropy viscosity technique; a procedure to compute local bounds; and a convex limiting scheme. Two important features of the current work are the fact that (i) boundary conditions are incorporated into the mathematical theory as well as the implementation of the scheme. For instance, the first-order version of the scheme satisfies pointwise entropy inequalities including boundary effects for any boundary data that is admissible; (ii) sub-cell limiting is built into the convex limiting framework. This is in contrast to the majority of the existing methodologies that consider a single limiter per cell providing no sub-cell limiting capabilities.
  From a practical point of view, the implementation of graph-based methods is algebraic, meaning that they operate directly on the stencil of the spatial discretization. In principle, these methods do not need to use or invoke loops on cells or faces of the mesh. Finally, we verify convergence rates on various well-known test problems with differing regularity. We propose a simple test in order to verify the implementation of boundary conditions and their convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Rectified deep neural networks overcome the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of gradient-dependent semilinear heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical experiments indicate that deep learning algorithms overcome the curse of dimensionality when approximating solutions of semilinear PDEs. For certain linear PDEs and semilinear PDEs with gradient-independent nonlinearities this has also been proved mathematically, i.e., it has been shown that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN increases at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\epsilon\in (0,1)$. The main contribution of this paper is to rigorously prove for the first time that deep neural networks can also overcome the curse dimensionality in the approximation of a certain class of nonlinear PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>MgFNO: Multi-grid Architecture Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In science and engineering, there is often a need to repeatedly solve large-scale and high-resolution partial differential equations (PDEs). Neural operators are a new model that can map between function spaces, allowing trained models to emulate PDE solution operators. This paper introduces a novel Fourier neural operator with a multigrid architecture (MgFNO). The MgFNO combines the frequency principle of deep neural networks (DNNs) with the multigrid idea of solving linear systems. To speed up the FNO training process, a three-layer V-cycle multigrid architecture is used. This architecture involves training the model multiple times on a coarse grid and then transferring it to a fine grid to accelerate the training of the model. The solver based on DNN learns the solution from low to high frequency, while the multigrid method acquires the solution from high to low frequency. Note that the FNO is a resolution-invariant solution operator, so the corresponding calculations are greatly simplified. Finally, experiments are carried out on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The results show that the proposed MgFNO outperforms the traditional Fourier neural operator.

      <title>Generating customized field concentration via virtual surface transmission resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for generating strong customized field concentration locally around the inhomogeneous medium inclusion via surface transmission resonance. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that for a given inclusion embedded in an otherwise uniformly homogeneous background space, we can design an incident field to generate strong localized field concentration at any specified places around the inclusion. The aforementioned customized field concentration is crucially reliant on the peculiar spectral and geometric patterns of certain transmission eigenfunctions. Secondly, we prove the existence of a sequence of transmission eigenfunctions for a specific wavenumber and they exhibit distinct surface resonant behaviors, accompanying strong surface-localization and surface-oscillation properties. These eigenfunctions as the surface transmission resonant modes fulfill the requirement for generating the field concentration.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithms for Fourier extension based on boundary interval data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a new algorithm for the computation of Fourier extension based on boundary data, which can obtain a super-algebraic convergent Fourier approximation for non-periodic functions. The algorithm calculates the extended part using the boundary interval data and then combines it with the original data to form the data of the extended function within a period. By testing the key parameters involved, their influences on the algorithm was clarified and an optimization setting scheme for the parameters was proposed. Compared with FFT, the algorithm only needs to increase the computational complexity by a small amount. Then, an improved algorithm for the boundary oscillation function is proposed. By refining the boundary grid, the resolution constant of the boundary oscillation function was reduced to approximately 1/4 of the original method.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we illustrate the connection between adaptive mesh refinement for finite element discretized PDEs and the recently developed \emph{bi-level regularization algorithm}. By adaptive mesh refinement according to data noise, regularization effect and convergence are immediate consequences. We moreover demonstrate its numerical advantages to the classical Landweber algorithm in term of time and reconstruction quality for the example of the Helmholtz equation in an aeroacoustic setting.</description>

      <title>A node-based uniform strain virtual element method for elastoplastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently proposed node-based uniform strain virtual element method (NVEM) is here extended to small strain elastoplastic solids. In the proposed method, the strain is averaged at the nodes from the strain of surrounding linearly-precise virtual elements using a generalization to virtual elements of the node-based uniform strain approach for finite elements. The averaged strain is then used to sample the weak form at the nodes of the mesh leading to a method in which all the field variables, including state and history-dependent variables, are related to the nodes and thus they are tracked only at these locations during the nonlinear computations. Through various elastoplastic benchmark problems, we demonstrate that the NVEM is locking-free while enabling linearly-precise virtual elements to solve elastoplastic solids with accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Sparse Solvers for Severely Ill-Conditioned Linear Systems in Geophysical Marker-In-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving sparse linear systems is a critical challenge in many scientific and engineering fields, particularly when these systems are severely ill-conditioned. This work aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of various solvers designed for such problems, offering valuable insights and guidance for domain scientists and researchers. We develop the tools required to accurately evaluate the performance and correctness of 16 solvers from 11 state-of-the-art numerical libraries, focusing on their effectiveness in handling ill-conditioned matrices. The solvers were tested on linear systems arising from a coupled hydro-mechanical marker-in-cell geophysical simulation. To address the challenge of computing accurate error bounds on the solution, we introduce the Projected Adam method, a novel algorithm to efficiently compute the condition number of a matrix without relying on eigenvalues or singular values. Our benchmark results demonstrate that Intel oneAPI MKL PARDISO, UMFPACK, and MUMPS are the most reliable solvers for the tested scenarios. This work serves as a resource for selecting appropriate solvers, understanding the impact of condition numbers, and improving the robustness of numerical solutions in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Fast convergence of trust-regions for non-isolated minima via analysis of CG on indefinite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trust-region methods (TR) can converge quadratically to minima where the Hessian is positive definite. However, if the minima are not isolated, then the Hessian there cannot be positive definite. The weaker Polyak$\unicode{x2013}${\L}ojasiewicz (P{\L}) condition is compatible with non-isolated minima, and it is enough for many algorithms to preserve good local behavior. Yet, TR with an $\textit{exact}$ subproblem solver lacks even basic features such as a capture theorem under P{\L}.
  In practice, a popular $\textit{inexact}$ subproblem solver is the truncated conjugate gradient method (tCG). Empirically, TR-tCG exhibits super-linear convergence under P{\L}. We confirm this theoretically.
  The main mathematical obstacle is that, under P{\L}, at points arbitrarily close to minima, the Hessian has vanishingly small, possibly negative eigenvalues. Thus, tCG is applied to ill-conditioned, indefinite systems. Yet, the core theory underlying tCG is that of CG, which assumes a positive definite operator. Accordingly, we develop new tools to analyze the dynamics of CG in the presence of small eigenvalues of any sign, for the regime of interest to TR-tCG.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free neural topology optimization: Towards effective fracture-resistant designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-free optimizers allow for tackling problems regardless of the smoothness or differentiability of their objective function, but they require many more iterations to converge when compared to gradient-based algorithms. This has made them unviable for topology optimization due to the high computational cost per iteration and the high dimensionality of these problems. We propose a gradient-free neural topology optimization method using a pre-trained neural reparameterization strategy that addresses two key challenges in the literature. First, the method leads to at least one order of magnitude decrease in iteration count to reach minimum compliance when optimizing designs in latent space, as opposed to the conventional gradient-free approach without latent parameterization. This helps to bridge the large performance gap between gradient-free and gradient-based topology optimization for smooth and differentiable problems like compliance optimization, as demonstrated via extensive computational experiments in- and out-of-distribution with the training data. Second, we also show that the proposed method can optimize toughness of a structure undergoing brittle fracture more effectively than a traditional gradient-based optimizer, delivering an objective improvement in the order of 30% for all tested configurations. Although gradient-based topology optimization is more efficient for problems that are differentiable and well-behaved, such as compliance optimization, we believe that this work opens up a new path for problems where gradient-based algorithms have limitations.</description>

      <title>A highly accurate procedure for computing globally optimal Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the computation of localized molecular orbitals known as Wannier functions. In this manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical integration. Then a simple analytically computable correction is introduced to yield the optimally localized Wannier function. The resulting scheme is rapidly convergent and proven to produce globally optimal Wannier functions. The analysis in this manuscript can also be viewed as a proof of the existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions in one dimension. We illustrate the performance of the scheme by a number of numerical experiments.</description>
