      <title>Testing Spreading Behavior in Networks with Arbitrary Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the works of Goldreich and Ron (J. ACM, 2017) and Nakar and Ron (ICALP, 2021), we initiate the study of property testing in dynamic environments with arbitrary topologies. Our focus is on the simplest non-trivial rule that can be tested, which corresponds to the 1-BP rule of bootstrap percolation and models a simple spreading behavior: Every "infected" node stays infected forever, and each "healthy" node becomes infected if and only if it has at least one infected neighbor. We show various results for both the case where we test a single time step of evolution and where the evolution spans several time steps. In the first, we show that the worst-case query complexity is $O(\Delta/\varepsilon)$ or $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)$ (whichever is smaller), where $\Delta$ and $n$ are the maximum degree of a node and number of vertices, respectively, in the underlying graph, and we also show lower bounds for both one- and two-sided error testers that match our upper bounds up to $\Delta = o(\sqrt{n})$ and $\Delta = O(n^{1/3})$, respectively. In the second setting of testing the environment over $T$ time steps, we show upper bounds of $O(\Delta^{T-1}/\varepsilon T)$ and $\tilde{O}(|E|/\varepsilon T)$, where $E$ is the set of edges of the underlying graph. All of our algorithms are one-sided error, and all of them are also time-conforming and non-adaptive, with the single exception of the more complex $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)$-query tester for the case $T = 2$.</description>

      <title>A Note on Output Length of One-Way State Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the output length of one-way state generators (OWSGs), their weaker variants, and EFIs.
  - Standard OWSGs. Recently, Cavalar et al. (arXiv:2312.08363) give OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(\log \lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter, and conjecture that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. We prove their conjecture in a stronger manner by showing that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. This means that their construction is optimal in terms of output length.
  - Inverse-polynomial-advantage OWSGs. Let $\epsilon$-OWSGs be a parameterized variant of OWSGs where a quantum polynomial-time adversary's advantage is at most $\epsilon$. For any constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$, we construct $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with $((c+1)\log \lambda+O(1))$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with at most $(c\log \lambda-2)$-qubit outputs.
  - Constant-advantage OWSGs. For any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct $\epsilon$-OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of subexponentially secure OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $O(1)$-OWSGs with $((\log \log \lambda)/2+O(1))$-qubit outputs.
  - Weak OWSGs. We refer to $(1-1/\mathsf{poly}(\lambda))$-OWSGs as weak OWSGs. We construct weak OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(1)$ assuming the existence of exponentially secure OWFs with linear expansion. We show that this is tight by proving that there do not exist weak OWSGs with $O(1)$-qubit outputs.
  - EFIs. We show that there do not exist $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs. We show that this is tight by proving that there exist $\omega(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs assuming the existence of exponentially secure PRGs.</description>
