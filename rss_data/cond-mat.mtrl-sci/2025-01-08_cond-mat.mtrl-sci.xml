      <title>DenseGNN: universal and scalable deeper graph neural networks for high-performance property prediction in crystals and molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models generate vast numbers of hypothetical materials, necessitating fast, accurate models for property prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in this domain but face challenges like high training costs, domain adaptation issues, and over-smoothing. We introduce DenseGNN, which employs Dense Connectivity Network (DCN), Hierarchical Node-Edge-Graph Residual Networks (HRN), and Local Structure Order Parameters Embedding (LOPE) to address these challenges. DenseGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets such as JARVIS-DFT, Materials Project, and QM9, improving the performance of models like GIN, Schnet, and Hamnet on materials datasets. By optimizing atomic embeddings and reducing computational costs, DenseGNN enables deeper architectures and surpasses other GNNs in crystal structure distinction, approaching X-ray diffraction method accuracy. This advances materials discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of erbium crystal field splittings in oxide hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective ab initio method to calculate the crystal field coefficients of an erbium (Er3+) ion experiencing different local site symmetries in several wide-band-gap oxides, and then evaluate crystal field splittings of these Er3+ ions for their ground and excited states. The optical transitions between the ground state (Z) and excited state (Y) manifolds of the environmentally shielded 4f states of these Er3+ ions have wavelengths ~1.5 microns and thus have potential applications to quantum communications and quantum memories. These results are in excellent agreement with recent low-temperature measurements, provided the inadequate calculation of the 4f shell screening is adjusted by reducing the radial extent of the 4f wavefunctions by approximately a factor of 2.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of erbium crystal field splittings in oxide hosts: role of the 4f radial wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand here our description of a newly developed simple and effective ab initio method of calculating crystal field coefficients (CFCs) of rare-earth atoms in insulating hosts, focusing on Er in wide band gap oxide hosts MgO, ZnO, TiO$_2$, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$, which exemplify different local site symmetries. These hybrid functional calculations, which incorporate a portion of exact exchange from Hartree-Fock theory, reproduce the experimentally identified insulating band gaps of these oxides. The negative values of cohesive and formation energies confirm the structural and chemical stability of these oxides, whereas the defect formation energies indicate that Er doped ZnO, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$ are easier to form compared to Er doped MgO and TiO$_2$. Er doped in these oxide hosts exhibits a spin magnetic moment of $\sim$ 3 $\mu_B$ confirming the $3+$ valence state. The CFCs of these hosted Er are determined from charge densities and potentials obtained from non-spin-polarized calculations, involving a 4\textit{f} core approximation. These CFCs are subsequently used to solve an effective Hamiltonian and generate the crystal field splitting of Er 4f. These calculated Er 4f energy levels are in good agreement with available experiments.</description>

      <title>Space Charge Doping Induced Band Modulation in Mono- and Bi-layer Graphene: a nano-ARPES study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled modulation of electronic band structure in two-dimensional (2D) materials via doping is crucial for devices fabrication. For instance doped graphene has been envisaged for various applications like sensors, super-capacitors, transistors, p-n junctions, photo-detectors, etc. Many different techniques have been developed to achieve desired doping in 2D materials, like chemical doping, electrostatic doping, substrate doping, etc. Here, we have combined space charge doping with space and angle resolved photoemission (nano-ARPES), in order to directly observe the Fermi level modulation on micron-sized flakes of monolayer and bilayer graphene. The doping level can be tuned in a controlled manner, which allows us to directly observe the Fermi level tuning. In our experiment we successfully doped the graphene with p- and n-type carriers (holes/electrons) which are directly observed through band shift in ARPES measurements. The observed band shift is $\sim$250 meV for bilayer and $\sim$500 meV for monolayer graphene. The results from our experiment promote the space charge doping technique and nano-ARPES into other materials such as 2D semiconductors and superconductors, in order to directly observe the physical phenomena such as band gap transition and phase transition as function of carrier doping.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of Cr$_8$ and V$_8$ molecular rings from ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.</description>

      <title>Probing growth precursor diffusion lengths by inter-surface diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and optimizing thin-film synthesis requires measuring the diffusion length $d_\alpha$ of adsorbed growth precursors. Despite technological advances, in-situ measurements of $d_\alpha$ are often unachievable due to harsh deposition conditions, such as high temperatures or reactive environments. In this paper, we propose a fitting approach to determine $d_\alpha$ from experimental data by leveraging inter-surface diffusion between a substrate and a strip obtained by, for example, processing a film. The substrate serves as a source or sink of precursors, influencing the growth dynamics and shaping the profile of the strip. By fitting simulated profiles to given profiles, we demonstrate that $d_\alpha$ can be determined. To achieve this, we develop a theoretical growth model, a simulation strategy, and a fitting procedure. The growth model incorporates inter-surface diffusion, adsorption, and desorption of growth precursors, with growth being proportional to the concentration of adsorbed precursors. In our simulations, a chain of nodes represents a profile, and growth is captured by the displacement of those nodes, while keeping the node density approximately constant. For strips significantly wider than $d_\alpha$, a scaled precursor concentration and $d_\alpha$ are the fitting parameters that are determined by minimizing a suitably defined measure of the distance between simulated and given profiles. We evaluate the robustness of our procedure by analyzing the effect of profile resolution and noise on the fitted parameters. Our approach can offer valuable insights into thin-film growth processes, such as those occurring during plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulations of defects near the (0001) surface of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in materials are ubiquitous and one of their adverse effects in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ is the initiation of corrosion. While this process starts near the surface, the defects involved and their electronic structure need to be elucidated with high accuracy. Since point defects are confined to a small spatial region, defect embedding theory allows the definition of an active space, comprising of the defect electronic states, that is coupled to the environment of the host material. The active space Hamiltonian is of small rank, enabling access to its electronic properties using a high-level or even exact quantum theory. In this paper we use these techniques and first-principles simulations to compute the structural and electronic properties of near-surface vacancies for the (0001) surface of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$, and investigate the influence of defects and hydration on the initiation and propagation of corrosion. We report the defect electronic structure for strongly localized ground and excited states of the surface O vacancy and compare results obtained using full configuration interaction and a variational quantum eigensolver on a quantum computer. Error mitigation techniques are explored and shown to reduce the error due to the hardware noise to the point where the quantum result agrees with the exact solution within chemical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Orbital fluctuations and spin-orbital-lattice coupling in Bi2Fe4O9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic frustrations and degeneracies profoundly affect ground-state magnetic properties emerging from competing exchange interactions. Controlling such frustrations using orbital and phonon engineering via the Kugel-Khomskii-type (KK-type) interactions has recently enabled the orbital enhancement of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling. Using combined spectroscopic techniques and first-principle simulations, here we demonstrate that the magnetically frustrated Cairo lattice, Bi2Fe4O9, exhibits a strong KK-type interaction resulting in a coupled spin-orbital phase below 1.8 times the Neel temperature (TN = 245 K). We observe an order of magnitude change in phonon linewidths that is not explainable considering spin-phonon coupling channels alone. Instead, the observed change is reminiscent of orbitally active materials, which we explicitly confirm by measuring the T-dependence of low-energy orbital excitations. We further find that Bi2Fe4O9 harbors an unstable polar mode, driving the lattice to a symmetry-lowered ferroelectric (FE) phase below TN, in line with the previously reported hysteresis in polarization. Nonetheless, the FE phase leads to extremely small calculated superlattice Bragg peak intensities that are yet to be experimentally confirmed. Moreover, thermal conductivity measurements do not show any measurable effect of KK-type interactions on thermal transport across TN. But, we observe a repeatable anomaly near 57 K appearing only in the heating cycle, which co-occurs with the 400 meV broad continuum observed in Raman measurements. The observed KK-type interaction in Bi2Fe4O9 provides an opportunity for orbital enhancement of ME coupling by phonon control of superexchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Zero Field Antiferromagnetically Coupled Skyrmions and their Field-Driven Uncoupling in Composite Chiral Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions are topological spin structures with fully compensated, net-zero magnetization. Compared to their ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion counterparts, their reduced stray field and enhanced electrical response can enable linear, high-throughput current-driven motion. However, their bubble-like character in conventional bilayer AFs limits their stability to fluctuations, leading to deformation and annihilation. Here we present the engineering of a composite AF chiral multilayer, wherein the interplay of AF and FM interlayer couplings generates compensated skyrmions with compact structures. High-resolution magnetic imaging and micromagnetic simulations show that the internal exchange field stabilizes AF skyrmions at zero external field with characteristics comparable to FM counterparts at 100 mT. Quantitative analyses establish their decoupling above the exchange field, yielding independent, spatially segregated textures in constituent chiral layers. This work provides a foundation to develop AF spin-textures with enhanced immunity, compatible with efficient readout and manipulation, with relevance to unconventional computing.</description>

      <title>Magnetic imaging under high pressure with a spin-based quantum sensor integrated in a van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure is a powerful thermodynamic parameter for tuning the magnetic properties of van der Waals magnets owing to their weak interlayer bonding. However, local magnetometry measurements under high pressure still remain elusive for this important class of emerging materials. Here we introduce a method enabling in situ magnetic imaging of van der Waals magnets under high pressure with sub-micron spatial resolution. Our approach relies on a quantum sensing platform based on boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which can be placed in atomic contact of any type of two-dimensional (2D) material within a van der Waals heterostructure. We first show that the V$_\text{B}^-$ center can be used as a magnetic field sensor up to pressures of a few GPa, a pressure range for which the properties of a wide variety of van der Waals magnets are efficiently altered. We then use V$_\text{B}^-$ centers in a thin hBN layer to perform magnetic imaging of a van der Waals magnet under pressure. As a proof of concept, we study the pressure-dependent magnetization in micrometer-sized flakes of $1T$-CrTe$_2$, whose evolution is explained by a shift of the Curie temperature. Besides providing a new path for studying pressure-induced phase transitions in van der Waals magnets, this work also opens up interesting perspectives for exploring the physics of 2D superconductors under pressure via local measurements of the Meissner effect.</description>

      <title>Field-free perpendicular magnetization switching of low critical current density at room temperature in TaIrTe4/ferromagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque-induced perpendicular magnetization switching has attracted much attention due to the advantages of nonvolatility, high density, infinite read/write counts, and low power consumption in spintronic applications. To achieve field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization, additional magnetic field, magnetic layer assistance, or artificially designed structural symmetry breaking are usually required, which are not conducive to the high-density integration and application of low-power devices. However, 2D Weyl semimetals with low-symmetry structures have recently been found to generate z-spin-polarized currents, which may induce out-of-plane damping-like torques to their neighboring ferromagnetic layers, and realize deterministic perpendicular magnetization switching at zero magnetic field. In this Letter, we report that current-induced field-free magnetization switching at room temperature can be achieved in a perpendicularly magnetized TaIrTe4/Pt/Co/Pt device, and the critical switching current density can be lowered to be about 2.64*105 Acm-2. This study suggests that TaIrTe4 has great potential for the design of room-temperature efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy of electron-phonon interactions in the delafossite PdCoO$_2$: From weak bulk to polaronic surface coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metallic delafossites host ultra-high mobility carriers in the bulk, while at their polar surfaces, intrinsic electronic reconstructions stabilise markedly distinct electronic phases, from charge-disproportionated insulators, to Rashba-split heavy-hole gases and ferromagnetic metals. The understanding of these phases has been strongly informed by surface spectroscopic measurements, but previous studies have been complicated by the presence of spatially varying terminations of the material surface. Here, we demonstrate the potential of microscopic-area angle-resolved photoemission to overcome these challenges. Our measurements of the model compound PdCoO$_2$ yield extremely high-quality spectra of the electronic structure, which allows us to place new experimental constraints on the weak electron-phonon coupling in the bulk of PdCoO$_2$, while revealing much stronger interactions at its surfaces. While the CoO$_2$-terminated surface exhibits a conventional weak-coupling behavior, our measurements reveal surprising spectroscopic signatures of polaron formation at the Pd-terminated surface, despite its pronounced metallicity. Together, our findings reveal how mode and symmetry-selective couplings can markedly tune the electron-phonon interactions in a single host material, here opening routes to stabilise surprisingly persistent polaronic quasiparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report here the reversibility and bistability of the switching behavior in an azobenzene derivative induced by the bias applied by a Scanning-Tunneling Microscopy (STM) tip, at low temperature and in ultra-high vacuum environment. This cis-to-trans and trans-to-cis switching were observed during STM imaging in either polarity at +2V or -2V, on a sub-second time scale. This results in a blinking effect visible on STM images, corresponding to the reversible switching of the azobenzene molecule under the applied STM bias through an electric field induced process.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion bombardment is currently an active area of research for patterning rare earth/transition metal ferrimagnetic thin films because the magnetic properties are extremely sensitive to changes in the constituent sublattices. It has previously been shown that ion bombardment can be used to deliberately reduce the contribution of the rare earth sublattice in rare earth/transition metal ferrimagnets by selective oxidation. However, the exact mechanism by which oxidation occurs remains an outstanding question. We show that the defects introduced by ion bombardment of Tb/Co multilayers using different ion species with projected range (i.e., 10 keV He + , 15 keV O + , and 30 keV Ga +) create easy diffusion paths for oxygen to penetrate the system. The choice of ion species and fluence enables the effective composition of the films to be tailored by reducing the amount of magnetically-active Tb.</description>

      <title>Grain boundaries amplify local chemical ordering in CrCoNi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local chemical ordering plays an important role in the behavior of complex concentrated alloys, yet its characterization remains challenging due to the nanoscale dimensions and scattered spatial distribution of the ordered domains. This study explores the potential of grain boundaries as microstructural anchor points that amplify chemical ordering and enable the formation of compositional nanopatterns in CrCoNi. Using hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal the development of distinct compositional waves with ordering vectors normal to grain boundaries, extending to lengths greater than 6 nm. These waves manifest as periodic enrichment and depletion patterns, with strong Ni depletion near the Ni-segregated grain boundary accompanied by Co and Cr enrichment. Analogous to surface-driven phase separation, the concentration waves emanating from the boundaries gradually attenuate as they propagate into the grain interior. This behavior highlights the interplay between boundary-dictated directional ordering and the isotropic, untemplated domain growth within the grain. This work advances our fundamental understanding of grain boundary-mediated ordering phenomena and offers a pathway for more precise experimental characterization of local chemical ordering in CCAs.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption and luminescence of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe Salpeter equation. We find a very strong optical absorption band related to transitions between the filled V-$d_{xy}$ like states to the empty ones with strong polarization along the $a$-direction. We relate this to recent experimental observations of cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a supression of the CL was observed upon addition of Li.</description>

      <title>Multi-functional Wafer-Scale Van der Waals Heterostructures and Polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have promised the realisation of artificial materials with multiple physical phenomena such as giant optical nonlinearities, spin-to-charge interconversion in spintronics and topological carrier protection, in a single layered device through an infinitely diverse set of quantum materials. However, most efforts have only focused on exfoliated material that inherently limits both the dimensions of the materials and the scalability for applications. Here, we show the epitaxial growth of large area heterostructures of topological insulators (Bi2Se3), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, WSe2) and ferromagnets (Co), resulting in the combination of functionalities including tuneable optical nonlinearities, spin-to-charge conversion and magnetic proximity effects. This is demonstrated through coherent phase resolved terahertz currents, bringing novel functionalities beyond those achievable in simple homostructures. In particular, we show the role of different TMD polymorphs, with the simple change of one atomic monolayer of the artificial material stack entirely changing its optical, electrical and magnetic properties. This epitaxial integration of diverse two-dimensional materials offers foundational steps towards diverse perspectives in quantum material engineering, where the material polymorph can be controlled at technological relevant scales for coupling applications in, for example, van der Waals nonlinear optics, optoelectronics, spintronics, multiferroics and coherent current control.</description>

      <title>Two-fluid mobility model from coupled hydrodynamic equations for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-fluid mobility model incorporating fundamental aspects of electron-hole (e-h) scattering such as momentum conservation for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches (LDSSs). Compared to previous works that use Matthiessen's rule, the two-fluid mobility model predicts distinct AC responses of e-h plasmas in semiconductors. Based on the two-fluid mobility model, we develop a theory with very few adjustable parameters for simulating the switching performance of LDSSs based on high-purity indirect-gap semiconductors such as silicon (Si). As a prototypical application, we successfully reproduce experimentally measured reflectance at around 320 GHz in a laser-driven Si switch. By injecting e-h plasmas with densities up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$, we reveal the importance of carrier-screening effects in e-h scattering and Auger recombination for carrier densities above the critical carrier density for exciton-plasma Mott transition. Our results also suggest a way to characterize the intrinsic momentum-relaxation mechanism, e-h scattering, and the intrinsic e-h recombination mechanism in indirect-gap semiconductors, Auger recombination. We reassess the ambipolar Auger coefficient of high-purity Si with high injection levels of e-h plasmas up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ and find a minimal value of $1.8\times10^{-41}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$. The value is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the ambipolar Auger coefficient widely used for simulating LDSSs, $3.8\times10^{-40}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$, which was deduced from minority-carrier lifetime in highly doped silicon more than four decades ago.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative method for predicting deformation in architected lattice structures that combines Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with finite element analysis. A thorough study was carried out on FCC-based lattice beams utilizing five different materials (Structural Steel, AA6061, AA7075, Ti6Al4V, and Inconel 718) under varied edge loads (1000-10000 N). The PINN model blends data-driven learning with physics-based limitations via a proprietary loss function, resulting in much higher prediction accuracy than linear regression. PINN outperforms linear regression, achieving greater R-square (0.7923 vs 0.5686) and lower error metrics (MSE: 0.00017417 vs 0.00036187). Among the materials examined, AA6061 had the highest displacement sensitivity (0.1014 mm at maximum load), while Inconel718 had better structural stability.</description>

      <title>Probing Stress and Magnetism at High Pressures with Two-Dimensional Quantum Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pressure serves as a fundamental tuning parameter capable of drastically modifying all properties of matter. The advent of diamond anvil cells (DACs) has enabled a compact and tabletop platform for generating extreme pressure conditions in laboratory settings. However, the limited spatial dimensions and ultrahigh pressures within these environments present significant challenges for conventional spectroscopy techniques. In this work, we integrate optical spin defects within a thin layer of two-dimensional (2D) materials directly into the high-pressure chamber, enabling an in situ quantum sensing platform for mapping local stress and magnetic environments up to 4~GPa. Compared to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers embedded in diamond anvils, our 2D sensors exhibit around three times stronger response to local stress and provide nanoscale proximity to the target sample in heterogeneous devices. We showcase the versatility of our approach by imaging both stress gradients within the high-pressure chamber and a pressure-driven magnetic phase transition in a room-temperature self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$. Our work demonstrates an integrated quantum sensing device for high-pressure experiments, offering potential applications in probing pressure-induced phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and mechanical deformation.</description>

      <title>Text to Band Gap: Pre-trained Language Models as Encoders for Semiconductor Band Gap Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the use of a transformer-based language model as an encoder to predict the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from their text descriptions. Quantum chemistry simulations, including Density Functional Theory (DFT), are computationally intensive and time-consuming, which limits their practicality for high-throughput material screening, particularly for complex systems. Shallow machine learning (ML) models, while effective, often require extensive data preprocessing to convert non-numerical material properties into numerical inputs. In contrast, our approach leverages textual data directly, bypassing the need for complex feature engineering. We generate material descriptions in two formats: formatted strings combining features and natural language text generated using the ChatGPT API. We demonstrate that the RoBERTa model, pre-trained on natural language processing tasks, performs effectively as an encoder for prediction tasks. With minimal fine-tuning, it achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.33 eV, performing better than shallow machine learning models such as Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Even when only the linear regression head is trained while keeping the RoBERTa encoder layers frozen, the accuracy remains nearly identical to that of the fully trained model. This demonstrates that the pre-trained RoBERTa encoder is highly adaptable for processing domain-specific text related to material properties, such as the band gap, significantly reducing the need for extensive retraining. This study highlights the potential of transformer-based language models to serve as efficient and versatile encoders for semiconductor materials property prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Simulation on the Miniaturization and Performance Improvement Study of Gr/MoS2 Based Vertical Field Effect Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical field effect transistors (VFETs) show many advantages such as high switching speed, low operating voltage, low power consumption, and miniaturization over lateral FETs. However, VFET still faces the main challenges of high off-state current. Graphene (Gr) and transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDs) are attractive materials for the next generation electronics. In this simulation work, the bulk molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is sandwiched between perforated monolayer Gr which acts as the source electrode, and aluminum (Al) as the top drain electrode. In addition to this, the minimization of the off-state current is carried out by modifications in the source contact geometry by insulating some part of the source electrode and introducing the extra MoS2 layer between the source and gate dielectric named as buried layer. After the modification, the results show an improvement in OFF current, hence the ON/OFF ratio. The highest ON/OFF ratio of 109 is achieved with top side insulated source contact and thinnest buried layer of 02 nm with top and sidewall insulation. These results would support low voltage operation with high switching speed in complete 2D material based VFETs and further miniaturize its geometry.</description>

Abstract: To verify whether the Mott insulator Ca2RuO4 can be switched by applying electric-field alone, regardless of current flow, we employ metallisation using electric double-layer gating (EDLG). The resistance change due to EDLG occurs only when positive gate-voltage above +3 V is applied. The amplitude of the reduction, reaching ~97% of the initial value, is difficult to interpret as surface metallisation and is likely related to structural change in bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important strategy for understanding the microscopic physics of strongly correlated systems and enhancing their technological potential is to selectively drive the fundamental degrees of freedom out of equilibrium. Intense terahertz (THz) pulses with photon energies of a few meV, can not only serve this purpose but also unravel their electronic and quantum nature. Here, we present THz-driven ultrafast dynamics of rare-earth nickelates $\text{RNiO}_{\text{3}}$, $\text{R}$ = rare-earth atom) - a prototype system to study the Mott insulator-metal transition (IMT). The THz drive of its Mott insulating state induces instantaneous IMT via quantum tunneling of valence electrons across the bandgap while the THz drive of its correlated metallic state leads to overall heating of the conduction electrons. The subsequent relaxations of excited electrons in these two states occur via a two-step process (electron-phonon thermalization and recovery of the charge-ordered insulating state) and a one-step process (electron-phonon scattering), respectively. The relaxation dynamics of the electrons and the absence of acoustic phonon modes, in particular, suggest that the THz photons drive only the charge degree of freedom. The purely electronic, ultrafast and local nature of the THz-induced IMT offers its applications in opto-electronics with enhanced performance and minimal device size and heat dissipation.</description>

      <title>Electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence based on the formation of charge-transfer excimers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the extensive use of electrochemiluminescence in sensing applications, its potential in lighting and display technology has been constrained by the low luminance and short operational lifetime of electrochemiluminescence devices (ECLDs). Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) via electrogeneration of charge-transfer (CT) excimers and subsequent energy transfer to fluorescent acceptors. By assuming a double-decker arrangement of the electron donor and acceptor groups, the molecule TpAT-tFFO supports solution-state thermally activated delayed fluorescence from a CT excimer state and efficient energy transfer to the rubrene dye TBRb. Optimized ECLDs based on this material combination achieve an unprecedented luminance of 6,220 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime (LT50) at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m2 exceeds 20 minutes, more than 10-fold longer than other ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between the excimer and the emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF. In mixtures with energy gaps &gt; 0.5 eV, electron transfer results in reduced performance and renders the operation strongly dependent on applied voltage and frequency. By contrast, spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with favorable energy level alignment operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. These findings highlight the innovative potential of ECiHF in improving the performance of ECLD, which can be widely applied in future commercial lighting solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic states by a small current is essential for the next-generation of energy-efficient spintronic devices. However, it invariably requires considerable energy to change a magnetic ground state of intrinsically quantum nature governed by fundamental Hamiltonian, once stabilized below a phase transition temperature. We report that surprisingly an in-plane current can tune the magnetic state of nm-thin van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 from a hard magnetic state to a soft magnetic state. It is the direct demonstration of the current-induced substantial reduction of the coercive field. This surprising finding is possible because the in-plane current produces a highly unusual type of gigantic spin-orbit torque for Fe3GeTe2. And we further demonstrate a working model of a new nonvolatile magnetic memory based on the principle of our discovery in Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a tiny current. Our findings open up a new window of exciting opportunities for magnetic van der Waals materials with potentially huge impacts on the future development of spintronic and magnetic memory.</description>

Abstract: Robust multi-level spin memory with the ability to write information electrically is a long-sought capability in spintronics, with great promise for applications. Here we achieve nonvolatile and highly energy-efficient magnetization switching in a single-material device formed of van-der-Waals topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2, whose magnetic information can be readily controlled by a tiny current. Furthermore, the switching current density and power dissipation are about 400 and 4000 times smaller than those of the existing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory based on conventional magnet/heavy-metal systems. Most importantly, we also demonstrate multi-level states, switched by electrical current, which can dramatically enhance the information capacity density and reduce computing costs. Thus, our observations combine both high energy efficiency and large information capacity density in one device, showcasing the potential applications of the emerging field of van-der-Waals magnets in the field of spin memory and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Voltage-driven 90 switching of bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ferrimagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unravelling the mechanism behind bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in amorphous rare earth-transition metal films has proven challenging. This is largely due to the inherent complexity of amorphous structure and the entangled potential origins arising from microstructure and atomic structure factors. Here, we present an approach wherein the magneto-electric effect is harnessed to induce 90{\deg} switching of bulk PMA in Tb-Co films to in-plane directions by applying voltages of only -1.2 V. This manipulation is achieved by voltage-driven insertion of hydrogen atoms into interstitial sites between Tb and Co atoms, which serves as a perturbation to local atomic structure. Using angle-dependent X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, we find that the anisotropy switching originates from the distortion of crystal field around Tb which reorients the alignment of Tb orbital moments. Initially aligned along Tb-Co bonding directions, the easy magnetization axis undergoes reorientation and switches by 90{\deg}, as substantiated by ab-initio calculations. Our study not only concludes the atomic origin of Tb-Co atom bonding configuration in shaping bulk PMA, but also establishes the groundwork for electrically programmable ferrimagnetic spintronics, such as controlling domain wall motion and programming artificial spin textures.</description>

      <title>Broken inversion symmetry in van der Waals topological ferromagnetic metal iron germanium telluride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and fundamental for spin-orbit torque, which is crucial for next-generation spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin-orbit torque has been established in the topological van-der-Waals (vdW) magnet iron germanium telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, we report the definitive evidence of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. Our data show that the crystal symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1 space group, giving the three-fold SHG pattern with dominant out-of-plane polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern to a sharp three-fold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new information to our understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin-orbit torque and topological vdW polar metal states.</description>

      <title>Electric field dependent thermal conductivity of relaxor ferroelectric PMN-33PT through changes in the phonon spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ferroelectric materials, an electric field has been shown to change the phonon dispersion sufficiently to alter the lattice thermal conductivity, opening the possibility that a heat gradient could drive a polarization flux, and technologically, also opening a pathway towards voltage-driven, all solid-state heat switching. In this report, we confirm the validity of the theory originally developed for Pb(Zr,Ti)O_3 (PZT) on the ferroelectric relaxor 0.67Pb[Mg_(1/3)Nb_(2/3)]O_3-0.33PbTiO_3 (PMN-33PT). In the theory, the change in sound velocity and thermal conductivity with electric field relates to the piezoelectric coefficients and the Gruneisen parameter. It predicts that in PMN-33PT the effect should be an order of magnitude larger, and of opposite sign as in PZT; this is confirmed here experimentally. The effects are measured on samples never poled before and on samples that underwent multiple field sweep cycles and passed through two phase transitions with change in temperature. The thermal conductivity changes are linked to variations in the piezoelectric coefficients and can be as large as 8-11% at room temperature and above. To date, this is the only means of heat conduction modulation that utilizes changes in the phonon spectrum. While this technology is in its infancy, it offers another path to future active thermal conduction control.</description>

      <title>Unexpected versatile electrical transport behaviors of ferromagnetic nickel films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of magnets is paramount for electrically controlled spintronics due to their intrinsic potentials for higher memory density, scalability, thermal stability and endurance, surpassing an in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Nickel film is a long-lived fundamental element ferromagnet, yet its electrical transport behavior associated with magnetism has not been comprehensively studied, hindering corresponding spintronic applications exploiting nickel-based compounds. Here, we systematically investigate the highly versatile magnetism and corresponding transport behavior of nickel films. As the thickness reduces within the general thickness regime of a magnet layer for a memory device, the hardness of nickel films' ferromagnetic loop of anomalous Hall effect increases and then decreases, reflecting the magnetic transitions from IMA to PMA and back to IMA. Additionally, the square ferromagnetic loop changes from a hard to a soft one at rising temperatures, indicating a shift from PMA to IMA. Furthermore, we observe a butterfly magnetoresistance resulting from the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect, which evolves in conjunction with the thickness and temperature-dependent magnetic transformations as a complementary support. Our findings unveil the rich magnetic dynamics and most importantly settle down the most useful guiding information for current-driven spintronic applications based on nickel film: The hysteresis loop is squarest for the ~8 nm-thick nickel film, of highest hardness with Rxyr/Rxys~1 and minimum Hs-Hc, up to 125 K; otherwise, extra care should be taken for a different thickness or at a higher temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Density functional theory has been applied to investigate structural and electronic properties of molybdenene monolayer in both its hexagonal and triclinic eigenstructures, within ultrasoft pseudopotential approach. In agreement with experimental findings, it has been found that either phase of molybdenene is metallic Dirac material, known as metallic relative of graphene. Partial density of state analysis has revealed that the $d$ valence orbitals of molybdenum atoms have had the largest contribution to such a metallic property, due to being half-empty and being the outermost. Phonon-dispersion calculations also have led to negative frequencies or soft modes for both eigenstructures, showing their instability in terms of lattice dynamics, as reported in experimental literature.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic spin Hall effect from spin quantum metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic spin Hall effect (ISHE), as proposed in [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.126603} {Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{92}, 126603 (2004)}], stems from the spin Berry curvature. Herein, we propose the concept of \textit{spin quantum metric}, which is established as the quantum geometric counterpart of the spin Berry curvature within the \textit{spin quantum geometric tensor}, defined in a manner analogous to the conventional quantum geometric tensor. In contrast to the well-known $\mathcal{T}$-even ($\mathcal{T}$, time reversal) spin Berry curvature, the \textit{spin quantum metric} is a $\mathcal{T}$-odd tensor. Remarkably, by symmetry analysis we show that the $\mathcal{T}$-odd \textit{spin quantum metric} can also drive an ISHE particularly under a high-frequency electric field. We investigate this $\mathcal{T}$-odd ISHE in the magnetically tilted surface Dirac cone and ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. We find that this $\mathcal{T}$-odd ISHE dominates when the Fermi level is close to the band crossing or anticrossing point and can be as large as the $\mathcal{T}$-even ISHE when a THz or an infrared driving field is applied. Our work not only reveals an indispensable member in emergent quantum geometry physics but also offers a novel response function for ultrafast spintronics.</description>

      <title>Surface conduction and reduced electrical resistivity in ultrathin noncrystalline NbP semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17337v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrical resistivity of conventional metals, such as copper, is known to increase in thin films due to electron-surface scattering, limiting the performance of metals in nanoscale electronics. Here, we find an unusual reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in niobium phosphide (NbP) semimetal deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400 \deg C. In films thinner than 5 nm, the room temperature resistivity (~34 microohm*cm for 1.5-nm-thick NbP) was up to six times lower than the bulk NbP resistivity, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness (typically ~100 microohm*cm). Remarkably, the NbP films are not crystalline, but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower effective resistivity is due to conduction via surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics, beyond the limitations of conventional metals.</description>

      <title>On the material genome of wurtzite ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the dielectric film thickness shrinks to ~10 nm, some traditional wurtzite piezoelectric materials demonstrate ferroelectricity through element doping. Among them, Sc doped AlN and Mg doped ZnO are the most famous examples. While it is widely acknowledged that the dopant atoms effectively reduce the coercive field, enabling ferroelectric polarization switching, the material genome of these wurtzite (WZ) ferroelectrics is still less understood. In this work, we analyze the features of WZ ferroelectrics, ascribing them to five-coordination (5C) ferroelectrics, which may be compared with 6C ferroelectrics (perovskite-type) and 7C ferroelectrics (hafnia-like). In particular, the exact reason for their adopting the hexagonal WZ structure instead of the zinc blende structure is studied. Emphasis is paid to the degree of ionicity in promoting the hexagonal arrangement, and the phenomenon of layer distance compression is discovered and explained in WZ ferroelectrics. The role of element doping in coercive field reduction is understood within this context.</description>

Abstract: In CALPHAD-type thermodynamic databases, nonstoichiometric compounds are typically described by sublattice models where the sublattice site fractions represent the occupation probability of different atomic, ionic or defect species on different sublattices. Here, we develop a general procedure and corresponding linear algebra tools for converting the sublattice site fractions to a combination of independent component compositions and internal process order parameters describing the extent of internal atomic exchange, electronic redox and defect generation reactions. We apply them to a number of nonstoichiometric phases in thermodynamic databases and literature. The general procedure can be applied to constructing thermodynamic databases in terms of internal process order parameters for nonstoichiometric phases in multicomponent systems such as high-entropy oxides and alloys, which can be utilized to model their kinetics of nonequilibrium processes and microstructure evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep deformation of MoNbTaW RHEAs under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical screening of the electron-phonon vertex is due to the retarded oscillations of the electronic charge following the phonon annihilation into an electron-hole pair. This retardation induces a frequency dependence of the electron-phonon interaction that is commonly neglected. In this work I propose a dynamical perturbative expansion that, while being diagrammatically consistent, defines a controllable and physically sound method to include dynamical screening effects in the electron-phonon vertex. The method is applied to the phonon self-energy of the homogeneous electron gas where I show how retardation effects are driven by the ratio between the plasma and the phonon frequencies. I finally propose a simple approach to estimate the importance of dynamical corrections. This method is applied to the paradigmatic case of MgB$_2$ to show the non--perturbative and large retardation effects that characterize this peculiar material.</description>

Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnetic ordering with spin reorientation transition and optical properties in DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02544</link>

Abstract: This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious inertial cavitation rheometry via bubble collapse time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid and accurate characterization of soft, viscoelastic materials at high strain rates is of interest in biological and engineering applications such as assessing the extent of non-invasive tissue surgery completion and developing injury criteria for the mitigation of blast injuries. The inertial microcavitation rheometry technique (IMR, Estrada et al. 2018) allows for the minimally invasive characterization of local viscoelastic properties at strain rates up to 1E8 per second. However, IMR relies on bright-field videography of a sufficiently translucent sample at approximately 1 million frames per second and a simulation-dependent fit optimization process that can require hours of post-processing. We present an IMR-style technique that parsimoniously characterizes viscoelastic models. The approach uses experimental advancements to accurately estimate the time to first collapse of the laser-induced cavity. A theoretical energy balance analysis yields an approximate collapse time based on the material viscoelasticity parameters. The method closely matches the accuracy of the original IMR procedure while decreasing the computational cost from hours to seconds for the Kelvin--Voigt model and potentially reducing dependence on high-speed videography. This technique can enable nearly real-time characterization of a broader range of soft, viscoelastic hydrogels and biological materials.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Optical Constants of Nanometer-thin Flakes of Fe(Te,Se) Superconductor in the Visible and Near-Infrared Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Iron chalcogenides superconductors, such as Fe(Te,Se) have recently garnered significant attention due to their simple crystal structure with a relatively easy synthesis process, high-temperature superconductivity, intrinsic topological band structure, and an unconventional pairing of superconductivity with ferromagnetism. Here, we report the complex in-plane refractive index measurement of nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flake exfoliated from a single crystal FeTe$_{\text{0.6}}$Se$_{\text{0.4}}$ for photon wavelengths from 450 to 1100 nm over a temperature range from 4 K to 295 K. The results were obtained by employing a two-Drude model for the dielectric function of Fe(Te,Se), a multiband superconductor, and fitting the absolute optical reflection spectra using the transfer matrix method. A high extinction coefficient in the visible to near-infrared range makes nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flakes a promising material for photodetection applications.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19421v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications. However, less effort has been devoted to searching for the Rashba effect and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators, from the perspective of material design and establishing universal rules. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. As the atomic number rises, the bandgaps of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) decrease continuously from 2.14 eV for MgAl2S3Se. The trend persists until the bandgap, when combined with strong spin-orbit coupling, shrinks to cause band inversion and reopen with nontrivial topology. Especially in specific Janus systems, pz orbitals near the Fermi level, in conjunction with band inversion, could create a hybrid spin texture with double Rashba splitting. Notably, the Rashba effect, nontrivial topological states and unique spin textures can be significantly tuned synchronously through small biaxial strain. Our work not only expands the diverse Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family with multifunctional application prospects but also reveals the designing rules of Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning identified nitride quantum wells for enhanced red emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: III-nitride heterostructures are critical for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications, however red emission remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge by systematically exploring their design space with machine learning. We surprisingly uncover that larger polarization fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. We outline strategies for engineering polarization fields through the tuning of composition, strain, and interlayer and quantum-barrier thicknesses. Without polarization fields, efficient red emission would not be possible in nitride LEDs given the current challenges in nitride epitaxy. Our results show how polarization can improve light emission from polar semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference Driven Electron Transport through Fano-Anderson Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic transport behavior of Fano-Anderson (FA) systems, consisting of a one-dimensional finite backbone chain and an attached side-group of varying length. The tight-binding model within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) reveals distinct interference patterns between the frontier orbitals of odd and even side-group systems that lead to distinct transport mechanisms across various configurations. The even side-group systems exhibit resonant tunneling peaks, while the odd ones demonstrate significant destructive interference at Fermi energy leading to antiresonance and reduced current responses. Further exploration of the role of electron-electron interactions within mean-field Hubbard Hamiltonian indicates the emergence of negative differential resistance (NDR) in odd side-group systems at lower biases, a phenomenon absent in the non-interacting case. Our study demonstrates the critical role of quantum interferences among the frontier molecular orbitals and electron correlations in shaping the transport behavior of FA systems, providing insights for the design of molecular-scale electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Refining Coarse-Grained Molecular Topologies: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.</description>
