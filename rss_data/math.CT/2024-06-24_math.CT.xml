      <title>A Tangent Category Perspective on Connections in Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an abstract notion of connection in any tangent category. In this paper, we show that when applied to the tangent category of affine schemes, this recreates the classical notion of a connection on a module (and similarly, in the tangent category of schemes, this recreates the notion of connection on a quasi-coherent sheaf of modules). By contrast, we also show that in the tangent category of algebras, there are no non-trivial connections.</description>

      <title>Pushforward monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a monad $T$ on $\mathcal{C}$ and a functor $G \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$, one can construct a monad $G_\#T$ on $\mathcal{D}$ subject to the existence of a certain Kan extension; this is the pushforward of $T$ along $G$. We develop the general theory of this construction, and relate it to the concept of codensity monads, showing that each is a special case of the other. We study several examples of pushforwards, the most notable being that the pushforward of the powerset monad from finite sets to sets gives the theory of continuous lattices. We also identify the category of algebras of the codensity monad of the inclusion of fields into rings, which turns out to be the free product completion of the category of fields. Lastly, for a set $E$, we identify the category of algebras of the codensity monad of the $(\cdot) + E$ functor on sets.</description>

      <title>Boolean-valued models of $(\kappa ,\kappa )$-coherent categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05345v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common theme in model theory is to introduce constant symbols naming the elements of a model. We describe the analogous construction in the language of syntactic categories/ sites.
  As an application we identify Boolean-valued models with $\mathbf{Set}$-valued regular functors on the syntactic category. For the coherent fragment $L_{\omega \omega }^g \subseteq L_{\omega \omega }$ this was proved by Jacob Lurie, our discussion gives a new proof together with a generalization to $L_{\kappa \kappa }^g$ when $\kappa $ is weakly compact.
  We present some further applications: first, a Boolean-valued completeness theorem for $L_{\kappa \kappa }^g$ ($\kappa $ is weakly compact), second, that $\mathcal{C}\to \mathbf{Set} $ regular functors (on coherent categories with disjoint coproducts) admit an elementary embedding to a product of coherent functors.</description>

      <title>Internalizations of decorated bicategories via $\pi_2$-indexings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We treat the problem of lifting bicategories into double categories through categories of vertical morphisms. We consider structures on decorated 2-categories allowing us to formally implement arguments of sliding certain squares along vertical subdivisions in double categories. We call these structures $\pi_2$-indexings. We present a construction associating, to every $\pi_2$-indexing on a decorated 2-category, a length 1 double internalization.</description>

      <title>Length of fully faithful framed bicategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The length of a double category is a numerical invariant measuring the 'work' it takes to reconstruct the double category from its globular data. The smallest possible length of a double category is 1. It is conjectured that framed bicategories are of length 1. In this paper we prove this conjecture for a particular class of framed bicategories, namely for those double categories for which all their unit squares are cartesian/opcartesian. We call these framed bicategories fully faithful/absolutely dense.</description>

      <title>A Homological View of Categorical Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a foundation for working with homological and homotopical methods in categorical algebra. This involves two mutually complementary components, namely (a) the strategic selection of suitable axiomatic frameworks, some well known and some new, and (b) the development of categorical tools for effective reasoning and computing within those frameworks.
  The selection of axiomatic frameworks begins `from the ground up' with z-exact categories. These are pointed categories in which every morphism has a kernel and cokernel. Then we progress all the way to abelian categories, en route meeting contexts such as Borceux--Bourn homological categories and Janelidze--M\'arki--Tholen semiabelian categories. We clarify the relationship between these axiomatic frameworks by direct comparison, but also by explaining how concrete examples fit into the selection. The outcome is a fine-grained set of criteria by which one can map varieties of algebras (in the sense of Universal Algebra) and topological models of algebraic theories into the various frameworks.
  The categorical tools for effective computation deal mostly with situations involving universal factorizations of morphisms, with exact sequences, and with the homology of chain complexes.
  Further, the categorical tools for computation include the `basic diagram lemmas' of homological algebra, that is the (Short) $5$-Lemma, the $(3\times 3)$-Lemma, the Snake Lemma, and applications thereof. We find that these tools are even available in some surprisingly weak categorical environments, such as the category of pointed sets. In discovering such features, we make systematic use of what we call the self-dual axis of a category.</description>

      <title>On semidirect products of quantale enriched monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider monoids equipped with a compatible quantale valued relation, to which we call quantale enriched monoids, and study semidirect products of such structures. It is well-known that semidirect products of monoids are closely related to Schreier split extensions which, in the setting of monoids, play the role of split extensions of groups. We will thus introduce certain split extensions of quantale enriched monoids, which generalize the classical Schreier split extensions of monoids, and investigate their connections with semidirect products. We then restrict our study to a class of quantale enriched monoids whose behavior mimics the fact that the preorder on a preordered group is completely determined by its cone of positive elements. Finally, we instantiate our results for preordered monoids and compare them with existing literature.</description>
