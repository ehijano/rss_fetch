      <description>arXiv:2602.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the translation into English of my paper published in Russian at the paper collection on cosmology at \\ 1981. The content of the book is presented in the Appendix. This is the first paper where the dynamical mechanism of phoenix universe was worked out. The notion of phoenix universe was first mentioned in the paper by Lemaitre in 1933, where he assumed that a repetition of successive phases of expansion and contraction was possible. Lemaitre called such model of the universe, that is born, dies and is reborn, the phoenix model, named after the mythical bird able to reborn from the ashes. According to the author, there could be an infinite number of such cycles in the past and future. In this model, however, a possible solution to the fundamental question was unclear, what was the mechanism for the rebirth of the universe. This mechanism was worked out in my paper, published in 1980 in Russian. Moreover, in our recent paper with E. Arbuzova a mechanism of dynamical cancellation of vacuum energy was proposed, that permits to eliminate vacuum energy locally down to zero and permits universe to jump to a lower hot level, leading to rebirth of a hot universe.</description>

      <title>Studying dark gaps in Ly-$\alpha$ forest transmission with large reionization simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical conditions of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the final stages of cosmic reionization ($z\sim5.0-6.0$) are not yet fully understood. Recent reports of unexpectedly large-scale ($\ge 150 h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$) correlation in Ly-$\alpha$ transmission flux using extended XQR-30 quasar spectra pose interesting consequences on the reionization end stages. In this work, we investigate the Ly-$\alpha$ forest dark-gap distribution (defined as regions with transmitted flux below 0.05) as another sensitive tracer of the IGM, using an efficient, large-volume ($\sim 1 ~\mathrm{Gpc}$) simulation framework. By constructing a suite of physically motivated model variants (i.e, varying the reionization redshift, IGM temperature, and ionizing-photon mean free path), we generate synthetic sightlines and compare their predicted cumulative distribution of dark gaps with that of observed spectra (at redshift intervals of $\Delta z=0.2$). We find that most of the models achieve qualitatively consistent agreement with the data. Specifically, the scenario involving a slightly later reionization completion ($z\sim 5.4$) provides the closest match, while a short constant mean free path model disfavors the data at lower redshifts. These findings give further support for the emerging scenario of reionization end extending to $z\le5.7$, although they can not rule out a slightly early reionization with enhanced post-ionization ultraviolet (UV) background fluctuations. A similar conclusion arises from the redshift distribution of long dark gap ($L\ge 30 ~h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$) fraction. However, the model variants are still not able to reproduce the observed strong flux correlations at unusually large scales, which remains open for further investigations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dynamics of Multi-Axion Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One fundamental physics interpretation of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results is that the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe is driven not by the cosmological constant, but by a slowly rolling scalar field, a natural model for which is an axion with a decay constant close to the Planck scale. In the ``string axiverse'' one expects not one, but many, axions and this may allow the ability to engineer large effective decay constants. We thus investigate dark energy dynamics in a toy model with two axions, and compute the prior probability for the dark energy equation of state parameters $(w_0,w_a)$ implied by priors on the fundamental parameters of the model conditioned weakly on the resulting cosmology. We find various interesting behaviours, for example where both fields can be in an oscillating regime while maintaining $w_0&lt;-1/3$, and models with opposite sign for $w_a$ than in a single-field model. The prior probability in $(w_0,w_a)$ gains support away from the ``thawing quintessence'' behaviour preferred by DESI, and when the axions have cross-interactions this effect becomes stronger. When the axions interact, one in general still requires large decay constants, but if the axions are non-interacting the largest decay constant can be reduced. The novel equations of state we illustrate may also be of relevance to models of early dark energy or inflation/reheating with mutliple axions. Further exploration of dynamics in models with $N\gg 1$ axions is warranted.</description>

      <title>Skewness in the Hellings-Downs curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Pulsar Timing Array datasets provide compelling evidence for a nano-Hertz gravitational-wave background, but robust detection requires characterizing statistical fluctuations of the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation expected from a finite population of discrete sources. Building on the variance calculation of Allen (2023), we derive the third central moment (skewness) of the HD correlation for a single unpolarized point source and an ensemble of many interfering point sources in the confusion-noise regime. To isolate the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the background, we extend the pulsar-averaging formalism to third order by introducing a three-point averaged correlation function, which allows us to define the cosmic skewness. We find that the skewness remains non-zero in the large-source-number limit and is controlled by a new geometric three-point function. These results suggest that incorporating higher-order moments could provide additional information on source discreteness beyond standard Gaussian analyses.</description>

      <title>Wigner Function Shapelets I : formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend shapelets for the analysis of galaxy images to be available in a phase space, introducing \textit{Wigner Function Shapelets (WFS)}. Whereas conventional shapelets expand images separately in configuration or Fourier space using Hermite-Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian modes, WFS represents images directly in the four-dimensional phase space with symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$, which is quantised by a phase-space cell $2\pi\lambdabar$ that determines a resolution limit of a telescope. WFS consists of a bilinear form of the cross-Wigner function of the Laguerre-Gaussian modes as an orthogonal and complete basis for the Wigner function of an image, carrying out $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ irreducible representations of the phase space with the Hopf tori. We introduce a scalar function $\mathcal{W}_{k\ell} (Q_0,Q_2)$ from the $\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{U}(1)$ - covariant tori to a two-dimensional space of constants of motion $(Q_0,Q_2)$ -- the harmonic energy and axial angular momentum -- thereby yielding a natural phase-space ``band structure'', given a pair of winding number $(k,\ell) \in \mathbb{Z}^2$. %
WFS leverage key properties of the Wigner function for image analysis: (i) it encodes full information of an image in a symmetry-preserving way; (ii) its trasport equation naturally involves with a Liouville equation at $\lambdabar \rightarrow 0$; (iii) it admits positive/negative oscillatory patterns on $(Q_0,Q_2)$ plane that can be sensitive spatial coherent structure of galaxy morphology and cosmological imprints; and (iv) systematics and noise can be manipulated as a quantum channel operation. This paper aims to bring all the formulae related to the Wigner function in the context of astrophysics and cosmology, formally organising in both terminologies of astronomy and of quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Detectability and Model Discriminability of the Dark Ages 21 cm Global Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen atom is almost the only way to directly probe the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages 21 cm signal, observed at frequencies below 50 MHz, can serve as a powerful probe of cosmology, as the standard cosmological model predicts a well-defined 21 cm spectral shape. In this work, we assess the detectability and model-selection power of 21 cm observations assuming physically motivated foregrounds, optimistic error levels, and several observing strategies for the signals predicted in various cosmological models. Using a Bayesian evidence-based comparison, we find that wide-band observations covering 1-50 MHz can identify the evidence of non-zero 21 cm signals from models considered in this paper except the one with a smooth spectrum that peaks at lower frequencies. In particular, observations below 15 MHz are essential to avoid degeneracies with the foreground. Furthermore, even with observations measured at 5 MHz intervals over the frequency range 1-50 MHz, the 21 cm signal can be identified if the errors are sufficiently small. This indicates that the intrinsic 21 cm spectral shape can be captured without foreground degeneracy even with a limited number of frequency channels.</description>

      <title>A Variable-Slope Smooth-$k$ Filter for Modeling Halo Abundances with Damped and Oscillatory Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a variable-slope smooth-$k$ (VSMK) filter within the Press-Schechter formalism to model halo mass functions derived from damped and oscillatory matter power spectra. While the standard smooth-$k$ approach successfully captures small-scale suppression effects, it intrinsically couples these to oscillatory features at intermediate scales. The VSMK filter generalizes this framework by allowing the effective logarithmic slope of the $k$-space window function to vary smoothly between two asymptotic regimes, thereby decoupling the small-scale suppression of halo abundances from the intermediate-scale oscillatory features characteristic of dark acoustic oscillations. We compare the analytic predictions obtained with the VSMK filter to $N$-body simulations for warm dark matter and ETHOS-based models, showing that a single parameter set reproduces both regimes simultaneously. The VSMK filter thus provides a unified and flexible analytic framework for modeling halo abundances in non-cold dark matter scenarios with damped and oscillatory power spectra.</description>

      <title>A single field inflationary potential consistent with recent observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current observations indicate that an inverse exponential form of the inflaton potential provides an excellent description of single-field inflation. This potential fits the SPA$+$BK$+$DESI data sets well with in the $1\sigma$ bound in the $n_{\rm s}$-$r$ plane, thereby offering a simple and observationally viable single field inflationary scenario. To describe post-inflationary evolution and reheating, we extend the inverse exponential potential by adding a steep exponential term that remains negligible during inflation but becomes important afterwards. The resulting full potential develops a minimum after the end of inflation, leading to oscillations of the scalar field and consequently reheating of the Universe. We find that the maximum reheating temperature attainable in this scenario is of order $10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. The inverse exponential potential therefore emerges as a compelling candidate for early-Universe inflation, combining theoretical simplicity with robust observational viability.</description>

      <title>Resonant production of heavy particles during inflation and its gravitational wave signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a quadratic $U(1)$-breaking term, together with an effective chemical potential induced by a dimension five derivative coupling between the inflaton and the $U(1)$ current, can drive efficient particle production during inflation even when the $U(1)$ field is heavier than the Hubble scale. Notably, the chemical potential enables efficient production even when the $U(1)$-breaking mass is smaller than the effective diagonal mass. We compute the gravitational wave signal generated by this mechanism during inflation, derive the primordial tensor spectrum, and map it to the present day energy density $\Omega_{\mathrm GW}(f)$. Assuming the $U(1)$ field constitutes the dominant component of dark matter, this mapping fixes the characteristic frequency, which we compare with projected sensitivity curves of ongoing and proposed gravitational wave observatories. Finally, we argue that the same dynamics are accompanied by a cosmological collider signal, providing an independent cross validation of the framework.</description>

      <title>Partial Relief of the Hubble Tension and a Natural Self-Interacting Dark Matter Candidate From Staged Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The values of the Hubble constant ($\rm{H_0}$) inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and local measurements via the distance ladder exhibit a $\sim5\sigma$ tension. In this work we propose that the tension might be partially alleviated if a subcomponent of the dark matter undergoes decays triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking in the dark sector, so that the equation of state parameter of the subcomponent shifts from $w \approx 0$ at early times to $w \approx -1/3$ at late times. We provide an effective field theory whose structure is partially motivated by the desire for a plausible UV completion. We find that such a construction naturally produces a possible self-interacting dark matter candidate with a velocity-dependent scattering cross section as a by-product of gauge invariance. This is relevant for addressing tensions between the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM and observations of small-scale structure, such as the core-cusp problem.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Tsallis Parameter from a deformed Neutrino Sector in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize neutrino energy density content in the early universe near BBN era $T\simeq1$ MeV within Tsallis nonextensive statistics. By using Curado-Tsallis constraints we obtain generalized distribution functions $f_q(E)$. We compute the generalized thermodynamic integral for the energy density $\rho_q$. We define a reescaling $R^{(\xi = +1)}_{\rho}(q) = \rho_q/\rho^{\rm std}$ which is a ratio between the deformed energy density and the standard extensive case. The last was used to directly map and deform neutrino content via the effective number of neutrinos $N_{\rm eff}$. The deformation prediction was confronted against CMB$+$BAO and BBN data for $N_{\rm eff}$ by a joint/combined $\chi^2$ type-fit. We obtained the constraints $|q-1|\le 1.09\times 10^{-2}$ (95\% CL) and $|q-1|\le 1.32\times 10^{-2}$ (99\% CL) from the combined analysis by numerically calculating the best value of the Tsallis parameter $q_{\rm best}$.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based cosmological inference from optically-selected galaxy clusters with $\texttt{Capish}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are powerful probes of the growth of cosmic structure through measurements of their abundance as a function of mass and redshift. Extracting precise cosmological constraints from cluster surveys is challenging, as we must contend the complex relationship between richness and the underlying halo mass, selection function biases, super-sample covariance, and correlated measurement noise between mass proxies. As upcoming photometric surveys are expected to detect tens to hundreds of thousands of galaxy clusters, controlling these systematics becomes essential. In this paper, we present a forward-modelling approach using Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), which provides a natural framework for jointly modelling cluster abundance and lensing mass observables while capturing systematic uncertainties at higher fidelity than analytic likelihood methods - which rely on simplifying assumptions such as fixed covariances and Gaussianity - without requiring an explicit likelihood formulation. We introduce $\texttt{Capish}$, a Python code for generating forward-modelled galaxy cluster catalogues using halo mass functions and incorporating observational effects. We perform SBI using neural density estimation with normalizing flows, trained on abundance and mean lensing mass measurements in observed redshift-richness bins. Our forward model accounts for realistic noise, redshift uncertainties, selection functions, and correlated scatter between lensing mass and observed richness. We find good agreement with likelihood-based analyses, with broader SBI posteriors reflecting the increased realism of the forward model. We also test $\texttt{Capish}$ on cluster catalogues built from a large cosmological simulation, finding a good fit to cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Clustering of emission line galaxies with IllustrisTNG -- II. cosmology challenge with anisotropic correlation functions and ELG-halo connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission line galaxies (ELGs) are the primary tracers of the large-scale structures of the Universe in ongoing Stage-IV cosmological spectroscopic surveys, which aim to measure the clustering statistics at higher redshifts $z \simeq 1.5 \text{--} 2$ with unprecedented precision. In this study, we construct realistic mock ELG samples with IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations and stellar population synthesis framework. In order to validate the modelling of clustering, we measure the anisotropic correlation functions of mock ELGs and infer the linear growth rate, which is one of key cosmological parameters in galaxy clustering. As a control sample, we construct the mass-limited subhalo samples with the same number density as ELGs. The isotropic correlation functions in real space for both samples do not differ significantly. However, the quadrupole moment of the anisotropic correlation function, which is sensitive to the velocity of galaxies, is suppressed for ELGs, potentially due to the infalling motion of ELGs towards the centre of the hosting halos. The smaller amplitude leads to the underestimation of the linear growth rate and implies the velocity bias between ELGs and dark matter. When the analysis is limited to large scales $(\gtrsim 15 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc})$, the parameter bias vanishes. Next, we investigate the ELG-halo connection through the phase-space distribution of satellite ELGs within hosting halos and galactic conformity of star formation activity. The infalling motion is further confirmed by the phase-space distribution relative to the host halo, and this dynamics of ELGs challenges the assumption that the radial distribution of satellites follows that of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Negentropy as Diagnostic of Cosmic Density Fields and Dynamical Dark Energy Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ negentropy ($J$), defined as the difference between the information content of a non-Gaussian probability distribution and a Gaussian with identical variance, as an information-theoretic probe of non-Gaussianity in the cosmic density field. We quantify its sensitivity to dynamical dark energy by studying the evolution of $J(a)$ and its derivatives $\Gamma_1(a)$ and $\Gamma_2(a)$ across three parameterisation schemes: CPL, JBP, and BA. We determine the characteristic redshift $z_{NG}$, marking the epoch of maximal non-Gaussian structure formation, and the turnaround redshift $z_{TA}$, when information production transitions due to dark-energy domination, finding $z_{NG}\sim0.81$ and $z_{TA}\sim0.18$ for $\Lambda$CDM. Our diagnostics clearly discriminate between thawing and freezing quintessence models and phantom dark energy at low redshifts. Thawing models show small departures from $\Lambda$CDM, freezing models display higher $z_{TA}$, while phantom models exhibit lower $z_{TA}$, reflecting late-time evolution. We provide a practical prescription for measuring negentropy from discrete galaxy distributions, establishing a framework that can be applied to simulations and observations. This information-theoretic approach offers a robust and complementary tool for probing dark energy dynamics, enabling sensitive discrimination between evolving and cosmological-constant scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the largest scales of the Universe with field-level inference applied to the Quaia Quasar Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently released Quaia quasar catalogue, with its broad redshift range and all-sky coverage, enables unprecedented three-dimensional reconstructions of matter across cosmic time. In this work, we apply the field-level inference algorithm BORG to the Quaia catalogues to reconstruct the initial conditions and present-day matter distribution of the Universe. We employ a physics-based forward model of large-scale structure using Lagrangian perturbation theory, incorporating light-cone effects, redshift-space distortions, quasar bias, and survey selection effects. This approach enables a detailed and physically motivated inference of the three-dimensional density field and initial conditions over the entire cosmic volume considered. We analyse both the G &lt; 20.0 (Quaia Clean) and G &lt; 20.5 (Quaia Deep) samples, where G denotes the Gaia broad optical-band magnitude, imposing conservative sky cuts to ensure robustness against foreground contamination. The resulting reconstructions span a comoving volume of (10h^{-1} Gpc)^3 with a maximum spatial resolution of 39.1 h^{-1}Mpc, making this the largest field-level reconstruction of the observable Universe in terms of comoving volume to date. We validate our reconstructions through a range of internal and external consistency checks, including the cross-correlation of the inferred density fields with Planck CMB lensing, where we detect a signal at ~4\sigma significance. Beyond delivering high-fidelity data products, including posterior maps of initial conditions, present-day dark matter, and velocity fields, this work establishes a framework for exploiting quasar surveys in field-level cosmology.</description>

      <title>Mitigating half-wave plate systematics at the map-making level: calibration requirements for LiteBIRD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although half-wave plates (HWPs) are becoming a popular choice of polarization modulators for cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, their non-idealities can introduce systematic effects that should be carefully characterized and mitigated. One possible mitigation strategy is to incorporate information about the non-idealities at the map-making level, which helps to reduce the HWP-induced distortions of the reconstructed CMB. Nevertheless, the non-idealities can only be known with finite precision. In this paper we investigate the consequences of discrepancies between their true frequency profiles and those assumed by the map-maker. We present an end-to-end framework, including a blind component-separation step, and use it to translate these discrepancies into a bias on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, for the LiteBIRD satellite mission. We subsequently derive realistic and conservative measurement requirements for accurately characterizing the HWP non-idealities to ensure they do not compromise LiteBIRD's ambitious scientific goals. We find that the obtained results are robust against sky models with varying complexity.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO Project: Exploring the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation as a probe of large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback processes associated with galaxy formation directly influence the large-scale structure by redistributing gas. Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\leq M_{200\mathrm{c}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Reheating in geometric Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Weyl-invariant purely gravitational theories formulated within the Einstein-Cartan framework. In the Einstein-frame description, these models are dynamically equivalent to standard general relativity coupled to an axion-like pseudoscalar degree of freedom, which naturally drives a period of cosmic inflation. Without committing to a specific microscopic mechanism for reheating, we demonstrate that the post-inflationary reheating dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the inflationary predictions. In particular, we show that assumptions about the reheating temperature and the equation-of-state parameter can significantly affect the predicted values of inflationary observables, highlighting the necessity of consistently incorporating reheating effects in the phenomenological analysis of inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Running Love Numbers of Charged Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loops of virtual particles from the vacuum of quantum field theory (QFT) render black holes tidally deformable. We compute the static tidal response of unspinning charged black holes at arbitrary radius, using the perturbative formalism developed in 2501.18684. Since the gravitational and electromagnetic tidal responses mix, we generalize the notion of Love numbers to Love matrices. We derive the coupled equations of motion for the metric and electromagnetic fluctuations around purely electric and magnetic backgrounds. For large charged black holes, which are described by the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity, we compute the full set of Love matrices induced by an arbitrary tower of $F^{2n}$ operators. We find that, although quantum corrections break electromagnetic duality, the Love matrices in electric and magnetic backgrounds are related by a $Z_2$ symmetry under electric-magnetic exchange. Going beyond EFT, we compute the Love matrices of small magnetic black holes. We show that the running of the Love matrices is governed by the running of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling, and we derive the correspondence between Love and $U(1)$ beta functions for arbitrary harmonics. The overall picture that emerges is that the QFT-induced tidal response of magnetic black holes saturates in the strong-field regime. These results imply that nearly-extremal magnetic black holes charged under an Abelian dark sector could be probed by gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Realization of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 in Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the DESI Collaboration indicate a preference for quintom dark energy, i.e., its equation of state evolves across the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$. It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we provide a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by introducing the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density in teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the intrinsic difficulties in the old models.</description>

      <title>Factorized neural posterior estimation for rapid and reliable inference of parameterized post-Einsteinian deviation parameters in gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO has strikingly confirmed general relativity (GR), but testing GR via GWs requires estimating parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) deviation parameters in waveform models. Traditional Bayesian inference methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provide reliable estimates but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, failing to meet the real-time demands and surging data volume of future GW detectors. Here, we propose a factorized neural posterior estimation framework: we construct independent normalizing flow models for each of the nine ppE deviation parameters and effectively integrate prior information from other source parameters via a conditional embedding network. Leveraging a hybrid neural network with a convolutional neural network and a Residual Neural Network for feature extraction, our method performs rapid and statistically reliable posterior inference directly from binary black hole signals. Compared to conventional MCMC, our approach achieves millisecond-scale inference time with a speedup factor of $9 \times 10^4$. Comprehensive validations show that the posterior estimates pass the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and achieve empirical coverage probabilities close to theoretical targets. This work demonstrates the great potential of deep learning for GW parameter estimation and provides a viable technical solution for real-time GR tests with next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Contribution of Active Galactic Nuclei to the Diffuse High-Energy Neutrino Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy neutrinos from NGC 1068 and TXS-0506+56 suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGN) may contribute significantly to the the diffuse neutrino flux measured by IceCube. Using 10 years of publicly available IceCube data, we performed a systematic population analysis of X-ray-bright and gamma-ray-bright AGN to evaluate the extent to which this diffuse flux could originate from these sources. We find that gamma-ray-bright blazars can account for no more than 16\% of IceCube's total diffuse flux. Although we find no evidence of neutrino emission from gamma-ray-bright, non-blazar AGN, we cannot exclude the possibility that these sources contribute significantly to the diffuse flux. In contrast, we report (pre-trials) evidence of neutrino emission from several nearby, X-ray-bright, Seyfert-type AGN, including \mbox{NGC 1068} ($4.9\sigma$), SWIFT J1041.4-1740 ($2.6\sigma$), SWIFT J0202.4+6824A/B ($2.6\sigma$), SWIFT J0744.0+2914 (2.6$\sigma$), NGC 4151 ($2.5\sigma$), and NGC 3079 ($2.5\sigma$). Although not fully conclusive, these results suggest that IceCube may be detecting neutrinos from a larger population of Seyfert galaxies. The fact that these sources are not gamma-ray bright indicates that their neutrino production must be taking place in optically thick environments, such as in the coronae surrounding these galaxies' supermassive black holes. We also identify a $4.2\sigma$ correlation between the neutrinos detected by IceCube and members of the Swift-BAT catalog of X-ray-bright AGN, although this correlation is dominated by NGC 1068. We estimate that this class of sources contributes between 11.2\% and the entirety of IceCube's total diffuse neutrino flux. These results strengthen the emerging case for the prevalence of gamma-ray-obscured AGN as significant sources of high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on $\Lambda$(t)CDM Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18591v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problems with the concordance cosmology $\Lambda$CDM as the cosmological constant problem, coincidence problems and Hubble tension has led to many proposed alternatives, as the $\Lambda(t)$CDM, where the now called $\Lambda$ cosmological term is allowed to vary due to an interaction with pressureless matter. Here, we analyze one class of these proposals, namely, $\Lambda=\alpha'a^{-2}+\beta H^2+\lambda_*$, based on dimensional arguments. Using SNe Ia, cosmic chronometers data plus constraints on $H_0$ from SH0ES and Planck satellite, we constrain the free parameters of this class of models. By using the Planck prior over $H_0$, we conclude that the $\lambda_*$ term can not be discarded by this analysis, thereby disfavouring models only with the time-variable terms. The SH0ES prior over $H_0$ has an weak evidence in this direction. The subclasses of models with $\alpha'=0$ and with $\beta=0$ can not be discarded by this analysis. Finally, by using distance priors from CMB, the $\Lambda$ time-dependence was quite restricted.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Siren: Astrophysical Gravitational-Wave Background Measurements of the Hubble Constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$ using the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from binary black hole mergers. This astrophysical background is sensitive to the expansion history of the Universe and thus can be used for cosmological parameter inference independently of not only electromagnetic methods, but also gravitational-wave standard siren approaches. We describe the background's cosmological dependence and show how it can be used as a ``stochastic siren'' to measure $H_0$. By analyzing existing resolved binary black hole mergers and the current non-detection of the background, we find that $H_0$ can be measured more accurately relative to using resolved mergers alone. We also note that the stochastic siren may serve a unique role in the Hubble tension in that the lower bound of the $H_0$ measurement would progressively increase with continued non-detection of the background.</description>

      <title>Fullshape power spectrum for the Symmetron modified gravity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make use of the perturbation theory for modified gravity models that we developed in previous works and apply it to construct the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron modified gravity model. First, we study the growth rate, that is a scale dependent quantity, and compare our results with those of the $n=1 $ Hu-Sawcki (HS) model, finding that the Symmetron has a growth quite similar to the HS F6 in the wavenumber interval $0.01 \leq k \leq 0.1 $ and for redshifts where Symmetron model is viable. We also propose a growth parametrization that turns to be a good approximation for the HS and Symmetron models, with a deviation less than $0.6 \%$. To compute the RSD multipoles we employ an expansion of the velocity moments generating function that is suitable for general modified gravity models. Later, we apply the fk-Perturbation Theory (fkPT) approximation to reduce the computation time of nonlinear kernels, to find the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron, and study the differences with HS model. The RSD multipoles of the Symmetron result similar to those of the HS F6 model. Next, we integrate this theory to an MCMC sampler and validate our results by fitting our parameters to EZMocks to recover the parameters that bring the model to GR. We found a similar agreement in the model validation between Symmetron and F6 model, recovering the simulation cosmological parameters, and concluding that our pipeline is ready to make cosmological parameters' inference with real data.</description>

      <title>DESI results and Dark Energy from QCD topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a physically motivated dark-energy (DE) model rooted in the topological structure of the Quantum ChromoDynamic (QCD) vacuum. In this framework, DE arises from the difference between the vacuum energy of an expanding FRW universe and Minkowski spacetime, induced by QCD topological sectors. The resulting DE term in the Friedmann equation scales with the Hubble rate, $\rho_{\rm DE}(t)\propto H(t)$, once DE dominates cosmic expansion, i.e. when the Universe is close to the de Sitter regime with $H\approx$ constant. The QCD scale, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}\sim100~{\rm MeV}$, naturally fixes the DE density and explains why its influence becomes significant only recently. The construction relies solely on the Standard Model of particle physics, introducing no new fields or couplings. The most fundamental change is the possibility of modifying the evolution of the background cosmology in the Friedmann equation. Key predictions include: (a) A present-day equation of state parameter $w_{\rm DE,0}&gt;-1$ that asymptotically approaches the de Sitter limit $w_{\rm DE}=-1$ in the future. (b) A present-day Hubble constant $H_0$ that asymptotically approaches a constant $\overline{H}$ set by $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. (b) For $z\ge 0$, $w_{\rm DE}(z)$ may lie above or below $-1$ and can cross this boundary multiple times at different $z$, behavior qualitatively consistent with the recent DESI findings. (c) In our framework, any deviation from $\Lambda$CDM leads to a corresponding deviation of $H(z)$, which can be tested with existing and future cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-tail of the curvature perturbation in hybrid inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential-tail behaviours of the probability density function (PDF) of the primordial curvature perturbation are confirmed in the mild-waterfall variants of hybrid inflation with the use of the stochastic formalism of inflation. On top of these tails, effective upper bounds on the curvature perturbation are also observed, corresponding to the exact hilltop trajectory during the waterfall phase. We find that in the model where the leading and higher-order terms in the expansion of the inflaton potential around the critical point are fine-tuned to balance, this upper bound can be significantly reduced, even smaller than the primordial black hole (PBH) threshold, as a novel perturbation-reduction mechanism than the one proposed by Tada and Yamada. It makes PBH formation much difficult compared to the Gaussian or exponential-tail approximation. We also introduce Johnson's $S_U$-distribution as a useful fitting function for the PDF, which reveals a nonlinear mapping between the Gaussian field and the curvature perturbation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical backreaction of a mass-acquiring scalar field on first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase transitions in the early Universe give rise to effective masses for massless fields in the symmetry-broken phase. We perform lattice simulations to study the dynamical impact of a mass-acquiring spectator field on the evolution of first-order phase transitions and the associated gravitational-wave production, while keeping the effective potential responsible for bubble nucleation fixed. In addition to the well-known friction effects, we identify a novel effect that significantly enhances the strength of first-order phase transitions. In contrast to the general scenario, although the effective potential governs the tunneling rate, the amplitude of the $\chi$ field is strongly suppressed inside the true vacuum bubble, resulting in a faster bubble expansion than predicted by the effective potential alone. The amplitude of the mass-acquiring field is highly suppressed in the true vacuum bubbles, resulting in additional release of vacuum energy that concentrate on the bubble walls. We further develop an analytical framework that not only explains our numerical results but can also be used to improve the estimation of gravitational-wave signals in related phase-transition scenarios.</description>

      <title>Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without theoretical pathologies. Breaking the shift symmetry in Horndeski theories allows this transition. We construct an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a quadratic kinetic term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts without introducing ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmology with bright sirens from the CosmoDC2_BCO LSST synthetic catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bright sirens, i.e. gravitational-wave detections of compact binary mergers with electromagnetic counterparts, provide a self-calibrated distance-redshift relation and are therefore powerful probes of cosmic expansion. Using the CosmoDC2_BCO catalog, we forecast cosmological constraints from current (LVK) and next-generation (ET, CE) detector networks, in combination with a Roman-like Type Ia supernova sample. We find that third-generation networks reach sub-percent precision on the Hubble constant within a few years, achieving 0.2% after a decade with CE+ET+LVK, while LVK remains limited to the 6% level. The LVK fifth observing run may shed light on the H_0 tension only if the inferred value falls outside the range spanned by the Planck and SH0ES determinations, which currently achieve far higher precisions. Supernovae do not directly tighten H_0 but stabilize its inference through parameter correlations and enable an absolute calibration of the supernova magnitude M_B. In dynamical dark-energy models, the joint analysis of Roman supernovae and bright sirens yields a Figure of Merit of 25 for ET+LVK and 76 for CE+ET+LVK, to be compared with the state-of-the-art DESI DR2 BAO plus DESY5 supernovae value of 56. Sky-localization thresholds of DeltaOmega &lt; 50 deg^2, or even DeltaOmega &lt; 10 deg^2, entail only mild penalties, suggesting efficient follow-up strategies. These results establish third-generation GW+EM observations, especially when combined with Roman supernovae, as a cornerstone for precision cosmology in the next decade.</description>

      <title>Revealing cosmological fluctuations in 21cm intensity maps with MeerKLASS: from maps to power spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping the integrated 21cm emission line from dark matter-tracing neutral hydrogen gas is the primary science goal for MeerKLASS (MeerKAT's Large Area Synoptic Survey). Prior to the arrival of MeerKAT, this intensity mapping technique had only been tested on a couple of pre-existing single-dish radio telescopes with a handful of observational hours with which to make early pioneering detections. The 64-dish MeerKAT array, precursor to the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), can scan the sky in auto-correlation mode and perform intensity mapping across large sky areas, presenting the exciting potential for a wide-sky (${\gtrsim}\,10{,}000\,{\rm deg}^2$) spectroscopic survey across redshift $0.4\,{&lt;}\,z\,{&lt;}\,1.45$. Validating the auto-correlation (or single-dish) mode of observation for a multi-dish array and developing the analysis pipeline with which to make unbiased measurements has presented major challenges to this endeavour. In this work, we overview the advances in the field that have facilitated a robust analysis framework for single-dish intensity mapping, and review some results that showcase its success using early MeerKLASS surveys. We demonstrate our control of foreground cleaning, signal loss and map regridding to deliver detections of cosmological clustering within the intensity maps through cross-correlation power spectrum measurements with overlapping galaxy surveys. Finally, we discuss the prospects for future MeerKLASS observations and forecast its potential, making our code publicly available: https://github.com/meerklass/MeerFish.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic galaxy alignments in CAMELS simulations and the significant impact of baryon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detection of the intrinsic galaxy alignments in the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the alignment amplitude depends significantly on cosmological and supernova feedback parameters - specifically $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, $A_{\text{SN1}}$, $A_{\text{SN2}}$- while no dependence on AGN feedback is observed (due to the limited simulation volume $(25\,h^{-1}\,\text{Mpc})^3$). The dependence on $\sigma_8$ vanishes when projected correlation functions $w_{m+}$ are normalized by matter density correlations $w_{mm}$, consistent with predictions from linear alignment models. We find alignment amplitudes in quiescent galaxies to exceed those in star-forming galaxies by an order of magnitude. Moreover, examining orientation-only correlation functions from ellipticity-normalized galaxies $\tilde w_{m+}$, we confirm that alignment signals retain sensitivity to supernova feedback across full, star forming, quiescent, and ellipticity-normalized samples. Finally, we find evidence that supernova feedback impacts alignment signals differently in star-forming versus quiescent populations, suggesting that distinct alignment mechanisms operate across galaxy types. Our results offer key insights for understanding galaxy formation and alignment models for future weak gravitational lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>Stellar Disruption of Axion Minihalos and Consequences for Direct Axion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scenarios such as the QCD axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry broken after inflation predict an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales. These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.
  We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a framework for constructing wave functions in closed and open quantum systems from their Hamiltonians. Since the early universe is inherently an open system, we employ this algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across various cosmological phases: inflation, radiation domination (RD), and matter domination (MD). Our results highlight a clear distinction in Krylov complexity between the closed- and open-system methodologies. To accurately capture the influence of potentials during RD and MD, we examine a set of inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, $R^2$ inflation, and chaotic inflation, while incorporating violations of slow-roll conditions. This study is conducted in conformal time through the preheating stage. Numerically, we find that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy shows remarkable similarity across different potentials during RD and MD. Furthermore, we rigorously construct an open two-mode squeezed state using the second kind of Meixner polynomial. Based on this construction, we derive for the first time the evolution equations for the squeezing parameter $r_k$ and phase $\phi_k$ in terms of the scale factor. Our analysis indicates that dissipative effects lead to rapid decoherence-like behavior. In addition, we observe that the inflationary universe behaves as a strongly dissipative system, whereas during the RD and MD epochs the universe exhibits weak dissipative characteristics. This work opens new perspectives for studying the universe from a quantum-informational viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20389v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>GW231123: Likely a product of successive mergers from $\sim 10 $ stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We test possible formation scenarios for GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH spin distributions, in light of population properties built on the previous (GWTC-3) data. Our analysis shows that GW231123 belongs to the high-spin subpopulation that is naturally interpreted as hierarchical BBH mergers. By comparing the spin magnitudes and component masses of GW231123 to those of the remnants of previous mergers, we show that both components of GW231123 are multi-generation ($&gt;$2G) merger remnants, and plausibly originated from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical friction in the disks of active galactic nuclei.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic inflation is the leading theory to explain early Universe history and structure formation. Non-oscillatory inflation is a class of models which can naturally introduce a post-inflationary stiff period of the Universe's evolution which boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs), making it possible to observe them in forthcoming GW experiments. However, this pushes the GW energy density high enough to destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This problem can be overcome by "softening" the stiff period, so that the field is gradually tending towards freefall from a frozen start. Here, we consider a modified hybrid inflation model where the stiff period is driven by the waterfall field, allowing the barotropic parameter of the Universe to vary, so that it does not violate the BBN constraint but produces a characteristic gravitational wave spectrum soon to be observable.</description>
