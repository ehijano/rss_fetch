      <description>arXiv:2409.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of spaces of reflectionless canonical systems. In this analysis, a key role is played by a natural action of the group $\operatorname{PSL}(2,\mathbb R)$ on these spaces.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of Schr\"odinger operators on subcovering graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider discrete Schr\"odinger operators with periodic potentials on periodic graphs. Their spectra consist of a finite number of bands. By "rolling up" a periodic graph along some appropriate directions we obtain periodic graphs of smaller dimensions called subcovering graphs. For example, rolling up a planar hexagonal lattice along different directions will lead to nanotubes with various chiralities. We show that the subcovering graph is asymptotically isospectral to the original periodic graph as the length of the "chiral" (roll up) vectors tends to infinity and get asymptotics of the band edges of the Schr\"odinger operator on the subcovering graph. We also obtain a criterion for the subcovering graph to be just isospectral to the original periodic graph. By isospectrality of periodic graphs we mean that the spectra of the Schr\"odinger operators on the graphs consist of the same number of bands and the corresponding bands coincide as sets.</description>

      <title>Weyl laws for Schr\"odinger operators on compact manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Weyl laws for Schr\"odinger operators with critically singular potentials on compact manifolds with boundary. We also improve the Weyl remainder estimates under the condition that the set of all periodic geodesic billiards has measure 0. These extend the classical results by Seeley, Ivrii and Melrose. The proof uses the Gaussian heat kernel bounds for short times and a perturbation argument involving the wave equation.</description>

      <title>On the Dirac spectrum on degenerating Riemannian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the spectrum of the Dirac operator on degenerating families of compact Riemannian surfaces, when the length $t$ of a simple closed geodesic shrinks to zero, under the hypothesis that the spin structure along the pinched geodesic is non-trivial. The difficulty of the problem stems from the non-compactness of the limit surface, which has finite area and two cusps. The main idea in this investigation is to construct an adapted pseudodifferential calculus, in the spirit of the celebrated b-algebra of Melrose, which includes both the family of Dirac operators on the family of compact surfaces and the Dirac operator on the limit non-compact surface, together with their resolvents. We obtain smoothness of the spectral projectors, and $t^2 \log t$ regularity for the cusp-surgery trace of the relative resolvent in the degeneracy process as $t \searrow 0$.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Homological Bounds on k-Component Edge Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical framework connecting k-component edge connectivity with spectral graph theory and homology theory to pro vide new insights into the resilience of real-world networks. By extending classical edge connectivity to higher-dimensional simplicial complexes, we derive tight spectral-homological bounds on the minimum number of edges that must be removed to ensure that all remaining components in the graph have size less than k. These bounds relate the spectra of graph and simplicial Laplacians to topological invariants from homology, establishing a multi-dimensional measure of network robustness. Our framework improves the understanding of network resilience in critical systems such as the Western U.S. power grid and European rail network, and we extend our analysis to random graphs and expander graphs to demonstrate the broad applicability of the method. Keywords: k-component edge connectivity, spectral graph theory, homology, simplicial complexes, network resilience, Betti numbers, algebraic connectivity, random graphs, expander graphs, infrastructure systems</description>

      <title>Sharp semiclassical spectral asymptotics for local magnetic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^d$ without full regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider operators acting in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $d\geq3$ that locally behave as a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. For the magnetic Schr\"odinger operators we suppose the magnetic potentials are smooth and the electric potential is five times differentiable and the fifth derivatives are H\"older continuous. Under these assumptions, we establish sharp spectral asymptotics for localised counting functions and Riesz means.</description>

      <title>Sharp semiclassical spectral asymptotics for Schr\"odinger operators with non-smooth potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider semiclassical Schr\"odinger operators acting in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $d\geq3$. For these operators we establish a sharp spectral asymptotics without full regularity. For the counting function we assume the potential is locally integrable and that the negative part of the potential minus a constant is one time differentiable and the derivative is H\"older continues with parameter $\mu\geq1/2$. Moreover we also consider sharp Riesz means of order $\gamma$ with $\gamma\in(0,1]$. Here we assume the potential is locally integrable and that the negative part of the potential minus a constant is two time differentiable and the second derivative is H\"older continues with parameter $\mu$ that depends on $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Witten instanton complexes on stratified pseudomanifolds with K\"ahler wedge metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Witten instanton complexes for K\"ahler Hamiltonian Morse functions on stratified pseudomanifolds with wedge K\"ahler metrics satisfying a local conformally totally geodesic condition. We use this to extend Witten's holomorphic Morse inequalities for the $L^2$ cohomology of Dolbeault complexes, deriving versions for Poincar\'e Hodge polynomials, the spin Dirac and signature complexes for which we prove rigidity results, in particular establishing the rigidity of $L^2$ de Rham cohomology for these circle actions. We study formulas for Rarita Schwinger operators, generalize formulas studied by Witten and Gibbons-Hawking for the equivariant signature and extend formulas used to compute NUT charges of gravitational instantons. We discuss conjectural inequalities extending known Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch formulas for other cohomology theories including those of Baum-Fulton-Quart. This article contains the first extension of Witten's holomorphic Morse inequalities and instanton complexes to singular spaces.</description>
