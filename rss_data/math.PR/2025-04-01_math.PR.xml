      <title>Last-passage percolation and product-matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a model of directed last-passage percolation in planar layered environment. This environment is represented by an array of random exponential clocks arranged in blocks, for each block the average waiting times depend only on the local coordinates within the block. The last-passage time, the total time needed to travel from the source to the sink located in a given block, maximized over all the admissible paths, becomes a stochastic process indexed by the number of blocks in the array. We show that this model is integrable, particularly the probability law of the last-passage time process can be determined via a Fredholm determinant of the kernel that also appears in the study of products of random matrices. Further, we identify the scaling limit of the last-passage time process, as the sizes of the blocks become infinitely large and the average waiting times become infinitely small. Finite-dimensional convergence to the continuous-time critical stochastic process of random matrix theory is established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an upper bound of the bottom of the essential spectrum for the generator associated with a regular Dirichlet form in terms of the rates of the volume growth/decay and big jump.

      <title>On the zero-noise limit for SDE's singular at the initial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-noise limit for SDE's driven by Brownian motion with a divergence-free drift singular at the initial time and prove that a unique probability measure concentrated on the integral curves of the drift is selected. More precisely, we prove uniqueness of the zero-noise limit for divergence-free drifts in $L^1_{loc}((0,T];BV(\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d))\cap L^q((0,T);L^p(\mathbb{T}^d;\mathbb{R}^d))$ where $p$ and $q$ satisfy a Prodi-Serrin condition. The vector field constructed by Depauw [C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2003] lies in this class and we show that for almost every intial datum, the zero-noise limit selects a probability measure concentrated on several distinct integral curves of this vector field.</description>

      <title>On Multiparameter Generalized Counting Process, its Time-Changed Variants and Martingale Characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a multiparameter version of the generalized counting process (GCP), where there is a possibility of finitely many arrivals simultaneously. We call it the multiparameter GCP. In a particular case, it is uniquely represented as a weighted sum of independent multiparameter Poisson processes. For a specific case, we establish a relationship between the multiparameter GCP and the sum of independent GCPs. Some of its time-changed variants are studied where the time-changing components used are the multiparameter stable subordinator and the multiparameter inverse stable subordinator. An integral of the multiparameter GCP is defined, and its asymptotic distribution is obtained. Also, some of its martingale characterizations are derived.</description>

      <title>Multiple Extremal Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of multiple extremal integrals as an extension of single extremal integrals, which have played important roles in extreme value theory. The multiple extremal integrals are formulated in terms of a product-form random sup measure derived from the \texorpdfstring{$\alpha$}{alpha}-Fr\'{e}chet random sup measure. We establish a LePage-type representation similar to that used for multiple sum-stable integrals, which have been extensively studied in the literature. This approach allows us to investigate the integrability, tail behavior, and independence properties of multiple extremal integrals. Additionally, we discuss an extension of a recently proposed stationary model that exhibits an unusual extremal clustering phenomenon, now constructed using multiple extremal integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current paper focuses on studying the impact of immigration with an infinite mean, driven by a discrete-stable compound Poisson process, when it is entering the branching environment with infinite variance of reproduction. Our goal is to determine the explicit form of the probability generating function and subsequently to analyze the probability of extinction, aiming to understand the long-term behavior of such processes.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic subset selection of multivariate Markov chains via submodular optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimally projecting the transition matrix of a finite ergodic multivariate Markov chain onto a lower-dimensional state space. Specifically, we seek to construct a projected Markov chain that optimizes various information-theoretic criteria under cardinality constraints. These criteria include entropy rate, information-theoretic distance to factorizability, independence, and stationarity. We formulate these tasks as best subset selection problems over multivariate Markov chains and leverage the submodular (or supermodular) structure of the objective functions to develop efficient greedy-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees. We extend our analysis to $k$-submodular settings and introduce a generalized version of the distorted greedy algorithm, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we illustrate the theory and algorithms through extensive numerical experiments with publicly available code on multivariate Markov chains associated with the Bernoulli-Laplace and Curie-Weiss model.</description>

      <title>Dynamics for spherical spin glasses: Gibbs distributed initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the coupled non-linear integro-differential equations for the thermodynamic limit of the empirical correlation and response functions in the Langevin dynamics at temperature $T$, for spherical mixed $p$-spin disordered mean-field models, initialized according to a Gibbs measure for temperature $T_0$, in the replica-symmetric (RS) or $1$-replica-symmetry-breaking (RSB) phase. For any $T_0=T$ above the dynamical phase transition point $T_c^{\rm dyn}$ the resulting stationary relaxation dynamics coincide with the FDT solution for these equations, while for lower $T_0=T$ in the $1$-RSB phase, the relaxation dynamics coincides with the FDT solution, now concentrated on the single spherical band within the Gibbs measure's support on which the initial point lies.</description>

      <title>A new Berry-Esseen-type estimate in the free central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the subordination approach, we provide a new Berry-Esseen-type estimate in the free central limit theorem in terms of the fourth Lyapunov fraction. In the special case of identical distributions, our result implies a rate of order $n^{-1/2 + \varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, thus almost leading to the optimal rate of order $n^{-1/2}$.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the existence and uniqueness of solutions to Reflected Generalized Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (GRBSDEs) within a general filtration that supports a Brownian motion and an independent integer-valued random measure. Our study focuses on cases where the given data satisfy appropriate $\mathbb{L}^2$-integrability conditions and the coefficients satisfy a monotonicity assumption. Additionally, we establish a connection between the solution and an optimal control problem over the set of stopping times.</description>

      <title>Operator limit of Wigner matrices I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Wigner matrix $W_{n}$ of dimension $n \times n$ as $n \to \infty$. The objective of this paper is two folds: first we construct an operator $\mathcal{W}$ on a suitable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and then define a suitable notion of convergence such that the matrices $W_{n}$ converge in that notion of convergence to $\mathcal{W}$. We further investigate some properties of $\mathcal{W}$ and $\mathcal{H}$. We show that $\mathcal{H}$ is a nontrivial extension of $L^{2}[0,1]$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure and the spectral measure of $\mathcal{W}$ at any function $f \in L^{2}[0,1]$ is almost surely the semicircular law.</description>

      <title>Degrees in the $\beta$- and $\beta'$-Delaunay graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the typical cells $\widehat{Z}$ and $\widehat{Z}^\prime$ of $\beta$- and $\beta'$-Voronoi tessellations in $\mathbb{R}^d$, establishing a Complementary Theorem which entails: 1) a gamma distribution of the $\Phi$-content (a suitable homogeneous functional) of the typical cell with $n$-facets; 2) the independence of this $\Phi$-content with the shape of the cell; 3) a practical integral representation of the distribution of $Z^{(\prime)}$. We exploit the latter to derive bounds on the distribution of the facet numbers. Using duality, we get bounds on the typical degree distributions of $\beta$- and $\beta'$-Delaunay triangulations. For $\beta'$-Delaunay, the resulting exponential lower bound seems to be the first of its kind for random spatial graphs arising as the skeletons of random tessellations. For $\beta$-Delaunay, matching super-exponential bounds allow us to show concentration of the maximal degree in a growing window to only a finite number of deterministic values (in particular, only two values for $d=2$).</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of Generalized Hermite Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hermite processes are paradigmatic examples of stochastic processes which can belong to any Wiener chaos of an arbitrary order; the wellknown fractional Brownian motion belonging to the Gaussian first order Wiener chaos and the Rosenblatt process belonging to the non-Gaussian second order Wiener chaos are two particular cases of them. Except these two particular cases no simulation method for sample paths of Hermite processes is available so far. The goal of our article is to introduce a new method which potentially allows to simulate sample paths of any Hermite process and even those of any generalized Hermite process. Our starting point is the representation for the latter process as random wavelet-typeseries, obtained in our very recent paper [3]. We construct from it a "concrete" sequence of piecewise linear continuous random functions which almost surely approximate sample paths of this process for the uniform norm on any compact interval, and we provide an almost sure estimate of the approximation error. Then, for the Rosenblatt process and more importantly for the third order Hermite process, we propose algorithms allowing to implement this sequence and we illustrate them by several simulations. Python routines implementing these synthesis procedures are available upon request.</description>

      <title>A BDG inequality for stochastic Volterra integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Burkholder-Davis-Gundy-type inequalities for stochastic Volterra integrals with a completely monotone convolution kernel, which may exhibit singular behaviour at the origin. When the supremum is taken over a finite interval, the upper bound depends linearly on the $L^\gamma$-norm of the kernel, for any $\gamma&gt;2$. We demonstrate the utility of this inequality in quantifying the pathwise distance between two stochastic Volterra equations with distinct kernels, with a particular emphasis on the multifactor Markovian approximation. For kernels that decay sufficiently fast, we derive an alternative inequality valid over an infinite time interval, providing uniform-in-time bounds for mean-reverting stochastic Volterra equations. Finally, we compare our findings with existing results in the literature.</description>

      <title>A criterion on the free energy for log-Sobolev inequalities in mean-field particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of mean-field particle systems, we formulate a criterion in terms of the free energy that implies uniform bounds on the log-Sobolev constant of the associated Langevin dynamics. For certain double-well potentials with quadratic interaction, the criterion holds up to the critical temperature of the model, and we also obtain precise asymptotics on the decay of the log-Sobolev constant when approaching the critical point. The criterion also applies to ``diluted'' mean-field models defined on sufficiently dense, possibly random graphs. We further generalize the criterion to non-quadratic interactions that admit a mode decomposition. The mode decomposition is different from the scale decomposition of the Polchinski flow we used for short-range spin systems.</description>

      <title>Geometry and stability of species complexes: larger species speciate less often</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Species complexes are groups of closely related populations exchanging genes through dispersal. We study the dynamics of the structure of species complexes in a class of metapopulation models where demes can exchange genetic material through migration and diverge through the accumulation of new mutations. Importantly, we model the ecological feedback of differentiation on gene flow by assuming that the success of migrations decreases with genetic distance, through a specific function $h$. We investigate the effects of metapopulation size on the coherence of species structures, depending on some mathematical characteristics of the feedback function $h$. Our results suggest that with larger metapopulation sizes, species form increasingly coherent, transitive, and uniform entities. We conclude that the initiation of speciation events in large species requires the existence of idiosyncratic geographic or selective restrictions on gene flow.</description>

E-MVFCM is a centralized MVC with consideration to heat-kernel coefficients (H-KC) and weight factors. Secondly, we propose an exponential bi-level multi-view fuzzy c-means clustering (EB-MVFCM). Different to E-MVFCM, EB-MVFCM does automatic computation of feature and weight factors simultaneously. Like E-MVFCM, EB-MVFCM present explicit forms of the H-KC to simplify the generation of the heat-kernel $\mathcal{K}(t)$ in powers of the proper time $t$ during the clustering process. All the features used in this study, including tools and functions of proposed algorithms will be made available at https://www.github.com/KristinaP09/EB-MVFCM.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin Maximum Principle for rough stochastic systems and pathwise stochastic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a novel class of rough stochastic control problems that allows for a convenient approach to solving pathwise stochastic control problems with both non-anticipative and anticipative controls. We first establish the well-posedness of a class of controlled rough SDEs with affine rough driver and establish the continuity of the solution w.r.t.~the driving rough path. This allows us to define pathwise stochastic control problems with anticipative controls. Subsequently, we apply a flow transformation argument to establish a necessary and sufficient maximum principle to identify and characterize optimal strategies for rough and hence pathwise stochastic control problems. We show that the rough and the corresponding pathwise stochastic control problems share the same value function. For the benchmark case of linear-quadratic problems with bounded controls a similar result is shown for optimal controls.</description>

      <title>Likelihood Level Adapted Estimation of Marginal Likelihood for Bayesian Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational mechanics, multiple models are often present to describe a physical system. While Bayesian model selection is a helpful tool to compare these models using measurement data, it requires the computationally expensive estimation of a multidimensional integral -- known as the marginal likelihood or as the model evidence (\textit{i.e.}, the probability of observing the measured data given the model). This study presents efficient approaches for estimating this marginal likelihood by transforming it into a one-dimensional integral that is subsequently evaluated using a quadrature rule at multiple adaptively-chosen iso-likelihood contour levels. Three different algorithms are proposed to estimate the probability mass at each adapted likelihood level using samples from importance sampling, stratified sampling, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, respectively. The proposed approach is illustrated through four numerical examples. The first example validates the algorithms against a known exact marginal likelihood. The second example uses an 11-story building subjected to an earthquake excitation with an uncertain hysteretic base isolation layer with two models to describe the isolation layer behavior. The third example considers flow past a cylinder when the inlet velocity is uncertain. Based on these examples, the method with stratified sampling is by far the most accurate and efficient method for complex model behavior in low dimension. In the fourth example, the proposed approach is applied to heat conduction in an inhomogeneous plate with uncertain thermal conductivity modeled through a 100 degree-of-freedom Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion. The results indicate that MultiNest cannot efficiently handle the high-dimensional parameter space, whereas the proposed MCMC-based method more accurately and efficiently explores the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Normal approximation for number of edges in random intersection graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random intersection graph model $\mathcal G(n,m,p)$ is considered. Due to substantial edge dependencies, studying even fundamental statistics such as the subgraph count is significantly more challenging than in the classical binomial model $\mathcal G(n,p)$. First, we establish normal approximation bound in both the Wasserstein and the Kolmogorov distances for a class of local statistics on $\mathcal G(n,m,p)$. Next, we apply these results to derive such bounds for the standardised number of edges, and determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for its asymptotic normality. We develop a new method that provides a combinatorial interpretation and facilitates the estimation of analytical expressions related to general distance bounds. In particular, this allows us to control the behaviour of central moments of subgraph existence indicators. The presented method can also be extended to count copies of subgraphs larger than a single edge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a `dense' Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph model $G=G_{n,M}$ with $n$ vertices and $M$ edges, where we assume the edge density $M/\binom{n}{2}$ is bounded away from 0 and 1. Fix $k=k(n)$ with $k/n$ bounded away from 0 and~1, and let $S$ be a random subset of size $k$ of the vertices of $G$. We show that with probability $1-\exp(-n^{\Omega(1)})$, $G$ satisfies both a central limit theorem and a local limit theorem for the empirical distribution of the edge count $e(G[S])$ of the subgraph of $G$ induced by $S$, where the distribution is over uniform random choices of the $k$-set $S$.</description>

Abstract: The McCarty Conjecture states that any McCarty Matrix (an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ with positive integer entries and each of the $2n$ row and column sums equal to $n$), can be additively decomposed into two other matrices, $B$ and $C$, such that $B$ has row and column sumsets both equal to $\{1, 2,... n\}$, and $C$ has row and column sumsets both equal to $\{0, 1,... n-1\}$. The problem can also be formulated in terms of bipartite graphs. In this paper we use probabilistic methods to resolve this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>

      <title>Scenario-Based Optimization of Network Resilience: Integrating Vulnerability Assessments and Traffic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrastructure networks are increasingly vulnerable to natural hazards and design flaws, making resilience assessment essential. This paper presents a scenario-based framework to evaluate network vulnerability by combining local measures and topological analysis, assessing each node's role in maintaining network integrity during disruptions. The framework identifies optimization opportunities by comparing structural properties with established standards. Traffic flow is modeled using the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) function to improve disruption resilience. A two-stage stochastic model captures uncertainties, ensuring robust network performance across diverse scenarios. The approach balances risk-neutral and risk-averse strategies, emphasizing the importance of strengthening critical nodes to prevent cascading failures. The proposed method enhances resilience by minimizing undelivered demand and optimizing overall performance under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Structure of average distance minimizers in general dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a fixed, compactly supported probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$, we consider the problem of minimizing the $p^{\mathrm{th}}$-power average distance functional over all compact, connected $\Sigma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ with Hausdorff 1-measure $\mathcal{H}^1(\Sigma) \leq l$. This problem, known as the average distance problem, was first studied by Buttazzo, Oudet, and Stepanov in 2002, and has undergone a considerable amount of research since. We will provide a novel approach to studying this problem by analyzing it using the so-called barycentre field introduced previously by Hayase and two of the authors. This allows us to provide a complete topological description of minimizers in arbitrary dimension when $p = 2$ and $p &gt; \frac{1}{2}(3 + \sqrt{5}) \approx 2.618$, the first such result which includes the case when $d &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Feature learning from non-Gaussian inputs: the case of Independent Component Analysis in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks learn structured features from complex, non-Gaussian inputs, but the mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood. Our work is motivated by the observation that the first-layer filters learnt by deep convolutional neural networks from natural images resemble those learnt by independent component analysis (ICA), a simple unsupervised method that seeks the most non-Gaussian projections of its inputs. This similarity suggests that ICA provides a simple, yet principled model for studying feature learning. Here, we leverage this connection to investigate the interplay between data structure and optimisation in feature learning for the most popular ICA algorithm, FastICA, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is used to train deep networks. We rigorously establish that FastICA requires at least $n\gtrsim d^4$ samples to recover a single non-Gaussian direction from $d$-dimensional inputs on a simple synthetic data model. We show that vanilla online SGD outperforms FastICA, and prove that the optimal sample complexity $n \gtrsim d^2$ can be reached by smoothing the loss, albeit in a data-dependent way. We finally demonstrate the existence of a search phase for FastICA on ImageNet, and discuss how the strong non-Gaussianity of said images compensates for the poor sample complexity of FastICA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters. Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.</description>

      <title>Optimal low-rank approximations for linear Gaussian inverse problems on Hilbert spaces, Part I: posterior covariance approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For linear inverse problems with Gaussian priors and Gaussian observation noise, the posterior is Gaussian, with mean and covariance determined by the conditioning formula. Using the Feldman-Hajek theorem, we analyse the prior-to-posterior update and its low-rank approximation for infinite-dimensional Hilbert parameter spaces and finite-dimensional observations. We show that the posterior distribution differs from the prior on a finite-dimensional subspace, and construct low-rank approximations to the posterior covariance, while keeping the mean fixed. Since in infinite dimensions, not all low-rank covariance approximations yield approximate posterior distributions which are equivalent to the posterior and prior distribution, we characterise the low-rank covariance approximations which do yield this equivalence, and their respective inverses, or `precisions'. For such approximations, a family of measure approximation problems is solved by identifying the low-rank approximations which are optimal for various losses simultaneously. These loss functions include the family of R\'enyi divergences, the Amari $\alpha$-divergences for $\alpha\in(0,1)$, the Hellinger metric and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our results extend those of Spantini et al. (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 2015) to Hilbertian parameter spaces, and provide theoretical underpinning for the construction of low-rank approximations of discretised versions of the infinite-dimensional inverse problem, by formulating discretization independent results.</description>

      <title>Double-jump phase transition for the reverse Littlewood--Offord problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s conjectured in 1945 that for any unit vectors $v_1, \dotsc, v_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and signs $\varepsilon_1, \dotsc, \varepsilon_n$ taken independently and uniformly in $\{-1,1\}$, the random Rademacher sum $\sigma = \varepsilon_1 v_1 + \dotsb + \varepsilon_n v_n$ satisfies $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq 1$ with probability $\Omega(1/n)$. While this conjecture is false for even $n$, Beck has proved that $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq \sqrt{2}$ always holds with probability $\Omega(1/n)$. Recently, He, Ju\v{s}kevi\v{c}ius, Narayanan, and Spiro conjectured that the Erd\H{o}s' conjecture holds when $n$ is odd. We disprove this conjecture by exhibiting vectors $v_1, \dotsc, v_n$ for which $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq 1$ occurs with probability $O(1/n^{3/2})$. On the other hand, an approximated version of their conjecture holds: we show that we always have $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq 1 + \delta$ with probability $\Omega_\delta(1/n)$, for all $\delta &gt; 0$. This shows that when $n$ is odd, the minimum probability that $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq r$ exhibits a double-jump phase transition at $r = 1$, as we can also show that $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq 1$ occurs with probability at least $\Omega((1/2+\mu)^n)$ for some $\mu &gt; 0$. Additionally, and using a different construction, we give a negative answer to a question of Beck and two other questions of He, Ju\v{s}kevi\v{c}ius, Narayanan, and Spiro, concerning the optimal constructions minimising the probability that $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq \sqrt{2}$. We also make some progress on the higher dimensional versions of these questions.</description>

      <title>Optimal low-rank approximations for linear Gaussian inverse problems on Hilbert spaces, Part II: posterior mean approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct optimal low-rank approximations for the Gaussian posterior distribution in linear Gaussian inverse problems. The parameter space is a separable Hilbert space of possibly infinite dimension, and the data space is assumed to be finite-dimensional. We consider various types of approximation families for the posterior. We first consider approximate posteriors in which the means vary among a class of either structure-preserving or structure-ignoring low-rank transformations of the data, and in which the posterior covariance is kept fixed. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for these approximating posteriors to be equivalent to the exact posterior, for all possible realisations of the data simultaneously. For such approximations, we measure approximation error with the Kullback-Leibler, R\'enyi and Amari $\alpha$-divergences for $\alpha\in(0,1)$, and with the Hellinger distance, all averaged over the data distribution. With these losses, we find the optimal approximations and formulate an equivalent condition for their uniqueness, extending the work in finite dimensions of Spantini et al. (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 2015). We then consider joint approximation of the mean and covariance, by also varying the posterior covariance over the low-rank updates considered in Part I of this work. For the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, we show that the separate optimal approximations of the mean and of the covariance can be combined to yield an optimal joint approximation of the mean and covariance. In addition, we interpret the joint approximation with the optimal structure-ignoring approximate mean in terms of an optimal projector in parameter space.</description>

Abstract: Stabilization and sufficient conditions for mixing by stochastic transport are shown. More precisely, given a second order linear operator with possibly unstable eigenvalues on a smooth compact Riemannian manifold, it is shown that the inclusion of transport noise can imply global asymptotic stability. Moreover, it is shown that an arbitrary large exponential rate of convergence can be reached, implying enhanced dissipation. The sufficient conditions are shown to be satisfied by the so-called Kraichnan model for stochastic transport of passive scalars in turbulent fluids. In addition, an example is given showing that it can be sufficient to force four modes in order to induce stabilization.</description>

      <title>Graphical Negative Multinomial and Multinomial Models with Dirichlet-type priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06058v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian statistical graphical models are typically classified as either continuous and parametric (Gaussian, parameterized by the graph-dependent precision matrix with Wishart-type priors) or discrete and non-parametric (with graph-dependent structure of probabilities of cells and Dirichlet-type priors). We propose to break this dichotomy by introducing two discrete parametric graphical models on finite decomposable graphs: the graph negative multinomial and the graph multinomial distributions (the former related to the Cartier-Foata theorem for the graph genereted free quotient monoid). These models interpolate between the product of univariate negative binomial laws and the negative multinomial distribution, and between the product of binomial laws and the multinomial distribution, respectively. We derive their Markov decompositions and provide related probabilistic representations.
  We also introduce graphical versions of the Dirichlet and inverted Dirichlet distributions, which serve as conjugate priors for the two discrete graphical Markov models. We derive explicit normalizing constants for both graphical Dirichlet laws and establish their independence structure (a graphical version of neutrality), which yields a strong hyper Markov property for both Bayesian models. We also provide characterization theorems for graphical Dirichlet laws via respective graphical versions of neutrality, which extends previously known results.</description>

      <title>Existence of Bass martingales and the martingale Benamou$-$Brenier problem in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical optimal transport, the contributions of Benamou$-$Brenier and McCann regarding the time-dependent version of the problem are cornerstones of the field and form the basis for a variety of applications in other mathematical areas.
  In this article, we characterize solutions to the martingale Benamou$-$Brenier problem as $\textit{Bass martingales}$, i.e. transformations of Brownian motion through the gradient of a convex function. Our result is based on a new (static) Brenier-type theorem for a particular weak martingale optimal transport problem. As in the classical case, the structure of the primal optimizer is derived from its dual counterpart, whose derivation forms the technical core of this article. A key challenge is that dual attainment is a subtle issue in martingale optimal transport, where dual optimizers may fail to exist, even in highly regular settings.</description>

      <title>Quantitative estimates of the spectral norm of random matrices with independent columns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03069v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the nonasymptotic properties of the spectral norm of some random matrices with independent columns. In particular, we consider an $m\times n$ random matrix $BA$, where $A$ is an $N\times n$ random matrix with independent mean-zero subexponential entries, and $B$ is an $m\times N$ deterministic matrix. We prove that the $L_{p}$ norm of the spectral norm of $BA$ is upper bounded by $(\sqrt{m}+\sqrt{n})p$. It is remarkable that this result is independent of the dimension $N$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of scaled asymptotically-free self-interacting random walks to Brownian motion perturbed at extrema</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of one-dimensional self interacting walks whose dynamics characterized by a monotone weight function $w$ on $\mathbb{N}\cup \{0\}$. The weight function takes the form $w(n) = (1 + 2^p Bn^{-p} + O(n^{-1-\kappa}))^{-1}$, for some $B \in \mathbb{R} $, $\kappa&gt;0$ and $p\in (0,1]$. Our main model parameter is $p$, and for $p\in (0,1/2]$ we show the convergence of the SIRW to Brownian motion perturbed at extrema under the diffusive scaling. This completes the functional limit theorem in [8] for the asymptotically free case and extends the result to the full parameter range $(0,1]$. Our method depends on the generalized Ray-Knight theorems ([T96], [KMP23]) for the rescaled local times of this walk. The directed edge local times, described by the branching-like processes, are used to analyze the total drift experienced by the walker.</description>

      <title>Weak uniqueness for singular stochastic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We put forward a new method for proving weak uniqueness of stochastic equations with singular drifts driven by a non-Markov or infinite-dimensional noise. We apply our method to study stochastic heat equation (SHE) driven by Gaussian space-time white noise $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u_t(x)=\frac12 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}u_t(x)+b(u_t(x))+\dot{W}_{t}(x), \quad t&gt;0,\, x\in D\subset\mathbb{R}, $$ and multidimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by fractional Brownian motion with the Hurst index $H\in(0,1/2)$ $$ d X_t=b(X_t) dt +d B_t^H,\quad t&gt;0. $$ In both cases $b$ is a generalized function in the Besov space $\mathcal{B}^\alpha_{\infty,\infty}$, $\alpha&lt;0$. Well-known pathwise uniqueness results for these equations do not cover the entire range of the parameter $\alpha$, for which weak existence holds. What happens in the range where weak existence holds but pathwise uniqueness is unknown has been an open problem. We settle this problem and show that for SHE weak uniqueness holds for $\alpha&gt;-3/2$, and for SDE it holds for $\alpha&gt;1/2-1/(2H)$; thus, in both cases, it holds in the entire desired range of values of $\alpha$. This extends seminal results of Catellier and Gubinelli (2016) and Gy\"ongy and Pardoux (1993) to the weak well-posedness setting. To establish these results, we develop a new strategy, combining ideas from ergodic theory (generalized couplings of Hairer-Mattingly-Kulik-Scheutzow) with stochastic sewing of L\^e.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a family of Poisson-Laguerre tessellations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generated by a Poisson point process in $\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}$, whose intensity measure has a density of the form $(v,h)\mapsto f(h){\rm d} h {\rm d} v$, where $v\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and $h\in\mathbb{R}$, with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We study its sectional properties and show that the $\ell$-dimensional section of a Poisson-Laguerre tessellation corresponding to $f$ is an $\ell$-dimensional Poisson-Laguerre tessellation corresponding to $f_{\ell}$, which is up to a constant a fractional integral of $f$ of order $(d-\ell)/2$. Further we derive an explicit representation for the distribution of the volume weighted typical cell of the dual Poisson-Laguerre tessellation in terms of fractional integrals and derivatives of $f$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motions(fBMs) are not semimartingales so the classical theory of It\^o integral can't apply to fBMs. Wick integration as one of the applications of Malliavin calculus to stochastic analysis is a fine definition for fBMs. We consider the fractional forward backward stochastic differential equations(fFBSDEs) driven by a fBM that have the Hurst parameter in (1/2,1) where $\int_{0}^{t} f_s \, dB_s^H$ is in the sense of a Wick integral, and relate our fFBSDEs to the system of partial differential equations by using an analogue of the It\^o formula for Wick integrals. And we develop a deep learning algorithm referred to as the RNN-BSDE method based on recurrent neural networks which is exactly designed for solving high-dimensional fractional BSDEs and their corresponding partial differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the forest fire model on $\mathbb{Z}_+$ with ignition at zero only, studied in [arXiv:0907.1821]. Unlike that model, we allow delays in the spread of the fires as well as the non-zero burning time of individual ``trees''. We obtain some general properties for this model, which cover, among others, the phenomena of an ``infinite fire'', not present in the original model.</description>

      <title>Optimizing over iid distributions and the Beat the Average game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A casino offers the following game. There are three cups each containing a die. You are being told that the dice in the cups are all the same, but possibly nonstandard. For a bet of \$1, the game master shakes all three cups and lets you choose one of them. You win \$2 if the die in your cup displays at least the average of the other two, and you lose otherwise. Is this game in your favor? If not, how should the casino design the dice to maximize their profit?
  This problem is a special case of the following more general question: given a measurable space $X$ and a bounded measurable function $f : X^n \to \R$, how large can the expectation of $f$ under probability measures of the form $\mu^{\otimes n}$ be? We develop a general method to answer this kind of question. As an example application that is harder than the casino problem, we show that the maximal probability of the event $X_1 + X_2 + X_3 &lt; 2 X_4$ for nonnegative iid random variables lies between $0.400695$ and $0.422$, where the upper bound is obtained by mixed integer linear programming. We conjecture the lower bound to be the exact value.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of kinetic McKean-Vlasov equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10987v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the McKean-Vlasov equation $dX_t = b(t, X_t, [X_t])dt + \sigma(t, X_t, [X_t])dW_t$ where $[X_t]$ is the law of $X_t$. We specifically consider the kinetic case, where the equation is degenerate because the dimension of the Brownian motion $W$ is strictly smaller than that of the solution $X$, as commonly required in classical models of collisional kinetic theory. Assuming H\"older continuous coefficients and a weak H\"ormander condition, we prove the well-posedness of the equation. This result advances the existing literature by filling a crucial gap: it addresses the previously unexplored case where the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$ depends on the law $[X_t]$. Notably, our proof employs a simplified and direct argument eliminating the need for PDEs involving derivatives with respect to the measure argument. A critical ingredient is the sub-Riemannian metric structure induced by the corresponding Fokker-Planck operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a closed Riemannian manifold, we construct a family of intrinsic Gaussian noises indexed by a regularity parameter $\alpha\geq0$ to study the well-posedness of the parabolic Anderson model. We show that with rough initial conditions, the equation is well-posed assuming non-positive curvature with a condition on $\alpha$ similar to that of Riesz kernel-correlated noise in Euclidean space. Non-positive curvature was used to overcome a new difficulty introduced by non-uniqueness of geodesics in this setting, which required exploration of global geometry. The well-posedness argument also produces exponentially growing in time upper bounds for the moments. Using Feynman-Kac formula for moments, we also obtain exponentially growing in time second moment lower bounds for our solutions with bounded initial condition.</description>

Abstract: We analyze height fluctuations in Aztec diamond dimer models with nearly arbitrary periodic edge weights. We show that the centered height function approximates the sum of two independent components: a Gaussian free field on the multiply connected liquid region and a harmonic function with random liquid-gas boundary values. The boundary values are jointly distributed as a discrete Gaussian random vector. This discrete Gaussian distribution maintains a quasi-periodic dependence on $N$, a phenomenon also observed in multi-cut random matrix models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the free analogue of the classical affine fixed-point (or perpetuity) equation
  \[
  \mathbb{X} \stackrel{d}{=} \mathbb{A}^{1/2}\mathbb{X}\,\mathbb{A}^{1/2} + \mathbb{B},
  \] where $\mathbb{X}$ is assumed to be $*$-free from the pair $(\mathbb{A},\mathbb{B})$, with $\mathbb{A}\ge 0$ and $\mathbb{B}=\mathbb{B}^*$. Our analysis covers both the subcritical regime, where $\tau(\mathbb{A})&lt;1$, and the critical case $\tau(\mathbb{A})=1$, in which the solution $\mathbb{X}$ is necessarily unbounded. When $\tau(\mathbb{A})=1$, we prove that the series defining $\mathbb{X}$ converges bilaterally almost uniformly (and almost uniformly under additional tail assumptions), while the perpetuity fails to have higher moments even if all moments of $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{B}$ exist.
  Our approach relies on a detailed study of the asymptotic behavior of moments under free multiplicative convolution, which reveals a markedly different behavior from the classical setting. By employing subordination techniques for non-commutative random variables, we derive precise asymptotic estimates for the tail of the distributions of $\mathbb{X}$ in both one-sided and symmetric cases. Interestingly, in the critical case, the free perpetuity exhibits a power-law tail behavior that mirrors the phenomenon observed in the celebrated Kesten's theorem.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of CSBPs via Poissonian Intertwining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit certain decompositions of continuous-state branching processes (CSBPs), commonly referred to as skeletal decompositions, through the lens of intertwining of semi-groups. Precisely, we associate to a CSBP $X$ with branching mechanism $\psi$ a family of $\mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{Z}_+$-valued branching processes $(X^\lambda, L^\lambda)$, indexed by a parameter $\lambda \in (0, \infty)$, that satisfies an intertwining relationship with $X$ through the Poisson kernel with parameter $\lambda x$. The continuous component $X^\lambda$ has the same law as $X$, while the discrete component $L^\lambda$, conditionally on $X^\lambda_t$, has a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda X^\lambda_t$. The law of $(X^\lambda, L^\lambda)$ depends on the position of $\lambda$ within $[0, \infty) = [0, \rho) \cup [\rho, \infty)$, where $\rho$ is the largest positive root of $\psi$. When $\lambda \geq \rho$, various well-known results concerning skeleton decompositions are recovered. In the supercritical case ($\rho &gt; 0$), when $\lambda&lt;\rho$, a novel phenomenon arises: a birth term appears in the skeleton, corresponding to a one-unit proportional immigration from the continuous to the discrete component. Along the way, the class of continuous-time branching processes taking values in $\mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{Z}_+$ is constructed.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Shah [arXiv:2502.03073] derived an explicit expression for the distribution of occupancy times for a two-state Markov chain, using a method based on enumerating sample paths. We consider here the more general problem of finding the distribution of occupancy times for countable-state Markov chains in discrete time. Our approach, which employs generating functions, leads to arguably simpler formulae for the occupancy distribution for the two-state chain.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently proposed a method for estimation of states and parameters in stochastic differential equations, which included intermediate time points between observations and used the Laplace approximation to integrate out these intermediate states. In this paper, we establish a Laplace approximation for the transition probabilities in the continuous-time limit where the computational time step between intermediate states vanishes. Our technique views the driving Brownian motion as a control, casts the problem as one of minimum effort control between two states, and employs a Girsanov shift of probability measure as well as a weak noise approximation to obtain the Laplace approximation. We demonstrate the technique with examples; one where the approximation is exact due to a property of coordinate transforms, and one where contributions from non-near paths impair the approximation. We assess the order of discrete-time scheme, and demonstrate the Strang splitting leads to higher order and accuracy than Euler-type discretization. Finally, we investigate numerically how the accuracy of the approximation depends on the noise intensity and the length of the time interval.</description>

      <title>Phase-type frailty models: A flexible approach to modeling unobserved heterogeneity in survival analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.13142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frailty models are essential tools in survival analysis for addressing unobserved heterogeneity and random effects in the data. These models incorporate a random effect, the frailty, which is assumed to impact the hazard rate multiplicatively. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of frailty models in both univariate and multivariate settings, using phase-type distributions as the underlying frailty specification. We investigate the properties of these phase-type frailty models and develop expectation-maximization algorithms for their maximum-likelihood estimation. In particular, we show that the resulting model shares similarities with the Gamma frailty model, has closed-form expressions for its functionals, and can approximate any other frailty model. Through a series of simulated and real-life numerical examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed models in addressing unobserved heterogeneity in survival analysis.</description>

      <title>Characterization of flip process rules with the same trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Garbe, Hladk\'y, \v{S}ileikis and Skerman [Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e Probab. Stat., 60 (2024), pp. 2878-2922] recently introduced a general class of random graph processes called flip processes and proved that the typical evolution of these discrete-time random graph processes correspond to certain continuous-time deterministic graphon trajectories. We obtain a complete characterization of the equivalence classes of flip process rules with the same graphon trajectories. As an application, we characterize the flip process rules which are unique in their equivalence classes. These include several natural families of rules such as the complementing rules, the component completion rules, the extremist rules, and the clique removal rules.</description>

      <title>A deep implicit-explicit minimizing movement method for option pricing in jump-diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel deep learning approach for pricing European basket options written on assets that follow jump-diffusion dynamics. The option pricing problem is formulated as a partial integro-differential equation, which is approximated via a new implicit-explicit minimizing movement time-stepping approach, involving approximation by deep, residual-type Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for each time step. The integral operator is discretized via two different approaches: (a) a sparse-grid Gauss-Hermite approximation following localised coordinate axes arising from singular value decompositions, and (b) an ANN-based high-dimensional special-purpose quadrature rule. Crucially, the proposed ANN is constructed to ensure the appropriate asymptotic behavior of the solution for large values of the underlyings and also leads to consistent outputs with respect to a priori known qualitative properties of the solution. The performance and robustness with respect to the dimension of these methods are assessed in a series of numerical experiments involving the Merton jump-diffusion model, while a comparison with the deep Galerkin method and the deep BSDE solver with jumps further supports the merits of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Entrywise tensor-train approximation of large tensors via random embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of low-rank tensor-train approximation is well understood when the approximation error is measured in the Frobenius norm. The entrywise maximum norm is equally important but is significantly weaker for large tensors, making the estimates obtained via the Frobenius norm and norm equivalence pessimistic or even meaningless. In this article, we derive a direct estimate of the entrywise approximation error that is applicable in some of these cases. The estimate is given in terms of the higher-order generalization of the matrix factorization norm, and its proof is based on the tensor-structured Hanson--Wright inequality. The theoretical results are accompanied by numerical experiments carried out with the method of alternating projections.</description>

      <title>Entropic curvature not comparable to other curvatures -- or is it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider global $\theta$-curvatures of finite Markov chains with associated means $\theta$ in the spirit of the entropic curvature (based on the logarithmic mean) by Erbar-Maas and Mielke. As in the case of Bakry-\'Emery curvature, we also allow for a finite dimension parameter by making use of an adapted $\Gamma$ calculus for $\theta$-curvatures. We prove explicit positive lower curvature bounds (both finite- and infinite-dimensional) for finite abelian Cayley graphs. In the case of cycles, we provide also an upper curvature bound which shows that our lower bounds are asymptotically sharp (up to a logarithmic factor). Moreover, we prove new universal lower curvature bounds for finite Markov chains as well as curvature perturbation results (allowing, in particular, to compare entropic and Bakry-\'Emery curvatures). Finally, we present examples where entropic curvature differs significantly from other curvature notions like Bakry-\'Emery curvature or Ollivier Ricci and sectional curvatures.</description>

      <title>A Graph Random Walk Method for Calculating Time-of-Flight Charge Mobility in Organic Semiconductors from Multiscale Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved vertices and an interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments, charge carriers are injected into the material and the time until they reach a collecting electrode is recorded. Our approach allows direct evaluation of the expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in terms of a sparse, linear system, avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional Master Equation or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach by numerical studies of charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in diffusive and drift-diffusive regimes using a surrogate lattice model of a realistic material whose properties have been simulated within a multiscale model framework combining quantum-mechanical and molecular-mechanics methods. The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder from the reference baseline. Comparison with results from the Master Equation confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical implementations. We further show that KMC results show substantial deviations due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues and with the benefit of making use of sparse matrix methods.</description>

      <title>New technique for parameter estimation and improved fits to experimental data for a set of compound Poisson distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compound Poisson distributions have been employed by many authors to fit experimental data, typically via the method of moments or maximum likelihood estimation. We propose a new technique and apply it to several sets of published data. It yields better fits than those obtained by the original authors for a set of widely employed compound Poisson distributions (in some cases, significantly better). The technique employs the power spectrum (the absolute square of the characteristic function). The new idea is suggested as a useful addition to the tools for parameter estimation of compound Poisson distributions.</description>

      <title>Stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and Sinkhorn semigroups for log-concave models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we obtain several new results and developments in the study of entropic optimal transport problems (a.k.a. Schr\"odinger problems) with general reference distributions and log-concave target marginal measures. Our approach combines transportation cost inequalities
  with the theory of Riccati matrix difference equations arising in filtering and optimal control theory. This methodology is partly based on a novel entropic stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and closed form expressions of a class of discrete time algebraic Riccati equations. In the context of regularized entropic transport these techniques provide new sharp entropic map estimates. When applied to the stability of Sinkhorn semigroups, they also yield
  a series of novel contraction estimates in terms of the fixed point of Riccati equations.
  The strength of our approach is that it is applicable to a large class of models arising in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. We illustrate the impact of our results in the context of regularized entropic transport, proximal samplers and diffusion generative models as well as diffusion flow matching models</description>

      <title>Beyond Group Means and Into the World of Individuals: A Distributional Spotlight for Experimental Effects on Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, experimental effects on humans are investigated at the group level. In this work, we present a distributional ``spotlight'' to investigate experimental effects at the individual level. Specifically, we estimate the effects on individuals through the changes in the probability distributions of their experimental data across conditions. We test this approach on Reaction Time (RT) data from 10 individuals in a visual search task, examining the effects of (1) information set sizes and (2) the presence or absence of a target on their processing speed. The changes in individuals' RT distributions are measured using three approaches: (i) direct measurements of distributional changes are compared against the changes captured by two established models of RT: (ii) the ex-Gaussian distribution and (iii) the Drift-Diffusion model. We find that direct measurement of distributional changes provides the clearest view of the effects on individuals and highlights the presence of two sub-groups based on the effects experienced: one that shows neither effect and the other showing only the target-presence effect. Moreover, the intra-individual changes across conditions (i.e., the experimental effects) appear much smaller than the inter-individual differences (i.e., the random effects). Generally, these results highlight the merits of going beyond group means and examining the effects on individuals, as well as the effectiveness of the distributional spotlight in such pursuits.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning for Entropy-Regularized Markov Decision Processes via Multilevel Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient learning algorithms with complexity guarantees for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with large or continuous state and action spaces remains a fundamental challenge. We address this challenge for entropy-regularized MDPs with Polish state and action spaces, assuming access to a generative model of the environment. We propose a novel family of multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) algorithms that integrate fixed-point iteration with MLMC techniques and a generic stochastic approximation of the Bellman operator. We quantify the precise impact of the chosen approximate Bellman operator on the accuracy of the resulting MLMC estimator. Leveraging this error analysis, we show that using a biased plain MC estimate for the Bellman operator results in quasi-polynomial sample complexity, whereas an unbiased randomized multilevel approximation of the Bellman operator achieves polynomial sample complexity in expectation. Notably, these complexity bounds are independent of the dimensions or cardinalities of the state and action spaces, distinguishing our approach from existing algorithms whose complexities scale with the sizes of these spaces. We validate these theoretical performance guarantees through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating states and parameters in a model based on a system of coupled stochastic differential equations, based on noisy discrete-time data. Special attention is given to nonlinear dynamics and state-dependent diffusivity, where transition densities are not available in closed form. Our technique adds states between times of observations, approximates transition densities using, e.g., the Euler-Maruyama method and eliminates unobserved states using the Laplace approximation. Using case studies, we demonstrate that transition probabilities are well approximated, and that inference is computationally feasible. We discuss limitations and potential extensions of the method.</description>
