      <title>Inverting airborne electromagnetic data with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on inverting time-domain airborne electromagnetic data in 2D by training a neural-network to understand the relationship between data and conductivity, thereby removing the need for expensive forward modeling during the inversion process. Instead the forward modeling is completed in the training stage, where training models are built before calculating 3D forward modeling training data. The method relies on training data being similar to the field dataset of choice, therefore, the field data was first inverted in 1D to get an idea of the expected conductivity distribution. With this information, $ 10,000 $ training models were built with similar conductivity ranges, and the research shows that this provided enough information for the network to produce realistic 2D inversion models over an aquifer-bearing region in California. Once the training was completed, the actual inversion time took only a matter of seconds on a generic laptop, which means that if future data was collected in this region it could be inverted in near real-time. Better results are expected by increasing the number of training models and eventually the goal is to extend the method to 3D inversion.</description>

      <title>Fully invertible hyperbolic neural networks for segmenting large-scale surface and sub-surface data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large spatial/temporal/frequency scale of geoscience and remote-sensing datasets causes memory issues when using convolutional neural networks for (sub-) surface data segmentation. Recently developed fully reversible or fully invertible networks can mostly avoid memory limitations by recomputing the states during the backward pass through the network. This results in a low and fixed memory requirement for storing network states, as opposed to the typical linear memory growth with network depth. This work focuses on a fully invertible network based on the telegraph equation. While reversibility saves the major amount of memory used in deep networks by the data, the convolutional kernels can take up most memory if fully invertible networks contain multiple invertible pooling/coarsening layers. We address the explosion of the number of convolutional kernels by combining fully invertible networks with layers that contain the convolutional kernels in a compressed form directly. A second challenge is that invertible networks output a tensor the same size as its input. This property prevents the straightforward application of invertible networks to applications that map between different input-output dimensions, need to map to outputs with more channels than present in the input data, or desire outputs that decrease/increase the resolution compared to the input data. However, we show that by employing invertible networks in a non-standard fashion, we can still use them for these tasks. Examples in hyperspectral land-use classification, airborne geophysical surveying, and seismic imaging illustrate that we can input large data volumes in one chunk and do not need to work on small patches, use dimensionality reduction, or employ methods that classify a patch to a single central pixel.</description>

      <title>The Nash-MTL-STCN for Prestack Three-Parameter Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques have been widely used in prestack three-parameter inversion to address its ill-posed problems. Among these DL techniques, Multi-task learning (MTL) methods can simultaneously train multiple tasks, thereby enhancing model generalization and predictive performance. However, existing MTL methods typically adopt heuristic or non-heuristic approaches to jointly update the gradient of each task, leading to gradient conflicts between different tasks and reducing inversion accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised temporal convolutional network (STCN) based on Nash equilibrium (Nash-MTL-STCN). Firstly, temporal convolutional networks (TCN) with non-causal convolution and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used as multi-task layers to extract the shared features from partial angle stack seismic data, with CNNs serving as the single-task layer. Subsequently, the feature mechanism is utilized to extract shared features in the multi-task layer through hierarchical processing, and the gradient combination of these shared features is treated as a Nash game for strategy optimization and joint updates. Ultimately, the overall utility of the three-parameter is maximized, and gradient conflicts are alleviated. In addition, to enhance the network's generalization and stability, we have incorporated geophysical forward modeling and low-frequency models into the network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes the gradient conflict issue of the conventional MTL methods with constant weights (CW) and achieves higher precision than four widely used non-heuristic MTL methods. Further field data experiments also validate the method's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Medium-scale thermospheric gravity waves in the high-resolution Whole Atmosphere Model: Seasonal, local time, and longitudinal variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the global medium-scale (scales&lt;620 km) gravity wave (GW) activity (in terms of zonal wind variance) and its seasonal, local time and longitudinal variations by employing the enhanced-resolution (~50 km) Whole Atmosphere Model (WAMT254) and space-based observations for geomagnetically quiet conditions. It is found that the GW hotspots produced by WAMT254 in the troposphere and stratosphere agree well with previously well-studied orographic and non-orographic sources. In the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) region, GWs spread out forming latitudinal band-like hotspots. During solstices, a primary maximum in GW activity is observed in WAMT254 and GOCE over winter mid-high latitudes, likely associated with higher-order waves with primary sources in polar night jet, fronts and polar vortex. During all the seasons, the enhancement of GWs around the geomagnetic poles as observed by GOCE (at ~250 km) is well captured by simulations. WAMT254 GWs in the IT region also show dependence on local time due to their interaction with migrating tides leading to diurnal and semidiurnal variations. The GWs are more likely to propagate up from the MLT region during westward/weakly-eastward phase of thermospheric tides, signifying the dominance of eastward GW momentum flux in the MLT. Additionally, as a novel finding, a wavenumber-4 signature in GW activity is predicted by WAMT254 between 6-12 LT in the tropics at ~250 km, which propagates eastward with local time. This behavior is likely associated with the modulation of GWs by wave-4 signal of non-migrating tides in the lower thermospheric zonal winds.</description>

      <title>Features of the intra-mass buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The buoyancy force is the cause of ordered vertical movements in the atmosphere, therefore, the analysis of the causes and conditions of its formation is important not only for the formation of convective clouds, but also for understanding all atmospheric transport processes. Due to the absence of rigid boundaries inside the gas, a horizontal pressure gradient in a static state cannot exist in the allocated volume. The pressure inside the allocated volume with a different density is equal to the external pressure and the intra-mass buoyancy force, according to its definition, is formally zero. The observed force of intra-mass buoyancy arises due to the difference in vertical pressure gradients in media with different densities. In this case, the buoyancy force is volumetric, and its value corresponds to generally accepted ratios.</description>

      <title>Density deficit of the Earth's core revealed by a multi-megabar primary pressure scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate pressure scale is a fundamental requirement to understand planetary interiors. Here, we establish a primary pressure scale extending to the multi-megabar pressures of the Earth's core, by combined measurement of the acoustic velocities and the density from a rhenium sample in a diamond anvil cell using inelastic x-ray scattering and x-ray diffraction. Our scale agrees well with previous primary scales and shock Hugoniots in each experimental pressure range, and reveals that previous scales have overestimated laboratory pressures by at least 20% at 230 gigapascals. It suggests that the light element content in the Earth's inner core (the density deficit relative to iron) is likely to be double what was previously estimated, or the Earth's inner core temperature is much higher than expected, or some combination thereof.</description>

      <title>Lunar antineutrinos and heat: fluxes from primordial radioactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the fluxes of heat and antineutrinos due to primordial radioactivity within the moon. We use a radial density profile, specifying an inner core and a model-averaged crust. Thickness, density, and elevation of the lunar crust are from remote measurements of the gravitational field. Lateral and vertical variations of thorium, uranium, and potassium abundances in the crust follow from a prediction of the lunar bulk chemical composition. We constrain the total contents of thorium, uranium, and potassium using estimates for the earth's primitive mantle. These contents produce $311\pm37$ GW of radiogenic heating and a surface-averaged heat flux of $8.19\pm0.97$ mW/m$^2$. Our lunar model estimates an antineutrino flux of $(1.83\pm0.32)\times10^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and an antineutrino inverse beta decay rate of $5.8\pm1.0$ per $10^{32}$ free proton targets per year, both averaged over the surface.</description>

      <title>Shakebot: A Low-cost, Open-source Robotic Shake Table for Earthquake Research and Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shake tables serve as a critical tool for simulating earthquake events and testing the response of structures to seismic forces. However, existing shake tables are either expensive or proprietary. This paper presents the design and implementation of a low-cost, open-source shake table named \textit{Shakebot} for earthquake engineering research and education, built using Robot Operating System (ROS) and principles of robotics. The Shakebot adapts affordable and high-accuracy components from 3D printers, particularly a closed-loop stepper motor for actuation and a toothed belt for transmission. The stepper motor enables the bed to reach a maximum horizontal acceleration of 11.8 $m/s^2$ (1.2 $\mathbf{g}$), and velocity of 0.5 $m/s$, with a 2 $kg$ specimen. The Shakebot is equipped with an accelerometer and a high frame-rate camera for bed motion estimation. The low cost and easy use make the Shakebot accessible to a wide range of users, including students, educators, and researchers in resource-constrained settings.
  The Shakebot, along with its digital twin--a virtual shake robot--has showcased significant potential in advancing ground motion research. Specifically, this study examines the dynamics of precariously balanced rocks. The Shakebot provides an approach to validate the simulation through physical experiments. The ROS-based perception and motion software facilitates the code transition from our virtual shake robot to the physical Shakebot. The reuse of the control programs ensures that the implemented ground motions are consistent for both the simulation and physical experiments, which is critical to validate our simulation experiments.</description>
