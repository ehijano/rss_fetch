      <title>Impact of redshift distribution uncertainties on Lyman-break galaxy cosmological parameter inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant number of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) with redshifts 3 &lt; z &lt; 5 are expected to be observed by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). This will enable us to probe the universe at higher redshifts than is currently possible with cosmological galaxy clustering and weak lensing surveys. However, accurate inference of cosmological parameters requires precise knowledge of the redshift distributions of selected galaxies, where the number of faint objects expected from LSST alone will make spectroscopic based methods of determining these distributions extremely challenging. To overcome this difficulty, it may be possible to leverage the information in the large volume of photometric data alone to precisely infer these distributions. This could be facilitated using forward models, where in this paper we use stellar population synthesis (SPS) to estimate uncertainties on LBG redshift distributions for a 10 year LSST (LSSTY10) survey. We characterise some of the modelling uncertainties inherent to SPS by introducing a flexible parameterisation of the galaxy population prior, informed by observations of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and cosmic star formation density (CSFRD). These uncertainties are subsequently marginalised over and propagated to cosmological constraints in a Fisher forecast. Assuming a known dust attenuation model for LBGs, we forecast constraints on the sigma8 parameter comparable to Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes with mass ratio-modulated initial clustering: merger suppression and projected constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modification of the expected local primordial black hole (PBH) count $N(y)$, typically seen in the context of the early PBH binary merger rate as a term in the merger rate suppression. We utilize recent results in small-scale PBH clustering to formulate $N(y)$ in such a way that accounts for variations in the binary mass ratio $q$. We then examine how this change affects the projected constraints on PBH abundance from simulated Einstein Telescope (ET) and LISA mergers. Our results indicate that for broadly extended mass distributions, the merger suppression is greatly reduced for binaries with $q \gg 1$. This leads to an enhanced merger rate for binary distributions favoring a lighter average mass. This change is best reflected in the constraints derived from the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), as the increased merger rate does not have as much of an impact on constraints from resolvable mergers. Our results imply that the assumption of PBH clustering is testable at abundances and mass ranges much lower than anticipated, but only definitively through measurements of the SGWB.</description>

      <title>Indicator Functions: Distilling the Information from Gaussian Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A random Gaussian density field contains a fixed amount of Fisher information on the amplitude of its power spectrum. For a given smoothing scale, however, that information is not evenly distributed throughout the smoothed field. We investigate which parts of the field contain the most information by smoothing and splitting the field into different levels of density (using the formalism of indicator functions), deriving analytic expressions for the information content of each density bin in the joint-probability distribution (given a distance separation). We find that the information peaks at moderately rare densities (where the number of smoothed survey cells $N\sim 100$). Counter-intuitively, we find that, for a finite survey volume, indicator function analysis can outperform conventional two-point statistics while using only a fraction of the total survey cells, and we explain why. In light of recent developments in marked statistics (such as the indicator power spectrum and density-split clustering), this result elucidates how to optimize sampling for effective extraction of cosmological information.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-Attractor E-Model in Warm Inflation: Observational Viability from Planck 2018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the inflationary evolution and observational viability of the $\alpha$-attractor E-model in the framework of warm inflation, focusing on both weak and strong dissipative regimes, with a dissipation coefficient linear in temperature. In the strong regime, we account for the growth of inflaton fluctuations due to coupling with the radiation bath via two different forms for the dissipation enhancement function: one associated with plateau-like potentials, and another motivated by the warm little inflation scenario. Employing slow roll conditions, we analytically derive the expressions for the key inflationary observables, the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, in both dissipative regimes. The resulting theoretical trajectories on the $n_s$--$r$ plane are then juxtaposed with the contour plots obtained from Planck 2018 data in order to constrain the model parameter. Our analysis shows that the warm $\alpha$-attractor E-model remains compatible with observations in both dissipative regimes, with dissipation playing a crucial role in shifting the predictions and enlarging the viable parameter space, highlighting observational robustness of the model when extended to warm inflation.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Save $R^2$ Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the latest Planck-Atacama Cosmology Telescope (P-ACT) joint results on the primordial scalar power spectrum, we show that the $R^2$ inflation model extended with a non-minimally coupled scalar field $\chi$--namely the $R^2$-Higgs model--can yield a larger spectral index $n_s$ and a small positive running $\alpha_s$ at cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales, which are consistent with the data. This is because the $\chi$ field contributes a blue-tilted component to the primordial power spectrum which both modifies the large-scale power and, as a result, significantly enhances power on small scales. The consequent enhancement be large enough to lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $\lesssim 10^{20}\mathrm{g}$, accounting for all of the dark matter. Furthermore, future observations of the small-scale power spectrum, CMB spectral distortions, and stochastic gravitational waves will provide decisive tests of this model and its predictions for PBHs.</description>

      <title>Quantum cosmological perturbations in bouncing models with mimetic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations originated from quantum vacuum fluctuations in bouncing scenarios proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology} in the framework of mimetic cosmology. We show that all physically relevant models produce scale invariant spectral indices, and amplitudes compatible with observations provided that the bounce occurs at length scales $t_0$ inside the physically reasonable interval $10^5 l_p &lt; t_0 &lt; 10^9 l_p$. We also show that by slightly modifying the scalar field potential proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology}, we can also obtain the observed red-tilted spectral index, with the same amplitude constraints. Hence, mimetic cosmology provides reasonable bouncing cosmological models without the need of any background quantum effect.</description>

      <title>Separating Angular and Radial Modes with Spherical-Fourier Bessel Power Spectrum on All Scales and Implications for Systematics Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and upcoming large-scale structure surveys place stringent requirements on the mitigation of observational systematics in order to achieve their unprecedented constraining power. In this work, we investigate the potential use of the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) power spectrum in controlling systematics, leveraging its capability of disentangling angular and radial scales. We first clarify how the discrete SFB basis describes radial scales via the index $n$ and demonstrate that the SFB power spectrum reduces to the clustering wedge $P(k,\mu)$ in the plane-parallel limit, enabling it to inherit results from past literature based on the clustering wedge. Crucially, the separation of angular and radial scales allows systematics to be localized in SFB space. In particular, systematics with broad and smooth radial distributions primarily concentrate in the $n=0$ modes corresponding to the largest radial scales. This localization behavior enables one to selectively remove only particular angular and radial modes contaminated by systematics. This is in contrast to standard 3D clustering analyses based on power spectrum multipoles, where systematic effects necessitate the removal of all modes below a given $k_{\rm min}$. Our findings advocate for adopting the SFB basis in 3D clustering analyses where systematics have become a limiting factor.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Perturbation Theory at Field-level: the LSS bootstrap in GridSPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first step toward field-level cosmological inference beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, focusing on optimizing precision tests in the nonlinear regime of large-scale structure (LSS). As an illustrative case, we study the model-independent ``bootstrap'' coefficient of the second-order perturbation theory (PT) kernel for matter in real space, which we use as a proxy for new physics effects in the nonlinear sector. We discuss in details the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff dependence induced by discretizing fields on a grid, which requires proper renormalization to eliminate grid artifacts. We formulate a Wilsonian perturbative framework in which the evolution from a UV theory defined at a high cutoff $\Lambda_\text{uv}$ down to lower cutoffs is computed analytically, even beyond the validity of a derivative expansion. Within this framework, we develop an extended version of the GridSPT code incorporating the bootstrap parameterization and demonstrate how cutoff-independent predictions can be achieved through the inclusion of appropriate counterterms. We validate our approach at third- and fifth-order in PT, emphasizing the importance of higher-derivative contributions for unbiased parameter extraction. Our framework is readily extendable to biased tracers and redshift-space distortions.</description>

      <title>Constraining Dark Matter Parameters in the Lambda-CDM Framework: A Bayesian Comparison of Planck and DES Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian analysis of cosmological parameter constraints from early- and late-universe observations, focusing on the matter density parameter ($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$) within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Using data from the Planck 2018 satellite mission and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3, we compute theoretical predictions for angular and matter power spectra via Boltzmann solvers and perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling using the \texttt{emcee} Python package. Our key contribution is a direct and quantitative comparison of DES and Planck constraints, assessing their consistency using chi-squared analysis and Gaussian tension metrics. We find a statistically significant $6.46\sigma$ tension in $\Omega_m$ and a $2.68\sigma$ tension in $\sigma_8$ between the two datasets. These results provide fresh evidence of persistent discrepancies in cosmological parameter estimates and suggest that simple extensions to the $\Lambda$CDM model may be insufficient to fully reconcile early- and late-time observations, motivating the need for more complex theoretical models or refined treatment of systematics.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Cluster Mass Estimation Through The Splashback Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the splashback radius ($R_{\text{sp}}$) and the associated splashback mass ($M_{\text{sp}}$) for a sample of galaxy clusters using SDSS spectroscopic data and mock simulations. $R_{\text{sp}}$ marks a physical boundary between the virialized core and the outer infall regions of clusters, providing a robust measure of cluster mass accretion history without being affected by pseudo-evolution. We model the cumulative galaxy number profile of clusters, testing different halo density models and considering the impact of cluster properties, such as center definitions, magnitude limits, galaxy colors, and field contamination, on the estimation of splashback features. Our results show that observed splashback radii, measured in projection (2D), are consistently smaller than predicted by dark matter simulations, with $R_\text{sp}/R_{200m} \approx 1$, supporting previous discrepancies in the literature. We also explore the relationship between $M_{\text{sp}}$ and $R_{\text{sp}}$, proposing a new scaling relation for future cosmological studies, as $R_{\text{sp}}$ is easily observable. Our findings indicate that splashback masses strongly correlate with radii, with a dispersion of $\approx 0.15$ dex, competitive with other mass-observable relations. However, the fitted relation diverges from the constant density expectations of galaxy clusters around $R_\text{sp}$. Additionally, the $M_{\text{sp}} \textendash R_{\text{sp}}$ relation shows significant redshift evolution, though the predominantly low-redshift range of our sample limits our ability to confirm this trend conclusively. The approach developed here may play a key role in cluster characterization and cosmology in the era of large galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Constraints on cosmology and baryonic feedback with joint analysis of Dark Energy Survey Year 3 lensing data and ACT DR6 thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a joint analysis of weak gravitational lensing (shear) data obtained from the first three years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect measurements from a combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Planck data. A combined analysis of shear (which traces the projected mass) with the tSZ effect (which traces the projected gas pressure) can jointly probe both the distribution of matter and the thermodynamic state of the gas, accounting for the correlated effects of baryonic feedback on both observables. We detect the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation at a 21$\sigma$ significance, the highest to date, after minimizing the bias from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ map. By jointly modeling the small-scale shear auto-correlation and the shear$~\times~$tSZ cross-correlation, we obtain $S_8 = 0.811^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.263^{+0.023}_{-0.030}$, results consistent with primary CMB analyses from Planck and P-ACT. We find evidence for reduced thermal gas pressure in dark matter halos with masses $M &lt; 10^{14} \, M_{\odot}/h$, supporting predictions of enhanced feedback from active galactic nuclei on gas thermodynamics. A comparison of the inferred matter power suppression reveals a $2-4\sigma$ tension with hydrodynamical simulations that implement mild baryonic feedback, as our constraints prefer a stronger suppression. Finally, we investigate biases from cosmic infrared background leakage in the tSZ-shear cross-correlation measurements, employing mitigation techniques to ensure a robust inference. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Multi-band observation of lensed gravitational waves as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational lensing effect of gravitational waves (GWs) has been extensively discussed as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos, which can provide missing information about dark matter. We propose a multi-band observation of lensed GWs from a compact binary to observe both geometrical optics (GO) and wave optics (WO) effects from the same source. This method is expected to be advantageous in breaking parameter degeneracies between a GW source and a dark matter halo acting as a lens. We assume DECIGO or B-DECIGO as a space-based detector observing the early inspiral phase, and the ET as a ground-based detector observing the merger phase. We perform a Fisher analysis of multi-band detection for a source with masses $m_1 = 30 M_{\odot}, m_2 = 20 M_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.5$, and a lens with mass $3 \times 10^{3} M_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.0$. With this setup, the GO effect appears in the ET frequency band, and the WO effect in that of DECIGO. For the halo density profile, we adopt Singular Isothermal Sphere, Cored Isothermal Sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White models. We find that multi-band observation resolves parameter degeneracies and significantly reduces errors in estimated parameters. For the CIS model, in particular, we show that, by combining ET and DECIGO observations, the lens mass error improves by about 71 $\%$ and 58 $\%$ compared to ET and DECIGO alone, respectively. Similarly, the impact parameter error is reduced by about 65 $\%$ and 70 $\%$, and the core size error by 34 $\%$ and 68 $\%$, respectively. From these results, we conclude that the multi-band observation of GWs from compact binaries improves the estimation of the lens object properties by breaking the parameter degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Power Spectrum Emulators from Neural Networks and Tree-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use two subsets of 2000 and 1000 \textsc{Quijote} simulations to build two power spectrum emulators, allowing for fast computations of the non-linear matter power spectrum. The first emulator works on scales $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$ in terms of seven cosmological parameters: the matter and baryon fraction of the energy density of the Universe $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$, the reduced Hubble constant $h$, the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the amplitude of matter density fluctuations $\sigma_8$, the total neutrino mass $M_{\nu}$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. The power spectra can be directly determined at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3, while for intermediate redshifts these can be interpolated. The second emulator is based on five cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$ and the amplitude of equilateral non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equilateral}$, at redshifts 0, 0.503, 0.733, 0.997 for $k \in [0.015,1.8]\,h/ \rm{Mpc^{-1}}$. The emulators are built on machine learning techniques. In both cases we have investigated both neural networks and tree-based methods and we have shown that the best accuracy is obtained for a neural network with two hidden layers. Both emulators achieve a root-mean-squared relative error of less then 5\% for all the redshifts considered on the scales discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-Separable Halo Bias from High-Redshift Galaxy Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The halo model provides a powerful framework for interpreting galaxy clustering by linking the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes to the underlying matter distribution. A key assumption within the linear bias approximation of the halo model is that the halo bias between two halo populations is a separable function of the mass of each population. In this work, we test the validity of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear scales using both simulations and observational data. Unlike previous studies, we explicitly disentangle the effects of scale dependence of the bias to assess the robustness of bias separability across a broad range of halo masses and redshifts. In particular, we define a separability function based on halo or galaxy cross-correlations to quantify deviations from halo bias separability, and measure it from N-body simulations. We find significant departures from separability on quasi-linear scales ($\sim$ 1-5 Mpc) at high redshifts ($z \geq 3$), leading to enhancements in halo cross-correlations by up to a factor of 2 -- or even higher. In contrast, deviations at low redshifts remain modest. Additionally, using high-redshift ($z \sim 3.6$) galaxy samples, we detect deviations from bias separability that closely align with simulation predictions. The breakdown of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear scales at high redshifts underscore the importance to account for non-separability in models of the galaxy-halo connection in this regime. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of high-redshift galaxy cross-correlations as a probe for improving the galaxy-halo connection from upcoming large-scale surveys.</description>

      <title>CMB line-of-sight integrators for nearly-isotropic cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneous and nearly-isotropic cosmological models are natural extensions of standard Friedmann cosmologies. Constraining their features is crucial, as any detection of their properties would impact our understanding of inflation and the cosmological principle. Since these models evolve as a set of non-interacting scalar, vector, and tensor modes on top of homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, their imprints on cosmological observables, particularly the CMB, can be obtained using standard line-of-sight methods. This requires (1) that one resorts on Laplacian eigenmodes on spatially curved spaces and (2) that radial functions for these modes are analytically continued to accommodate complex (i.e., supercurvature) wavenumbers. We introduce two line-of-sight integrators implementing the evolution of the CMB anisotropies in these models: \texttt{AniLoS}, a user-friendly and easy to modify \texttt{Python} package, and \texttt{AniCLASS}, an advanced and efficient extension of the Boltzmann solver \texttt{CLASS}. We discuss possible initial conditions that could generate such fluctuations and provide illustrative examples using our codes. This work offers a pathway for leveraging diverse cosmological datasets to constrain superhorizon anisotropies of the late-time universe.</description>

      <title>Not so dark, not so dense: an alternative explanation for the lensing subhalo in SDSSJ0946+1006</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies of the strong lens system SDSSJ0946+1006 have reported a dark matter subhalo with an unusually high central density, potentially challenging the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. However, these analyses assumed the subhalo to be completely dark, neglecting the possibility that it may host a faint galaxy. In this work, we revisit the lensing analysis of SDSSJ0946+1006, explicitly modelling the subhalo as a luminous satellite. Incorporating light from the perturber broadens the range of allowed subhalo properties, revealing solutions with significantly lower central densities that are consistent with CDM expectations. The inferred luminosity of the satellite also aligns with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. While high-concentration subhaloes remain allowed, they are no longer statistically preferred. The luminous subhalo model yields a better fit to the data, while also offering a more plausible explanation that is in line with theoretical expectations. We validate our methodology using mock data, demonstrating that neglecting subhalo light can lead to inferred mass distributions that are artificially compact.</description>

      <title>Resonant neutrino self-interactions: insights from the full shape galaxy power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates resonant neutrino self-interactions in cosmology by employing, for the first time, the effective field theory of large-scale structure to model their impact on the matter distribution up to mildly nonlinear scales. We explore a broad range of mediator masses in two main analyses: one combining BOSS Full Shape (FS) galaxy clustering with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and another combining FS with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Our results place the strongest cosmological constraints to date on the resonant self interactions when using FS+Planck data, reaching up to $g_\nu&lt; 10.8 \times 10^{-14}$ at $95\%$ confidence for the 1 eV mediator. Notably, FS+BBN can constrain the interaction for the 10 eV mediator independently of CMB data, yielding $g_\nu &lt; 7.33 \times 10^{-12}$ at $95\%$ confidence. Our results suggest that resonant neutrino self-interactions are unlikely to resolve existing cosmological tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in production of scalaron dark matter in $f(R)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the scalaron, a scalar degree of freedom, emerging from the $f(R)$ theory of gravity, can account for the observed dark matter (DM) abundance if its mass is around the MeV scale, to ensure its cosmological stability. Focusing on two well-known $f(R)$ gravity models, we systematically show that if scalaron production proceeds via the freeze-in mechanism, the right relic abundance is satisfied over a very narrow window of reheating temperature $10^{14}\lesssim T_{\rm rh}\lesssim 10^{16}$ GeV. We delineate the viable parameter space of the $f(R)$ models consistent with the observed DM abundance, and highlight relevant experimental constraints from searches targeting DM decay signatures.</description>

      <title>Composite Hybrid Inflation : Primordial Black Holes and Stochastic Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production of primordial black holes and gravitational waves in composite hybrid inflation. Starting from an effective chiral Lagrangian with a dilaton and pions, we identify inflation occurring due to the walking dynamics of the theory. A $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-breaking term in the pion sector induces a shift in the inflaton's trajectory, which leads to a tachyonic instability phase. Curvature perturbations grow exponentially, producing copious primordial black holes and a stochastic gravitational wave background. We show that the primordial black hole mass and the gravitational wave frequency are strongly restricted by the anomalous dimensions of the pion operators, with larger anomalous dimensions giving lighter primordial black holes and higher frequency gravitational waves. In both cases, the associated signatures lie within reach of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of LLM integration in final-year undergraduate astronomy education, examining how students develop AI literacy through structured guidance and documentation requirements. We developed AstroTutor, a domain-specific astronomy tutoring system enhanced with curated arXiv content, and deployed it alongside general-purpose LLMs in the course. Students documented their AI usage through homework reflections and post-course surveys. We analyzed student evolution in AI interaction strategies and conducted experimental comparisons of LLM-assisted versus traditional grading methods. LLM grading showed strong correlation with human evaluation while providing more detailed and consistent feedback. We also piloted LLM-facilitated interview-based examinations as a scalable alternative to traditional assessments, demonstrating potential for individualized evaluation that addresses common testing limitations. Students experienced decreased rather than increased reliance on LLMs over the semester, developing critical evaluation skills and strategic tool selection. They evolved from basic assistance-seeking to verification workflows, with documentation requirements fostering metacognitive awareness. Students developed effective prompting strategies, contextual enrichment techniques, and cross-verification practices. Our findings suggest that structured LLM integration with transparency requirements and domain-specific tools can enhance astronomy education while building essential AI literacy skills. We provide implementation guidelines for educators and make our AstroTutor repository freely available.</description>

      <title>Spatial Correlation between Pulsars from Interfering Gravitational-Wave Sources in Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the nanohertz band, the spatial correlations in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) produced by interfering gravitational waves (GWs) from multiple sources likely deviate from the traditional ones without interference under the assumption of an isotropic Gaussian ensemble. This work investigates the impact of such interference within the framework of massive gravity. Through simulations, we show that while the resulting correlation patterns can be described by Legendre expansions with coefficients that depend on the interference configuration, they remain predominantly quadrupolar (l = 2), with this feature becoming more pronounced as the graviton mass increases--reflecting both the tensorial polarizations and the modified GW dispersion. However, the interference introduces significant variability in the angular correlation, making it difficult to distinguish massive gravity from general relativity based on a single realization of the Universe. We conclude that beyond a fundamental constraint set by the PTA observation time, achieving a substantially tighter bound on the graviton mass is statistically challenging and observationally limited under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Variance of the Pantheon+ Dataset: Systematics in the Covariance Matrix?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the statistics of the available Pantheon+ dataset. Noticing that the $\chi^2$ value for the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model to the real data is small, we quantify how significant its smallness is by calculating the distribution of $\chi^2$ values for the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model fit to mock Pantheon+-like datasets, using the provided covariance matrix. We further investigate the distribution of the residuals of the Pantheon+ dataset with respect to the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model, and notice that they scatter less than would be expected from the covariance matrix but find no significant kurtosis. These results point to the conclusion that the Pantheon+ covariance matrix is over-estimated. One simple interpretation of these results is a $\sim$7\% overestimation of errors on SN distance moduli in Pantheon+ data. When the covariance matrix is reduced by subtracting an intrinsic scatter term from the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix, the best-fit $\chi^2$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model achieves a normal value of 1580 and no deviation from $\Lambda$CDM is detected. We further quantify how consistent the $\Lambda$CDM model is with respect to the modified data with the subtracted covariance matrix using model-independent reconstruction techniques such as the iterative smoothing method. We find that the standard model is consistent with the data. There are a number of potential explanations for this smallness of the $\chi^2$, such as a Malmquist bias at high redshift, or accounting for systematic uncertainties by adding them to the covariance matrix, thus approximating systematic uncertainties as statistical ones.</description>

      <title>Union Through UNITY: Cosmology with 2,000 SNe Using a Unified Bayesian Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were instrumental in establishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. By virtue of their combination of distance reach, precision, and prevalence, they continue to provide key cosmological constraints, complementing other cosmological probes. Individual SN surveys cover only over about a factor of two in redshift, so compilations of multiple SN datasets are strongly beneficial. We assemble an up-to-date "Union" compilation of 2087 cosmologically useful SNe Ia from 24 datasets ("Union3"). We take care to put all SNe on the same distance scale and update the light-curve fitting with SALT3 to use the full rest-frame optical. Over the next few years, the number of cosmologically useful SNe Ia will increase by more than a factor of ten, and keeping systematic uncertainties subdominant will be more challenging than ever. We discuss the importance of treating outliers, selection effects, light-curve shape and color populations and standardization relations, unexplained dispersion, and heterogeneous observations simultaneously. We present an updated Bayesian framework, called UNITY1.5 (Unified Nonlinear Inference for Type-Ia cosmologY), that incorporates significant improvements in our ability to model selection effects, standardization, and systematic uncertainties compared to earlier analyses. As an analysis byproduct, we also recover the posterior of the SN-only peculiar-velocity field, although we do not interpret it in this work. We compute updated cosmological constraints with Union3 and UNITY1.5, finding weak 1.7--2.6 sigma tension with LambdaCDM and possible evidence for thawing dark energy (w0 &gt; -1, wa &lt; 0). We release our SN distances, light-curve fits, and UNITY1.5 framework to the community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An omnipresent feature of the multi-phase ``cosmic web'' is that warm/hot (&gt;$10^5$ K) ionized gas pervades it. This gas constitutes a relevant contribution to the overall universal matter budget across multiple scales, from the several tens of Mpc-scale IGM filaments, to the Mpc ICM, all the way down to the CGM surrounding individual galaxies from ~1 kpc up to their respective virial radii (~100 kpc). The study of the hot baryonic component of cosmic matter density represents a powerful means for constraining the intertwined evolution of galactic populations and large-scale cosmological structures, for tracing the matter assembly in the Universe and its thermal history. To this end, the SZ effect provides the ideal observational tool for measurements out to the beginnings of structure formation. The SZ effect is caused by the scattering of the photons from the cosmic microwave background off the hot electrons embedded within cosmic structures, and provides a redshift-independent perspective on the thermal and kinematic properties of the warm/hot gas. Still, current and future (sub)mm facilities have been providing only a partial view of the SZ Universe due to any combination of: limited angular resolution, spectral coverage, field of view, spatial dynamic range, sensitivity. In this paper, we motivate the development of a wide-field, broad-band, multi-chroic continuum instrument for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) by identifying the scientific drivers that will deepen our understanding of the complex thermal evolution of cosmic structures. On a technical side, this will necessarily require efficient multi-wavelength mapping of the SZ signal with an unprecedented spatial dynamic range (from arcsecond to tens of arcminutes) and we employ theoretical forecasts to determine the key instrumental constraints for achieving our goals.

      <title>Matter power spectrum induced by primordial magnetic fields: from the linear to the non-linear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear theory predicts that primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) enhance the matter power spectrum on small scales. However, the linear approximation breaks down on sufficiently small scales where PMF-induced baryon perturbations back-react onto the magnetic fields. Previous studies assumed that the baryon power spectrum would be sharply suppressed in this non-linear regime, based on arguments related to the magnetic Jeans scale. For the first time, we perform dedicated magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to investigate the transition from the linear to the non-linear regime. Our simulations confirm the expected linear behavior on large scales. In the non-linear regime, however, we find that the dimensionless baryon power spectrum saturates to an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ value, which contrasts with previous analytical expectations. Additionally, our results show that several past studies overestimated the total matter power spectrum by orders of magnitude near the transition to non-linearity. Thus, the results presented in this work are useful to obtain more accurate constraints on PMFs from structure formation processes and/or different tracers of cosmic structures.</description>

Abstract: We propose a unified framework that describes both the curvaton mechanism for generating primordial density fluctuations and the Affleck-Dine (AD) mechanism for baryogenesis. By introducing a complex scalar field (AD field) carrying a baryon/lepton number and its potential consisting of quadratic and quartic terms with a small baryon/lepton-number-violating mass term, we investigate the evolution of the scalar field during the radiation-dominated era following inflation. We set the initial conditions such that the quartic term dominates the scalar potential, and the angular component of the AD field is non-zero. We focus on a scenario where the AD field sufficiently dominates the energy density of the universe before its decay. We show that the radial component of the AD field can be identified with the curvaton to solely produce the Planck normalized scalar power spectrum while the evolution of the angular component is crucial for generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. Additionally, we find that the amplitude of scalar bispectrum $f_{NL}$ is negative, which is consistent with the current Planck data and testable in future observations such as CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, LSS, and 21-cm experiments. In our estimation of the scalar power spectrum and bispectrum, we develop a novel analytical scheme for computing scalar fluctuations based on the $\delta N$ formalism, which allows us to deal with the evolution of curvaton with polynomial potential more accurately in comparison to the existing analytical methods.</description>

      <title>Boosting HI-Galaxy Cross-Clustering Signal through Higher-Order Cross-Correlations</title>

Abstract: After reionization, neutral hydrogen (HI) traces the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe, enabling HI intensity mapping (IM) to capture the LSS in 3D and constrain key cosmological parameters. We present a new framework utilizing higher-order cross-correlations to study HI clustering around galaxies, tested using real-space data from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation. This approach computes the joint distributions of $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) optical galaxies and the HI brightness temperature field smoothed at relevant scales (the $k$NN-field framework), providing sensitivity to all higher-order cross-correlations, unlike two-point statistics. To simulate HI data from actual surveys, we add random thermal noise and apply a simple foreground cleaning model, filtering out Fourier modes of the brightness temperature field with $k_\parallel &lt; k_{\rm min,\parallel}$. Under current levels of thermal noise and foreground cleaning, typical of a Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)-like survey, the HI-galaxy cross-correlation signal in our simulations, using the $k$NN-field framework, is detectable at $&gt;30\sigma$ across $r = [3,12] \, h^{-1}$Mpc. In contrast, the detectability of the standard two-point correlation function (2PCF) over the same scales depends strongly on the foreground filter: a sharp $k_\parallel$ filter can spuriously boost detection to $8\sigma$ due to position-space ringing, whereas a less sharp filter yields no detection. Nonetheless, we conclude that $k$NN-field cross-correlations are robustly detectable across a broad range of foreground filtering and thermal noise conditions, suggesting their potential for enhanced constraining power over 2PCFs.</description>

Abstract: The origin of the binary black hole mergers observed by LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA remains an open question. We calculate the merger rate from primordial black holes (PBHs) within the density spike around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies. We show that the merger rate within the spike is comparable to that within the wider dark matter halo. We also calculate the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) signal from PBHs hosted within the density spike spiralling into their host SMBHs due to gravitational wave emission. We predict that LISA may detect $\sim10^4$ of these EMRIs with a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 20 within a 4 yr observation run, if all dark matter is made up of $\sim30{\rm\,M}_\odot$ PBHs. Uncertainties in our rates come from the uncertain mass fraction of PBHs within the dark matter spike, relative to the host central SMBHs, which defines the parameter space LISA can constrain.</description>

      <title>Testing inflation on all scales: a case study with $\alpha$-attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plethora of inflationary models can produce interesting small-scale phenomenology, such as enhanced scalar fluctuations leading to primordial black hole (PBH) production and large scalar-induced GW. Nevertheless, good models must simultaneously explain current observations on all scales. In this work, we showcase our methodology to establish the small-scale phenomenology of inflationary models on firm grounds. We consider the case of hybrid $\alpha$-attractors, and focus on a reduced parameter space featuring the two potential parameters which roughly determine the position of the peak in the scalar power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$, and its amplitude. We first constrain the parameter space by comparing the large-scale predictions for $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ with current CMB anisotropies measurements and upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. We take into account uncertainties due to the reheating phase, and observe that the parameter-space area compatible with large-scale constraints shrinks for extended reheating stages. We then move to smaller scales, where we find that non-Gaussianity at peak scales is of the local type and has amplitude $f_\text{NL}\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This ensures that non-linear effects are subdominant, motivating us to employ the tree-level $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ to compute the abundance of PBHs and the spectrum of induced GWs for models consistent with large-scale tests. The former allows us to further constrain the parameter space, by excluding models which over-produce PBHs. We find that a subset of viable models can lead to significant production of PBHs, and a fraction of these is within reach for LISA, having a signal-to-noise ratio larger than that of astrophysical foregrounds. Our first-of-its-kind study systematically combines tests at different scales, and exploits the synergy between cosmological observations and theoretical consistency requirements.</description>

      <title>DeepWiener: Neural Networks for CMB polarization maps and power spectrum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study the early Universe, it is essential to estimate cosmological parameters with high accuracy, which depends on the optimal reconstruction of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps and the measurement of their power spectrum. In this paper, we generalize the neural network developed for applying the Wiener Filter, initially presented for temperature maps in previous work, to polarization maps. Our neural network has a UNet architecture, including an extra channel for the noise variance map, to account for inhomogeneous noise, and a channel for the mask. In addition, we propose an iterative approach for reconstructing the E and B-mode fields, while addressing the E-to-B leakage present in the maps due to incomplete sky coverage. The accuracy achieved is satisfactory compared to the Wiener Filter solution computed with the standard Conjugate Gradient method, and it is highly efficient, enabling the computation of the power spectrum of an unknown signal using the optimal quadratic estimator. We further evaluate the quality of the reconstructed maps at the power spectrum level along with their corresponding errors, finding that these errors are smaller than those obtained using the well-known pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach. Our results show that increasing complexity in the applied mask presents a more significant challenge for B-mode reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear reconstruction of 21cm global signal from 21cm power spectrum with artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method to recover the 21cm global signal from the 21cm power spectrum using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The 21cm global signal is crucial for understanding cosmic evolution from the Dark Ages through the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). While interferometers like LOFAR, MWA, HERA, and SKA focus on detecting the 21cm power spectrum, single-dish experiments such as EDGES target the global signal. Our method utilizes ANNs to establish a connection between these two observables, providing a means to cross-validate independent 21cm line observations. This capability is significant as it allows different observational approaches to verify each other's results, ensuring greater reliability in 21cm cosmology. We demonstrate that our ANN-based approach can accurately recover the 21cm global signal across a wide redshift range (z=7.5-35) from simulated data, even when realistic thermal noise levels, such as those expected from SKA-1, are considered. This cross-validation process strengthens the robustness of 21cm signal analysis, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Impact of adiabatic temperature fluctuations on the power spectrum of axion density perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) have gained substantial attention as potential candidates for cold dark matter. The ALP field can exhibit fluctuations stemming from initial conditions. These initial field fluctuations hold the potential to give rise to gravitationally bound configurations known as axion miniclusters (AMC). While this proposition is widely accepted in the post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scenario, uncertainties persist regarding the pre-inflationary scenario, where the effects of the initial field fluctuations may be suppressed by inflation. In this study, we investigate the influence of adiabatic temperature fluctuations of the primordial plasma on the evolution of axion density perturbations and their power spectrum, aiming to explore the possibility of AMC formation in the pre-inflationary scenario. Our analysis reveals that the impact of adiabatic temperature fluctuations becomes significant when $f_{\rm a} / H_{\rm inf} \gtrsim 1.25 \times 10^4$ and surpasses that of quantum fluctuations by up to five orders of magnitude on large scales. This emphasizes the possibility of also forming AMC within the pre-inflationary scenario. Consequently, a detection of AMC would not reliably differentiate between the pre- and post-inflationary origin of axions.</description>

      <title>Full-Shape analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI DR1 LRG and QSO samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first joint analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum using the Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), focusing on Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and quasars (QSOs) across a redshift range of $0.4\leq z\leq2.1$. By combining the two- and three-point statistics, we are able to partially break the degeneracy between the logarithmic growth rate, $f(z)$, and the amplitude of dark matter fluctuations, $\sigma_\textrm{s8}(z)$, which cannot be measured separately in analyses that only involve the power spectrum. In comparison with the (fiducial) Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology we obtain $f/f^\textrm{fid}=\{0.888_{-0.089}^{+0.186},0.977_{-0.220}^{+0.182},1.030_{-0.085}^{+0.368}\}$, $\sigma_{s8}/\sigma^\textrm{fid}_\textrm{s8}=\{1.224_{-0.133}^{+0.091},1.071_{-0.163}^{+0.278},1.000_{-0.223}^{+0.088}\}$ respectively for the three LRG redshift bins, corresponding to a cumulative 10.1\% constraint on $f$, and of 8.4\% on $\sigma_\textrm{s8}$, including the systematic error budget. The cumulative constraints for the ShapeFit compressed parameters from our joint power spectrum-bispectrum analysis are respectively $\sigma_{\alpha_\textrm{iso}}=0.9\%$ (9\% improvement with respect to our power spectrum-only analysis); $\sigma_{\alpha_\textrm{AP}}=2.3\%$ (no improvement with respect to power spectrum-only analysis, which is expected given that the bispectrum monopole has no significant anisotropic signal); $\sigma_{f\sigma_\textrm{s8}}=5.1\%$ (9\% improvement); $\sigma_{m+n}=2.3\%$ (11\% improvement). These results are fully consistent with the main DESI power spectrum analysis, demonstrating the robustness of the DESI cosmological constraints, and compatible with Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>Joint estimation of the cosmological model and the mass and redshift distributions of the binary black hole population with the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of constraining the mass and redshift distributions of binary black hole systems jointly with the underlying cosmological model using one year of observations of the Einstein Telescope. To this aim, we fixed the underlying cosmological model to a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, then we considered the mass distribution given by a smoothed power law, and the redshift distributions given by the Madau-Dickinson model. We built mock catalogs with different SNR thresholds, and finally inferred astrophysical and cosmological parameters jointly adopting a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We found that as the SNR threshold decreases, the precision on the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$ and the Hubble constant $H_0$, improves significantly due to the increased number of detectable events at high redshift. However, degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical parameters exist and evolve with the SNR threshold. Finally, we showed that one year of observations will serve to reconstruct the mass distribution with its features. Conversely, the redshift distribution will be poorly constrained and will need more observations to improve.</description>

      <title>A quadratic estimator view of the transfer function correction in intensity mapping surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In single dish neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping, signal separation methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) are used to clean the astrophysical foregrounds. PCA induces a signal loss in the estimated power spectrum, which can be corrected by a transfer function (TF). By injecting mock signals of HI into the data and performing the PCA cleaning, we can use the cleaned mock HI signal to cross-correlate with the original mock, and estimate the signal loss as a TF, ${T}(\vec{k})$. As expected, a correction of ${T} (\vec{k})^{-1}$ restores the cross-power between the HI and optical galaxies. However, contrary to intuition, the HI autopower also requires a ${T}(\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction, not ${T}(\vec{k})^{-2}$. The ${T}(\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction is only known empirically through simulations. In this Letter, we show that the ${T}(\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction in autopower is universal, and can be analytically proven using the quadratic estimator formalism through window function normalization. The normalization can also be used to determine the TF correction for any type of linear process. Using the window function, we demonstrate that PCA induces mode-mixing in the power spectrum estimation, which may lead to biases in the model inference.</description>

      <title>Resolving the S8 tension with the Lambda Prime ($\Lambda'$) model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $S_8$ parameter, which quantifies the amplitude of matter fluctuations on scales of $8h^{-1}$ Mpc, has been a source of tension between weak lensing surveys (e.g. KiDS, DES, HSC) and the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements. This discrepancy challenges the standard ${\Lambda}$CDM model and has become one of the most significant tensions in modern cosmology. The ${\Lambda'}$ model offers a potential resolution by introducing modifications to the cosmic growth history through alterations to the gravitational sector. The alterations involve including a Ricci soliton into Einstein's field equations which introduce a time dependent factor yielding a time varying cosmological constant ${\Lambda'}=(1-{\alpha(t)^2}{\Lambda_{DE}}\frac{{\rho}_g}{\rho_{DE}}$ and subsequently the evolution of the cosmos. The Ricci soliton is sourced from gravitational energy density. In this study we analyze results from six surveys and compare the results for $w_a$ and $w_0$ with the ${\Lambda'}$ model. We also find ${\sigma}_8={0.750}_{-0.020}^{+0.020}$ , $S_8={0.788}$. These values are closer to some low $S_8$ measurements from weak lensing surveys (e.g DES, KiDS), which report $S_8 \approx 0.76-0.78$, suggesting that the model may alleviate the $S_8$ tension. High values of ${\alpha(t)}$ in the late universe are the cause of suppressed structure formation and low values of ${\Lambda'}$. The late universe in the ${\Lambda'}$ model is effectively or apparently 5-10% younger than in ${\Lambda}$CDM which translates to $H_0={72.734}_{-1.687}^{+1.687}$ km/s/Mpc, which is in agreement with late universe probes. ${\Lambda'}$ is classified under the dynamical dark energy models, however unlike alternatives, it does not invoke exotic particles nor phantom energy.</description>

      <title>Fishing for the Optimal Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey: Cosmological Constraints for 1,000 Possible Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is set to conduct a generation-defining SN Ia cosmology measurement with its High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS). However, between optical elements, exposure times, cadences, and survey areas, there are many survey parameters to consider. This work was part of a Roman Project Infrastructure Team effort to help the Core Community Survey (CCS) Committee finalize the HLTDS recommendation to the Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee. We simulate 1,000 surveys, with and without a conservative (volume-limited) version of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Deep Drilling Field SNe Ia, and compute Fisher-matrix-analysis Dark Energy Task Force Figures of Merit (FoM, based on w0-wa constraints) for each. We investigate which survey parameters correlate with FoM, as well as the dependence of the FoM values on calibration uncertainties and the SN dispersion model. The exact optimum depends on the assumed dispersion model and whether Rubin DDF SNe Ia are also considered, but ~20% time in prism, ~30--40% time in Wide imaging and the remainder in Deep imaging seems most promising. We also advocate for "interlaced" cadences where not every filter is used in every cadence step to reduce overheads while maintaining a good cadence and increasing the number of filters compared to the Rose et al. (2021) reference survey (the prism has proportionately lower overheads and can be used for each cadence step). We show simulated light curves and spectra for the baseline HLTDS CCS recommendation and release distance-modulus covariance matrices for all surveys to the community.</description>

Abstract: We present an assumption-minimized framework for testing late-time cosmological models using Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards (UCS), including standard rulers and standard candles, without relying on absolute calibrations. The method exploits a tight, model-insensitive correlation between the sound horizons at recombination and the drag epoch. By avoiding dependence on pre-recombination physics and the amplitude of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, the UCS framework reduces potential early-time biases while retaining much of the constraining power of full analyses. Applying UCS to the recent dynamical dark energy (DE) study that reported deviations from $\Lambda$CDM \citep{DESI:2025zgx}, we find the constraints shift systematically toward the $\Lambda$CDM case, suggesting the presence of pre-recombination physics or systematics that likely affect the scale-dependence of the CMB spectra. We also observe a mild tension between uncalibrated standard rulers and candles, which can be largely mitigated by introducing a redshift-dependent magnitude bias in the supernova (SNe Ia) data. Our results highlight the importance of isolating post-recombination observables for testing late-time models in the era of precision cosmology, positioning UCS analysis as a robust framework for upcoming galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Polarization Measurements as a Probe of Axion-Photon Coupling: a Study of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion Like Particles (ALPs) can be produced in Gamma Ray Bursts, altering the polarization of the electromagnetic emission in these events. For the first time, we derive bounds on the axion-photon coupling from polarization measurements of GRB 221009A, performing a full calculation of the Stokes parameters, as it is typically done in the astrophysics community. Within astrophysical uncertainties, our limits on the axion-photon coupling are competitive with complementary probes in the axion mass range $10^{-9}$ eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-8}$ eV, further allowing to probe motivated parameter space of ALP dark matter.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Epoch of Reionization Signal with 3D U-Net Neural Networks Using Data-driven Systematic Effect Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) serves as a crucial probe for the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Actual observations of the 21-cm signal often encounter challenges such as thermal noise and various systematic effects. To overcome these challenges, we simulate SKA-Low-depth images in South Celestial Pole (SCP) field and process them with a deep learning method. We utilized foreground residuals acquired by LOFAR during actual North Celestial Pole (NCP) field observations, thermal and excess variances calculated via Gaussian process regression (GPR), and 21-cm signals generated with 21cmFAST for signal extraction tests. Our approach to overcome these foreground, thermal noise, and excess variance components employs a 3D U-Net neural network architecture for image analysis. When considering thermal noise corresponding to 1752 hours of integration time, U-Net provides reliable 2D power spectrum predictions, and robustness tests ensure that we get realistic EoR signals. Adding foreground residuals, however, causes inconsistencies below the horizon delay-line. Lastly, evaluating both thermal noise and excess variances with observations up to 4380 hours and 13140 hours ensures reliable power spectrum estimations within the EoR window and across nearly all scales, respectively. The incoherence of excess variances in the frequency direction can greatly affect deep learning to extract 21-cm signals.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves of GUT Phase Transition during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grand unified theory (GUT) phase transition is generally considered unobservable due to its ultrahigh energy scale, and the monopole problem associated with GUT phase transition is one motivation of inflation. We propose that if a first-order GUT phase transition happens during inflation, the induced gravitational waves (GWs) are redshifted and deformed, and might be observed today in GW observatories. We review the formalism of inflated GWs and derive the general deformation function between inflated and uninflated GW spectra in the instant-source or transitory-source application. It is valid for any e-folding number of instant or transitory source. Applying the formalism to GUT phase transition, we find that the e-folding number at 15 or 25 can shift the GWs to 10 Hz or mHz hands, respectively, which might be tested in the future ground-based or space-based interferometers. We further generalise the discussion to inflated GWs via phase transition below the GUT scale. It is worth mentioning that, due to the deformation of the spectrum, the peak of inflated GWs is not simply a redshift of the peak of uninflated GWs.</description>

      <title>Supernova constraints on lepton flavor violating ALPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernovae offer a unique hot and dense environment to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. We investigate supernova cooling constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to electrons and muons. Three production channels are considered: muon decay, axion bremsstrahlung, and electron-muon coalescence. We find that the electron-muon coalescence process, which was neglected in previous LFV-ALP studies, yields the strongest constraints on the LFV coupling in the mass range of $\sim (115,280)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Study of Various Dark Matter Halo Profiles in Milky Way and M31 Galaxies within the Standard Cosmology Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rotation curves of the Milky Way galaxy (MW) and Andromeda galaxy (M31) by considering their bulge, disk, and halo components. We model the bulge region by the widely accepted de Vaucouleur's law and the disk region by the well-established exponential profile. In order to understand the distribution of dark matter in the halo region, we consider three different dark matter profiles in the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, namely, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Hernquist, and Einasto profiles. We use recent datasets of rotation curves of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. The data consist of rotation velocities of the stars and gas in the galaxy as a function of the radial distance from the center. Using Bayesian statistics, we perform an overall fit including all the components, i.e., bulge, disk, and halo, with the data. Our results indicate that the NFW and Hernquist profiles are in concordance with the observational data points. However, the Einasto profile poorly explains the behavior of dark matter in both the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Axion Stabilization in Modular Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The potential in the axion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation, hence, the axion field remains nearly massless. In this paper, we develop a generalized class of such models, where the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions.</description>

      <title>Power Spectra in Double-Field Inflation Using Renormalization-Group Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A perturbative strategy for inflation described by two-inflaton fields is developed using a mathematical analogy with the renormalization-group. Two small quantities, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, corresponding to standard slow-roll parameters are defined and systematic expansions of all inflationary quantities in terms of powers of $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are found. No other slow-roll parameters are needed. To illustrate this perturbative method in the multi-field context, we adopt a simple two-inflaton model with quadratic potentials in the parameter range where both fields contribute similarly to the dynamics of inflation. The model, even though it is not a viable alternative for phenomenological description of the inflationary period, nicely illustrates subtleties of the perturbative approach. In particular, this method allows us to derive two independent gauge-invariant scalar perturbations that are conserved in the superhorizon limit, overcoming typical problems that emerge in multi-field inflation. Furthermore, it is possible to perform nonperturbative resummations that allow to study the model in a true multi-field regime. We derive tensor and scalar power spectra to the next-to-next-to-leading and next-to-leading orders, respectively, as well as their spectral indices. The hierarchy between the two scalar perturbations allows us to single out the dominant entry of the scalar power-spectrum matrix. Modifications due to the second inflaton occur already at the leading order. Finally, we explain why the quadratic two-inflaton model is not compatible with the present experimental constraints even though non-trivial corrections to scalar perturbations do emerge.</description>

      <title>How black hole mimickers and Shapiro-free lenses signal effective dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of two exotic compact objects in the leading relativistic model of modified Newtonian dynamics, namely aether-scalar-tensor theory. This model is consistent with precision cosmology and gravitational wave constraints on tensor speed. Black hole mimickers could subtly change observations: gravitational waves from their mergers might show unusual echoes or altered ringdown patterns, and images of their horizon-scale shadows might be slightly different from those of a true black hole. Shapiro-free lenses are massless objects that deflect light without any gravitational time delay, producing distinctive lensing events. These predictions connect to ongoing and future gravitational-wave searches, horizon-scale imaging, and time-domain lensing surveys.</description>
