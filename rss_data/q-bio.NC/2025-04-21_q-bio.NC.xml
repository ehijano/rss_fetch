      <title>Adaptive modelling of anti-tau treatments for neurodegenerative disorders based on the Bayesian approach with physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) proteins, leading to cognitive decline measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) score. In this study, we develop and analyze a system of ordinary differential equation models to describe the interactions between A$\beta$, p-tau, and ADAS score, providing a mechanistic understanding of disease progression. To ensure accurate model calibration, we employ Bayesian inference and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for parameter estimation based on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data. The data-driven Bayesian approach enables uncertainty quantification, improving confidence in model predictions, while the PINN framework leverages neural networks to capture complex dynamics directly from data. Furthermore, we implement an optimal control strategy to assess the efficacy of an anti-tau therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing p-tau levels and mitigating cognitive decline. Our data-driven solutions indicate that while optimal drug administration effectively decreases p-tau concentration, its impact on cognitive decline, as reflected in the ADAS score, remains limited. These findings suggest that targeting p-tau alone may not be sufficient for significant cognitive improvement, highlighting the need for multi-target therapeutic strategies. The integration of mechanistic modelling, advanced parameter estimation, and control-based therapeutic optimization provides a comprehensive framework for improving treatment strategies for AD.</description>

      <title>The relativity of color perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical colors, i.e. reflected or emitted lights entering the eyes from a visual environment, are converted into perceived colors sensed by humans by neurophysiological mechanisms. These processes involve both three types of photoreceptors, the LMS cones, and spectrally opponent and non-opponent interactions resulting from the activity rates of ganglion and lateral geniculate nucleus cells. Thus, color perception is a phenomenon inherently linked to an experimental environment (the visual scene) and an observing apparatus (the human visual system). This is clearly reminiscent of the conceptual foundation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, where the link is between a physical system and the measuring instruments. The relationship between color perception and relativity was explicitly examined for the first time by the physicist H. Yilmaz in 1962 from an experimental point of view. The main purpose of this contribution is to present a rigorous mathematical model that, by taking into account both trichromacy and color opponency, permits to explain on a purely theoretical basis the relativistic color perception phenomena argued by Yilmaz. Instead of relying directly on relativistic considerations, we base our theory on a quantum interpretation of color perception together with just one assumption, called trichromacy axiom, that summarizes well-established properties of trichromatic color vision within the framework of Jordan algebras. We show how this approach allows us to reconcile trichromacy with Hering's opponency and also to derive the relativistic properties of perceived colors without any additional mathematical or experimental assumption.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis enlightens effects of connectivity in a Neural Mass Model under Control-Target mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biophysical models of human brain represent the latter as a graph of inter-connected neural regions. Building from the model by Naskar et al. (Network Neuroscience 2021), our motivation was to understand how these brain regions can be connected at neural level to implement some inhibitory control, which calls for inhibitory connectivity rarely considered in such models. In this model, regions are made of inter-connected excitatory and inhibitory pools of neurons, but are long-range connected only via excitatory pools (mutual excitation). We thus extend this model by generalizing connectivity, and we analyse how connectivity affects the behaviour of this model.
  Focusing on the simplest paradigm made of a Control area and a Target area, we explore four typical kinds of connectivity: mutual excitation, Target inhibition by Control, Control inhibition by Target, and mutual inhibition. For this, we build an analytical sensitivity framework, nesting up sensitivities of isolated pools, of isolated regions, and of the full system. We show that inhibitory control can emerge only in Target inhibition by Control and mutual inhibition connectivities.
  We next offer an analysis of how the model sensitivities depends on connectivity structure, depending on a parameter controling the strength of the self-inhibition within Target region. Finally, we illustrate the effect of connectivity structure upon control effectivity in response to an external forcing in the Control area.
  Beyond the case explored here, our methodology to build analytical sensitivities by nesting up levels (pool, region, system) lays the groundwork for expressing nested sensitivities for more complex network configurations, either for this model or any other one.</description>

      <title>Radial Basis Function Techniques for Neural Field Models on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework for solving neural field equations on surfaces using Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation and quadrature. Neural field models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling studies often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can be computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains. In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns.</description>

      <title>Human-aligned Deep Learning: Explainability, Causality, and Biological Inspiration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aligns deep learning (DL) with human reasoning capabilities and needs to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image classification. We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall, our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy, and safe deployment.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many networks that arise in nature and applications are effectively low-dimensional in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks might also be low-dimensional. Indeed, recent results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or noise. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. We show that recurrent networks with low-rank structure often produce high-dimensional dynamics in the presence of high-dimensional perturbations. Counter to intuition, dynamics in these networks are \textit{suppressed} in directions that are aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term "low-rank suppression." Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.</description>

      <title>Complex non-Markovian dynamics and the dual role of astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease development and propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder nowadays. Amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) and tau proteins are among the main contributors to the development or propagation of AD. In AD, A$\beta$ proteins clump together to form plaques and disrupt cell functions. On the other hand, the abnormal chemical change in the brain helps to build sticky tau tangles that block the neuron's transport system. Astrocytes generally maintain a healthy balance in the brain by clearing the A$\beta$ plaques (toxic A$\beta$). However, over-activated astrocytes release chemokines and cytokines in the presence of A$\beta$ and react to pro-inflammatory cytokines, further increasing the production of A$\beta$. In this paper, we construct a mathematical model that can capture astrocytes' dual behaviour. Furthermore, we reveal that the disease propagation depends on the current time instance and the disease's earlier status, called the ``memory effect''. We consider a fractional order network mathematical model to capture the influence of such memory effect on AD propagation. We have integrated brain connectome data into the model and studied the memory effect, the dual role of astrocytes, and the brain's neuronal damage. Based on the pathology, primary, secondary, and mixed tauopathies parameters are considered in the model. Due to the mixed tauopathy, different brain nodes or regions in the brain connectome accumulate different toxic concentrations of A$\beta$ and tau proteins. Finally, we explain how the memory effect can slow down the propagation of such toxic proteins in the brain, decreasing the rate of neuronal damage.</description>

      <title>How to set up a psychedelic study: Unique considerations for research involving human participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Setting up a psychedelic study can be a long, arduous, and kafkaesque process. This rapidly-developing field poses several unique challenges for researchers, necessitating a range of considerations that have not yet been standardised. Many of the complexities inherent to psychedelic research also challenge existing assumptions around, for example, approaches to psychiatric prescribing, the conceptual framing of the placebo effect, and definitions of selfhood. This review paper brings together several of the major psychedelic research teams across the United Kingdom to formalise these unique considerations, identify continuing areas of debate, and provide a practical, experience-based guide, with recommendations for policymakers and future researchers intending to set up a psychedelic research study or clinical trial. We approach this such that the paper can either be read end to end, or treated as a manual: readers can dip into relevant sections as needed.</description>
