      <title>Quantitative Analysis of Cell Membrane Tension in Time-Series Imaging and A Minimal Lattice Model of Single Cell Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell membrane tension directly influences various cellular functions. In this study, we developed a method to estimate surface tension from time-series data. We obtained the curvature-velocity relationship from time-series of binarized cell shape images, and the effective surface tension term was calculated from linear regression.
  During the process, we observed an S-shaped pattern in the curvature-velocity relationship. To understand the dynamics, we constructed a minimal lattice model describing single-cell motion. The model consists of surface tension and protrusion formation, and the characteristic parameters are obtained from experimental observations. We found that similar patterns emerged in the curvature-velocity relationship.</description>

      <title>Parametrization of microbial survival models under UVC exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to identify and parameterize the optimal survival curves for 33 fundamental microorganisms subject to UVC exposure through experimental measurements. We compile published data on UVC doses and corresponding survival fractions for these microorganisms to estimate parameters for four prominent survival models: Single-target (ST), Multi-target (MT), Linear Quadratic (LQ), and Two-Stage Decay (TSD). The best-fitting model for each microorganism is determined by selecting the one with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) compared to the experimental data. Our analysis indicates that the MT model is the most frequently appropriate, accurately fitting 21 of the 33 microorganisms. The TSD model is the best fit for only three, while the LQ model, though occasionally suitable at lower doses, is often excluded due to unreliable performance at higher doses. The assessed models, particularly the MT model, demonstrate strong predictive capabilities for UVC surface sterilization of microorganisms. However, caution is warranted with the LQ model at higher doses due to its potential limitations.</description>
