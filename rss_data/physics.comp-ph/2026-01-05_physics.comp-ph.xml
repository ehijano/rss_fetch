      <title>New RVE concept in thermoelasticity of periodic composites subjected to compact support loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for linear thermoelastic composites (CMs) with periodic microstructures. The approach is based on an exact new Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), formulated for compactly supported loading conditions, such as body forces and localized thermal effects (for example laser heating). In addition, new general integral equations (GIEs) are established for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading. A unified iterative scheme is developed for solving the static AGIEs, where the compact support of loading serves as a new fundamental training parameter. At the core of the methodology lies a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept that extends Hill classical definition of the RVE. Unlike conventional RVEs, this generalized RVE is not fixed geometrically but emerges naturally from the characteristic scale of localized loading, thereby reducing the analysis of an infinite periodic medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This formulation automatically filters out nonrepresentative subsets of effective parameters while eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite-size sample dependencies. Furthermore, the AGIE-based CAM framework integrates seamlessly with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, supporting the development of accurate, physics-informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Additive general integral equations in thermoelastic micromechanics of composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an enhanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for the analysis of linear thermoelastic composite materials (CMs) with random microstructure. The proposed approach is grounded in an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), specifically formulated for compactly supported loading, including both body forces and localized thermal changes (such as those from laser heating). New general integral equations (GIEs) for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading are proposed. A unified iterative solution strategy is developed for the static AGIE, applicable to CMs with both perfectly and imperfectly bonded interfaces, where the compact support of loading is introduced as a new fundamental training parameter. Central to this methodology is a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill classical definition. The resulting RVE is not predefined geometrically, but rather emerges from the characteristic scale of the localized loading, effectively reducing the analysis of an infinite, randomly heterogeneous medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This generalized RVE approach enables automatic exclusion of unrepresentative subsets of effective parameters, while inherently eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite size limitations. Moreover, the AGIE-based CAM framework is naturally compatible with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, facilitating the construction of accurate and physically informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Materials Informatics: Emergence To Autonomous Discovery In The Age Of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective explores the evolution of materials informatics, from its foundational roots in physics and information theory to its maturation through artificial intelligence (AI). We trace the field's trajectory from early milestones to the transformative impact of the Materials Genome Initiative and the recent advent of large language models (LLMs). Rather than a mere toolkit, we present materials informatics as an evolving ecosystem, reviewing key methodologies such as Bayesian Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, and Transformers that drive inverse design and autonomous self-driving laboratories. We specifically address the practical challenges of LLM integration, comparing specialist versus generalist models and discussing solutions for uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, we assess the transition of AI from a predictive tool to a collaborative research partner. By leveraging active learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the field is moving toward a new era of autonomous materials science, increasingly characterized by "human-out-of-the-loop" discovery processes.</description>

      <title>Full grid solution for multi-asset options pricing with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pricing multi-asset options via the Black-Scholes PDE is limited by the curse of dimensionality: classical full-grid solvers scale exponentially in the number of underlyings and are effectively restricted to three assets. Practitioners typically rely on Monte Carlo methods for computing complex instrument involving multiple correlated underlyings. We show that quantized tensor trains (QTT) turn the d-asset Black-Scholes PDE into a tractable high-dimensional problem on a personal computer. We construct QTT representations of the operator, payoffs, and boundary conditions with ranks that scale polynomially in d and polylogarithmically in the grid size, and build two solvers: a time-stepping algorithm for European and American options and a space-time algorithm for European options. We compute full-grid prices and Greeks for correlated basket and max-min options in three to five dimensions with high accuracy. The methods introduced can comfortably be pushed to full-grid solutions on 10-15 underlyings, with further algorithmic optimization and more compute power.</description>

      <title>Coupled Modal-Nonmodal Interactions Due to Periodic, Infinite Train of Convecting Vortices (TCV)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Events during transition to turbulence either follow modal or non-modal routes, or combinations of the two. Here, we report a computational investigation of strong freestream excitation caused by a train of convecting vortices. For this TCV excitation, we show a strong interaction of modal and non-modal components causing a spectacular growth of disturbances. We propose this as the mechanism for the severe encounters due to convective vortical disturbances on the underlying shear layer.</description>

      <title>Solving nonlinear subsonic compressible flow in infinite domain via multi-stage neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In aerodynamics, accurately modeling subsonic compressible flow over airfoils is critical for aircraft design. However, solving the governing nonlinear perturbation velocity potential equation presents computational challenges. Traditional approaches often rely on linearized equations or finite, truncated domains, which introduce non-negligible errors and limit applicability in real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel framework utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the full nonlinear compressible potential equation in an unbounded (infinite) domain. We address the unbounded-domain and convergence challenges inherent in standard PINNs by incorporating a coordinate transformation and embedding physical asymptotic constraints directly into the network architecture. Furthermore, we employ a Multi-Stage PINN (MS-PINN) approach to iteratively minimize residuals, achieving solution accuracy approaching machine precision. We validate this framework by simulating flow over circular and elliptical geometries, comparing our results against traditional finite-domain and linearized solutions. Our findings quantify the noticeable discrepancies introduced by domain truncation and linearization, particularly at higher Mach numbers, and demonstrate that this new framework is a robust, high-fidelity tool for computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method to compute the reweighted path ensemble by combining transition interface sampling simulations conditioned on different collective variables. The approach is based on the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) methodology applied to entire trajectories. Illustrating the technique with simple 2D potential models and a more complex host-guest system, we show that the statistics can significantly improve compared to a straightforward combination.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Deformation Behavior of Co-Free Non-Equiatomic CrMnFeNi Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cobalt-free high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have garnered interest for nuclear structural applications due to their good mechanical performance, thermal stability, and resistance to radiation-induced degradation, while avoiding long-lived Co radioisotopes. This study presents an experimental and computational investigation of the plastic deformation behavior of a non-equatomic CrMnFeNi alloy, designed to maintain a stability of fcc phase in a large domain of temperatures and to balance stacking fault (SF) energies for enhanced strain hardening and ductility. Tensile tests reveal a temperature-dependent reduction in mechanical strength, attributed to thermally activated deformation mechanisms and microstructural evolution. Molecular dynamics simulations of single- and polycrystals capture dislocation activity, SF formation, and twin nucleation as a function of strain and temperature. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) confirms twin formation and grain boundary activity. The Schmid factor mapping is drawn to interpret local slip activity and anisotropic deformation behavior. The absence of Co leads to enhanced high-temperature strength compared to the Cantor alloy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization for re-analysis and calibration of extreme sea state events simulated with a spectral third-generation wave model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate hindcasting of extreme sea state events is essential for coastal engineering, risk assessment, and climate studies. However, the reliability of numerical wave models remains limited by uncertainties in physical parameterizations and model inputs. This study presents a novel calibration framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO), leveraging the Tree structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to efficiently estimate uncertain sink term parameters, specifically bottom friction dissipation, depth induced breaking, and wave dissipation from strong opposing currents, in the ANEMOC-3 hindcast wave model. The proposed method enables joint optimization of continuous parameters and discrete model structures, significantly reducing discrepancies between model outputs and observations. Applied to a one month period encompassing multiple intense storm events along the French Atlantic coast, the calibrated model demonstrates improved agreement with buoy measurements, achieving lower bias, RMSE, and scatter index relative to the default sea$-$state solver configuration. The results highlight the potential of BO to automate and enhance wave model calibration, offering a scalable and flexible approach applicable to a wide range of geophysical modeling problems. Future extensions include multi-objective optimization, uncertainty quantification, and integration of additional observational datasets.</description>

      <title>Electronic-Entropy-Driven Solid-Solid Phase Transitions in Elemental Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the thermodynamic phase diagram of seventeen elemental metals with hexagonal close-packed (hcp), face-centered cubic (fcc), and body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structures using finite-temperature density functional theory. Helmholtz free-energy differences between competing hcp, fcc, and bcc phases are evaluated as functions of electronic temperature up to 7 eV, allowing us to identify solid-solid phase transitions driven by electronic entropy. The systems studied include Zr, Ti, Cd, Zn, Co, and Mg (hcp), Ni, Cu, Ag, Al, Pt, and Pb (fcc), and Cr, W, V, Nb, and Mo (bcc) in their ground-state structures. From the free-energy crossings, we extract the transition electronic temperatures and analyze systematic trends across the metallic systems. We found that all the studied systems go through one or two solid-solid phase transition caused purely by electronic entropy except Mg and Pb. Our results establish electronic entropy as a key factor governing structural stability in metals under strong electronic excitation.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of plastic deformation in ultrasound-assisted cold spray of tungsten: a molecular dynamics study</title>

Abstract: Tungsten (W) is widely valued for its exceptional thermal stability, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance, making it an ideal candidate for high-performance military and aerospace applications. However, its high melting point and limited room-temperature plasticity pose significant challenges for processing W using additive manufacturing (AM). Cold spray (CS), a solid-state AM process that relies on high-velocity particle impact and plastic deformation, offers a promising route for additive manufacturing of W, yet conventional CS fails to induce sufficient plastic deformation for effective bonding. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to investigate the effect of ultrasonic perturbation in enhancing plastic deformation during CS of W, with a focus on acoustoplasticity-driven deformation mechanism. We show that ultrasonic perturbation leads to pronounced acoustic softening and promotes transient temperature elevation at the particle-substrate and particle-particle interfaces, thereby enhancing plastic deformation compared to non-ultrasound-assisted CS. Additionally, our results show that the coupled effects of acoustic softening and enhanced transient thermal activation lead to substantial improvements in interfacial bonding across a wide range of impact velocities, particle sizes, and ultrasonic parameters. Finally, we analyze the feasibility of ultrasound-assisted CS for manufacturing heterogeneous interfaces consisting of an equimolar Vanadium (V)-Tungsten (W) coating on a W substrate. Simulations reveal distinct mechanical behavior and dislocation densities compared to the homogeneous W on W CS configurations. Overall, this work highlights the potential of ultrasound-assisted cold spray as an effective strategy for manufacturing uniform coatings and engineered alloys, thereby addressing critical limitations in the additive manufacturing of refractory metals.</description>

      <title>Random Batch Sum-of-Gaussians Method for Molecular Dynamics of Born-Mayer-Huggins Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Born-Mayer-Huggins (BMH) potential, which combines Coulomb interactions with dispersion and short-range exponential repulsion, is widely used for ionic materials such as molten salts. However, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of BMH systems are often limited by computation, communication, and memory costs. We recently proposed the random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) method, which accelerates Coulomb calculations by using a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition to split the potential into short- and long-range parts and by applying importance sampling in Fourier space for the long-range part. In this work, we extend the RBSOG to BMH systems and incorporate a random batch list (RBL) scheme to further accelerate the short-range part, yielding a unified framework for efficient simulations with the BMH potential. The combination of the SOG decomposition and the RBL enables an efficient and scalable treatment of both long- and short-range interactions in BMH system, particularly the RBL well handles the medium-range exponential repulsion and dispersion by the random batch neighbor list. Error estimate is provided to show the theoretical convergence of the RBL force. We evaluate the framework on molten NaCl and mixed alkali halide with up to $5\times10^6$ atoms on $2048$ CPU cores. Compared to the Ewald-based particle-particle particle-mesh method and the RBSOG-only method, our method achieves approximately $4\sim10\times$ and $2\times$ speedups while using $1000$ cores, respectively, under the same level of structural and thermodynamic accuracy and with a reduced memory usage. These results demonstrate the attractive performance of our method in accuracy and scalability for MD simulations with long-range interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in micromechanics.</description>

      <title>Photon Blockade Mediated by Two-Photon Absorption in an Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon blockade (PB) is a quantum effect in strongly nonlinear systems where a single photon prevents the system from being excited to a higher level, generating anti-bunched light fields. It enables the generation of single-photon sources for quantum information processing. Conventional photon blockade (CPB) leverages strong nonlinear interactions to generate an anharmonic energy spectrum. Unconventional photon blockade (UPB) utilizes destructive quantum interference between excitation pathways. Recently, environmentally induced photon blockade (EPB) has emerged as a novel approach, exploiting two-photon absorption (TPA) to realize photon blockade. In this work, we combine UPB and EPB together, considering the TPA effect in the optical parametric amplifier (OPA), thereby achieving a more stable PB with stronger suppression of multi-photon states.</description>

Abstract: Shor's factoring algorithm guarantees a success probability of at least one half for any fixed modulus N = pq with distinct primes p and q. We show that this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -&gt; infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N &lt;= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the "expected polynomial time" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.</description>
