      <title>Spectral properties of canonical systems: discreteness and distribution of eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey paper we review classical results and recent progress about a certain topic in the spectral theory of two-dimensional canonical systems. Namely, we consider the questions whether the spectrum $\sigma$ is discrete, and if it is, what is its density. Here we measure density by the growth of the counting function of $\sigma$ in the sense of integrability or $\limsup$-conditions relative to suitable comparison functions. These questions have been around for many years. However, full answers have been obtained only very recently -- in partly still unpublished work.
  The way we measure density of eigenvalues must be clearly distinguished from spectral asymptotics, where one asks for an asymptotic expansion of eigenvalues. We explicitly and on purpose do not go into this direction and do not present any results about spectral asymptotics.
  We understand this survey as a focussed presentation of results revolving around the initially stated questions, and not as an exhaustive account on the literature which is in the one or other way related to the area. It does not contain any proofs, but we do comment on proof methods.
  The theorems we present are very diverse. They rely on different methods from operator theory, complex analysis, and classical analysis, and beautifully invoke the interplay between these areas. Besides the fundamental theorems solving the problem and several selected additions, we decided to include a number of results devoted to the spectral theory of Jacobi matrices, in other words, to the Hamburger moment problem. The connection between the theories of canonical systems and moment problems gives rise to important new insights, yet seems to be less widely known than other connections, e.g., with Krein-Feller or Schr\"odinger operators.
  We compile all necessary prerequisites from the general theory to make the exposition as self-contained as possible. It is our aim that this survey can be read and enjoyed by a broad community, including non-specialist readers.</description>

      <title>Regular Bohr-Sommerfeld rules for non-self-adjoint Berezin--Toeplitz operators and complex Lagrangian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real-analytic, non-self-adjoint Berezin--Toeplitz operators, up to exponentially small error, on complex one-dimensional compact manifolds, under the hypothesis of regularity of the energy levels. These results form a complex version of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions; they hold under a hypothesis that the skew-adjoint part is small but can be of principal order with respect to the semiclassical parameter.
  To this end, we develop a calculus of Fourier Integral Operators and Lagrangian states associated with complex Lagrangians; these tools can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An operator approach to the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media. Part 2: transmission problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this second chapter, we analyse transmission problems between a dielectric and a dispersive negative material. In the first part, we consider a transmission problem between two half-spaces, filled respectively by the vacuum and a Drude material, and separated by a planar interface. In this setting, we answer to the following question: does this medium satisfy a limiting amplitude principle? This principle defines the stationary regime as the large time asymptotic behavior of a system subject to a periodic excitation. In the second part, we consider the transmission problem of an infinite strip of Drude material embedded in the vacuum and analyse the existence and dispersive properties of guided waves. In both problems, our spectral analysis enlighten new and unusual physical phenomena for the considered transmission problems due to the presence of the dispersive negative material. In particular, we prove the existence of an interface resonance in the first part and the existence of slow light phenomena for guiding waves in the second part.</description>

      <title>An operator approach to the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media. Part 1: general results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate in this chapter the mathematical models for electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive isotropic passive linear media for which the dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon$ and magnetic permeability $\mu$ depend on the frequency. We emphasize the link between physical requirements and mathematical properties of the models. A particular attention is devoted to the notions of causality and passivity and its connection to the existence of Herglotz functions that determine the dispersion of the material. We consider successively the cases of the general passive media and the so-called local media for which $\varepsilon$ and $\mu$ are rational functions of the frequency. This leads us to analyse the important class of non dissipative and dissipative generalized Lorentz models. In particular, we discuss the connection between mathematical and physical properties of models through the notions of stability, energy conservation, dispersion and modal analyses, group and phase velocities and energy decay in dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Shape sensitivity analysis of Neumann-Poincar\'e eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the eigenvalues of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator, a boundary integral operator associated with the harmonic double-layer potential. Specifically, we examine how the eigenvalues depend on the support of integration and prove that the map associating the support's shape to the eigenvalues is real-analytic. We then compute its first derivative and present applications of the resulting formula. The proposed method allows for handling infinite-dimensional perturbation parameters for multiple eigenvalues and perturbations that are not necessarily in the normal direction.</description>

Abstract: We establish stable quantum ergodicity for spin Hamiltonians, also known as Pauli-Schr\"odinger operators. Our approach combines new analytic techniques of mixed quantization, inspired by local index theory, with stable ergodicity results for partially hyperbolic systems.</description>

      <title>Sampling Theorem and explicit interpolation formula for non-decaying unbounded signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03667v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper establishes an analog Whittaker-Shannon-Kotelnikov sampling theorem for unbounded non-decaying band-limited signals. An explicit interpolation formula is obtained for signals sublinear growth with rate of growth less than 1/2. At any time, the rate of decay for the $k$th coefficients of this formula is $\sim 1/k^2$. In addition, the paper obtains a method for calculating the coefficients of the interpolation formula applicable to signals with arbitrarily high rate of polynomial growth.</description>

      <title>On the Time-decay of solutions arising from periodically forced Dirac Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is increased interest in time-dependent (non-autonomous) Hamiltonians, stemming in part from the active field of Floquet quantum materials. Despite this, dispersive time-decay bounds, which reflect energy transport in such systems, have received little attention.
  We study the dynamics of non-autonomous, time-periodically forced, Dirac Hamiltonians: $i\partial_t\alpha =D(t)\alpha$, where $D(t)=i\sigma_3\partial_x+ \nu(t)$ is time-periodic but not spatially localized. For the special case $\nu(t)=m\sigma_1$, which models a relativistic particle of constant mass $m$, one has a dispersive decay bound: $\|\alpha(t,x)\|_{L^\infty_x}\lesssim t^{-\frac12}$. Previous analyses of Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians suggest that this decay bound persists for small, spatially-localized and time-periodic $\nu(t)$. However, we show that this is not necessarily the case if $\nu(t)$ is not spatially localized. Specifically, we study two non-autonomous Dirac models whose time-evolution (and monodromy operator) is constructed via Fourier analysis. In a rotating mass model, the dispersive decay bound is of the same type as for the constant mass model. However, in a model with a periodically alternating sign of the mass, the results are quite different. By stationary-phase analysis of the associated Fourier representation, we display initial data for which the $L^\infty_x$ time-decay rate are considerably slower: $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/3})$ or even $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/5})$ as $t\to\infty$.</description>
