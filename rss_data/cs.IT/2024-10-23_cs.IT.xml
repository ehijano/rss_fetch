      <title>Two Classes of Quantum MDS Codes with Large Minimal Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, two classes of quantum MDS codes are constructed. The main tools are multiplicative structures on finite fields. Carefully choosing different cosets can make the corresponding generalized Reed-Solomon codes Hermitian self-orthogonal, which yields quantum MDS codes by utilizing Hermitian type CSS construction. In some cases, these codes have minimal distances larger than $q/2$. Also, the parameters of these codes have never been reported before.</description>

      <title>The Dispersion of Broadcast Channels With Degraded Message Sets Using Gaussian Codebooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-user broadcast channel with degraded message sets and derive second-order achievability rate regions. Specifically, the channel noises are not necessarily Gaussian and we use spherical codebooks for both users. The weak user with worse channel quality applies nearest neighbor decoding by treating the signal of the other user as interference. For the strong user with better channel quality, we consider two decoding schemes: successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding and joint nearest neighbor (JNN) decoding. We adopt two performance criteria: separate error probabilities (SEP) and joint error probability (JEP). Counterintuitively, the second-order achievable rate regions under both SIC and JNN decoding are identical although JNN decoding usually yields better performance in other multiterminal problems with Gaussian noise. Furthermore, we generalize our results to the case with quasi-static fading and show that the asymptotic notion of outage capacity region is an accurate performance measure even at finite blocklengths.</description>

      <title>Improving Connectivity of RIS-Assisted UAV Networks using RIS Partitioning and Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is pivotal for beyond 5G networks in regards to the surge demand for reliable communication in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. This paper presents an innovative approach to maximize connectivity of UAV networks using RIS deployment and virtual partitioning, wherein an RIS is deployed to assist in the communications between an user-equipment (UE) and blocked UAVs. Closed-form (CF) expressions for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the two-UAV setup are derived and validated. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize network connectivity by optimizing the 3D deployment of the RIS and its partitioning subject to predefined quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. To tackle this problem, we propose a method of virtually partitioning the RIS given a fixed 3D location, such that the partition phase shifts are configured to create cascaded channels between the UE and the blocked two UAVs. Then, simulated-annealing (SA) method is used to find the 3D location of the RIS. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint RIS deployment and partitioning framework can significantly improve network connectivity compared to benchmarks, including RIS-free and RIS with a single narrow-beam link.</description>

      <title>Puncturing Quantum Stabilizer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical coding theory contains several techniques to obtain new codes from other codes, including puncturing and shortening. For quantum codes, a form of puncturing is known, but its description is based on the code space rather than its generators. In this work, we take a different approach and describe puncturing of a stabilizer code by focusing on its stabilizer matrix containing the generators. In this way, we are able to explicitly describe the stabilizer matrix of the punctured code given the stabilizer matrix of the original stabilizer code. This gives an immediate way to construct new codes from old. We indicate how this may be used to search for good or even optimal codes. Furthermore, we show the equivalence to the original description of puncturing and the connection to a shortening of a classical code. Lastly, we generalize the proof of the Griesmer bound from the classical setting to stabilizer codes since the proof relies heavily on the puncturing technique.</description>

      <title>Truly Sub-Nyquist Method Based Matrix Pencil and CRT with Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of ultra-wideband (UWB) and high-throughput signals has necessitated advancements in data sampling technologies1. Sub-Nyquist sampling methods, such as the modulated wideband converter (MWC) and compressed auto-correlation spectrum sensing (CCS), address the limitations of traditional analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) by capturing signals below the Nyquist rate. However, these methods face challenges like spectral leakage and complex hardware requirements. This paper proposes a novel super-resolution generalized eigenvalue method that integrates the matrix pencil method with the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to enhance signal processing capabilities within a true sub-Nyquist framework3. This approach aims to improve frequency resolution and accuracy in high-frequency signal extraction, with potential applications in telecommunications, radar, and medical imaging.</description>

      <title>A Method to Reduce the Complexity of Computing the Complete Weight Distribution of Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The code spectrum of polar codes is crucial to the performance of polar codes. Based on the lower-triangular affine group (LTA) of decreasing monomial codes and the one-variable descendance (ovd) relation, we define a new subgroup of LTA which can find more cosets with the same weight distribution. Using this algebraic structure, we further reduce the complexity by proofing the group action on a coset set is transitive. Our method is an enhanced version of previous research, and the complexity of most cases can be reduced exceeding several times.</description>

      <title>Striking a New Chord: Neural Networks in Music Information Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initiating a quest to unravel the complexities of musical aesthetics through the lens of information dynamics, our study delves into the realm of musical sequence modeling, drawing a parallel between the sequential structured nature of music and natural language.
  Despite the prevalence of neural network models in MIR, the modeling of symbolic music events as applied to music cognition and music neuroscience has largely relied on statistical models. In this "proof of concept" paper we posit the superiority of neural network models over statistical models for predicting musical events. Specifically, we compare LSTM, Transformer, and GPT models against a widely-used markov model to predict a chord event following a sequence of chords.
  Utilizing chord sequences from the McGill Billboard dataset, we trained each model to predict the next chord from a given sequence of chords. We found that neural models significantly outperformed statistical ones in our study. Specifically, the LSTM with attention model led with an accuracy of 0.85, followed by Transformer models at 0.58, Transformer with GPT head at 0.56, and standard LSTM at 0.43. Variable Order Markov and Markov trailed behind with accuracies of 0.31 and 0.23, respectively. Encouraged by these results, we extended our investigation to multidimensional modeling, employing a many-to-one LSTM, LSTM with attention, Transformer, and GPT predictors. These models were trained on both chord and melody lines as two-dimensional data using the CoCoPops Billboard dataset, achieving an accuracy of 0.21, 0.56, 0.39, and 0.24 respectively in predicting the next chord.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Knowledge-Free Network Management: Feasibility Study and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional network management algorithms have relied on prior knowledge of system models and networking scenarios. In practice, a universal optimization framework is desirable where a sole optimization module can be readily applied to arbitrary network management tasks without any knowledge of the system. To this end, knowledge-free optimization techniques are necessary whose operations are independent of scenario-specific information including objective functions, system parameters, and network setups. The major challenge of this paradigm-shifting approach is the requirement of a hyper-intelligent black-box optimizer that can establish efficient decision-making policies using its internal reasoning capabilities. This article presents a novel knowledge-free network management paradigm with the power of foundation models called large language models (LLMs). Trained on vast amounts of datasets, LLMs can understand important contexts from input prompts containing minimal system information, thereby offering remarkable inference performance even for entirely new tasks. Pretrained LLMs can be potentially leveraged as foundation models for versatile network optimization. By eliminating the dependency on prior knowledge, LLMs can be seamlessly applied for various network management tasks. The viability of this approach is demonstrated for resource management problems using GPT-3.5-Turbo. Numerical results validate that knowledge-free LLM optimizers are able to achieve comparable performance to existing knowledge-based optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Geometric Partition Entropy for the Estimation of Mutual Information in the Presence of Informative Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent introduction of geometric partition entropy brought a new viewpoint to non-parametric entropy quantification that incorporated the impacts of informative outliers, but its original formulation was limited to the context of a one-dimensional state space. A generalized definition of geometric partition entropy is now provided for samples within a bounded (finite measure) region of a d-dimensional vector space. The basic definition invokes the concept of a Voronoi diagram, but the computational complexity and reliability of Voronoi diagrams in high dimension make estimation by direct theoretical computation unreasonable. This leads to the development of approximation schemes that enable estimation that is faster than current methods by orders of magnitude. The partition intersection ($\pi$) approximation, in particular, enables direct estimates of marginal entropy in any context resulting in an efficient and versatile mutual information estimator. This new measure-based paradigm for data driven information theory allows flexibility in the incorporation of geometry to vary the representation of outlier impact, which leads to a significant broadening in the applicability of established entropy-based concepts. The incorporation of informative outliers is illustrated through analysis of transient dynamics in the synchronization of coupled chaotic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Fully smooth one shot multipartite soft covering of quantum states without pairwise independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a powerful machinery to prove fully smooth one shot multipartite covering, aka convex split, type results for quantum states. In the important case of smooth multipartite convex split for classical quantum states, aka smooth multipartite soft covering, our machinery works even when certain marginals of these states do not satisfy pairwise independence. The recent paper of Sen gave the first proof of fully smooth multipartite convex split by simplifying and extending a technique called telescoping, developed originally for convex split by (arXiv:2304.12056). However, that work as well as all earlier works on convex split assumed pairwise or even more independence amongst suitable marginals of the quantum states.
  We develop our machinery by leveraging known results from (arXiv:1806.07278) involving tilting and augmentation smoothing of quantum states, combined with a novel observation that a natural quantum operation `flattening' quantum states actually preserves the fidelity. This machinery is powerful enough to lead to non pairwise independent results as mentioned above.
  As an application of our soft covering lemma without pairwise independence, we prove the `natural' one shot inner bounds for sending private classical information over a quantum wiretap interference channel, even when the classical encoders at the input lose pairwise independence in their encoding strategies to a certain extent. This result was unknown earlier even in the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Random space-time sampling and reconstruction of sparse bandlimited graph diffusion field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the sampling and reconstruction of spectrally $s$-sparse bandlimited graph signals governed by heat diffusion processes. We propose a random space-time sampling regime, referred to as {randomized} dynamical sampling, where a small subset of space-time nodes is randomly selected at each time step based on a probability distribution. To analyze the recovery problem, we establish a rigorous mathematical framework by introducing the parameter \textit{the dynamic spectral graph weighted coherence}. This key parameter governs the number of space-time samples needed for stable recovery and extends the idea of variable density sampling to the context of dynamical systems. By optimizing the sampling probability distribution, we show that as few as $\mathcal{O}(s \log(k))$ space-time samples are sufficient for accurate reconstruction in optimal scenarios, where $k$ denotes the bandwidth of the signal. Our framework encompasses both static and dynamic cases, demonstrating a reduction in the number of spatial samples needed at each time step by exploiting temporal correlations. Furthermore, we provide a computationally efficient and robust algorithm for signal reconstruction. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results and illustrate the practical efficacy of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>ProFL: Performative Robust Optimal Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performative prediction (PP) is a framework that captures distribution shifts that occur during the training of machine learning models due to their deployment. As the trained model is used, its generated data could cause the model to evolve, leading to deviations from the original data distribution. The impact of such model-induced distribution shifts in the federated learning (FL) setup remains unexplored despite being increasingly likely to transpire in real-life use cases. Although Jin et al. (2024) recently extended PP to FL in a straightforward manner, the resulting model only converges to a performative stable point, which may be far from optimal. The methods in Izzo et al. (2021); Miller et al. (2021) can find a performative optimal point in centralized settings, but they require the performative risk to be convex and the training data to be noiseless, assumptions often violated in realistic FL systems. This paper overcomes all of these shortcomings and proposes Performative robust optimal Federated Learning (ProFL), an algorithm that finds performative optimal points in FL from noisy and contaminated data. We present the convergence analysis under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which applies to non-convex objectives. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate our proposed algorithms' efficiency.</description>

      <title>Approaching Massive MIMO Performance with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: We Do Not Need Many Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers an antenna structure where a (non-large) array of radiating elements is placed at short distance in front of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), herein nicknamed reconfigurable intelligent base station (RIBS). We firstly derive a closed-form expression for the channel between the array of radiating elements and the RIS that captures the near-field effects, and give some considerations on the channel hardening and favorable propagation in this scenario. Focusing on both active and passive RIS, we describe channel estimation and downlink signal processing techniques suitable for the RIBS structure. Additionally, we formulate and solve an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the fairness among the users with respect to the downlink power coefficients and RIS configuration both in the cases of active and passive RIBS. Numerical results show that the proposed structure is effective and capable of outperforming conventional non-RIS aided MIMO systems, especially in the case of active RIBS. The proposed antenna structure is thus shown to be able to approach massive MIMO performance levels in a cost-effective way with reduced hardware resources.</description>

      <title>Stronger Polarization for the Deletion Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show a polar coding scheme for the deletion channel with a probability of error that decays roughly like $2^{-\sqrt{\Lambda}}$, where $\Lambda$ is the length of the codeword. That is, the same decay rate as that of seminal polar codes for memoryless channels. This is stronger than prior art in which the square root is replaced by a cube root. Our coding scheme is similar yet distinct from prior art. The main differences are: 1) Guard-bands are placed in almost all polarization levels; 2) Trellis decoding is applied to the whole received word, and not to segments of it. As before, the scheme is capacity-achieving. The price we pay for this improvement is a higher decoding complexity, which is nonetheless still polynomial, $O(\Lambda^4)$.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided MIMO Networks: Distributed or Centralized Architecture?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the capacity of a broadcast channel with a multi-antenna base station (BS) sending independent messages to multiple users, aided by IRSs with N elements. In particular, both the distributed and centralized IRS deployment architectures are considered. Regarding the distributed IRS, the N IRS elements form multiple IRSs and each of them is installed near a user cluster; while for the centralized IRS, all IRS elements are located in the vicinity of the BS. To draw essential insights, we first derive the maximum capacity achieved by the distributed IRS and centralized IRS, respectively, under the assumption of line-of-sight propagation and homogeneous channel setups. By capturing the fundamental tradeoff between the spatial multiplexing gain and passive beamforming gain, we rigourously prove that the capacity of the distributed IRS is higher than that of the centralized IRS provided that the total number of IRS elements is above a threshold. Motivated by the superiority of the distributed IRS, we then focus on the transmission and element allocation design under the distributed IRS. By exploiting the user channel correlation of intra-clusters and inter-clusters, an efficient hybrid multiple access scheme relying on both spatial and time domains is proposed to fully exploit both the passive beamforming gain and spatial DoF. Moreover, the IRS element allocation problem is investigated for the objectives of sum-rate maximization and minimum user rate maximization, respectively. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical finding and also to unveil the effectiveness of the distributed IRS for improving the system capacity under various system setups.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Precoder Design for Angle-of-Departure Estimation with Limited-Resolution Phase Shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid analog-digital beamforming stands out as a key enabler for future communication systems with a massive number of antennas. In this paper, we investigate the hybrid precoder design problem for angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation, where we take into account the practical constraint on the limited resolution of phase shifters. Our goal is to design a radio-frequency (RF) precoder and a base-band (BB) precoder to estimate AoD of the user with a high accuracy. To this end, we propose a two-step strategy where we first obtain the fully digital precoder that minimizes the angle error bound, and then the resulting digital precoder is decomposed into an RF precoder and a BB precoder, based on the alternating optimization and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Besides, we derive the quantization error upper bound and analyse the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Exact Thresholds for Noisy Non-Adaptive Group Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the mathematical limits and algorithmic bounds for probabilistic group testing have become increasingly well-understood, with exact asymptotic thresholds now being known in general scaling regimes for the noiseless setting. In the noisy setting where each test outcome is flipped with constant probability, there have been similar developments, but the overall understanding has lagged significantly behind the noiseless setting. In this paper, we substantially narrow this gap by deriving exact asymptotic thresholds for the noisy setting under two widely-studied random test designs: i.i.d. Bernoulli and near-constant tests-per-item. These thresholds are established by combining components of an existing information-theoretic threshold decoder with a novel analysis of maximum-likelihood decoding (upper bounds), and deriving a novel set of impossibility results by analyzing certain failure events for optimal maximum-likelihood decoding (lower bounds).</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Hybrid Beamforming for Holographic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that there is inherent radiation pattern distortion for the commercial base station antenna array, which usually needs three antenna sectors to cover the whole space. To eliminate pattern distortion and further enhance beamforming performance, we propose an electromagnetic hybrid beamforming (EHB) scheme based on a three-dimensional (3D) superdirective holographic antenna array. Specifically, EHB consists of antenna excitation current vectors (analog beamforming) and digital precoding matrices, where the implementation of analog beamforming involves the real-time adjustment of the radiation pattern to adapt it to the dynamic wireless environment. Meanwhile, the digital beamforming is optimized based on the channel characteristics of analog beamforming to further improve the achievable rate of communication systems. An electromagnetic channel model incorporating array radiation patterns and the mutual coupling effect is also developed to evaluate the benefits of our proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed EHB scheme with a 3D holographic array achieves a relatively flat superdirective beamforming gain and allows for programmable focusing directions throughout the entire spatial domain. Furthermore, they also verify that the proposed scheme achieves a sum rate gain of over 150% compared to traditional beamforming algorithms.</description>

      <title>Co-existing/Cooperating Multicell Massive MIMO and Cell-Free Massive MIMO Deployments: Heuristic Designs and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems represent a deeply investigated evolution from the conventional multicell co-located massive MIMO (MC-mMIMO) network deployments. Anticipating a gradual integration of CF-mMIMO systems alongside pre-existing MC-mMIMO network elements, this paper considers a scenario where both deployments coexist, in order to serve a large number of users using a shared set of frequencies. The investigation explores the impact of this co-existence on the network's downlink performance, considering various degrees of mutual cooperation, precoder selection, and power control strategies. Moreover, to take into account the effect of the proposed cooperation scenarios on the fronthaul links, this paper also provides a fronthaul-aware heuristic association algorithm between users and network elements, which allows the fulfillment of the front-haul requirement on each link. The research is finally completed by extensive simulations, shedding light on the performance outcomes associated with the various levels of cooperation and several solutions delineated in the paper.</description>

      <title>Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields, integral and fractional MDS codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08916v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we prove Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields. These new bounds give upper bounds on the length of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes which attain the Singleton bound. We will also consider codes to be MDS if they attain the fractional Singleton bound, due to Huffman. We prove that this bound in the fractional case can be obtained by codes whose length surpasses the length of the longest known codes in the integral case. For small parameters, we provide exhaustive computational results for additive MDS codes, by classifying the corresponding (fractional) subspace-arcs. This includes a complete classification of fractional additive MDS codes of size 243 over the field of order 9.</description>

      <title>Detecting positive quantum capacities of quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.06327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether a noisy quantum channel can be used to reliably transmit quantum information at a non-zero rate is a challenging problem in quantum information theory. This is because it requires computation of the channel's coherent information for an unbounded number of copies of the channel. In this paper, we devise an elementary perturbative technique to solve this problem in a wide variety of circumstances. Our analysis reveals that a channel's ability to transmit information is intimately connected to the relative sizes of its input, output, and environment spaces. We exploit this link to develop easy tests which can be used to detect positivity of quantum channel capacities simply by comparing the channels' input, output, and environment dimensions. Several noteworthy examples, such as the depolarizing and transpose-depolarizing channels (including the Werner-Holevo channel), dephasing channels, generalized Pauli channels, multi-level amplitude damping channels, and (conjugate) diagonal unitary covariant channels, serve to aptly exhibit the utility of our method. Notably, in all these examples, the coherent information of a single copy of the channel turns out to be positive.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford and parallelizable fault-tolerant logical gates on constant and almost-constant rate homological quantum LDPC codes via higher symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parallel fault-tolerant quantum computing for families of homological quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes defined on 3-manifolds with constant or almost-constant encoding rate. We derive generic formula for a transversal $T$ gate of color codes on general 3-manifolds, which acts as collective non-Clifford logical CCZ gates on any triplet of logical qubits with their logical-$X$ membranes having a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ triple intersection at a single point. The triple intersection number is a topological invariant, which also arises in the path integral of the emergent higher symmetry operator in a topological quantum field theory: the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory. Moreover, the transversal $S$ gate of the color code corresponds to a higher-form symmetry supported on a codimension-1 submanifold, giving rise to exponentially many addressable and parallelizable logical CZ gates. We have developed a generic formalism to compute the triple intersection invariants for 3-manifolds and also study the scaling of the Betti number and systoles with volume for various 3-manifolds, which translates to the encoding rate and distance. We further develop three types of LDPC codes supporting such logical gates: (1) A quasi-hyperbolic code from the product of 2D hyperbolic surface and a circle, with almost-constant rate $k/n=O(1/\log(n))$ and $O(\log(n))$ distance; (2) A homological fibre bundle code with $O(1/\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ rate and $O(\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ distance; (3) A specific family of 3D hyperbolic codes: the Torelli mapping torus code, constructed from mapping tori of a pseudo-Anosov element in the Torelli subgroup, which has constant rate while the distance scaling is currently unknown. We then show a generic constant-overhead scheme for applying a parallelizable universal gate set with the aid of logical-$X$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Receiver Selection and Transmit Beamforming for Multi-static Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are expected to develop a novel paradigm of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) to enable both the high-accuracy sensing and high-speed communications. However, conventional mono-static ISAC systems, which simultaneously transmit and receive at the same equipment, may suffer from severe self-interference, and thus significantly degrade the system performance.To address this issue, this paper studies a multi-static ISAC system for cooperative target localization and communications, where the transmitter transmits ISAC signal to multiple receivers (REs) deployed at different positions. We derive the closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) on the joint estimations of both the transmission delay and Doppler shift for cooperative target localization, and the CRB minimization problem is formulated by considering the cooperative cost and communication rate requirements for the REs. To solve this problem, we first decouple it into two subproblems for RE selection and transmit beamforming, respectively. Then, a minimax linkage-based method is proposed to solve the RE selection subproblem, and a successive convex approximation algorithm is adopted to deal with the transmit beamforming subproblem with non-convex constraints. Finally, numerical results validate our analysis and reveal that our proposed multi-static ISAC scheme achieves better ISAC performance than the conventional mono-static ones when the number of cooperative REs is large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an open quantum system undergoing Markovian dynamics, the latter being modelled by a discrete-time quantum Markov semigroup $(\Phi^n)_{n \in {\mathbb{N}}}$, resulting from the action of sequential uses of a quantum channel $\Phi$, with $n \in {\mathbb{N}}$ being the discrete time parameter. We find upper and lower bounds on the one-shot $\epsilon$-error information transmission capacities of $\Phi^n$ for a finite time $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon \in [0,1)$ in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the channel $\Phi$. We consider transmission of $(i)$ classical information (both in the unassisted and entanglement-assisted settings); $(ii)$ quantum information and $(iii)$ private classical information.</description>
