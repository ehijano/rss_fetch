      <title>Modular programming of interaction and geometric specificity enables assembly of complex DNA origami nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modular DNA origami design approach to address the challenges of assembling geometrically complex nanoscale structures, including those with nonuniform Gaussian curvature. This approach features a core structure that completely conserves the scaffold routing across different designs and preserves more than 70% of the DNA staples between designs, dramatically reducing both cost and effort, while enabling precise and independent programming of subunit interactions and binding angles through adjustable overhang lengths and sequences. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, gel electrophoresis, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we validate a set of robust design rules. We demonstrate the method's utility by assembling a variety of self-limiting structures, including anisotropic shells with controlled inter-subunit interactions and curvature, and a toroid with globally varying curvature. Our strategy is both cost-effective and versatile, providing a promising and efficient solution for the synthetic fabrication of complex nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Collective Hysteron Behavior in Nonlinear Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multistability-induced hysteresis has been widely studied in mechanical systems, but such behavior has proven more difficult to reproduce experimentally in flow networks. Natural flow networks like animal and plant vasculature exhibit complex nonlinear behavior to facilitate fluid transport, so multistable flows may inform their functionality. To probe such phenomena in an analogous model system, we utilize an electronic network of hysterons designed to have tunable negative differential resistivity. We demonstrate our system's capability to generate complex global memory states in the form of voltage patterns. The tunable nonlinearity of each element's current-voltage characteristic allows us to navigate this space of hysteretic behavior, and can be utilized to engineer more complex networks with exotic effects such as avalanches and multiperiodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Power-law decay of force on cell membrane tethers reflects long-ranged relaxation of membrane tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane tension is an acknowledged regulator of a wide array of cell functions; however, whether it acts locally or globally in different contexts remains debated. Recent experiments that locally perturb tension and measure the response elsewhere on the membrane are not conclusive, and the mechanism of diffusive tension relaxation has been called into doubt. Here, we consider the tension response to a sudden extension of a membrane tether, and report a quantitative signature of dynamic tension relaxation, which up to now is missing. We present a theory based on tension diffusion leading to a prediction of power-law decay in time of the force holding the tether, with a material-independent exponent of 1/3. This prediction is confirmed to within a few percent by re-analyzing eleven sets of tether data from two cell types with distinct membrane cortical architectures. Overall, our scaling results indicate the absence of a relevant characteristic length and therefore generically reflect tension relaxation by long-range membrane lipid flows.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Control of Third-order Nonlinear Optical Properties of Gold Nanoparticle/Liquid Crystal Composites under External Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamic control of third-order nonlinear optical absorption properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) dispersed in nematic liquid crystals (LC). By leveraging the reconfigurable nature of liquid crystals under external electric fields, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate AuNP alignment, dimer formation, and subsequently the plasmon coupling effects. Planar oriented and degenerate LC cells were prepared, and their optical responses under varying electric fields were characterized using polarization microscopy, UV-VIS spectroscopy, and Z-scan techniques. In planar cells, the applied electric field reorients LC molecules and AuNPs, influencing plasmon coupling and the nonlinear absorption. Conversely, degenerate cells exhibit more complex behaviors due to multiple LC alignment directions. These findings illustrate the potential of AuNP/nematic LC systems for creating tunable photonic devices responsive to external stimuli.</description>

      <title>Enhanced collective vibrations in granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials are defined as collections of macroscopic dissipative particles. Although these systems are ubiquitous in our lives, the nature and the causes of their non-trivial collective dynamics still remain elusive and have attracted significant interest in non-equilibrium physics. Here, we focus on the vibrational dynamics of granular materials. While the vibrational dynamics of random packings have been examined concerning the jamming transition, previous research has overlooked the role of contact dissipations. We conducted numerical and analytical investigations into the vibrational dynamics of random packings influenced by the normal dissipative force, which is the simplest model for contact dissipations. Our findings reveal that the kinetic energy per mode diverges in the low-frequency range, following the scaling law $\mathcal{K}_l \propto \omega^{-2}_l$ with the frequency $\omega_l$, indicating that low-frequency modes experience strong excitation and that the equipartition of energy is violated. Additionally, the spatial structure factor of the velocity field displays the scaling law $S_v(q) \propto q^{-2}$ with the wavenumber $q$, which signifies that the velocity field has an infinitely long range. We demonstrate that these phenomena arise from the effects of weaker damping on softer modes, where the particle displacements parallel to the contacts are minimal in the low-frequency modes, rendering normal dissipation ineffective at dampening these modes.</description>

      <title>Giant Electro-Viscous Effects in Polar Fluids with Paraelectric-Modulated Antiferroelectric-Ferroelectric Phase Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid-crystal material DIO exhibits an antiferroelectric (AF) phase, characterized by a sinusoidally modulated structure between the paraelectric (P) and ferroelectric (F) nematic phases. Although these sinusoidal modulated structures associated with the P-AF-F phase sequence is commonly observed in solid ferroelectrics, their presence in soft matter systems is scarce. This study is aimed at examining the macroscopic properties of DIO, identifying unique rheological properties, such as switching between shear thinning and shear thickening behaviors at certain shear rate in the ferroelectric nematic phase. Additionally, a significant electroviscous effect is observed, with the viscosity increasing by 70 times under an ultra-low electric field of 0.15 V um-1 at the AF-F transition.</description>

      <title>Effects of particle angularity on granular self-organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of two-dimensional poly-disperse disc systems revealed a coordinated self-organisation of cell stresses and shapes, with certain distributions collapsing onto a master form for many processes, size distributions, friction coefficients, and cell orders. Here we examine the effects of grain angularity on the indicators of self-organisation, using simulations of bi-disperse regular $N$-polygons and varying $N$ systematically. We find that: the strong correlation between local cell stresses and orientations, as well as the collapses of the conditional distributions of scaled cell stress ratios to a master Weibull form for all cell orders $k$, are independent of angularity and friction coefficient. In contrast, increasing angularity makes the collapses of the conditional distributions sensitive to changes in the friction coefficient.</description>

      <title>Enhanced diffusion over a periodic trap by hydrodynamic coupling to an elastic mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many physical systems, degrees of freedom are coupled \emph{via} hydrodynamic forces, even in the absence of Hamiltonian interactions. A particularly important and widespread example concerns the transport of microscopic particles in fluids near deformable boundaries. In such a situation, the influence of elastohydrodynamic couplings on Brownian motion remains to be understood. Unfortunately, the temporal and spatial scales associated with the thermal fluctuations of usual surfaces are often so small that their deformations are difficult to monitor experimentally, together with the much slower and larger particle motion at stake. Here, we propose a minimal model describing the hydrodynamic coupling of a colloidal particle to a fluctuating elastic mode, in presence of an external periodic potential. We demonstrate that the late-time diffusion coefficient of the particle increases with the compliance of the elastic mode. Remarkably,  our results reveal that, and quantify how: i) spontaneous microscopic transport in complex environnements can be affected by soft boundaries -- a situation with numerous practical implications in nanoscale and biological physics; ii) the effects of fast and tiny surface deformations are imprinted over the long-term and large-distance colloidal mobility -- and are hence measurable in practice.</description>

      <title>Self-organized criticality driven by droplet influx and random fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The droplet size distribution typically decays exponentially in solutions formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. Nevertheless, a power-law distribution of nucleoli volumes has been observed in amphibian oocytes, which appears similar to the cluster size distribution in reaction-limited aggregation. In this work, we study the mechanism of power-law distributed droplet sizes and unveil a self-organized criticality driven by droplet influx and random fusion between droplets. Surprisingly, the droplet size dynamics is governed by a similar Smoluchowski equation as the cluster size in aggregation systems. The system reaches a critical state as the area fraction approaches the critical value at which the droplet size has a power-law distribution with a $1.5$ exponent. Furthermore, the system is also spatially scale-free with a divergent correlation length at the critical state, marked by giant droplet-density fluctuations and power-law decay of the pair correlation function.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Spreading Under Power Law Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic spreading of a dense suspension of particles under power law repulsive potentials decaying as $1/r^k$. We find analytically that the particles spread in a self-similar form, where the radius grows with time as $t^{1/(k+2)}$. Our results closely align with experiments of paramagnetic colloidal particles under an external magnetic field interacting via a $1/r^3$ potential. We further substantiate the theory by molecular dynamic simulations of thousands of particles in one and two dimensions. The simulations reveal a rich diversity of behaviors contingent on the value of $k$. Specifically, for $k&gt;D-2$ (where $D$ is the dimension), the density is centered in the middle, for $k = D-2$, density is uniform, and for $k&lt;D-2$, there is an aggregation of particles at the edge of the suspension. When two or more such suspensions are placed near each other, the system retains a power-law memory of its initial state, resulting in a particle-free zone at the interface of the merging populations.</description>

      <title>Rheologically tuned modes of collective transport in active viscoelastic films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many living biological media combine both viscous and elastic properties, most theoretical studies employ either purely fluid- or solid-like descriptions. We here use a unified framework for active films on substrates capable of describing a broad range of viscoelastic behavior to explore the interplay between activity and rheology. The core of the study is a comprehensive state diagram showing a rich world of spatiotemporal dynamic states. Our results demonstrate the potential of tunable rheology to realize modes of controlled active transport on the microscale.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and clustering of sedimenting disc lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform arrays of particles tend to cluster as they sediment in viscous fluids. Shape anisotropy of the particles enriches these dynamics by modifying the mode-structure and the resulting instabilities of the array. A one-dimensional lattice of sedimenting spheroids in the Stokesian regime displays either an exponential or an algebraic rate of clustering depending on the initial lattice spacing (Chajwa et al. 2020). This is caused by an interplay between the Crowley mechanism which promotes clumping, and a shape-induced drift mechanism which subdues it. We theoretically and experimentally investigate the sedimentation dynamics of one-dimensional lattices of oblate spheroids or discs and show a stark difference in clustering behaviour: the Crowley mechanism results in clumps comprised of several spheroids, whereas the drift mechanism results in pairs of spheroids whose asymptotic behavior is determined by pair-hydrodynamic interactions. We find that a Stokeslet, or point-particle, approximation is insufficient to accurately describe the instability and that the corrections provided by the first-reflection are necessary for obtaining some crucial dynamical features. As opposed to a sharp boundary between exponential growth and neutral eigenvalues under the Stokeslet approximation, the first-reflection correction leads to exponential growth for all initial perturbations, but far more rapid algebraic growth than exponential growth at large lattice spacing $d$. For discs with aspect ratio 0.125, corresponding to the experimental value, the instability growth rate is found to decrease with increasing lattice spacing $d$, approximately as $d^{-4.5}$, which is faster than the $d^{-2}$ for spheres (Crowley, 1971). Sedimenting pairs predominantly come together to form '$\perp$', which our theory accounts for through an analysis that builds on Koch &amp; Shaqfeh (1989).</description>

      <title>Oscillatory collective motion in viscoelastic and elastic active fluids and solids under circular confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an inspiring recent study, Xu et al. [Nat. Phys. 19, 46 (2023)] observed for a living active biofilm under circular confinement two emergent dynamic modes of collective motion in the film. One corresponds to global rotational motion of oscillating sense of rotation, the other one to uniformly translating motion of rotating migration direction. The authors reproduced these features in a discretized theoretical model for elastic active solids. We here demonstrate that the discovered fundamental phenomena are generic and emerge abundantly for a broad range of viscoelastic fluids and solids. Elastic solids represent only one limiting case.</description>

      <title>Anomalous suppression of large-scale density fluctuations in classical and quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a \textit{hidden} large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally-intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Cost of Steady State Erasure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of a time-varying external harmonic trap whereby the trap stiffness is changed from an initial to a final value in finite-time and then the system is reset when it relaxes to an equilibrium distribution in the final trap. Such setups are very similar to those studied in the context of the finite-time Landauer erasure principle. We analyse the thermodynamic costs of such a setup by deriving a moment generating function for the work cost of changing the trap stiffness in finite-time for a system in steady state. We analyse the mean and variance of the work required for a specific experimentally viable protocol and also obtain an optimal protocol which minimises the mean cost. For both these procedures, our analysis captures both the large-time and short-time corrections. For the optimal protocol, we obtain a closed form expression for the mean cost for all protocol durations, thereby making contact with earlier work on geometric measures of dissipation-minimising optimal protocols that implement information erasure.</description>

      <title>Silica Aerogel Thin Film on Improving Solar Cell Efficiency</title>

Abstract: Silica aerogels are nanoporous materials with exceptional optical and physical properties, making them promising candidates to enhance solar cell efficiency as antireflective coatings. This study synthesized hydrophobic silica aerogel thin films under ambient conditions and characterized their porous structure, surface morphology, and optical performance. The films were deposited on monocrystalline silicon solar cells to assess their impact on photovoltaic properties. A two-step acid/base catalyzed sol-gel process was utilized, followed by solvent exchange and surface modification with trimethylchlorosilane. Structural analysis via SEM revealed successful deposition of crack-free films when aging occurred in an ethanol environment. The aerogel displayed considerable specific surface area (115 m2/g), porosity (77.92%), and surface roughness (55-78%) along with a low refractive index (1.05), benefiting light harvesting. Preliminary solar testing showed increased output voltage with a 0.2 mm aerogel coating versus a bare cell. Further IV measurements demonstrated enhanced charge transport and conversion efficiency for the treated cell. The antireflective and light-trapping effects of aerogel appear to improve photon absorption. This initial research validates the potential of ambient pressure-synthesized hydrophobic silica aerogels to increase the performance of silicon photovoltaics cost-effectively. Further optimization of film thickness and morphology could realize higher efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>Fluidization and anomalous density fluctuations in 2D Voronoi cell tissues with pulsating activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cells not only can be motile by crawling but are also capable of non-motility active motions like periodic contraction or pulsation. In this work, based on a Voronoi cell model, we show how this non-motility activity affects the structure, dynamic and density fluctuations of cellular monolayers. Our model shows that random cell pulsation fluidizes solid epithelial tissues into a hyperuniform fluid state, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reverse solidification. Our results indicate this solidification is a BKT-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the annihilation of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation or anti-hyperuniformity. We propose a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that can unify the two opposite anomalous fluctuation phenomena. Our findings can help to understand recent experimental observations in MDCK monolayer.</description>

      <title>Motility-induced mixing transition in exponentially growing multicellular spheroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growth drives cellular dynamics in dense aggregates including bacterial colonies, developing tissues, and tumors. We investigate the underlying physical principles emerging from the interplay of growth, steric repulsion, and motility in a minimal agent-based model of exponentially growing, three-dimensional spheroids. Our results reveal a motility-induced mixing transition: Without motility, deterministic radial motion from volume expansion dominates, while growth and division cause tangential, cellular-scale diffusion, largely independent of expansion velocity. Despite this small-scale diffusion, cell lineages remain confined to their local environment. This confinement persists at weak motility and is overcome only above a threshold, leading to tangential superdiffusivity and global cell mixing with a diverging timescale near the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Using a phenomenological model, we identify two effects governing this transition: Steric interactions that suppress motility-induced velocity below a threshold, and the expanding nature of the system which inhibits complete mixing. Our study highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and motility with global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The results provide a baseline for identifying additional biological mechanisms in experiments, for example in tissue spheroids. The mixing dynamics might also be relevant for competition or tumor progression by interacting with genetic heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Chemical interactions in active droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions among biologically active agents is facilitated by their self-generated chemical and hydrodynamic fields. In order to elucidate the pair-wise interactions between such micro-organisms, we employ active droplets as a model system, capable of self-generating chemical and hydrodynamic fields. We demonstrate that the solute P\'eclet number ($Pe$), characterizing the relative strength of its convective to diffusive transport, plays a crucial role in determining how the chemical and hydrodynamic fields impact their interactions. Our findings reveal that at low $Pe$, the interaction is predominantly governed by chemo-repulsive effects, leading to droplets avoiding physical contact. Conversely, at elevated $Pe$, hydrodynamic interactions become more influential, leading to physical engagement. However, irrespective of $Pe$, the interaction of a droplet with the chemical trail of another droplet is always governed by chemo-repulsive effects. Furthermore, our results establish that the chemo-repulsive deflection/rebounding of droplets is influenced by the droplets' inherent chemical polarity, as determined by its $Pe$, independent of their approach orientation. Our findings offer a methodology for tuning the outcomes of binary interactions among chemically active droplets, laying the groundwork for potential studies on their collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the build-up of effective hyperuniformity from large globular colloidal aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02091v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple three-dimensional model of a fluid whose constituent particles interact via a short range attractive and long range repulsive potential is used to model the aggregation into large spherical-like clusters made up of hundreds of particles. The model can be thought of as a straightforward rendition of colloid flocculation into large spherical aggregates. We illustrate how temperature and particle density influence the cluster size distribution and affect inter- and intra-cluster dynamics. The system is shown to exhibit two well separated length and time scales, which can be tuned by the balance between repulsive and attractive forces. Interestingly, cluster aggregates at moderate/low temperatures approach a cluster glassy phase whereas cluster particles retain a local liquid-like structure. These states present a strong suppression of density fluctuations for a significant range of relatively large wavelengths, meeting the criterion of effective disordered hyperuniform materials as far as the intercluster structure is concerned.</description>

Abstract: The spontaneous organization of particles at the boundary between two fluids is a common occurrence. Scientists have extensively investigated various internal and external factors to manipulate and guide these self-assembly processes. This review article centers on the impact of external fields, particularly electric and magnetic fields, on the self-assembly of intermediate-sized particles at interfaces. By modifying the shape and dimensions of particles, attractive forces can be precisely controlled. Furthermore, the intensity and orientation of external fields exert a substantial influence on the resulting assembled structure. These systems hold immense promise for groundbreaking applications in drug delivery, catalysis, and other transport mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Director-layer dynamics in the antiferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the antiferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distinctive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the case of 90 degree director tilt, a "first-order" approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependencies of the splay, twist, and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the thermocapillary assembly of a colloidal cluster during the evaporation of a liquid film in an unevenly heated cell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of solution of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:cond-mat/0408153v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a solution of long polyanions (PA) with shorter polycations (PC) and focus on the role of Coulomb interaction. A good example is solutions of DNA and PC which are widely studied for gene therapy. In the solution, each PA attracts many PCs to form a complex. When the ratio of total charges of PA and PC in the solution, $x$, equals to 1, complexes are neutral and they condense in a macroscopic drop. When $x$ is far away from 1, complexes are strongly charged. The Coulomb repulsion is large and free complexes are stable. As $x$ approaches to 1, PCs attached to PA disproportionate themselves in two competing ways. One way is inter-complex disproportionation, in which PCs make some complexes neutral and therefore condensed in a macroscopic drop while other complexes become even stronger charged and stay free. The other way is intra-complex disproportionation, in which PCs make one end of a complex neutral and condensed in a small droplet while the rest of the complex forms a strongly charged tail. Thus each complex becomes a "tadpole". These two ways can also combine together to give even lower free energy. We get a phase diagram of PA-PC solution in a plane of $x$ and inverse screening radius of the monovalent salt, which includes phases or phase coexistence with both kinds of disproportionation.</description>

Abstract: We show that classical DNA unzipping transition which is equivalently described by quantum mechanical localization-delocalization transition in the ground state of non-Hermitian single impurity Hatano-Nelson Hamiltonian is underpinned by generalized parity ({\bf P})-time reversal ({\bf T}) symmetry breaking transition. We also study the one-dimensional discretized version of Hatano-Nelson model in the presence of the single impurity and random disorder on a finite-size lattice. These discrete models are useful to study unzipping of a single adsorbed polymer from a surface. Our results show that the discrete models also undergo a phase transition from a PT unbroken phase to a broken phase. Interestingly, the generalized PT phase transition points coincide with the localization-delocalization transition for continuum as well as lattice models.</description>

Abstract: A point force acting on a Brinkman fluid in confinement is always counterbalanced by the force on the porous medium, the force on the walls and the stress at open boundaries. We discuss the distribution of those forces in different geometries: a long pipe, a medium with a single no-slip planar boundary, a porous sphere with an open boundary and a porous sphere with a no-slip wall. We determine the forces using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and additionally validate the results with explicit analytical flow solutions. We discuss the relevance of our findings for cellular processes such as cytoplasmic streaming and centrosome positioning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important role in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field model and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell undergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial distribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell shape. T1 transitions have a dual effect. Cells losing neighbours tend to relax their shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the statistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find asymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours. These asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell migration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.</description>

      <title>Soil creep facilitated by cyclic variations of environmental conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sloped terrains tend to creep downward over time, even when their slope is below the nominal angle of repose. This behavior can result from periodic variations in environmental conditions, such as daily or seasonal fluctuations in temperature and humidity. We study this process by considering a model of an athermal yield stress material under an applied stress lower than the critical yield stress value $\sigma_c$. Normally, in such a situation the material does not flow at all. However, under cyclic temporal variation of system parameters a finite amount of irreversible deformation can remain after each cycle, and a long term steady-state flow of the whole system can be induced. In our model, we cycle the strength of internal elastic interactions to mimic the effect of cyclic variation of environmental conditions in the real soils. We find that the amount of deformation per cycle increases if $\sigma_c$ is approached from below, and it decreases and even vanishes at a novel critical stress $\sigma_0&lt;\sigma_c$ when this, in turn, is reached from above. Interestingly, $\sigma_0$ plays a role similar to the endurance limit in the context of fatigue damage propagation. Despite the model's simplicity, our results offer a fresh perspective on subcritical landform evolution, with implications for the creep of hill slopes over long periods and the precursors to runaway landslides.</description>

      <title>Sliding of a liquid spherical droplet in an external insoluble liquid at low Reynolds numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experiment shows that small liquid droplets under the action of gravity and the Archimedes force move in the external viscous liquid practically according to the Stokes drag force equation, and not in accordance with the Hadamard-Rybczynski (HR) formula, which was specially developed to describe the motion of a liquid droplet in an external viscous liquid. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain this: increased viscosity at the interface between two liquids and the presence of unaccounted surfactants. However, there is another fundamental mechanism that has not been taken into account. It can be expected that the velocities of such liquids, insoluble in each other, may not equalize at the boundary of the droplet. No slip condition may be may be unnatural at the droplet interface. In this paper, the Navier condition is applied to the liquid-liquid boundary for the first time. A generalized HR equation is obtained. If slip length {\lambda}=0 that equation transforms into the usual HR equation. At certain {\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids. For infinite viscosity of the drop, it becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes drag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of partial slip.</description>
