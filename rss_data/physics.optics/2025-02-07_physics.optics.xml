      <title>Designing Illumination Patterns for Single-Pixel Imaging Using Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-pixel imaging leverages a single-pixel detector and structured illumination patterns to reconstruct images, offering a cost-effective solution for imaging across a wide range of wavelengths, such as x-ray and terahertz. However, the technique faces challenges in efficiency due to the need for numerous patterns to achieve high-quality image reconstruction. In this study, we explore the use of spin lattice models from statistical mechanics to design illumination patterns for single-pixel imaging. By employing models like Ising, Potts, XY, and Heisenberg, we generate structured patterns that are adaptable for binary, grayscale, and color imaging. This work creates a direct connection between lattice models and imaging applications, providing a systematic approach to pattern generation that can enhance single-pixel imaging efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sample Motion for Structured Illumination Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) uses a set of images captured with different patterned illumination to computationally reconstruct resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Here, we propose an alternative approach using a static speckle illumination pattern and relying on inherent sample motion to encode the super-resolved information in multiple raw images, for the case of fluorescence microscopy. From a set of sequentially captured raw images, we jointly estimate the sample motion and the super-resolved image. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method both in simulation and in experiment.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the complexity of Arnold's tongues in a breathing-soliton laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization occurs ubiquitously in nature and science. The synchronization regions generally broaden monotonically with the strength of the forcing, thereby featuring a tongue-like shape in parameter space, known as Arnold's tongue. Such a shape is universal, prevailing in many diverse synchronized systems. Interestingly, theoretical studies suggest that under strong external forcing, the shape of the synchronization regions can change substantially and even holes can appear in the solid patterns. However, experimentally accessing these abnormal regimes is quite challenging, mainly because many real-world systems displaying synchronization become fragile under strong forcing. Here, we are able to observe these intriguing regimes in a breathing-soliton laser. Two types of abnormal synchronization regions are unveiled, namely, a leaf- and a ray-like shape. High-resolution control of the loss allows holes to be revealed in the synchronization regions. Our work opens the possibility to study intriguing synchronization dynamics using a simple breathing-soliton laser as a testbed.</description>

      <title>EigenCWD: a spatially-varying deconvolution algorithm for single metalens imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniaturization of optics through the use of two-dimensional metalenses has enabled novel applications in imaging. To date, single-lens imaging remains the most common configuration, in part due to the limited focusing efficiency of metalenses. This results in limitations when it comes to wavefront manipulation and, thus, unavoidable aberrations in the formed image that require computational deconvolution to deblur the image. For certain lens profiles, such as the most common hyperbolic one that results in the highest efficiencies, at large fields of view, spatially-varying aberrations such as coma or astigmatism are prominent. These aberrations cannot be corrected for by traditional deconvolution methods, such as Wiener filtering. Here, we develop a spatially-varying deconvolution algorithm based on eigenvalue column-wise decomposition (eigenCWD). EigenCWD solves a minimization problem of the error between the measured image and the estimated image of the object to be reconstructed through an approximate forward blurring model. This approximate forward model uses an eigendecomposition of the spatially-varying point spread functions for fast computation, allowing for efficient scaling to larger image sizes and blurring kernels common in metalens imaging. We demonstrate eigenCWD's ability to correct spatially-varying blur and distortions for various lens profiles, surpassing that of the Wiener filter.</description>

      <title>Overcoming experimental obstacles in two-dimensional spectroscopy of a single molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy provides information on coupling and energy transfer between excited states on ultrafast timescales. Only recently, incoherent fluorescence detection has made it possible to combine this method with single-molecule optical spectroscopy to reach the ultimate limit of sensitivity. The main obstacle has been the low number of photons detected due to limited photostability. Here we discuss the key experimental choices that allowed us to overcome these obstacles: broadband acousto-optic modulation, accurate phase-locked loops, photon-counting lock-in detection, delay stage linearization, and detector dead-time compensation. We demonstrate how the acquired photon stream data can be used to post-select detection events according to specific criteria.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Optimized, Fabrication Error-Tolerant Photonic Crystal Nanobeam Cavities for Scalable On-Chip Diamond Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity-enhanced diamond color center qubits can be initialized, manipulated, entangled, and read individually with high fidelity, which makes them ideal for large-scale, modular quantum computers, quantum networks, and distributed quantum sensing systems. However, diamond's unique material properties pose significant challenges in manufacturing nanophotonic devices, leading to fabrication-induced structural imperfections and inaccuracies in defect implantation, which hinder reproducibility, degrade optical properties and compromise the spatial coupling of color centers to small mode-volume cavities. A cavity design tolerant to fabrication imperfections, such as surface roughness, sidewall slant, and non-optimal emitter positioning, can improve coupling efficiency while simplifying fabrication. To address this challenge, a deep learning-based optimization methodology is developed to enhance the fabrication error tolerance of nanophotonic devices. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to promising designs, such as L2 and fishbone nanobeam cavities, predicting Q-factors up to one million times faster than traditional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, enabling efficient optimization of complex, high-dimensional parameter spaces. The CNNs achieve prediction errors below 3.99% and correlation coefficients up to 0.988. Optimized structures demonstrate a 52% reduction in Q-factor degradation, achieving quality factors of 5e4 under real-world conditions and a two-fold expansion in field distribution, enabling efficient coupling of non-optimally positioned emitters. This methodology enables scalable, high-yield manufacturing of robust nanophotonic devices, including the cavity-enhanced diamond quantum systems developed in this study.</description>

      <title>Power-over-fiber and distributed acoustic sensing hybridization in single fiber channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient and independent operation of power-over-fiber (PoF) and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has been demonstrated using standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). A transmission optical power efficiency (OPTE) of 6.67% was achieved over an 11.8 km fiber link, supporting both power delivery and distributed optical fiber sensing (DOFS). To minimize cross-talk, the system separates the power and sensing channels by a 40 THz bandwidth. In the experiment, the power and sensing light wavelengths are 1064 nm (continuous) and 1550 nm (pulsed), respectively. As the transmitted optical power increased from 0 W to 2.13 W, the DAS system successfully localized vibration sources and reconstructed phase information, confirming its ability to operate under high optical power. The reported scheme verifies the possibility of constructing the sensing-energy hybrid network based on conventional optical fiber with the advantages of flexibility and low cost.</description>

      <title>Multipole generalization of the Witten effect in Mie-resonant photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the Witten effect on the case of oscillating multipole sources exciting nonreciprocal sphere with effective axion response. We find that the fields outside of the sphere are presented as a superposition of electric and magnetic multipoles. In addition to appearance of cross-polarized component in the radiation, Mie resonances of the system hybridize with each other, exhibiting characteristic double peaks in Mie spectra observed especially clearly for higher-order multipole resonances. This characteristic feature may provide a sensitive probe of axion-type nonreciprocal responses in Mie-resonant photonics.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared dual comb spectroscopy via continuous-wave optical parametric oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-comb spectroscopy has demonstrated remarkable capabilities for rapid and sensitive measurements; however, significant challenges still exist in generating high-power, mutually coherent mid-infrared combs. Here we demonstrate that a pair of near-infrared femtosecond frequency combs can be spectrally translated via a continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator. The pair of spectrally translated combs demonstrated high mutual coherence, power per comb tooth in excess of hundreds of microwatts, and were tunable between 4 um and 5 um. Unlike previous approaches which relied upon synchronous optical parametric oscillation, the present approach avoids challenges associated with comb stabilization, low power per comb tooth, and complex cavity designs. Further it is readily amenable to high repetition rates (gigahertz-level and beyond). The flexible and facile nature of this approach provides a robust path for the spectral translation of mode-locked combs, achieving spectral bandwidths limited only by the phase matching bandwidth of the optical parametric oscillator. This approach holds significant promise for applications in chemical kinetics, remote sensing, combustion science, and precision spectroscopy, where the combination of high powers, broad bandwidths, and high measurement rates are transformative.</description>

      <title>Maximizing nanoparticle light absorption: size, geometry, and a prospect for metal alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we show how to maximize absorption of plasmonic nanoparticles in terms of size, geometry and material. For that reason the interaction of nanoparticles with light was decomposed into different effects. We determined that the main effect dictating the optimal amount of optical losses is radiation damping, and how it depends on nanoparticle size and geometry. Based on this, we find that for many combinations of sizes and geometries losses in pure metals are far from optimal. To overcome the aforementioned issue, alloying is presented as straightforward and flexible way of modulating the optical losses. Furthermore, strategies for tuning the optical losses to values above, between, and even below those in pure plasmonic metals are developed in terms of selecting the right alloy composition. In some cases, alloys showed a multifold increase in absorption when compared to pure plasmonic metals. The physical reasons governing such changes are elucidated based on the electronic structure changes during alloying of different metals, which enables generalization of the results to other systems. Besides increasing absorption, electronic structure changes can also be utilized for channeling the absorbed energy to suit different purposes, such as hot carrier generation for photocatalysis or solar energy harvesting. Overall, these results establish alloying as a powerful tool for designing nanostructures for applications that utilize light absorption.</description>

      <title>High Spatiotemporal Resolution Structured Illumination Microscopy: Principle, Instrumentation, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among super-resolution microscopy techniques, structured illumination microscopy (SIM) shows great advances of low phototoxicity, high speed, and excellent performance in long-term dynamic observation, making it especially suitable for live cell imaging. This review delves into the principles, instrumentation, and applications of SIM, highlighting its capabilities in achieving high spatiotemporal resolution. Two types of structured illumination mechanics are employed: (1) stripe-based SIM, where the illumination stripes are formed through interference or projection, with extended resolution achieved through Fourier-domain extension; (2) point-scanning based SIM, where illumination pattern are generated through projection of the focal point or focal array, with extended resolution achieved through photon reassignment. We discuss the evolution of SIM from mechanical to high-speed photoelectric devices, such as spatial light modulators, digital micromirror devices, galvanometers, etc., which significantly enhance imaging speed, resolution, and modulation flexibility. The review also explores SIM's applications in biological research, particularly in live-cell imaging and cellular interaction studies, providing insights into disease mechanisms and cellular functions. We conclude by outlining the future directions of SIM in life sciences. With the advancement of imaging techniques and reconstruction algorithms, SIM is poised to bring revolutionary impacts to frontier research fields, offering new avenues for exploring the intricacies of cellular biology.</description>

      <title>Many-body non-Hermitian skin effect with exact steady states in dissipative lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dissipative lattice gauge model that exhibits the many-body version of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The dissipative couplings between dynamical gauge fields on the lattice links and the surrounding environment generate chiral motions of particles residing on lattice sites. Although the system involves many-body interactions, the local gauge symmetries offer a flexible approach to exactly constructing the steady state that demonstrates the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.</description>

      <title>Rapid comprehensive characterization of biphoton spatial-polarization hyperentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement across more than one degree of freedom (DoF), is a valuable resource in photonic quantum information technology. However, the lack of efficient characterization schemes hinders its quantitative study and application potential. Here, we present a rapid quantitative characterization of spatial-polarization hyperentangled biphoton state produced from spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We first demonstrate rapid certification of the hyperentanglement dimensionality with a cumulative acquisition time of only 17 minutes. In particular, we verify transverse spatial entanglement through a violation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion with a minimum conditional uncertainty product of $(0.11\pm0.05)\hbar$ and certify the entanglement dimensionality to be at least 148. Next, by performing spatially-resolved polarization state tomography of the entire field, we demonstrate the generation of an entire class of near-maximally polarization-entangled states with an average concurrence of $0.8303\pm0.0004$. Together, the results reveal a total dimensionality of at least 251, which is the highest dimensionality reported for hyperentanglement. These measurements quantitatively resolve the influence of the spatial correlations of the down-converted photons and the angular spectrum of the pump beam on the polarization entanglement. Our study lays important groundwork for further exploiting the high dimensionality and cross-DoF correlations in hyperentangled states for future quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Co-existing topological and Volkov-Pankratov plasmonic edge states in magnetized graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene placed in a perpendicular magnetic field supports optical modes known as magnetoplasmons which are transversally confined to the graphene layer. Unlike ordinary graphene plasmons, these magnetoplasmonic surface waves are characterized by a band gap corresponding to the cyclotron frequency. In addition, these magnetoplasmon bands are topological, characterized by a non-zero Chern number. This leads to the existence of topologically protected edge states at domain edges where the Chern number changes. Since the Chern number is dependent on the direction of the magnetic field, edge states exist at domain edges across which the magnetic field flips direction. Physically, the magnetic field can only flip direction at gradual domain edges with finite width creating topological heterojunctions. These topological heterojunctions support extra edge states known as Volkov-Pankratov edge states which can enter the band gap and support propagation in both directions. The number of Volkov-Pankratov states at a heterojunction varies as a function of the width of the gradual domain edge.</description>

      <title>Towards experimental demonstration of quantum position verification using true single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geographical position can be a good credential for authentication of a party, this is the basis of position-based cryptography - but classically this cannot be done securely without physical exchange of a private key. However, recently, it has been shown that by combining quantum mechanics with the speed of light limit of special relativity, this might be possible: quantum position verification. Here we demonstrate experimentally a protocol that uses two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference at a beamsplitter, which, in combination with two additional beam splitters and 4 detectors is rendering the protocol resilient to loss. With this we are able to show first results towards an experimental demonstration of quantum position verification.</description>

      <title>General theory of slow non-Hermitian evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research, showcasing surprising behaviors that include apparent violation of the adiabatic theorem and chiral topological conversion related to encircling exceptional points (EPs). These have both fundamental interest and potential practical applications. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitian systems and resolve these contradictions. We prove an analog of the adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian systems and generalize it in the presence of uncontrolled environmental fluctuations (noise). The effect of noise turns out to be crucial due to inherent exponential instabilities present in non-Hermitian systems. Disproving common wisdom, the end state of the system is determined by the final Hamiltonian only, and is insensitive to other details of the evolution trajectory in parameter space. Our quantitative theory, leading to transparent physical intuition, is amenable to experimental tests. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system's evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations. Our approach may be useful for designing devices based on non-Hermitian physics and may stimulate analyses of classical and quantum non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as that of quantum Lindbladian and hybrid-Liouvillian systems.</description>

      <title>Electron hopping induced phonon pumping in opto-mechanical molecular nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01671</link>

Abstract: Plasmonic molecular nanojunctions exhibit opto-mechanical coupling at the nanoscale, enabling intertwined optical, vibrational and electronic phenomena. Here, we demonstrate plasmon-mediated phonon pumping, driven by inelastic electron hopping in conductive molecules, which results in strong Raman nonlinearity at the light intensities almost three orders of magnitude lower than in the conventional opto-mechanical systems and up to four-fold enhancement of the effective Raman polarizability due to vibrational electron-phonon coupling. We also developed a microscopic framework of opto-mechanical electron-phonon coupling in molecular nanojunctions based on the Marcus electron hopping. Systematically varying electrical conductance of the molecules in the junction and laser intensity, we observed the transition between a photo-assisted tunnelling regime and an electron hopping process. Our findings provide a microscopic description for vibrational, optical, and electronic phenomena in plasmonic nanocavities important for efficient phonon lasing, representing the first attempt to exploit conductive molecules as quantum-mechanical oscillators.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of ultra-smooth, high-aspect ratio, sub-10 nanometer nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministic and versatile approaches to sample preparation on nanoscopic scales are important in many fields including photonics, electronics, biology and material science. However, challenges exist in meeting many nanostructuring demands--particularly in emerging optical materials and component architectures. Here, we report a nanofabrication workflow that overcomes long-standing challenges in deterministic and top-down sample preparation procedures. The salient feature is a carbon mask with a low sputter yield that can be readily shaped using high resolution electron beam processing techniques. When combined with focused ion beam processing, the masking technique yields structures with ultra-smooth, near-vertical side walls. We target different material platforms to showcase the broad utility of the technique. As a first test case, we prepared nanometric gaps in evaporated Au. Gap widths of 7 plus/minus 2 nm, aspect ratios of 17, and line edge roughness values of 3sigma = 2.04 nm are achieved. Furthermore, the gap widths represent an order of magnitude improvement on system resolution limits. As a second test case, we designed and fabricated dielectric resonators in the ternary compounds MnPSe3 and NiPS3; a class of van der Waals material resistant to chemical etch approaches. Nanoantenna arrays with incrementally increasing diameter were fabricated in crystalline, exfoliated flakes. The optical response was measured by dark field spectroscopy and is in agreement with simulations. The workflow reported here leverages established techniques in material processing without the need for custom or specialized hardware. It is broadly applicable to functional materials and devices, and extends high speed focused ion beam milling to true sub-10 nm length scales.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of Lugiato-Lefever equation for Kerr combs generation in Fabry-Perot resonators</title>

Abstract: Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with damping, detuning and driving terms, introduced as a model for Kerr combs generation in ring-shape resonators and more recently, in the form of a variant, in Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators. The aim of this paper is to present some numerical methods that complement each other to solve the LLE in its general form both in the dynamic and in the steady state regimes. We also provide some mathematical properties of the LLE likely to help the understanding and interpretation of the numerical simulation results.</description>

      <title>Broadband biphoton source for quantum optical coherence tomography based on a Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broadband correlated photon pairs (biphotons) are valuable in quantum metrology, but current generation methods either involve complex nonlinear structures or lack sufficient bandwidth and brightness. In this work, we theoretically describe and experimentally demonstrate a novel technique for generation of a bright collinear biphoton field with a broad spectrum, achieved by using a tightly focused pump in a bulk nonlinear crystal. As the most straightforward application of the source, we employ Michelson interferometer-based quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT). Utilizing the source enables the demonstration of record resolution and dispersion cancellation for this QOCT scheme.</description>

      <title>Deterministic photonic entanglement arising from non-Abelian quantum holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing deterministic, high-fidelity entangling interactions--of the kind that can be utilized for efficient quantum information processing--between photons remains an elusive goal. Here, we address this long-standing issue by devising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled superpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic system that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian quantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled superpositions are maximally-entangled, "volume-law" states, and that the underlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in quantum science. Crucially, we generalize this approach to demonstrate the potentiality of deterministically entangling two arbitrarily high, $N$-dimensional quantum systems, by formally establishing a deep connection between the matrix representations of the unitary quantum holonomy--within energy-degenerate subspaces in which the total excitation number is conserved--and the $\left(2j+1\right)$-dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation operator, where $j = \left(N-1\right)/2$ and $N \geq 2$. Specifically, our protocol deterministically entangles spatially localized modes that are not only distinguishable but are also individually accessible and amenable to state preparation and measurement, and therefore, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could be utilized for deterministic quantum information processing with light.</description>

      <title>Polarization entanglement and qubit error rate dependence on the exciton-phonon coupling in self-assembled quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization entangled photons are the key ingredients of various protocols in quantum computation and quantum key distribution. In particular, for key distributions, a near-unity degree of polarization entanglement is one of the requirements for minimizing the qubit error rates. In this work, we theoretically investigate the polarization entangled photon pairs emitted by a quantum-dot radiative cascade embedded in a micropillar cavity. We develop a polaron master equation theory for incorporating the unavoidable exciton-phonon coupling and investigate the role of phonon-mediated processes and phonon-bath temperature on the degree of entanglement. We show that the phonon-coupling introduces the one-photon and two-photon incoherent processes, as well as the cross-coupling between the two exciton states. It is shown that the phonon-mediated coupling along with the ac-Stark shift and multiphoton emission significantly degrade the entanglement at higher temperatures. Finally, we consider a BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol to investigate the qubit error rate for the given degree of entanglement.</description>
