      <title>On the intersection theory of moduli spaces of parabolic bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the intersection numbers of tautological classes on moduli spaces of parabolic bundles on a smooth projective curve. We show that such intersection numbers are completely determined by wall-crossing formulas, Hecke isomorphisms, and flag bundle structures and resulting Weyl symmetry. As applications of these ideas, we prove the Newstead--Earl--Kirwan vanishing -- and a natural strengthening in terms of Chern filtrations -- and the Virasoro constraints for parabolic bundles. Both of these results were already known for moduli of stable bundles without parabolic structure, but even in those cases our proofs are new and independent of the existing ones. We use a Joyce style vertex algebra formulation of wall-crossing, and define intersection numbers even in the presence of strictly semistable parabolic bundles; all of our results hold in that setting as well.</description>

      <title>Tools for analyzing the intersection curve between a torus and a quadric through projection and lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces efficient and user-friendly tools for analyzing the intersection curve between a ringed torus and an irreducible quadric surface. Without loose of generality, it is assumed that the torus is centered at the origin, and its axis of revolution coincides with the $z$-axis. The paper primarily focuses on examining the curve's projection onto the plane $z=0$, referred to as the cutcurve, which is essential for ensuring accurate lifting procedures. Additionally, we provide a detailed characterization of the singularities in both the projection and the intersection curve, as well as the existence of double tangents. A key tool for the analysis is the theory of resultant and subresultant polynomials.</description>

      <title>Introduction to $PSL_2$ phase tropicalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usual approach to tropical geometry is via degeneration of amoebas of algebraic subvarieties of an algebraic torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$. An amoeba is logarithmic projection of the variety forgetting the angular part of coordinates, called the phase. Similar degeneration can be performed without ignoring the phase. The limit then is called phase tropical variety, and it is a powerful tool in numerous areas. In the article is described a non-commutative version of phase tropicalization in the simplest case of the matrix group $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$, replacing here $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ in the classical approach.</description>

      <title>Refined algebraic domains with finite sets in the boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refined algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by finitely many non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossing. We are interested in shapes of such regions with surrounding real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs the regions naturally collapse to respecting the projection to a straight line. Such graphs were first formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020, and regions surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves were mainly considered. The author has generalized the studies to several general situations.
  We find classes of such objects defined inductively by adding curves. We respect characteristic finite sets in the curves. We consider regions surrounded by the curves and of a new type. We investigate geometric properties and combinatorial ones of them and discuss important examples. We also previously studied explicit classes defined inductively in this way and review them.</description>

      <title>Tate's question, Standard conjecture D, semisimplicity and Dynamical degree comparison conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ over the algebraic closure of a finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$.
  Assuming the standard conjecture $D$, we prove
  a weaker form of the Dynamical Degree Comparison conjecture;
  equivalence of semisimplicity of Frobenius endomorphism and of any polarized endomorphism (a more general result, in terms of the biggest size of Jordan blocks, holds).
  We illustrate these results through examples, including varieties dominated by rational maps from Abelian varieties and suitable products of $K3$ surfaces.
  Using the same idea, we provide a new proof of the main result in a recent paper by the third author, including Tate's question/Serre's conjecture that for a polarized endomorphism $f:X\rightarrow X$, all eigenvalues of the action of $f$ on $H^k(X)$ have the same absolute value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish two main results in the context of arithmetic and geometric properties of plane curves. First, we construct numerous new examples of arithmetic Zariski pairs and multiplets, where only a few ones were previously available. Second, we describe a faithful action of the absolute Galois group on the equisingular strata of plane curves, providing insights into the interplay between Galois representations and the geometry of singular plane curves. We conclude the paper with very concretes examples of the general results obtained.</description>

      <title>RCD structures on singular Kahler spaces of complex dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let X be a projective variety of complex dimension 3 with log terminal singularities. We prove that every singular Kahler metric on X with bounded Nash entropy and Ricci curvature bounded below induces a compact RCD space homeomorphic to the projective variety X itself. In particular, singular Kahler-Einstein spaces of complex dimension 3 with bounded Nash entropy are compact RCD spaces topologically and holomorphically equivalent to the underlying projective variety. Various compactness theorems are also obtained for 3-dimensional projective varieties with bounded Ricci curvature. Such results establish connections among algebraic, geometric and analytic structures of klt singularities from birational geometry and provide abundant examples of RCD spaces from algebraic geometry via complex Monge-Ampere equations.</description>

Abstract: We study endomorphism rings of principally polarized abelian surfaces over finite fields from a computational viewpoint with a focus on exhaustiveness. In particular, we address the cases of non-ordinary and non-simple varieties. For each possible surface type, we survey known results and, whenever possible, provide improvements and missing results.</description>

      <title>Real algebraic surfaces biholomorphically equivalent but not algebraically equivalent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We answer in the negative the long-standing open question of whether biholomorphic equivalence implies algebraic equivalence for germs of real algebraic manifolds in $\mathbb C^n$. More precisely we give an example of two germs of real algebraic surfaces in $\mathbb C^2$ that are biholomorphic, but not via an algebraic biholomorphism. In fact we even prove that the components of any biholomorphism between these two surfaces are never solutions of polynomial differential equations. The proof is based on enumerative combinatorics and differential Galois Theory results concerning the nature of the generating series of walks restricted to the quarter plane.</description>

      <title>Open Hurwitz Flat F manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive Open WDVV equations starting from any Hurwitz Dubrovin Frobenius manifold. The WDVV equations play a crucial role in the structure of Frobenius manifolds, quantum cohomology, and integrable systems. Extending these ideas, Open WDVV equations provide a framework to incorporate boundary conditions, making them fundamental in Open Gromov-Witten theory. Using Dubrovin's construction of Landau Ginzburg superpotentials associated with Hurwitz spaces, we demonstrate that their primitives satisfy Open WDVV equations. Our approach provides an efficient method for computing Open WDVV equations associated with any Hurwitz Dubrovin Frobenius manifold.</description>

Abstract: We study stratifications of regions in the space of symmetric matrices. Their points are Mandelstam matrices for momentum vectors in particle physics. Kinematic strata in these regions are indexed by signs and rank two matroids. Matroid strata of Lorentzian quadratic forms arise when all signs are non-negative. We characterize the posets of strata, for massless and massive particles, with and without momentum conservation.</description>

Abstract: We examine the problem of the linearity of an algebraic torus action in the associative setting. We prove the free algebra analog of a classical theorem of BialynickiBirula, which establishes linearity of maximal torus action. Additionally, we formulate and prove linearity theorems for specific classes of regular actions, and provide a framework for constructing non-linearizable actions, analogous to the work of Asanuma. This framework has applications in the study of the Associative Cancellation Conjecture. Furthermore, we show the existence of two non-isomorphic algebras, whose free products with a polynomial ring are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Multiple typical ranks in matrix completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.09777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank matrix completion addresses the problem of completing a matrix from a certain set of generic specified entries. Over the complex numbers a matrix with a given entry pattern can be uniquely completed to a specific rank, called the generic completion rank. Completions over the reals may generically have multiple completion ranks, called typical ranks. We demonstrate techniques for proving that many sets of specified entries have only one typical rank, and show other families with two typical ranks, specifically focusing on entry sets represented by circulant graphs. This generalizes the results of Bernstein, Blekherman, and Sinn. In particular, we provide a complete characterization of the set of unspecified entries of an $n\times n$ matrix such that $n-1$ is a typical rank and fully determine the typical ranks for entry set $G(n,1)$ for $n&lt;9$. Moreover, we study the asymptotic behaviour of typical ranks and present results regarding unique matrix completions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove motivic versions of the Langlands-Shelstad Fundamental Lemma and Ng\^o's Geometric Stabilization. To achieve this, we follow the strategy from the recent proof by Groechenig, Wyss and Ziegler which avoided the use of perverse sheaves using instead $p$-adic integration and Tate duality. We make a key use of a construction of Denef and Loeser which assigns a virtual motive to any definable set in the theory of pseudo-finite fields.</description>

Abstract: The Hessian map is the rational map that sends a homogeneous polynomial to the determinant of its Hessian matrix. We prove that the Hessian map is birational on its image for ternary forms of degree $d\ge 4$, $d\neq 5$, by considering the action of the orthogonal group. In a previous paper we proved the analogous result for binary forms, with more geometric techniques.</description>

      <title>Adjoints, wrapping, and morphisms at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a localization of a smooth proper category along a subcategory preserved by the Serre functor, we show that morphisms in Efimov's algebraizable categorical formal punctured neighborhood of infinity can be computed using the natural cone between right and left adjoints of the localization functor. In particular, this recovers the following result of Ganatra--Gao--Venkatesh: morphisms in categorical formal punctured neighborhoods of wrapped Fukaya categories are computed by Rabinowitz wrapping.</description>

      <title>Consistent Dimer Models on Surfaces with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dimer model is a quiver with faces embedded in a surface. We define and investigate notions of consistency for dimer models on general surfaces with boundary which restrict to well-studied consistency conditions in the disk and torus case. We define weak consistency in terms of the associated dimer algebra and show that it is equivalent to the absence of bad configurations on the strand diagram. In the disk and torus case, weakly consistent models are nondegenerate, meaning that every arrow is contained in a perfect matching; this is not true for general surfaces. Strong consistency is defined to require weak consistency as well as nondegeneracy. We prove that the completed as well as the noncompleted dimer algebra of a strongly consistent dimer model are bimodule internally 3-Calabi-Yau with respect to their boundary idempotents. As a consequence, the Gorenstein-projective module category of the completed boundary algebra of suitable dimer models categorifies the cluster algebra given by their underlying quiver. We provide additional consequences of weak and strong consistency, including that one may reduce a strongly consistent dimer model by removing digons and that consistency behaves well under taking dimer submodels.</description>

      <title>$h$-function, Hilbert-Kunz density function and Frobenius-Poincar\'e function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given ideals $I,J$ of a noetherian local ring $(R, \mathfrak m)$ such that $I+J$ is $\mathfrak m$-primary and a finitely generated $R$-module $M$, we associate an invariant of $(M,R,I,J)$ called the $h$-function. Our results on $h$-functions allow extensions of the theories of Frobenius-Poincar\'e functions and Hilbert-Kunz density functions from the known graded case to the local case, answering a question of V.Trivedi. When $J$ is $\mathfrak m$-primary, we describe the support of the corresponding density function in terms of other invariants of $(R, I,J)$. We show that the support captures the $F$-threshold: $c^J(I)$, under mild assumptions, extending results of V. Trivedi and Watanabe. The $h$-function encodes Hilbert-Samuel, Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity and $F$-threshold of the ideal pair involved. Using this feature of $h$-functions, we provide an equivalent formulation of a conjecture of Huneke, Musta\c{t}\u{a}, Takagi, Watanabe; recover a result of Smirnov and Betancourt; give a new proof of a result answering Watanabe-Yoshida's question comparing Hilbert-Kunz and Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity and establish lower bounds on $F$-thresholds. We also point out that a conjecture of Smirnov-Betancourt as stated is false and suggest a correction which we relate to the conjecture of Huneke et al.
  We develop the theory of $h$-functions in a more general setting which yields a density function for $F$-signature. A key to many results on $h$-functions is a `convexity technique' that we introduce, which in particular proves differentiability of Hilbert-Kunz density functions almost everywhere on $(0,\infty)$, thus contributing to another question of Trivedi.</description>

      <title>Non-existence of Ulrich modules over Cohen-Macaulay local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over a Cohen-Macaulay local ring, the minimal number of generators of a maximal Cohen-Macaulay module is bounded above by its multiplicity. In 1984 Ulrich asked whether there always exist modules for which equality holds; such modules are known nowadays as Ulrich modules. We answer this question in the negative by constructing families of two dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local rings that have no Ulrich modules. Some of these examples are Gorenstein normal domains; others are even complete intersection domains, though not normal.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Approximations to Ricci-flat Metrics Via Extrinsic Symmetries of Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ever since Yau's non-constructive existence proof of Ricci-flat metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds, finding their explicit construction remains a major obstacle to development of both string theory and algebraic geometry. Recent computational approaches employ machine learning to create novel neural representations for approximating these metrics, offering high accuracy but limited interpretability. In this paper, we analyse machine learning approximations to flat metrics of Fermat Calabi-Yau n-folds and some of their one-parameter deformations in three dimensions in order to discover their new properties. We formalise cases in which the flat metric has more symmetries than the underlying manifold, and prove that these symmetries imply that the flat metric admits a surprisingly compact representation for certain choices of complex structure moduli. We show that such symmetries uniquely determine the flat metric on certain loci, for which we present an analytic form. We also incorporate our theoretical results into neural networks to reduce Ricci curvature for multiple Calabi--Yau manifolds compared to previous machine learning approaches. We conclude by distilling the ML models to obtain for the first time closed form expressions for Kahler metrics with near-zero scalar curvature.</description>
