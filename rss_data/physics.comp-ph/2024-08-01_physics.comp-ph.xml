      <title>Advanced Techniques for High-Performance Fock Matrix Construction on GPU Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Article presents two optimized multi-GPU algorithms for Fock matrix construction, building on the work of Ufimtsev et al. and Barca et al. The novel algorithms, opt-UM and opt-Brc, introduce significant enhancements, including improved integral screening, exploitation of sparsity and symmetry, a linear scaling exchange matrix assembly algorithm, and extended capabilities for Hartree-Fock caculations up to $f$-type angular momentum functions. Opt-Brc excels for smaller systems and for highly contracted triple-$\zeta$ basis sets, while opt-UM is advantageous for large molecular systems. Performance benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs show that our algorithms in the EXtreme-scale Electronic Structure System (EXESS), when combined, outperform all current GPU and CPU Fock build implementations in TeraChem, QUICK, GPU4PySCF, LibIntX, ORCA, and Q-Chem. The implementations were benchmarked on linear and globular systems and average speed ups across three double-$\zeta$ basis sets of 1.5$\times$, 5.2$\times$, and 8.5$\times$ were observed compared to TeraChem, GPU4PySCF, and QUICK respectively. Strong scaling analysis reveals over 91% parallel efficiency on four GPUs for opt-Brc, making it typically faster for multi-GPU execution. Single-compute-node comparisons with CPU-based software like ORCA and Q-Chem show speedups of up to 42$\times$ and 31$\times$, respectively, enhancing power efficiency by up to 18$\times$.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm for Electromagnetic Scattering by Large Metasurfaces using a Static Mode Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, comprising large arrays of interacting subwavelength scatterers, pose significant challenges for general-purpose computational methods due to their large electric dimensions and multiscale nature. This paper introduces an efficient boundary element method specifically tailored for metasurfaces, leveraging the Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) formulation. Our method combines the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) with a representation of surface current density unknowns using static modes, a set of entire domain basis functions dependent only on object shape. The reduction in the number of unknowns by the static mode expansion (SME), combined with the \(\mathcal{O}(N \log N)\) complexity of MLFMA matrix-vector products, significantly reduces CPU time and memory requirements for solving scattering problems from metasurfaces compared to classical MLFMA with RWG basis functions. The MLFMA-SME method offers substantial benefits for the analysis and optimization of metalenses and metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Diffusion in Magnesium Using Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and accurately predicting hydrogen diffusion in materials is challenging due to the complex interactions between hydrogen defects and the crystal lattice. These interactions span large length and time scales, making them difficult to address with standard ab initio techniques. This work addresses this challenge by employing accelerated machine learning (ML) molecular dynamics simulations through active learning. We conduct a comparative study of different ML-based interatomic potential schemes, including VASP, MACE, and CHGNet, utilizing various training strategies such as on-the-fly learning, pre-trained universal models, and fine-tuning. We obtain an optimal hydrogen diffusion coefficient value of \(2.1 \cdot 10^{-8}\) m\(^2\)/s at 673 K in MgH\(_{0.06}\), which aligns exceptionally well with experimental results, underlining the efficacy and accuracy of ML-assisted methodologies in the context of diffusive dynamics. Particularly, our procedure significantly reduces the computational effort associated with traditional transition state calculations or ad-hoc designed interatomic potentials. The results highlight the limitations of pre-trained universal solutions for defective materials and how they can be improved by fine-tuning. Specifically, fine-tuning the models on a database produced during on-the-fly training of VASP ML force field allows the retrieving of DFT-level accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Emergent phases in bent-core patchy colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional behavior of colloidal patchy ellipsoids specifically designed to follow a two-step assembly process from the monomer state to mesoscopic liquid-crystal phases, via the formation of so-called bent-core units at the intermediate stage. Our model comprises a binary mixture of ellipses interacting via the Gay-Berne potential and decorated by surface patches, with the binary components being mirror-image variants of each other - referred to as left-handed and right-handed ellipses according to the position of their patches. The surface patches are designed so as in the first stage of the assembly the monomers form bent-cores units, i.e. V-shaped dimers with a specific bent angle. The Gay-Berne interactions, which act between the ellipses, drive the dimers to subsequently form the characteristic phase observed in bent-core liquid crystals. We numerically investigate -- by means of both Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations -- the described two-step process: we first optimize a target bent-core unit and we then fully characterize its state diagram in temperature and density, defining the regions where the different liquid crystalline phases dominate.</description>

      <title>Describe, Transform, Machine Learning: Feature Engineering for Grain Boundaries and Other Variable-Sized Atom Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining microscopic structure-property relationships for grain boundaries are challenging because of the complex atomic structures that underlie their behavior. This has led to recent efforts to obtain these relationships with machine learning, but representing a grain boundary structure in a manner suitable for machine learning is not a trivial task. There are three key steps common to property prediction in grain boundaries and other variable-sized atom clustered structures. These are: (1) describe the atomic structure as a feature matrix, (2) transform the variable-sized feature matrices of different structures to a fixed length common to all structures, and (3) apply machine learning to predict properties from the transformed feature matrices. We examine these feature engineering steps to understand how they impact the accuracy of grain boundary energy predictions. A database of over 7000 grain boundaries serves to evaluate the different feature engineering combinations. We also examine how these combination of engineered features provide interpretability, or the ability to extract insightful physics from the obtained structure-property relationships.</description>

      <title>A symmetry-oriented crystal structure prediction method for crystals with rigid bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed an efficient crystal structure prediction (CSP) method for desired chemical compositions, specifically suited for compounds featuring recurring molecules or rigid bodies. We applied this method to two metal chalcogenides: $\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ and $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$, treating $\text{PS}_4$ as a tetrahedral rigid body and $\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ as an ethane-like dimer rigid body. Initial trials not only identified the experimentally observed structures of these compounds but also uncovered several novel phases, including a new stannite-type $\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ structure and a potential metastable structure for $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ that exhibits significantly lower energy than the observed phase, as evaluated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We compared our results with those obtained using USPEX, a popular CSP package leveraging genetic algorithms. Both methods predicted the same lowest energy structures in both compounds. However, our method demonstrated better performance in predicting metastable structures. The method is implemented with Python code which is available at https://github.com/ColdSnaap/sgrcsp.git.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of structural, elastic, electronic, phonon, thermal and optical properties of two $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ phases from first principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for new alkali metal chalcogenide materials is continuously increasing due to their potential applications across various technological fields. Recently, a new compound, $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$, was computationally predicted, representing a new phase distinct from the experimentally observed $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ reported in 1985. Notably, this newly predicted phase displays a lower total energy compared to the previously known experimental phase, as determined by first-principles calculations. In this study, we undertake a thorough comparative analysis of the structural, elastic, electronic, phonon, thermal, and optical properties of these two $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ phases. Our results show that both phases meet mechanical and dynamical stability criteria. The electronic band structure analysis confirms the semiconducting nature of both materials, with a 2.97 eV indirect band gap for the predicted phase and a 2.93 eV direct band gap for the observed phase. Optically, both phases exhibit strong absorption in the ultraviolet region. Thermal properties analysis reveals that the predicted phase is more thermodynamically stable below 907 K, while the observed phase shows greater thermodynamic stability above this temperature.</description>

      <title>Higher order quantum reservoir computing for non-intrusive reduced-order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting dynamical systems is of importance to numerous real-world applications. When possible, dynamical systems forecasts are constructed based on first-principles-based models such as through the use of differential equations. When these equations are unknown, non-intrusive techniques must be utilized to build predictive models from data alone. Machine learning (ML) methods have recently been used for such tasks. Moreover, ML methods provide the added advantage of significant reductions in time-to-solution for predictions in contrast with first-principle based models. However, many state-of-the-art ML-based methods for forecasting rely on neural networks, which may be expensive to train and necessitate requirements for large amounts of memory. In this work, we propose a quantum mechanics inspired ML modeling strategy for learning nonlinear dynamical systems that provides data-driven forecasts for complex dynamical systems with reduced training time and memory costs. This approach, denoted the quantum reservoir computing technique (QRC), is a hybrid quantum-classical framework employing an ensemble of interconnected small quantum systems via classical linear feedback connections. By mapping the dynamical state to a suitable quantum representation amenable to unitary operations, QRC is able to predict complex nonlinear dynamical systems in a stable and accurate manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework through benchmark forecasts of the NOAA Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature dataset and compare the performance of QRC to other ML methods.</description>

      <title>Unlocking massively parallel spectral proper orthogonal decompositions in the PySPOD package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a parallel (distributed) version of the spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) technique. The parallel SPOD algorithm distributes the spatial dimension of the dataset preserving time. This approach is adopted to preserve the non-distributed fast Fourier transform of the data in time, thereby avoiding the associated bottlenecks. The parallel SPOD algorithm is implemented in the PySPOD (https://github.com/MathEXLab/PySPOD) library and makes use of the standard message passing interface (MPI) library, implemented in Python via mpi4py (https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). An extensive performance evaluation of the parallel package is provided, including strong and weak scalability analyses. The open-source library allows the analysis of large datasets of interest across the scientific community. Here, we present applications in fluid dynamics and geophysics, that are extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve without a parallel algorithm. This work opens the path toward modal analyses of big quasi-stationary data, helping to uncover new unexplored spatio-temporal patterns.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Boltzmann Equation for Complex Systems of Neutral Gases across All Flow Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Multi-scale Boltzmann Equation (MBE) is found from the gas-kinetic theory and the direct modeling philosophy as a master equation for complex physical systems of neutral gases across all flow regimes, which locates between the continuum limit and the free-molecular limit, covering a vast range of applications such as hypersonic flows over aerospace crafts and delicate flows around MEMS. The most explicit characteristic of MBE is evolving the variable observation time in the expression, which distinguishes the MBE from the single-scale master or governing equation where a fixed scale is implied in the assumptions. The fundamental properties of MBE, such as the asymptotic property, are proved theoretically, while a concise numerical scheme is developed for MBE to demonstrate its validity by benchmark multi-scale problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of electromagnetic penetration is an important topic in computational electromagnetics. Electromagnetic penetration occurs through intentional or inadvertent openings in an enclosed electromagnetic scatterer, which prevent the contents from being fully shielded from external fields. To efficiently model electromagnetic penetration, aperture or slot models can be used with surface integral equations to solve Maxwell's equations. A necessary step towards establishing the credibility of these models is to assess the correctness of the implementation of the underlying numerical methods through code verification. Surface integral equations and slot models yield multiple interacting sources of numerical error and other challenges, which render traditional code-verification approaches ineffective. In this paper, we provide approaches to separately measure the numerical errors arising from these different error sources for the method-of-moments implementation of the electric-field integral equation with a slot model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches for a variety of cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a software package libEMMI\_MGFD for 3D frequency-domain marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) modelling and inversion. It is the first open-source C program tailored for geometrical multigrid (GMG) CSEM simulation. An volumetric anisotropic averaging scheme has been employed to compute effective medium for modelling over uniform and nonuniform grid. The computing coordinate is aligned with acquisition geometry by rotation with the azimuth and dip angles, facilitating the injection of the source and the extraction of data with arbitrary orientations. Efficient nonlinear optimization is achieved using quasi-Newton scheme assisted with bisection backtracking line search. In constructing the modularized Maxwell solver and evaluating the misfit and gradient for 3D CSEM inversion, the reverse communication technique is the key to the compaction of the software while maintaining the computational performance. A number of numeric tests demonstrate the efficiency of the modelling while preserving the solution accuracy. A 3D marine CSEM inversion example has been examined for resistivity imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11694v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of General Noise Model Parameters from Surface Code's Syndrome Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active research on the surface code shows that its decoding performance can be significantly enhanced by utilizing the information of the noise model and optimizing the grid shape and decoding algorithm. Usually, the parameters in the noise model for the quantum error correction code must be prepared separately using some method, such as the quantum process tomography. There is a strong need to perform noise model estimation in parallel with the syndrome measurement during decoding to avoid the demanding prior tomography procedure. While noise model estimation based on syndrome measurement statistics is well-explored for Pauli noise, it remains under-studied for more complex noise models like amplitude damping. In this paper, we propose general noise model Bayesian inference methods that integrate the surface code's tensor network simulator, which can efficiently simulate various noise models, with Monte Carlo sampling techniques. For stationary noise, where the noise parameters are constant and do not change, we propose a method based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. For time-varying noise, which is a more realistic situation, we introduce another method based on the sequential Monte Carlo. We present the numerical results of applying the proposed methods to various noise models, such as static, time-varying, and non-uniform cases, and evaluate their performance in detail.</description>
