      <title>Uniform Bounds for Digit-Appending Fibonacci Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the work of Miller et al. [Fibonacci Quarterly, 2022], we show that it is impossible to "walk to infinity" along the Fibonacci sequence in any integer base $b\geq 2$ when at most $N$ digits are appended per step. Our proof method is base-independent, yielding the bound \[L \;\leq\; 2N\log_\varphi b \,+\, O(1),\] uniformly in the starting term, without relying on base-specific periodicity computations (here, $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$). Our approach extends to certain Lucas sequences.</description>

      <title>On Jacobi sums arising from the classical doubling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notion of a non-abelian Jacobi sum $\mathcal{J}^{\mathrm{dbl}}\left(\pi, \chi\right)$ attached to an irreducible representation $\pi$ of a general linear group or a classical group over a finite field and a character $\chi$ of the multiplicative group of the finite field or its quadratic extension. These sums emerge in the study of the doubling method of Piatetski-Shapiro--Rallis and Lapid--Rallis. For general linear groups, we express these non-abelian Jacobi sums in terms of Kondo's non-abelian Gauss sums. For classical groups and for characters that are not conjugate-dual, we give an explicit formula for these non-abelian Jacobi sums in terms of Gauss sums attached to the Deligne--Lusztig data of the representation, and we prove that these Jacobi sums are constant on geometric Lusztig series. Our results rely on a multiplicativity result of non-abelian Jacobi sums obtained by Girsch--Zelingher.</description>

      <title>Some explicit values of a $q$-multiple zeta function whose denominator power is not uniform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the generalizations of multiple zeta values is the $q$-version, and in the case of finite sums, they may be expressed explicitly in polynomial form. Several results have been found when the powers of the factors in the denominator are equal and when they are small. In this paper, we give explicit formulas for the case when the powers are unequal and are small.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of the Cartesian product of exact approximation set in $\beta$-expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the metrical theory of Cartesian products of exact approximation sets in $\beta$-expansions. More precisely, for an integer $d \ge 2$ and real numbers $\beta_i &gt; 1$ $(1 \le i \le d)$, we consider the set of points $x_i \in [0,1)$ is approximable by its convergents in the $\beta_i$-expansion to order $\psi_i$, but not to any better order. For any non-increasing functions $\psi_i$, we determine the Hausdorff dimension of the Cartesian product of these sets.</description>

      <title>Continued fraction expansions of complex numbers, Lagrange's theorem, and badly approximable numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns extension of the classical Lagrange theorem, on the eventual periodicity of continued fraction expansions of quadratic surds, and the versions of it found in the literature in the case of complex numbers. In this respect, firstly, we adopt a more general notion of continued fraction expansions, in place of those arising from the nearest integer algorithms. Secondly, the issue is formulated in terms of zeros of quadratic and Hermitian forms, and a result is proved in terms of certain sequences of matrices associated with them, via continued fraction expansions. The result may be considered as a matrix analogue of Lagrange's theorem in the general framework. The unified approach leads to generalizations of the Lagrange theorem on one hand, and an extended version of a result of Hines (2019) on badly approximable complex numbers, on the other hand.</description>

      <title>Rational points in Cantor sets in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field and let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be the ring of algebraic integers of $K$. For $\alpha \in \mathcal{O}_K$ with $|\alpha| &gt; 1$, define \[ \mathcal{D}_\alpha = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\mathcal{O}_K}{\alpha^n}. \] For $\beta \in \mathcal{O}_K$ with $|\beta|&gt;1$ and a finite subset $A \subset \mathcal{O}_K$, define \[ S_{\beta,A} = \bigg\{ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_k}{\beta^k}: \; a_k \in A \;\forall k \in \mathbb{N} \bigg\}. \] Suppose that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are relatively prime. In this paper, we show that if $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} S_{\beta,A} &lt; 1$, then the intersection $\mathcal{D}_\alpha \cap S_{\beta,A}$ is a finite set. In general, the threshold for the Hausdorff dimension of $S_{\beta,A}$ is sharp. If we further assume that $\mathcal{O}_K$ is a unique factorization domain and that $\overline{\alpha}$ and $\alpha$ are relatively prime, then we establish the finiteness of the intersection under the weaker condition $\dim_{\mathrm{H}} S_{\beta,A} &lt; 2$. This extends the previously known results on the real line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a problem proposed by Mahler, we will address the following related question, `How well can irrationals in a missing digit set be approximated by rationals with polynomial denominators?' and prove some related results. To achieve this, we will be closely looking at Khintchine's theorem, particularly the convergence case and aim to prove a Khintchine-like convergence theorem for missing digit sets with large bases and rationals with polynomial denominators.</description>

      <title>Multiple Mertens theorems for arithmetic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish asymptotic formulas for sums of reciprocals of primes in arithmetic progressions, generalizing recent results on multiple Mertens evaluations by Tenenbaum, Qi, and Hu. Specifically, for any fixed constant $K&gt;0$, we derive asymptotic expansions for the sums $
\sum_{\substack{p_1\cdots p_n\leq x \\ p_i\equiv h_i \pmod{m_i} \\ i=1,\dots, n}}\frac{1}{p_1\cdots p_n} $
and the corresponding log-weighted sums. A key feature of our results is that the error terms hold \emph{uniformly} for moduli satisfying $m_i \le (\log x)^K$, a range accessible via the Siegel-Walfisz theorem. Furthermore, we identify the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion with the Taylor series of the reciprocal Gamma function, $1/\Gamma(z)$, providing a structural explanation for the lower-order terms.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Geometric Polynomials via Geometric Polynomials and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to show that harmonic geometric polynomials can be represented in terms of geometric polynomials. This problem was first considered by Keller [14]; however, the corresponding coefficients were not fully determined. In the present work, we provide several explicit representations of harmonic geometric polynomials in terms of geometric polynomials. Moreover, several applications of one of these representations are subsequently developed. In particular, we obtain a generalization of the classical identity for the harmonic numbers, compute an integral involving harmonic geometric polynomials and an integral involving products of harmonic geometric and geometric polynomials in terms of Bernoulli numbers. These integral formulas lead to new explicit expressions for Bernoulli numbers. In addition, we give several recurrence relations for harmonic geometric polynomials and evaluate a finite sum involving harmonic numbers and positive powers of integers.</description>

      <title>On the number of $k$-full integers between three successive $k$th powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k\geq2$ be an integer. The aim of this paper is to investigate the distribution of $k$-full integers in consecutive intervals determined by three successive $k$th powers. More precisely, for any integers $\ell,m\ge0$, we establish the explicit asymptotic density for the set of integers $n$ such that the intervals $(n^k, (n+1)^k)$ and $((n+1)^k, (n+2)^k)$ contain exactly $\ell$ and $m$ $k$-full integers, respectively. As an application, we prove that there are infinitely many integers $n$ for which the interval $(n^k,(n+2)^k)$ contains no $k$-full integer other than the central $k$th power $(n+1)^k$, thereby providing a more general answer to Shiu's question.</description>

      <title>Homological Methods in the Generalization of Drinfeld Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a natural class of Anderson t- modules, called triangular t-modules, characterized by having Drinfeld modules as their $\tau$-composition factors. They form a homologically meaningful generalization of Drinfeld modules and exhibit rich arithmetic structure.\smallskip
  We establish criteria for purity, strict and almost strict, and develop a reduction procedure that lowers the degrees of the defining biderivations. As a consequence, every almost strictly pure triangular t-module becomes strictly pure after a finite base extension.
  We then investigate morphisms and isogenies between triangular t-modules, provide a characterization of triangular isogenies, and describe the algebra of endomorphisms, including a criterion for commutativity. On the analytic side, we show that all triangular t- modules are uniformizable and establish finiteness and purity criteria with consequences for Taelman's conjecture.
  Finally, we develop a duality theory for triangular t- modules and their biderivations, proving compatibility with $\tau$-composition series and establishing analogues of the Cartier-Nishi theorem and the Weil-Barsotti formula.</description>

Abstract: We initiate a general quantitative study of sets of $\mathcal{M}$-points, which are special subsets of rational points, generalizing Campana points, Darmon points, and squarefree solutions of Diophantine equations. We propose an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on rationally connected varieties, extending Manin's conjecture as well as its generalization to Campana points by Pieropan, Smeets, Tanimoto and V\'arilly-Alvarado. Finally, we show that the conjecture explains several previously established results in arithmetic statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative version of Zhang's fundamental inequality for heights attached to polarizable endomorphisms. As an application, we obtain a gap principle for the N\'eron-Tate height on abelian varieties over function fields of arbitrary transcendence degree and characteristic zero, extending the result of Gao-Ge-K\"uhne. We also establish instances of effective gap principles for regular polynomial endomorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^2$, in the sense that all constants can are explicit. These yield effective instances of uniformity in the dynamical Bogomolov conjecture in both the arithmetic and geometric settings, including examples in prime characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a class of $\mathbb{R}^d$-ations and $\mathbb{Z}^d$-actions on the $n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^n$, we characterize their unique ergodicity and establish a theorem of Weyl type. This result allows us to establish an isomorphism between the Banach algebra of quasi-periodic functions with spectrum in a given $\mathbb{Z}$-module and the Banach algebra of periodic functions on a torus. This, in return, allows us to give a very simple proof of Hausdorff-Young inequalities for Besicovitch almost periodic functions. The regularity of the parent function of a quasi-periodic function is also studied.</description>

      <title>Regular Functions on Formal-Analytic Arithmetic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove for a broad class of pseudo convex formal-analytic arithmetic surfaces, those which admit a nonconstant monic such regular function, a conjecture of Bost-Charles that the ring of regular functions has continuum cardinality. A key feature of the proof is a new formula for the pushforward of the equilibrium Green's functions for our bordered Riemann surface with boundary by a holomorphic function, a formula which has constant term related to Arakelov degree. A Fekete-Sz\"ego-type approximation argument then produces a polynomial "large" relative to the regular function, which in turn yields continuum many distinct regular functions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of multiplicative groups over fields and Folner-Kloosterman sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For two countably infinite fields whose multiplicative groups are isomorphic, we examine invariant couplings between the actions that these groups induce on the additive Pontryagin duals of the fields. We show that the actions are disjoint unless the fields themselves are isomorphic and the group isomorphism extends (possibly after a finite twist) to a field isomorphism. As an application, we establish equidistribution of F\o lner-Kloosterman sums - an extension of classical Kloosterman sums to infinite fields. Unlike the classical case over algebraic closures of finite fields, these averages exhibit an inherent multiplicative asymmetry, revealing new and fundamentally different behavior. Finally, we derive several combinatorial consequences, including results on sum-product phenomena and a Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy-type theorem for Laurent polynomials over general fields.</description>

      <title>A tropical formula for non-Archimedean local heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce delta-forms on tropical toric varieties generalizing the construction of Mihatsch for $R^n$. These delta-forms will be used to define the star-product with Green functions of piecewise smooth type on a tropical toric variety. As an application, we show that non-archimedean local heights of projective varieties can be computed using the star-product on a suitable complete tropical toric variety.
  On the way, we show that open subsets of a simplicial tropical toric variety have a locally finite simplicial decomposition which is constant towards the boundary.</description>

      <title>Nahm sum identities for Cartan matrices of type $D_k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Around 2007, Warnaar proved four identities related to Nahm sums associated with twice the inverse of the Cartan matrix of type $D_k$. Three of these had been conjectured by Flohr, Grabow, and Koehn, while special cases of two of the identities were first conjectured in 1993 by Kedem, Klassen, McCoy, and Melzer. Warnaar's proof relies on a multi-sum identity from Andrews' proof of the Andrews-Gordon identities. We give a new proof of all four identities using the theory of Bailey pairs. Furthermore, we establish a parametric generalization of two of the identities and provide two distinct proofs of this generalization.</description>

      <title>Generators and splitting fields of certain elliptic K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k \subset {\mathbb C}$ be a number field and ${\mathcal E}$ be an elliptic curve defined over $k(t)$, the rational function field of the projective line ${\mathbb P}^1_k$, is isomorphic to the generic fiber of an elliptic surface $\pi:= \Sc_\Ee \rightarrow {\mathbb P}^1_k$. For any subfield ${\mathcal K}\subseteq {\mathbb C}$ of $k$, the set ${\mathcal E}({\mathcal K}(t))$ of ${\mathcal K}(t)$-rational points of ${\mathcal E}$ is known to be a finitely generated abelian group. The splitting field of ${\mathcal E}$ defined over $k(t)$ is the smallest finite extension ${\mathcal K} \subset {\mathbb C}$ of $k$ such that ${\mathcal E} ({\mathbb C} (t)) \iso {\mathcal E} ({\mathcal K}(t))$. In this paper, we consider the elliptic $K3$ surfaces defined over $k={\mathbb Q}$ with the generic fiber given by the Weierstrass equation ${\mathcal E}_n: \displaystyle y^2=x^3 + t^n + 1/t^n$, $1\leq n\leq 6$, and determine the splitting field ${\mathcal K}_n$, and find an explicit set of independent generators for ${\mathcal E}_n ({\mathcal K_n}(t))$ for $1\leq n \leq 6$.</description>

Abstract: We extend Latimer and MacDuffee's theorem to a general commutative domain and apply this result to study similarity of matrices over integral rings of number fields. We also conjecture similarity over discrete valuation rings can be descent by a finite covering and verify this conjecture for $2\times2$ matrices and separable characteristic polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An arithmetical function $f$ is said to admit a \emph{Cohen-Ramanujan expansion} $f(n) := \sum\limits_{r}\widehat{f}(r)c_r^s(n)$, if the series on the right hand side converges for suitable complex numbers $\widehat{f}(r)$. Here $c_r^s(n)$ denotes the Cohen-Ramanujan sum defined by E. Cohen. We deduce here a Cohen-Ramanujan expansion for the Jordan totient function $J_k(n)$. Further, we give an an asymptotic formula for the sum $\sum\limits_{n \leq N} \frac{J_a(n)}{n^a} \frac{J_b(n+h)}{(n+h)^b}$ using the expansion we derive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Piatetski-Shapiro sequences are of the form $\mathcal{N}_{c} := (\lfloor n^{c} \rfloor)_{n=1}^\infty$, where $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ is the integer part. It is expected that there are infinitely many primes in a Piatetski-Shapiro sequence for $c \in (1,2)$. In this article, we prove there are infinitely many Piatetski-Shapiro prime numbers for $1 &lt; c &lt; 1.1612\dots$ with an asymptotic formula. As a key idea, we prove a new bound for related type $I$ sum.</description>

Abstract: Denote $f(n):=\sum_{1\le k\le n} \tau(2^k-1)$, where $\tau$ is the number of divisors function. Motivated by a question of Paul Erd\H{o}s, we show that the sequence of ratios $f(2n)/f(n)$ is unbounded. We also present conditional results on the divergence of this sequence to infinity. Finally, we test numerically both the conjecture $f(2n)/f(n)\to\infty$ and our sufficient conditions for it to hold.</description>

      <title>Transcendency of variants of Mills' constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denote the integer part of $x$. For every sequence $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ of positive integers, we define $\xi(C_k)$ as the smallest real number $\xi&gt;1$ such that $\lfloor \xi^{C_k} \rfloor$ is a prime number for every positive integer $k$. The number $\xi(3^k)$ is called Mills' constant. Recently, the author showed that $\xi(3^k)$ is irrational; however, the transcendency remains open. In this paper, we show that Mills' constant is transcendental under the Density Hypothesis of the Riemann zeta function. Furthermore, we obtain four classes of sequences $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ for which we can verify the arithmetic properties of $\xi(C_k)$. For simplicity, we give four representative examples belonging to each class: (A) $\xi(\lfloor b^k\rfloor)$ is irrational for every real number $b\ge 1+\sqrt{2}$; (B) $\xi((1+\sqrt{2})^k+(1-\sqrt{2})^k)$ is transcendental; (C) $\xi(r3^k-1)$ is transcendental for every integer $r\ge 4.003\times 10^{14}$; (D) $\xi(3^{k-\lfloor (\log k)^{1/2} \rfloor}2^{\lfloor (\log k)^{1/2}\rfloor})$ is transcendental.</description>

      <title>Note on a conjecture of S\'ark\"ozy on special sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha&gt;1$ be an irrational number and $k\ge 2$ a positive integer. Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial with positive integer coefficients. Solving a 2001 problem of S\'ark\"ozy on special sequences, Hegyv\'ari proved in 2003 that there exists an infinite sequence $A$ with density $\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k\alpha}$ such that $$ \big\{f(a_1)+\ldots+f(a_k): a_i\in A, 1\le i\le k\big\}\cap \big\{\lfloor n\alpha\rfloor: n\in \mathbb{N}\big\}=\emptyset. $$ Hegyv\'ari also proved that the density given by him is optimal for $k=2$. In this article, we show that the density $\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k\alpha}$ given by Hegyv\'ari is actually optimal for all $k\ge 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain non-trivial bounds for bilinear sums of trace functions below the P\'olya-Vinogradov range assuming only that the geometric monodromy group of the underlying ell-adic sheaf satisfies certain simple structural properties, in contrast to previous works which handled only special cases of Kloosterman and hypergeometric sheaves. Our approach builds on a general "soft" stratification theorem for sums of products of trace functions, based on an idea of Junyan Xu, combined with a new robust version of the Goursat-Kolchin-Ribet criterion.</description>

Abstract: We provide a sufficient characterization for subsets $\mathcal{A}$ of the polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ for which partial sums of Steinhaus random multiplicative functions approach a complex standard normal distribution. This extends recent work of Soundararajan and Xu to the function field setting. We apply this characterization to deduce central limit theorems in four cases: polynomials in short intervals, polynomials with few prime factors, shifted primes, and rough polynomials. In doing so, we also establish an explicit Hildebrand inequality for smooth polynomials in short intervals, a function field form of Shiu's theorem for multiplicative functions, and an explicit Chebyshev bound for rough polynomials in short intervals.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the exponential Diophantine equation \( (2^k-1)(b^k-1)=y^q \) with $k\ge 2$, odd integer $b$ and an odd prime exponent $q$ and obtain effective upper bounds for $q$ in terms of $b$. In particular, we show that $q\le \log_2(b+1)$ holds apart from a finite, explicitly determined set of exceptional pairs $(b,q)$ when $3\le b&lt;10^6$. As an application, we prove that the related equation \( (2^k-1)(b^k-1)=x^n, \) has no positive integer solution $(k,x,n)$ for several specific odd values of $b$, including $b\in\{5,7,11,13,21,23,27,29\}$.</description>

      <title>The Linear Slicing Method for Equal Sums of Like Powers: Modular and Geometric Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Diophantine equation $a^k + b^k = c^k + d^k$ with integer variables and exponent $k&gt;1$, under the linear constraint $(c+d) - (a+b) = h$. We analyze the geometry and arithmetic of these linear slices. On the central slice $h=0$, we prove strictly convex uniqueness: distinct unordered pairs with the same sum yield distinct power sums. For shifted slices $h\neq 0$, we establish a Modular Divisibility Obstruction (MDO): any solution requires $h$ to be divisible by a specific squarefree modulus $M_k = \prod_{p-1 \mid k-1} p$. This condition creates a strong divisibility filter; for example, if $k=13$, the obstruction eliminates $99.96\%$ of all possible shifts. We combine this arithmetic constraint with a geometric exclusion zone principle and a global overlap bound, showing that the slice size must satisfy $\min\{S, S+h\} \gg |h|$. Finally, we prove an asymptotic dominance bound $k \le \max\{S, S+h\} \log 2$, implying that for any fixed slice, solutions cannot exist for sufficiently large $k$.</description>

      <title>Growth rates of sequences governed by the squarefree properties of its translates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer several questions of Erd\H{o}s regarding sequences of natural numbers $A$ whose translates $n+A$ intersect with the squarefree numbers in various specified ways. For instance, we show that if every translate only contains finitely many squarefree numbers, then $A$ has zero density, although the decay rate of this density can be arbitrarily slow. On the other hand, there exist sequences $A$ with optimal density $6/\pi^2$ for which infinitely many $n$ exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$ with $a &lt; n$. In fact, infinitely many such $n$ exist for every exponentially increasing sequence, as long as the sequence avoids at least one residue class modulo $p^2$ for all primes $p$, a property we call admissible. If one instead requires infinitely many $n$ to exist such that $n+a$ is squarefree for all $a \in A$, then $A$ can have density arbitrarily close to, but not equal to, $6/\pi^2$. Finally, we prove bounds on the growth rate of sequences $A$ for which $a+a'$ is squarefree for all $a,a' \in A$, as well as bounds on the largest admissible subset of $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$.</description>

Starting from residual representations $\bar\rho_1,\bar\rho_2$ of tame level~$1$ satisfying Hypothesis~3.1 of~\cite{LoefflerUD}, we consider the half--ordinary Panchishkin family $(R,V,V^+)$ of Example~3.17 of loc.\ cit., where the first factor varies in the ordinary Hida deformation and the second factor in the unrestricted universal deformation space.</description>

      <title>On the non-archimedean Monge-Amp\`ere equation in mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let X be a smooth projective variety over a complete discretely valued field of mixed characteristic. We solve non-archimedean Monge-Amp\`ere equations on X assuming resolution and embedded resolution of singularities. We follow the variational approach of Boucksom, Favre, and Jonsson proving the continuity of the plurisubharmonic envelope of a continuous metric on an ample line bundle on X. We replace the use of multiplier ideals in equicharacteristic zero by the use of perturbation friendly test ideals introduced by Bhatt, Ma, Patakfalvi, Schwede, Tucker, Waldron, and Witaszek building upon previous constructions by Hacon, Lamarche, and Schwede.</description>

      <title>Central motives on parahoric flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a refinement of Gaitsgory's central functor for integral motivic sheaves, and show it preserves stratified Tate motives. Towards this end, we develop a reformulation of unipotent motivic nearby cycles, which also works over higher-dimensional bases. We moreover introduce Wakimoto motives and use them to show that our motivic central functor is t-exact. A decategorification of these functors yields a new approach to generic Hecke algebras for general parahorics.</description>

      <title>Weighted Heights and GIT Heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) heights and weighted heights, with a focus on their interaction in weighted projective spaces and their application to binary forms. Building on the weighted height framework developed in previous papers, we relate it to Zhang's GIT height via the Veronese map. For a semistable cycle, we show that the GIT height decomposes into the logarithmic weighted height plus an Archimedean correction from the Chow metric.</description>

      <title>Extremal divisors on moduli spaces of K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish criteria for when Noether--Lefschetz divisors generate an extremal ray in the cone of pseudoeffective divisors of an orthogonal modular variety. In particular, we exhibit many extremal rays of the cone of pseudoeffective divisors on any moduli space~$\mathcal{F}_{2d}$ of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces of degree $d$, as well as on any normal projective $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial compactification $\overline{\mathcal{F}}_{2d}$ of $\mathcal{F}_{2d}$ lying over the Baily--Borel compactification.</description>

      <title>Principal minors of Fourier matrices of square-free order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chebotarev's theorem on roots of unity states that all minors of a Fourier matrix are non-zero if and only if the order of the matrix is prime. We establish cases in which all principal minors of Fourier matrices of square-free order are non-zero. In a subsequent paper we discuss the case of composites containing squares.</description>

      <title>The Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa (Marton) Conjecture in Integers and Finite Fields via Spectral Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We settle the Polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) conjecture for the integers and for cyclic groups. More precisely, we show that if $A$ is a finite subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le K|A|$, then there is a subgroup $H$ of index at most $K^{O(1)}$ such that $A$ is contained in at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of $H$. The proof is based on a new spectral stability dichotomy for the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $\mathbf{1}_A$: either this mass is concentrated on a span of size $K^{O(1)}$, or, after passing to a quotient of codimension $K^{O(1)}$, the doubling constant of the image of $A$ decreases by a definite power of $K$. Using Freiman modeling we transfer this dichotomy to cyclic groups, obtain polynomial Bogolyubov-type bounds, and deduce Marton's conjecture in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. As a corollary, we also recover and extend the finite-field formulation of Marton's conjecture: in odd characteristic we obtain a direct spectral proof, and together with the characteristic-2 result of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao this yields a complete resolution of the conjecture for all finite fields. For context beyond finite fields, we recall their theorem for abelian groups of bounded exponent.</description>
