      <title>A minimal model of money creation under regulatory constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model of the secured interbank network able to shed light on recent money markets puzzles. We find that excess liquidity emerges due to the interactions between the reserves and liquidity ratio constraints; the appearance of evergreen repurchase agreements and collateral re-use emerges as a simple answer to banks' counterparty risk and liquidity ratio regulation. In line with prevailing theories, re-use increases with collateral scarcity. In our agent-based model, banks create money endogenously to meet the funding requests of economic agents. The latter generate payment shocks to the banking system by reallocating their deposits. Banks absorbs these shocks thanks to repurchase agreements, while respecting reserves, liquidity, and leverage constraints. The resulting network is denser and more robust to stress scenarios than an unsecured one; in addition, the stable bank trading relationships network exhibits a core-periphery structure. Finally, we show how this model can be used as a tool for stress testing and monetary policy design.</description>

      <title>Periodic portfolio selection with quasi-hyperbolic discounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an infinite-horizon, continuous-time portfolio selection problem faced by an agent with periodic S-shaped preference and present bias. The inclusion of a quasi-hyperbolic discount function leads to time-inconsistency and we characterize the optimal portfolio for a pre-committing, naive and sophisticated agent respectively. In the more theoretically challenging problem with a sophisticated agent, the time-consistent planning strategy can be formulated as an equilibrium to a static mean field game. Interestingly, present bias and naivety do not necessarily result in less desirable risk taking behaviors, while agent's sophistication may lead to excessive leverage (underinvestement) in the bad (good) states of the world.</description>

      <title>Global Factors in Non-core Bank Funding and Exchange Rate Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11552v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that fluctuations in the ratio of non-core to core funding in the banking systems of advanced economies are largely driven by three global factors of both real and financial natures, with country-specific factors playing only a minor role. Exchange rate flexibility helps insulate the non-core to core ratio from such global factors. This insulation is stronger in periods away from global crises. Tighter prudential regulations appear to have a complementary effect to exchange rate insulation.</description>

      <title>Optimal In-Kind Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a model of in-kind redistribution where consumers participate in either a private market or a government-designed program, but not both. We characterize when a social planner, seeking to maximize weighted total surplus, can strictly improve upon the laissez-faire outcome. We show that the optimal mechanism consists of three components: a public option, nonlinear subsidies, and laissez-faire consumption. We quantify the resulting distortions and relate them to the correlation between consumer demand and welfare weights. Our findings reveal that while private market access constrains the social planner's ability to redistribute, it also strengthens the rationale for non-market allocations.</description>
