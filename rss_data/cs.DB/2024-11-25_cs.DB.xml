      <title>Subspace Collision: An Efficient and Accurate Framework for High-dimensional Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces is a fundamental problem with a wide range of applications. However, there is currently no ANN method that performs well in both indexing and query answering performance, while providing rigorous theoretical guarantees for the quality of the answers. In this paper, we first design SC-score, a metric that we show follows the Pareto principle and can act as a proxy for the Euclidean distance between data points.Inspired by this, we propose a novel ANN search framework called Subspace Collision (SC), which can provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of its results. We further propose SuCo, which achieves efficient and accurate ANN search by designing a clustering-based lightweight index and query strategies for our proposed subspace collision framework. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that both the indexing and query answering performance of SuCo outperform state-of-the-art ANN methods that can provide theoretical guarantees, performing 1-2 orders of magnitude faster query answering with only up to one-tenth of the index memory footprint. Moreover, SuCo achieves top performance (best for hard datasets) even when compared to methods that do not provide theoretical guarantees. This paper was published in SIGMOD 2025.</description>

      <title>Jovis: A Visualization Tool for PostgreSQL Query Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the world of relational database management, the query optimizer is a critical component that significantly impacts query performance. To address the challenge of optimizing query performance due to the complexity of optimizers -- especially with join operations -- we introduce Jovis. This novel visualization tool provides a window into the often intricate process of query optimization in PostgreSQL, making it more accessible and understandable. PostgreSQL employs two different query optimization strategies: the Dynamic Programming (DP) Optimizer for most scenarios and the Genetic Query Optimizer (GEQO) for more complex queries with numerous joins, both of which are supported in Jovis. Our tool visualizes the optimizer's decision-making process, from evaluating access paths for each relation to determining join orderings, all using data derived from the optimizer's logs. Jovis not only clarifies the query optimization process through visualizations but also serves as an invaluable learning tool for learners and a practical resource for experienced database professionals looking to optimize their query performance or even the query optimizer itself. The source code has been made available at https://github.com/snu-jovis.</description>

      <title>Optimization Strategies for Parallel Computation of Skylines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyline queries are one of the most widely adopted tools for Multi-Criteria Analysis, with applications covering diverse domains, including, e.g., Database Systems, Data Mining, and Decision Making. Skylines indeed offer a useful overview of the most suitable alternatives in a dataset, while discarding all the options that are dominated by (i.e., worse than) others.
  The intrinsically quadratic complexity associated with skyline computation has pushed researchers to identify strategies for parallelizing the task, particularly by partitioning the dataset at hand. In this paper, after reviewing the main partitioning approaches available in the relevant literature, we propose two orthogonal optimization strategies for reducing the computational overhead, and compare them experimentally in a multi-core environment equipped with PySpark.</description>

      <title>PoneglyphDB: Efficient Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Arbitrary SQL-Query Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In database applications involving sensitive data, the dual imperatives of data confidentiality and provable query processing are important. This paper introduces PoneglyphDB, a database system that leverages non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to support both confidentiality and provability. Unlike traditional databases, PoneglyphDB enhances confidentiality by ensuring that raw data remains exclusively with the host, while also enabling verification of the correctness of query responses by providing proofs to clients. The main innovation in this paper is proposing efficient ZKP designs (called circuits) for basic operations in SQL query processing. These basic operation circuits are then combined to form ZKP circuits for larger, more complex queries. PoneglyphDB's circuits are carefully designed to be efficient by utilizing advances in cryptography such as PLONKish-based circuits, recursive proof composition techniques, and designs with low-order polynomial constraints. We demonstrate the performance of PoneglyphDB with the standard TPC-H benchmark. Our experimental results show that PoneglyphDB can efficiently achieve both confidentiality and provability, outperforming existing state-of-the-art ZKP methods.</description>

      <title>Associative Knowledge Graphs for Efficient Sequence Storage and Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for constructing associative knowledge graphs that are highly effective for storing and recognizing sequences. The graph is created by representing overlapping sequences of objects, as tightly connected clusters within the larger graph. Individual objects (represented as nodes) can be a part of multiple sequences or appear repeatedly within a single sequence. To retrieve sequences, we leverage context, providing a subset of objects that triggers an association with the complete sequence. The system's memory capacity is determined by the size of the graph and the density of its connections. We have theoretically derived the relationships between the critical density of the graph and the memory capacity for storing sequences. The critical density is the point beyond which error-free sequence reconstruction becomes impossible. Furthermore, we have developed an efficient algorithm for ordering elements within a sequence. Through extensive experiments with various types of sequences, we have confirmed the validity of these relationships. This approach has potential applications in diverse fields, such as anomaly detection in financial transactions or predicting user behavior based on past actions.</description>

      <title>Ranked Enumeration of Conjunctive Query Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.02698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the enumeration of top-k answers for conjunctive queries against relational databases according to a given ranking function. The task is to design data structures and algorithms that allow for efficient enumeration after a preprocessing phase. Our main contribution is a novel priority queue based algorithm with near-optimal delay and non-trivial space guarantees that are output sensitive and depend on structure of the query. In particular, we exploit certain desirable properties of ranking functions that frequently occur in practice and degree information in the database instance, allowing for efficient enumeration. We introduce the notion of {\em decomposable} and {\em compatible} ranking functions in conjunction with query decomposition, a property that allows for partial aggregation of tuple scores in order to efficiently enumerate the ranked output. We complement the algorithmic results with lower bounds justifying why certain assumptions about properties of ranking functions are necessary and discuss popular conjectures providing evidence for optimality of enumeration delay guarantees. Our results extend and improve upon a long line of work that has studied ranked enumeration from both theoretical and practical perspective.</description>

      <title>MSF-Model: Queuing-Based Analysis and Prediction of Metastable Failures in Replicated Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable failure is a recent abstraction of a pattern of failures that occurs frequently in real-world distributed storage systems. In this paper, we propose a formal analysis and modeling of metastable failures in replicated storage systems. We focus on a foundational problem in distributed systems -- the problem of consensus -- to have an impact on a large class of systems. Our main contribution is the development of a queuing-based analytical model, MSF-Model, that can be used to characterize and predict metastable failures. MSF-Model integrates novel modeling concepts that allow modeling metastable failures which was interactable to model prior to our work. We also perform real experiments to reproduce and validate our model. Our real experiments show that MSF-Model predicts metastable failures with high accuracy by comparing the real experiment with the predictions from the queuing-based model.</description>
