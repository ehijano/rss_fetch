      <title>Fixed points of the Berezin transform on Fock-type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fixed points of the Berezin transform on the Fock-type spaces $F_m^2$ with the weight $e^{-|z|^m}, m &gt; 0.$ It is known that the Berezin transform is well-defined on the polynomials in $z$ and $\overline{z}$. In this paper we focus on the polynomial fixed points and we show that these polynomials must be harmonic, except possibly for countably many $m \in (0, \infty).$ We also show that, in some particular cases, the fixed point polynomials are harmonic for all $m.$</description>

      <title>Subsolution theorem in weighted energy classes of $m$-subharmonic functions with given boundary value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we concern with the existence of solutions of the weighted complex $m$-Hessian equation $-\chi(u)H_{m}(u)=\mu$ in the class $\mathcal{E}_{m,\chi}(f,\Omega)$ if there exists subsolution in this class, where the given boundary value $f\in\mathcal{E}_m(\Omega)\cap MSH_m(\Om).$ This is a generalization of the result in the paper \cite{PDtaiwan} where we proved that the subsolution theorem is true in the class $\mathcal{E}_{m,\chi}(f,\Omega)$ in the case when the given boundary value $f\in\mathcal{N}_m(\Omega)\cap MSH_m(\Om).$</description>

      <title>On the Algebraic Independence of a Set of Generalized Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, \gamma=0.577215\ldots , nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, \delta=0.596347\ldots , is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that these two numbers are disjunctively transcendental; that is, at least one of them must be transcendental. The two constants are related through a well-known equation of Hardy, which recently has been generalized to a pair of infinite sequences (\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)}) based on moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution. In the present work, we demonstrate the algebraic independence of the set \{\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}+\gamma^{\left(n\right)}\}_{n\geq0}, and thus the transcendence of \tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}+\gamma^{\left(n\right)} for all n\geq0. This further implies the disjunctive-transcendence of each pair (\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}).</description>

      <title>Manhattan curves in complex dynamics and asymptotic correlation of multiplier spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Manhattan curve for a pair of hyperbolic structures (possibly with cusps) on a given surface is a geometric object that encodes the growth rate of lengths of closed geodesics with respect to the two different hyperbolic metrics. It has been extensively studied as a way to understand geodesics on surfaces, the thermodynamic formalism of the geodesic flows and comparison of hyperbolic metrics.
  Via Sullivan's dictionary, in this paper, we define and study the Manhattan curve for a pair of hyperbolic rational maps on $\mathbb C\mathbb P^1$, and more generally of holomorphic endomorphisms of $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^k$. We discuss several counting results for the multiplier spectrum and show that the Manhattan curve for two holomorphic endomorphisms is related to the correlation number of their multiplier spectra.</description>

      <title>Analyticity of the Hausdorff dimension and metric structures on Misiurewicz families of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a holomorphic family $(f_\lambda)_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ of polynomial maps on $\mathbb C$ with the property that a critical point of $f_\lambda$ is persistently preperiodic to a repelling periodic point of $f_\lambda$. Let $\Omega$ be a bounded stable component of $\Lambda$ with the property that, for all $\lambda \in \Omega$, all the other critical points of $f_\lambda$ belong to attracting basins. In this paper, we introduce a dynamically meaningful geometry on $\Omega$ by constructing a natural path metric on $\Omega$ coming from a 2-form $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_G$. Our construction uses thermodynamic formalism. A key ingredient is the spectral gap of adapted transfer operators on suitable Banach spaces, which also implies the analyticity of $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_G$ on the unit tangent bundle of $\Omega$. As part of our construction, we recover a result of Skorulski and Urba\'nski stating that the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set of $f_\lambda$ varies analytically over $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Shannon entropy for harmonic metrics on cyclic Higgs bundles II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Riemann surface and $K_X \rightarrow X$ the canonical bundle. For each integer $r \geq 2$, each $q \in H^0(K_X^r)$, and each choice of the square root $K_X^{1/2}$ of the canonical bundle, we obtain a Higgs bundle, which is called a cyclic Higgs bundle. A diagonal harmonic metric $h = (h_1, \dots, h_r)$ on a cyclic Higgs bundle yields $r-1$-Hermitian metrics $H_1, \dots, H_{r-1}$ on $K_X^{-1} \rightarrow X$, while $h_1$, $h_r$, and $q$ yield a degenerate Hermitian metric $H_r$ on $K_X^{-1}\rightarrow X$. The $r$-differential $q$ induces a subharmonic weight function $\phi_q=\frac{1}{r}\log|q|$ on $K_X$, and the diagonal harmonic metric depends solely on this weight function. In the previous papers, the author studied the extension of harmonic metrics associated with arbitrary subharmonic weight function $\varphi$, which also constructs Hermitian metrics $H_1,\dots, H_r$ on $K_X^{-1}\rightarrow X$. Especially, the author introduced a function called entropy that quantifies the degree of mutual misalignment of the metrics $H_1,\dots, H_r$. In this paper, by analogy with the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics, we further introduce the quantity which we call free energy. When $H_1,\dots, H_{r-1}$ are all complete and satisfy a condition concerning their approximation, we give a sufficient condition for the free energy to decrease at each point, and when $r=2,3$ we also give a sufficient condition for the entropy to increase at each point. Furthermore, on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$, when is $C^2$ outside a compact subset, we provide, from the perspective of entropy and free energy, necessary and sufficient conditions for the function $e^\varphi h_\ast^{-1} \otimes h_{\mathbb{D}}$ to be bounded, where $h_{\mathbb{D}}$ denotes the Hermitian metric induced by the Poincar\'e metric. This result extends the work of Wan, Benoist-Hulin, Labourie-Toulisse, and Dai-Li.</description>

      <title>Complete harmonic metrics and subharmonic functions on the unit disc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Riemann surface, $K_X \rightarrow X$ the canonical bundle, and $T_X\rightarrow X$ the dual bundle of the canonical bundle. For each integer $r \geq 2$, each $q \in H^0(K_X^r)$, and each choice of the square root $K_X^{1/2}$ of the canonical bundle, we obtain a Higgs bundle $(\mathbb{K}_r,\Phi(q))$, which is called a cyclic Higgs bundle. A diagonal harmonic metric $h = (h_1, \dots, h_r)$ on a cyclic Higgs bundle yields $r-1$-Hermitian metrics $H_1, \dots, H_{r-1}$ on $T_X$, while $h_1$, $h_r$, and $q$ yield a degenerate Hermitian metric $H_r$ on $T_X$. A diagonal harmonic metric is said to be complete if the K\"ahler metrics induced by $H_1,\dots, H_{r-1}$ are all complete. Li-Mochizuki established a theorem stating that on any Riemann surface $X$ and any $q$ that is non-zero unless $X$ is hyperbolic, there exists a unique complete harmonic metric $h$ on $(\mathbb{K}_r,\Phi(q))$ with a fixed determinant. The holomorphic section $q$ induces a subharmonic weight function $\phi_q=\frac{1}{r}\log|q|^2$ on $K_X$, and a diagonal harmonic metric depends solely on this weight function $\phi_q$. In this paper, we extend the uniqueness part of the theorem of Li-Mochizuki to any subharmonic weight function $\varphi$ whose exponential is $C^2$ outside a compact subset $K \subseteq X$. We also show that on the unit disc, a complete Hermitian metric associated with $\varphi$ always exists. Furthermore, on the unit disc, when $\varphi$ can be monotonically approximated by a family of weight functions $(\varphi_\epsilon)_{0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1}$, where each $\varphi_\epsilon$ is smooth and defined on a disc $\mathbb{D}_\epsilon= \{z \in \mathbb{C} \mid |z| &lt; 1 - \epsilon\}$, we show that the corresponding family of complete metrics $(h_\epsilon)_{0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1}$ converges monotonically to a complete metric $h$ associated with $\varphi$ as $\epsilon\searrow 0$.</description>

      <title>On the limiting distribution of sums of random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality.
  A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On Banach subalgebras of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ consisting of lacunary Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ be the set of all Dirichlet series $f=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nn^{-s}$ (where $a_n\in\mathbb{C}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\cdots\}$) that converge at each $s$ in $\mathbb{C}_0=\{s\in \mathbb{C}:\text{Re}(s)&gt;0\}$, such that $\|f\|_{\infty}=\sup_{s\in\mathbb{C}_0}|f(s)|&lt;\infty$. Then $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ is a Banach algebra with pointwise operations and the supremum norm $\|\cdot\|_\infty$, and has been studied in earlier works. The article introduces a new family of Banach subalgebras $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$. For $S\subset\mathbb{N}$, let $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ be the set of all elements $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nn^{-s}\in \mathscr{H}^\infty$ such that for all $n\in \mathbb{N}\setminus S$, we have $a_n=0$. Then $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is a unital Banach subalgebra of $\mathscr{H}^\infty$ with the supremum norm if and only if $S$ is a multiplicative subsemigroup of $\mathbb{N}$ containing $1$. It is shown that for such $S$, $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is the multiplier algebra of $\mathscr{H}^2_S$, where $\mathscr{H}^2_S$ is the Hilbert space of all Dirichlet series $f=\sum_{n\in S} a_nn^{-s}$ such that $\|f\|_2:=(\sum_{n\in S} |a_n|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;\infty$. A characterisation of the group of units in $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$ is also given, by showing an analogue of the Wiener $1/f$ theorem for $\mathscr{H}^\infty_{S}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study weak solutions to complex Hessian equations of the form $(\omega + dd^c \varphi)^m\wedge\beta^{n-m}= F(\varphi,.)d\mu$ in the class $\mathcal{N}^a_m(\Omega,\omega,\phi)$ on a ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$, where $\omega$ is a real smooth $(1,1)$-form, $\mu$ is a positive measure which puts no mass on $m$-polar subsets, $\Omega$ is a ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$ and $F(t,z): \mathbb{R}\times\Omega\longrightarrow [0,+\infty)$ is a upper semi-continuous function on $\mathbb{R}\times\Omega$, $0\leq F(t,z)\leq G(z)$ for all $(t,z)\in\mathbb{R}\times \Omega$, $G(z)\in L^1_{loc}(\Omega, d\mu)$ and $F(t,z)$ is continuous in the first variable. Our result extends a result of Salouf in \cite{S23} in which he solved Monge-Amp\`ere type equations $(\omega + dd^c \varphi)^n= F(\varphi,.)d\mu$ with $F(t,z)$ is a continuous non-decreasing function in the first variable function and $\varphi\in\mathcal{E}(\Omega)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Riemann surface, $K_X \rightarrow X$ the canonical bundle, and $T_X= K_X^{-1}\rightarrow X$ the dual bundle of the canonical bundle. For each integer $r \geq 2$, each $q \in H^0(K_X^r)$, and each choice of the square root $K_X^{1/2}$ of the canonical bundle, we canonically obtain a Higgs bundle, which is called a cyclic Higgs bundle. A diagonal harmonic metric $h = (h_1, \dots, h_r)$ on a cyclic Higgs bundle yields $r-1$-Hermitian metrics $H_1, \dots, H_{r-1}$ on $T_X\rightarrow X$, defined as $H_j=h_j^{-1} \otimes h_{j+1}$ for each $j=1,\dots, r-1$, while $h_1$, $h_r$, and $q$ yield a degenerate Hermitian metric $H_r$ on $T_X \rightarrow X$. The $r$-differential $q$ induces a subharmonic weight function $\phi_q=\frac{1}{r}\log|q|^2$ on $K_X\rightarrow X$, and the diagonal harmonic metric depends solely on this weight function $\phi_q$. In the previous papers, the author introduced and studied the extension of harmonic metrics associated with arbitrary subharmonic weight function $\varphi$, which also constructs $r-1$-Hermitian metrics $H_1,\dots, H_{r-1}$ and a degenerate Hermitian metric $H_r$ on $T_X\rightarrow X$. In this paper, for each non-zero real parameter $\beta$, we introduce a function, which we call entropy, that quantifies the degree of mutual misalignment of the Hermitian metrics $H_1,\dots, H_r$. By extending the estimate established by Dai-Li and Li-Mochizuki to general subharmonic weight functions, we provide an upper bound and a lower bound for the entropy when $H_1,\dots, H_{r-1}$ are all complete and satisfy a condition concerning their approximation. Additionally, we show that the difference between the lower and upper bounds of entropy converges to a finite real number if and only if $\beta&gt;-1$.</description>

      <title>Boundary representations from constrained interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study $C^*$-envelopes of finite-dimensional operator algebras arising from constrained interpolation problems on the unit disc. In particular, we consider interpolation problems for the algebra $H^\infty_{\text{node}}$ that consists of bounded analytic functions on the unit disk that satisfy $ f(0) = f(\lambda)$ for some $0 \neq \lambda \in \mathbb{D}$. We show that there exist choices of four interpolation nodes that exclude both $0$ and $\lambda$, such that if $I$ is the ideal of functions that vanish at the interpolation nodes, then $C^*_e(H^\infty_{\text{node}}/I)$ is infinite-dimensional. This differs markedly from the behavior of the algebra corresponding to interpolation nodes that contain the constrained points studied in the literature. Additionally, we use the distance formula to provide a completely isometric embedding of $C^*_e(H^\infty_{\text{node}}/I)$ for any choice of $n$ interpolation nodes that do not contain the constrained points into $M_n(G^2_{nc})$, where $G^2_{nc}$ is Brown's noncommutative Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>On The Geometry and Topology of Cayley Condition in Poncelet Porism for Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the differential-geometric and topological properties of the Cayley condition in Poncelet porism for triangles, defined as the locus of pairs of non-degenerate conics that admit a Poncelet triangle. While the algebraic condition for this porism, established by Cayley, is classical, the geometric nature of the set of solutions has remained largely unexplored. We demonstrate that this Cayley set is a smooth, connected, 9-dimensional complex manifold. This is proven by showing it is an open subset of a smooth algebraic variety endowed with a trivial fiber bundle structure over the space of non-degenerate conics.
  To further analyze its structure, we construct the moduli space of transversely intersecting conic pairs under the action of $\mathbb{P}GL_3(\mathbb{C})$ and identify it with an open subset of $\mathbb{CP}^2/S_3$. We compute the fundamental group of a generic orbit.
  The elliptic j-invariant is then introduced as a holomorphic map on this space of conics, which factors through this moduli space. We analyze the subset of the Cayley set where this map is a submersion - its regular part - which corresponds to excluding points whose j-invariant is one of the critical values $0$ or $1728$. We prove that this regular part is the total space of a fiber bundle over $\C \setminus \{0,1728\}$. This structure allows for the computation of the fundamental group via the long exact sequence of homotopy.
  Finally, we provide a principal bundle formulation for the Poncelet correspondence itself over orbits of conic pairs.</description>
