      <title>Structural causal influence (SCI) captures the forces of social inequality in models of disease dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling has served a central role in studying how infectious disease transmission manifests at the population level. These models have demonstrated the importance of population-level factors like social network heterogeneity on structuring epidemic risk and are now routinely used in public health for decision support. One barrier to broader utility of mathematical models is that the existing canon does not readily accommodate the social determinants of health as distinct, formal drivers of transmission dynamics. Given the decades of empirical support for the organizational effect of social determinants on health burden more generally and infectious disease risk more specially, addressing this modelling gap is of critical importance. In this study, we build on prior efforts to integrate social forces into mathematical epidemiology by introducing several new metrics, principally structural causal influence (SCI). Here, SCI leverages causal analysis to provide a measure of the relative vulnerability of subgroups within a susceptible population, which are crafted by differences in healthcare, exposure to disease, and other determinants. We develop our metrics using a general case and apply it to specific one of public health importance: Hepatitis C virus in a population of persons who inject drugs. Our use of the SCI reveals that, under specific parameters in a multi-community model, the "less vulnerable" community may sustain a basic reproduction number below one when isolated, ensuring disease extinction. However, even minimal transmission between less and more vulnerable communities can elevate this number, leading to sustained epidemics within both communities. Summarizing, we reflect on our findings in light of conversations surrounding the importance of social inequalities and how their consideration can influence the study and practice of mathematical epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Hyperedge Representations with Hypergraph Wavelets: Applications to Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many data-driven applications, higher-order relationships among multiple objects are essential in capturing complex interactions. Hypergraphs, which generalize graphs by allowing edges to connect any number of nodes, provide a flexible and powerful framework for modeling such higher-order relationships. In this work, we introduce hypergraph diffusion wavelets and describe their favorable spectral and spatial properties. We demonstrate their utility for biomedical discovery in spatially resolved transcriptomics by applying the method to represent disease-relevant cellular niches for Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Models for Controllable RNA Sequence Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents RNAdiffusion, a latent diffusion model for generating and optimizing discrete RNA sequences. RNA is a particularly dynamic and versatile molecule in biological processes. RNA sequences exhibit high variability and diversity, characterized by their variable lengths, flexible three-dimensional structures, and diverse functions. We utilize pretrained BERT-type models to encode raw RNAs into token-level biologically meaningful representations. A Q-Former is employed to compress these representations into a fixed-length set of latent vectors, with an autoregressive decoder trained to reconstruct RNA sequences from these latent variables. We then develop a continuous diffusion model within this latent space. To enable optimization, we train reward networks to estimate functional properties of RNA from the latent variables. We employ gradient-based guidance during the backward diffusion process, aiming to generate RNA sequences that are optimized for higher rewards. Empirical experiments confirm that RNAdiffusion generates non-coding RNAs that align with natural distributions across various biological indicators. We fine-tuned the diffusion model on untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA and optimize sample sequences for protein translation efficiencies. Our guided diffusion model effectively generates diverse UTR sequences with high Mean Ribosome Loading (MRL) and Translation Efficiency (TE), surpassing baselines. These results hold promise for studies on RNA sequence-function relationships, protein synthesis, and enhancing therapeutic RNA design.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Mechanism of Hepatotoxiciy of PFAS Targeting L-FABP Using GCN and Computational Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental pollutants with known toxicity and bioaccumulation issues. Their widespread industrial use and resistance to degradation have led to global environmental contamination and significant health concerns. While a minority of PFAS have been extensively studied, the toxicity of many PFAS remains poorly understood due to limited direct toxicological data. This study advances the predictive modeling of PFAS toxicity by combining semi-supervised graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We propose a novel approach to enhance the prediction of PFAS binding affinities by isolating molecular fingerprints to construct graphs where then descriptors are set as the node features. This approach specifically captures the structural, physicochemical, and topological features of PFAS without overfitting due to an abundance of features. Unsupervised clustering then identifies representative compounds for detailed binding studies. Our results provide a more accurate ability to estimate PFAS hepatotoxicity to provide guidance in chemical discovery of new PFAS and the development of new safety regulations.</description>

      <title>Infector characteristics exposed by spatial analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence and demographic data analysed at fine geographical scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterising drivers of SARS-CoV-2 circulation is crucial for understanding COVID-19 because of the severity of control measures adopted during the pandemic. Whole genome sequence data augmented with demographic metadata provides the best opportunity to do this. We use Random Forest Decision Tree models to analyse a combination of over 4000 SARS-CoV2 sequences from a densely sampled, mixed urban and rural population (Tayside) in Scotland in the period from August 2020 to July 2021, with fine scale geographical and socio-demographic metadata. Comparing periods in versus out of "lockdown" restrictions, we show using genetic distance relationships that individuals from more deprived areas are more likely to get infected during lockdown but less likely to spread the infection further. As disadvantaged communities were the most affected by both COVID-19 and its restrictions, our finding has important implications for informing future approaches to control future pandemics driven by similar respiratory infections.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modelling, selection and hierarchical inference to determine the minimal dose in IFN$\alpha$ therapy against Myeloproliferative Neoplasms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) are blood cancers that appear after acquiring a driver mutation in a hematopoietic stem cell. These hematological malignancies result in the overproduction of mature blood cells and, if not treated, induce a risk of cardiovascular events and thrombosis. Pegylated IFN$\alpha$ is commonly used to treat MPN, but no clear guidelines exist concerning the dose prescribed to patients. We applied a model selection procedure and ran a hierarchical Bayesian inference method to decipher how dose variations impact the response to the therapy. We inferred that IFN$\alpha$ acts on mutated stem cells by inducing their differentiation into progenitor cells; the higher the dose, the higher the effect. We found that the treatment can induce long-term remission when a sufficient (patient-dependent) dose is reached. We determined this minimal dose for individuals in a cohort of patients and estimated the most suitable starting dose to give to a new patient to increase the chances of being cured.</description>

      <title>Modelling and calibration of pair-rule protein patterns in Drosophila embryo: From Even-skipped and Fushi-tarazu to Wingless expression networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We modelled and calibrated the distributions of the seven-stripe patterns of Even-skipped (\textit{Eve}) and Fushi-tarazu (\textit{Ftz}) pair-rule proteins along the anteroposterior axis of the \textit{Drosphila} embryo, established during early development. We have identified the putative repressive combinations for five \textit{Eve} enhancers, and we have explored the relationship between \textit{Eve} and \textit{Ftz} for complementary patterns. The regulators of \textit{Eve} and \textit{Ftz} are stripe-specific DNA enhancers with embryo position-dependent activation rates and regulated by the gap family of proteins. We achieved remarkable data matching of the \textit{Eve} stripe pattern, and the calibrated model reproduces gap gene mutation experiments. Extended work inferring the Wingless (\textit{Wg}) fourteen stripe pattern from \textit{Eve} and \textit{Ftz} enhancers have been proposed, clarifying the hierarchical structure of \textit{Drosphila}'s genetic expression network during early development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies revealed structural and functional brain changes in heavy smokers. However, the specific changes in topological brain connections are not well understood. We used Gaussian Undirected Graphs with the graphical lasso algorithm on rs-fMRI data from smokers and non-smokers to identify significant changes in brain connections. Our results indicate high stability in the estimated graphs and identify several brain regions significantly affected by smoking, providing valuable insights for future clinical research.</description>
