      <title>Continuity of the linearized forward map of electrical impedance tomography from square-integrable perturbations to Hilbert-Schmidt operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the Fr\'echet derivative of the idealized forward map of two-dimensional electrical impedance tomography, i.e., the linear operator that maps a perturbation of the coefficient in the conductivity equation over a bounded two-dimensional domain to the linear approximation of the corresponding change in the Neumann-to-Dirichlet boundary map. It is proved that the Fr\'echet derivative is bounded from the space of square-integrable conductivity perturbations to the space of Hilbert--Schmidt operators on the mean-free $L^2$ functions on the domain boundary, if the background conductivity coefficient is constant and the considered simply-connected domain has a $C^{1,\alpha}$ boundary. This result provides a theoretical framework for analyzing linearization-based one-step reconstruction algorithms of electrical impedance tomography in an infinite-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Scattering for the generalized Hartree equation with a potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the focusing generalized Hartree equation in $H^1(\R^3)$ with a potential, \begin{equation*} iu_t + \Delta u - V(x)u + (I_\gamma \ast |u|^p )|u|^{p-2} u=0, \end{equation*} where $I_\gamma = \frac{1}{|x|^{3-\gamma}}$, $p \geq 2$ and $\gamma &lt; 3$. In this paper, we prove scattering for the generalized Hartree equation with a potential in the intercritical case assuming radial initial data. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of a general mass-potential condition, incorporating the potential V, which extends the standard mass-energy framework. To this end, we employ a simplified method inspired by Dodson and Murphy \cite{Dod-Mur}, based on Tao's scattering criteria and Morawetz estimates. This approach provides a more straightforward proof of scattering compared to the traditional concentration-compactness/rigidity method of Kenig and Merle \cite{KENIG}.</description>

      <title>Global solutions to 3D quadratic nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem to the 3D fractional Schr\"odinger equation with quadratic interaction of $u\bar u$ type. We prove the global existence of solutions and scattering properties for small initial data. For the proof, one novelty is that we combine the normal form methods and the space-time resonance methods. Using the normal form transform enables us more flexibilities in designing the resolution spaces so that we can control various interactions. It is also convenient for the final data problem.</description>

      <title>A note on the Taylor estimates of iterated paraproducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bony's paraproduct is one of the main tools in the theory of paracontrolled calculus. The paraproduct is usually defined via Fourier analysis, so it is not a local operator. In the previous researches [7, 8], however, the author proved that the pointwise estimate like (1.2) holds for the paraproduct and its iterated versions when the sum of the regularities is smaller than 1. The aim of this article is to extend these results for higher regularities.</description>

      <title>A note on the radially symmetry in the moving plane method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 2$, be a bounded connected $C^2$ domain. For any unit vector $\nu\in\mathbb{R}^n$, let $T_{\lambda}^{\nu}=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:x\cdot\nu=\lambda\}$, $\Sigma_{\lambda}^{\nu}=\{x\in\Omega:x\cdot\nu&lt;\lambda\}$ and $x^{\ast}=x-2(x\cdot\nu-\lambda)\nu$ be the reflection of a point $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ about the plane $T_{\lambda}^{\nu}$. Let $\widetilde{\Sigma}_{\lambda}^{\nu}=\{x\in\Omega:x^{\ast}\in\Sigma_{\lambda}^{\nu}\}$ and $u\in C^2(\overline{\Omega})$. Suppose for any unit vector $\nu\in\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a constant $\lambda_{\nu}\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $\Omega$ is symmetric about the plane $T_{\lambda_{\nu}}^{\nu}$ and $u$ is symmetric about the plane $T_{\lambda_{\nu}}^{\nu}$ and satisfies (i)$\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}(x)&gt;0\quad\forall x\in \Sigma_{\lambda_{\nu}}^{\nu}$ and (ii)$\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}(x)&lt;0\quad\forall x\in \widetilde{\Sigma}_{\lambda_{\nu}}^{\nu}$. We will give a simple proof that $u$ is radially symmetric about some point $x_0\in\Omega$ and $\Omega$ is a ball with center at $x_0$. Similar result holds for the domain $\mathbb{R}^n$ and function $u\in C^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ satisfying similar monotonicity and symmetry conditions. We also extend this result under weaker hypothesis on the function $u$.</description>

      <title>Spectral localization estimates for abstract linear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation properties of abstract linear Schr\"odinger equations of the form $i\partial_t\psi = H_0\psi+V(t)\psi$, where $H_0$ is a self-adjoint operator and $V(t)$ a time-dependent potential. We present explicit sufficient conditions ensuring that if the initial state $\psi_0$ has spectral support in $(-\infty,0]$ with respect to a reference self-adjoint operator $\phi$, then, for some $c&gt;0$ independent of $\psi_0$ and all $t\ne0$, the solution $\psi_t$ remains spectrally supported in $(-\infty,c|t|]$ with respect to $\phi$, up to an $O(|t|^{-n})$ remainder in norm. The main condition is that the multiple commutators of $H_0$ and $\phi$ are uniformly bounded in operator norm up to the $(n+1)$-th order. We then apply the abstract theory to a class of nonlocal Schr\"odinger equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$, proving that any solution with compactly supported initial state remains approximately supported, up to a polynomially suppressed tail in $L^2$-norm, inside a linearly spreading region around the initial support for all $t\ne0$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the multiplicity of solutions for the $p(x)$-Laplacian problems involving the supercritical Sobolev growth via Ricceri's principle. By means of the truncation combining with De Giorgi iteration, we can extend the result about subcritical and critical growth to the supercritical growth and obtain at least three solutions for the $p(x)$ Laplacian problem.</description>

      <title>Global Well-posedness for the Fourth-order Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local and global well-posedness for the one dimensional fourth-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation are established in the modulation space $M^{s}_{2,q}$ for $s\geq \frac12$ and $2\leq q &lt;\infty$. The local result is based on the $U^p-V^p$ spaces and crucial bilinear estimates. The key ingredient to obtain the global well-posedness is that we achieve a-priori estimates of the solution in modulation spaces by utilizing the power series expansion of the perturbation determinant introduced by Killip-Visan-Zhang for completely integrable PDEs.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the MHD boundary layer equation in the Sobolev Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional MHD boundary layer equations. For small perturbation around a tangential background magnetic field, we obtain the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of solutions in Sobolev spaces. The proof relies on the novel combination of the well-explored cancellation mechanism and the idea of linearly-good unknowns, and in fact we use the former idea to deal with the top tangential derivatives and the latter one admitting fast decay rate to control lower-order derivatives.</description>

Abstract: We prove existence of multiple radial solutions to the Dirichlet problem for nonlinear equations involving the mean curvature operator in Lorentz-Minkowski space and a nonlinear term of concave-convex type. Solutions are found using Szulkin's critical point theory for non-smooth functional. Multiplicity results are also given for some cases in which the nonlinearity depends also on the gradient of the solution.</description>

      <title>Comparison principle for general nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi equations with superlinear gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the comparison principle for discontinuous viscosity sub- and supersolutions of nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi equations, with superlinear and coercive gradient terms. The nonlocal terms are integro-differential operators in L\'evy form, with general measures: $x$-dependent, possibly degenerate and without any restriction on the order. The measures must satisfy a combined Wasserstein/Total Variation-continuity assumption, which is one of the weakest conditions used in the context of viscosity approach for this type of integro-differential PDEs. The proof relies on a regularizing effect due to the gradient growth. We present several examples of applications to PDEs with different types of nonlocal operators (measures with density, operators of variable order, L\'evy-It\^o operators).</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove a theorem of C.~Miranda for the single and double layer potential corresponding to the fundamental solution of a second order differential operator with constant coefficients in Schauder spaces in the limiting case in which the open set is of class $C^{m,1}$ and the densities are of class $C^{m-1,1}$ for the single layer potential and of class $C^{m,1}$ for the double layer potential for some nonzero natural number $m$. The treatment of the limiting case requires generalized Schauder spaces.</description>

      <title>Existence of an extremal function of Sobolev critical embedding with an $\alpha$-homogeneous weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous publication [{\em Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations}, 60(1):Paper No. 16, 27, 2021], we delved into examining a critical Sobolev-type embedding of a Sobolev weighted space into an exponential weighted Orlicz space. We specifically determined the optimal Moser-type constant for this embedding, utilizing the monomial weight introduced by Cabr\'e and Ros-Oton [{\em J. Differential Equations}, 255(11):4312--4336, 2013]. Towards the conclusion of that paper, we pledged to explore the existence of an extremal function within this framework.
  In this current work, we not only provide a positive affirmation to this inquiry but extend it to a broader range of weights known as \emph{$\alpha$-homogeneous weights}.</description>

      <title>Contact discontinuities for 2-D isentropic Euler are unique in 1-D but wildly non-unique otherwise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for studying non-uniqueness of the Riemann problem for the isentropic compressible Euler system in two spatial dimensions, and in this paper we present the most delicate result of our method: non-uniqueness of the contact discontinuity. Our approach is computational, and uses the pressure law as an additional degree of freedom.
  The stability of the contact discontinuities for this system is a major open problem (see Gui-Qiang Chen and Ya-Guang Wang [Nonlinear partial differential equations, volume 7 of Abel Symposia. Springer, Heidelberg, 2012.]).
  We find a smooth pressure law $p$, verifying the physically relevant condition $p'&gt;0$, such that for the isentropic compressible Euler system with this pressure law, contact discontinuity initial data is wildly non-unique in the class of bounded, admissible weak solutions. This result resolves the question of uniqueness for contact discontinuity solutions in the compressible regime.
  Moreover, in the same regularity class in which we have non-uniqueness of the contact discontinuity, i.e. $L^\infty$, with no $BV$ regularity or self-similarity, we show that the classical contact discontinuity solution to the two-dimensional isentropic compressible Euler system is in fact unique in the class of bounded, admissible weak solutions if we restrict to 1-D solutions.</description>

      <title>A Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) Methodology for Coupled Moving Boundary PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is a novel multi-task learning framework useful for solving physical problems modeled using differential equations (DEs) by integrating the knowledge of physics and known constraints into the components of deep learning. A large class of physical problems in materials science and mechanics involve moving boundaries, where interface flux balance conditions are to be satisfied while solving DEs. Examples of such systems include free surface flows, shock propagation, solidification of pure and alloy systems etc. While recent research works have explored applicability of PINNs for an uncoupled system (such as solidification of pure system), the present work reports a PINN-based approach to solve coupled systems involving multiple governing parameters (energy and species, along with multiple interface balance equations). This methodology employs an architecture consisting of a separate network for each variable with a separate treatment of each phase, a training strategy which alternates between temporal learning and adaptive loss weighting, and a scheme which progressively reduces the optimisation space. While solving the benchmark problem of binary alloy solidification, it is distinctly successful at capturing the complex composition profile, which has a characteristic discontinuity at the interface and the resulting predictions align well with the analytical solutions. The procedure can be generalised for solving other transient multiphysics problems especially in the low-data regime and in cases where measurements can reveal new physics.</description>

      <title>Foundations on k-contact geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: k-Contact geometry appeared as a generalisation of contact geometry to analyse field theories. This work provides a new insightful approach to k-contact geometry by devising a theory of k-contact forms and proving that the kernel of a k-contact form is locally equivalent to a distribution of corank k that is distributionally maximally non-integrable and admits k commuting Lie symmetries: a so-called k-contact distribution. Compact manifolds admitting a global k-contact form are analysed, we give necessary topological conditions for their existence, k-contact Lie groups are defined and studied, we extend the Weinstein conjecture for the existence of closed orbits of Reeb vector fields in compact manifolds to the k-contact setting after studying compact low-dimensional manifolds endowed with a global k-contact form, and we provide some physical applications of some of our results. Polarisations for k-contact distributions are introduced and it is shown that a polarised k-contact distribution is locally diffeomorphic to the Cartan distribution of the first-order jet bundle over a fibre bundle of order k, which is a globally defined polarised k-contact distribution. Then, we relate k-contact manifolds to presymplectic and k-symplectic manifolds on fibre bundles of larger dimension and define for the first time types of submanifolds in k-contact geometry. We also review the theory of Hamiltonian k-vector fields, studying Hamilton-De Donder-Weyl equations in general and in Lie groups, which are here studied in an unprecedented manner. A theory of k-contact Hamiltonian vector fields is developed, which describes the theory of characteristics for Lie symmetries for first-order partial differential equations in a k-contact Hamiltonian manner. Our new Hamiltonian k-contact techniques are illustrated by analysing Hamilton-Jacobi and Dirac equations.</description>

      <title>Regularisation by multiplicative noise for reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation in $1+1$ dimensions driven by multiplicative space-time white noise, with a distributional drift belonging to a Besov-H\"older space with any regularity index larger than $-1$. We assume that the diffusion coefficient is a regular function which is bounded away from zero. By using a combination of stochastic sewing techniques and Malliavin calculus, we show that the equation admits a unique solution.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove existence of a unique global-in-time weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations that govern the motion of a compressible viscous fluid with density-dependent viscosity in two-dimensional space. The initial velocity belongs to the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)$, and the initial fluid density is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous on both sides of a $\mathscr{C}^{1+\alpha}$-regular interface with some geometrical assumption. We prove that this configuration persists over time: the initial interface is transported by the flow to an interface that maintains the same regularity as the initial one.
  Our result generalizes previous known of Hoff [21], Hoff and Santos [22] concerning the propagation of regularity for discontinuity surfaces by allowing more general nonlinear pressure law and density-dependent viscosity. Moreover, it supplements the work by Danchin, Fanelli and Paicu [6] with global-in-time well-posedness, even for density-dependent viscosity and we achieve uniqueness in a large space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mean-field dynamics of stochastic McKean differential equations with heterogeneous particle interactions described by large network structures. To express a wide range of graphs, from dense to sparse structures, we incorporate the recently developed graph limit theory of graphops into the limiting McKean--Vlasov equations. Global stability of the splay steady state is proven via a generalized entropy method, leading to explicit graph-structure dependent decay rates. We highlight the robustness of the entropy approach by extending the results to the closely related Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model with intrinsic frequency distribution. We also present central examples of random graphs, such as power law graphs and the spherical graphop, and analyze the limitations of the applied methodology.</description>

      <title>Quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for classical capillarity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider capillarity functionals which measure the perimeter of sets contained in a Euclidean half-space assigning a constant weight $\lambda \in (-1,1)$ to the portion of the boundary that touches the boundary of the half-space. Depending on $\lambda$, sets that minimize this capillarity perimeter among those with fixed volume are known to be suitable truncated balls lying on the boundary of the half-space.
  We first give a new proof based on an ABP-type technique of the sharp isoperimetric inequality for this class of capillarity problems. Next we prove two quantitative versions of the inequality: a first sharp inequality estimates the Fraenkel asymmetry of a competitor with respect to the optimal bubbles in terms of the energy deficit; a second inequality estimates a notion of asymmetry for the part of the boundary of a competitor that touches the boundary of the half-space in terms of the energy deficit.
  After a symmetrization procedure, the quantitative inequalities follow from a novel combination of a quantitative ABP method with a selection-type argument.</description>

      <title>The Maslov index, degenerate crossings and the stability of pulse solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the scalar Swift-Hohenberg equation with quadratic-cubic nonlinearity, it is known that symmetric pulse solutions exist for certain parameter regions. In this paper we develop a method to determine the spectral stability of these solutions by associating a Maslov index to them. This requires extending the method of computing the Maslov index introduced by Robbin and Salamon [Topology 32, no.4 (1993): 827-844] to so-called degenerate crossings. We extend their formulation of the Maslov index to degenerate crossings of general order in the case where the intersection is fully degenerate, meaning that if the dimension of the intersection is k, then each of the k crossings is a degenerate one. We then argue that, in this case, this index coincides with the number of unstable eigenvalues for the linearized evolution equation. Furthermore, we develop a numerical method to compute the Maslov index associated to symmetric pulse solutions. Finally, we consider several solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation and use our method to characterize their stability.</description>

      <title>Higher order hypoelliptic damped wave equations on graded Lie groups with data from negative order Sobolev spaces: the critical case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb G$ be a graded Lie group with homogeneous dimension $Q$. In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for a semilinear hypoelliptic damped wave equation involving a positive Rockland operator $\mathcal{R}$ of homogeneous degree $\nu\geq 2$ on $\mathbb G$ with power type nonlinearity $|u|^p$ and initial data taken from negative order homogeneous Sobolev space $\dot H^{-\gamma}(\mathbb G), \gamma&gt;0,$ for the critical exponent case $p=1+\frac{2\nu}{Q+2\gamma}.$ We also explore the diffusion phenomenon of the higher-order hypoelliptic damped wave equations on graded Lie groups with initial data belonging to Sobolev spaces of negative order. We emphasize that our results are also new, even in the setting of higher-order differential operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and more generally, on stratified Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Uniform counterexamples to the convergence problem for periodic dispersive equations with a polynomial symbol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the setting of Carleson's convergence problem for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation $i\, \partial_t u + (-\Delta)^{a/2}u=0$ with $a &gt; 1$ in $\mathbb R^d$, which has Fourier symbol $P(\xi) = |\xi|^a$, the Sobolev exponent $d/(2(d+1))$ is sufficient, but it is not known whether this condition is necessary. In this article, we show that in the periodic problem in $\mathbb T^d$ the exponent $d/(2(d+1))$ is necessary for all non-singular polynomial symbols $P$ regardless of the degree of $P$. Among the differential operators covered, we highlight the natural powers of the Laplacian $\Delta^k$ for $k \in \mathbb N$.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that positive Green's operators are not necessarily positivity preserving. In this paper we investigate the matter of just how far from being positivity preserving a positive Green's operator can be. We will also identify a broad class of Green's operators that are not necessarily positivity preserving but have properties related to positivity preservation that one expects from positivity preserving Green's operators.</description>

Abstract: We consider a variational model of electrified liquid drops, involving competition between surface tension and charge repulsion. Since the natural model happens to be ill-posed, we show that by adding to the perimeter a Willmore-type energy, the problem turns back to be well-posed. We also prove that for small charge the droplets is spherical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of zeroes of trigonometric polynomials under repeated differentiation. We show that if the zeroes of a real-rooted, degree $d$ trigonometric polynomial are distributed according to some probability measure $\nu$ in the large $d$ limit, then the zeroes of its $[2td]$-th derivative, where $t&gt;0$ is fixed, are distributed according to the free multiplicative convolution of $\nu$ and the free unitary Poisson distribution with parameter $t$. In the simplest special case, our result states that the zeroes of the $[2td]$-th derivative of the trigonometric polynomial $(\sin \frac \theta 2)^{2d}$ (which can be thought of as the trigonometric analogue of the Laguerre polynomials) are distributed according to the free unitary Poisson distribution with parameter $t$, in the large $d$ limit. The latter distribution is defined in terms of the function $\zeta=\zeta_t(\theta)$ which solves the implicit equation $\zeta - t \tan \zeta = \theta$ and satisfies $$ \zeta_t(\theta)= \theta + t \tan (\theta + t \tan (\theta + t \tan (\theta +\ldots))), \qquad \mathrm{Im}\, \theta &gt;0, \;\; t&gt;0. $$</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorems for Smooth Optimal Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the central objects in the theory of optimal transport is the Brenier map: the unique monotone transformation which pushes forward an absolutely continuous probability law onto any other given law. A line of recent work has analyzed $L^2$ convergence rates of plugin estimators of Brenier maps, which are defined as the Brenier map between density estimators of the underlying distributions. In this work, we show that such estimators satisfy a pointwise central limit theorem when the underlying laws are supported on the flat torus of dimension $d \geq 3$. We also derive a negative result, showing that these estimators do not converge weakly in $L^2$ when the dimension is sufficiently large. Our proofs hinge upon a quantitative linearization of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, which may be of independent interest. This result allows us to reduce our problem to that of deriving limit laws for the solution of a uniformly elliptic partial differential equation with a stochastic right-hand side, subject to periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence of a value for two-player zero-sum stopper vs. singular-controller games on finite-time horizon, when the underlying dynamics is one-dimensional, diffusive and bound to evolve in $[0,\infty)$. We show that the value is the maximal solution of a variational inequality with both obstacle and gradient constraint and satisfying a Dirichlet boundary condition at $[0,T)\times\{0\}$. Moreover, we obtain an optimal strategy for the stopper. In order to achieve our goals, we rely on new probabilistic methods, yielding gradient bounds and equi-continuity for the solutions of penalised partial differential equations that approximate the variational inequality.</description>
