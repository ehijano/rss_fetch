      <title>Construction of Toroidal Polyhedra corresponding to perfect Chains of wild Tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1957, Steinhaus proved that a chain of regular tetrahedra, meeting face-to-face and forming a closed loop does not exist. Over the years, various modifications of this statement have been considered and analysed. Weakening the statement by only requiring the tetrahedra of a chain to be wild, i.e. having all faces congruent, results in various examples of such chains. In this paper, we elaborate on the construction of these chains of wild tetrahedra. We therefore introduce the notions of chains and clusters of wild tetrahedra and relate these structures to simplicial surfaces. We establish that clusters and chains of wild tetrahedra can be described by polyhedra in Euclidean 3-space. As a result, we present methods to construct toroidal polyhedra arising from chains and provide a census of such toroidal polyhedra consisting of up to 20 wild tetrahedra. Here, we classify toroidal polyhedra with respect to self-intersections and reflection symmetries. We further prove the existence of an infinite family of toroidal polyhedra emerging from chains of wild tetrahedra and present clusters of wild tetrahedra that yield polyhedra of higher genera.</description>

      <title>Sampling from convex sets with a cold start using multiscale decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04439v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Running a random walk in a convex body $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is a standard approach to sample approximately uniformly from the body. The requirement is that from a suitable initial distribution, the distribution of the walk comes close to the uniform distribution $\pi_K$ on $K$ after a number of steps polynomial in $n$ and the aspect ratio $R/r$ (i.e., when $rB_2 \subseteq K \subseteq RB_{2}$).
  Proofs of rapid mixing of such walks often require the probability density $\eta_0$ of the initial distribution with respect to $\pi_K$ to be at most $\mathrm{poly}(n)$: this is called a "warm start". Achieving a warm start often requires non-trivial pre-processing before starting the random walk. This motivates proving rapid mixing from a "cold start", wherein $\eta_0$ can be as high as $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(n))$. Unlike warm starts, a cold start is usually trivial to achieve. However, a random walk need not mix rapidly from a cold start: an example being the well-known "ball walk". On the other hand, Lov\'asz and Vempala proved that the "hit-and-run" random walk mixes rapidly from a cold start. For the related coordinate hit-and-run (CHR) walk, which has been found to be promising in computational experiments, rapid mixing from a warm start was proved only recently but the question of rapid mixing from a cold start remained open.
  We construct a family of random walks inspired by classical decompositions of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ into countably many axis-aligned dyadic cubes. We show that even with a cold start, the mixing times of these walks are bounded by a polynomial in $n$ and the aspect ratio. Our main technical ingredient is an isoperimetric inequality for $K$ for a metric that magnifies distances between points close to the boundary of $K$. As a corollary, we show that the CHR walk also mixes rapidly both from a cold start and from a point not too close to the boundary of $K$.</description>
