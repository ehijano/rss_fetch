      <title>RealClass: A Framework for Classroom Speech Simulation with Public Datasets and Game Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the development of AI-driven speech models for education. Classroom datasets remain limited and not publicly available, and the absence of dedicated classroom noise or Room Impulse Response (RIR) corpora prevents the use of standard data augmentation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom noise and RIRs using game engines, a versatile framework that can extend to other domains beyond the classroom. Building on this methodology, we present RealClass, a dataset that combines a synthesized classroom noise corpus with a classroom speech dataset compiled from publicly available corpora. The speech data pairs a children's speech corpus with instructional speech extracted from YouTube videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions. Experiments on clean and noisy speech show that RealClass closely approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable asset in the absence of abundant real classroom speech.</description>

      <title>Emotional Text-To-Speech Based on Mutual-Information-Guided Emotion-Timbre Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current emotional Text-To-Speech (TTS) and style transfer methods rely on reference encoders to control global style or emotion vectors, but do not capture nuanced acoustic details of the reference speech. To this end, we propose a novel emotional TTS method that enables fine-grained phoneme-level emotion embedding prediction while disentangling intrinsic attributes of the reference speech. The proposed method employs a style disentanglement method to guide two feature extractors, reducing mutual information between timbre and emotion features, and effectively separating distinct style components from the reference speech. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline TTS systems in generating natural and emotionally rich speech. This work highlights the potential of disentangled and fine-grained representations in advancing the quality and flexibility of emotional TTS systems.</description>

      <title>SingMOS-Pro: An Comprehensive Benchmark for Singing Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro expands annotations of the additional part to include lyrics, melody, and overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets, spanning from early systems to recent advances. Each clip receives at least five ratings from professional annotators, ensuring reliability and consistency. Furthermore, we explore how to effectively utilize MOS data annotated under different standards and benchmark several widely used evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong baselines and practical references for future research. The dataset can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TangRain/SingMOS-Pro.</description>

      <title>HRTFformer: A Spatially-Aware Transformer for Personalized HRTF Upsampling in Immersive Audio Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are starting to be introduced in many commercial immersive audio applications and are crucial for realistic spatial audio rendering. However, one of the main hesitations regarding their introduction is that creating personalized HRTFs is impractical at scale due to the complexities of the HRTF measurement process. To mitigate this drawback, HRTF spatial upsampling has been proposed with the aim of reducing measurements required. While prior work has seen success with different machine learning (ML) approaches, these models often struggle with long-range spatial consistency and generalization at high upsampling factors. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture for HRTF upsampling, leveraging the attention mechanism to better capture spatial correlations across the HRTF sphere. Working in the spherical harmonic (SH) domain, our model learns to reconstruct high-resolution HRTFs from sparse input measurements with significantly improved accuracy. To enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a neighbor dissimilarity loss that promotes magnitude smoothness, yielding more realistic upsampling. We evaluate our method using both perceptual localization models and objective spectral distortion metrics. Experiments show that our model surpasses leading methods by a substantial margin in generating realistic, high-fidelity HRTFs.</description>

      <title>MelCap: A Unified Single-Codebook Neural Codec for High-Fidelity Audio Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have recently emerged as powerful tools for high-quality and low-bitrate audio compression, leveraging deep generative models to learn latent representations of audio signals. However, existing approaches either rely on a single quantizer that only processes speech domain, or on multiple quantizers that are not well suited for downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose MelCap, a unified "one-codebook-for-all" neural codec that effectively handles speech, music, and general sound. By decomposing audio reconstruction into two stages, our method preserves more acoustic details than previous single-codebook approaches, while achieving performance comparable to mainstream multi-codebook methods. In the first stage, audio is transformed into mel-spectrograms, which are compressed and quantized into compact single tokens using a 2D tokenizer. A perceptual loss is further applied to mitigate the over-smoothing artifacts observed in spectrogram reconstruction. In the second stage, a Vocoder recovers waveforms from the mel discrete tokens in a single forward pass, enabling real-time decoding. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that MelCap achieves quality on comparable to state-of-the-art multi-codebook codecs, while retaining the computational simplicity of a single-codebook design, thereby providing an effective representation for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Exploring Resolution-Wise Shared Attention in Hybrid Mamba-U-Nets for Improved Cross-Corpus Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in speech enhancement have shown that models combining Mamba and attention mechanisms yield superior cross-corpus generalization performance. At the same time, integrating Mamba in a U-Net structure has yielded state-of-the-art enhancement performance, while reducing both model size and computational complexity. Inspired by these insights, we propose RWSA-MambaUNet, a novel and efficient hybrid model combining Mamba and multi-head attention in a U-Net structure for improved cross-corpus performance. Resolution-wise shared attention (RWSA) refers to layerwise attention-sharing across corresponding time- and frequency resolutions. Our best-performing RWSA-MambaUNet model achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on two out-of-domain test sets. Notably, our smallest model surpasses all baselines on the out-of-domain DNS 2020 test set in terms of PESQ, SSNR, and ESTOI, and on the out-of-domain EARS-WHAM_v2 test set in terms of SSNR, ESTOI, and SI-SDR, while using less than half the model parameters and a fraction of the FLOPs.</description>

      <title>Bias beyond Borders: Global Inequalities in AI-Generated Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent years have seen remarkable progress in music generation models, research on their biases across countries, languages, cultures, and musical genres remains underexplored. This gap is compounded by the lack of datasets and benchmarks that capture the global diversity of music. To address these challenges, we introduce GlobalDISCO, a large-scale dataset consisting of 73k music tracks generated by state-of-the-art commercial generative music models, along with paired links to 93k reference tracks in LAION-DISCO-12M. The dataset spans 147 languages and includes musical style prompts extracted from MusicBrainz and Wikipedia. The dataset is globally balanced, representing musical styles from artists across 79 countries and five continents. Our evaluation reveals large disparities in music quality and alignment with reference music between high-resource and low-resource regions. Furthermore, we find marked differences in model performance between mainstream and geographically niche genres, including cases where models generate music for regional genres that more closely align with the distribution of mainstream styles.</description>

      <title>Multi-bit Audio Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Timbru, a post-hoc audio watermarking model that achieves state-of-the-art robustness and imperceptibility trade-offs without training an embedder-detector model. Given any 44.1 kHz stereo music snippet, our method performs per-audio gradient optimization to add imperceptible perturbations in the latent space of a pretrained audio VAE, guided by a combined message and perceptual loss. The watermark can then be extracted using a pretrained CLAP model. We evaluate 16-bit watermarking on MUSDB18-HQ against AudioSeal, WavMark, and SilentCipher across common filtering, noise, compression, resampling, cropping, and regeneration attacks. Our approach attains the best average bit error rates, while preserving perceptual quality, demonstrating an efficient, dataset-free path to imperceptible audio watermarking.</description>

      <title>SoundReactor: Frame-level Online Video-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation models operate offline, assuming an entire video sequence or chunks of frames are available beforehand. This critically limits their use in interactive applications such as live content creation and emerging generative world models. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task of frame-level online V2A generation, where a model autoregressively generates audio from video without access to future video frames. Furthermore, we propose SoundReactor, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first simple yet effective framework explicitly tailored for this task. Our design enforces end-to-end causality and targets low per-frame latency with audio-visual synchronization. Our model's backbone is a decoder-only causal transformer over continuous audio latents. For vision conditioning, it leverages grid (patch) features extracted from the smallest variant of the DINOv2 vision encoder, which are aggregated into a single token per frame to maintain end-to-end causality and efficiency. The model is trained through a diffusion pre-training followed by consistency fine-tuning to accelerate the diffusion head decoding. On a benchmark of diverse gameplay videos from AAA titles, our model successfully generates semantically and temporally aligned, high-quality full-band stereo audio, validated by both objective and human evaluations. Furthermore, our model achieves low per-frame waveform-level latency (26.3ms with the head NFE=1, 31.5ms with NFE=4) on 30FPS, 480p videos using a single H100. Demo samples are available at https://koichi-saito-sony.github.io/soundreactor/.</description>

      <title>Go witheFlow: Real-time Emotion Driven Audio Effects Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music performance is a distinctly human activity, intrinsically linked to the performer's ability to convey, evoke, or express emotion. Machines cannot perform music in the human sense; they can produce, reproduce, execute, or synthesize music, but they lack the capacity for affective or emotional experience. As such, music performance is an ideal candidate through which to explore aspects of collaboration between humans and machines. In this paper, we introduce the witheFlow system, designed to enhance real-time music performance by automatically modulating audio effects based on features extracted from both biosignals and the audio itself. The system, currently in a proof-of-concept phase, is designed to be lightweight, able to run locally on a laptop, and is open-source given the availability of a compatible Digital Audio Workstation and sensors.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Speech Enhancement via Discrete Audio Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent autoregressive transformer-based speech enhancement (SE) methods have shown promising results by leveraging advanced semantic understanding and contextual modeling of speech. However, these approaches often rely on complex multi-stage pipelines and low sampling rate codecs, limiting them to narrow and task-specific speech enhancement. In this work, we introduce DAC-SE1, a simplified language model-based SE framework leveraging discrete high-resolution audio representations; DAC-SE1 preserves fine-grained acoustic details while maintaining semantic coherence. Our experiments show that DAC-SE1 surpasses state-of-the-art autoregressive SE methods on both objective perceptual metrics and in a MUSHRA human evaluation. We release our codebase and model checkpoints to support further research in scalable, unified, and high-quality speech enhancement.</description>

      <title>Do Bias Benchmarks Generalise? Evidence from Voice-based Evaluation of Gender Bias in SpeechLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour transferability in future models and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Ovi: Twin Backbone Cross-Modal Fusion for Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-video generation has often relied on complex multi-stage architectures or sequential synthesis of sound and visuals. We introduce Ovi, a unified paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules, Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate, context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips. All the demos, code and model weights are published at https://aaxwaz.github.io/Ovi</description>

      <title>TalkPlay-Tools: Conversational Music Recommendation with LLM Tool Calling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have successfully enabled generative recommenders with natural language interactions, their recommendation behavior is limited, leaving other simpler yet crucial components such as metadata or attribute filtering underutilized in the system. We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>SLAP: Learning Speaker and Health-Related Representations from Natural Language Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech encodes paralinguistic information such as demographics, voice quality, and health. Yet no audio foundation model supports zero-shot or out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to these tasks. We introduce SLAP (Speaker contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining), the first model aligning speech with natural language descriptions of speaker and health metadata through contrastive learning. SLAP combines a Vision Transformer audio encoder with text encoders, trained on more than 3400 hours across 9 datasets with diverse speaker annotations. We evaluated on 38 binary classification tasks spanning demographics, voice characteristics, and clinical assessments across 14 datasets in 7 languages. SLAP achieves 62.9% average F1 in zero-shot evaluation, a 48% relative improvement over CLAP (42.4%), while demonstrating strong OOD generalization to unseen languages and clinical populations. When fine-tuned with linear probing, SLAP reaches 69.3% F1 overall and achieves best-in-class performance on health tasks (57.9% F1), surpassing larger foundation models.</description>

      <title>Stream RAG: Instant and Accurate Spoken Dialogue Systems with Streaming Tool Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural, expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200% relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for more agentic, real-time AI assistants.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Streaming Full-Duplex End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block. Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.</description>

      <title>Mirage Fools the Ear, Mute Hides the Truth: Precise Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Polyphonic Sound Event Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound Event Detection (SED) systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications such as industrial monitoring and audio surveillance. However, their robustness against adversarial attacks has not been well explored. Existing audio adversarial attacks targeting SED systems, which incorporate both detection and localization capabilities, often lack effectiveness due to SED's strong contextual dependencies or lack precision by focusing solely on misclassifying the target region as the target event, inadvertently affecting non-target regions. To address these challenges, we propose the Mirage and Mute Attack (M2A) framework, which is designed for targeted adversarial attacks on polyphonic SED systems. In our optimization process, we impose specific constraints on the non-target output, which we refer to as preservation loss, ensuring that our attack does not alter the model outputs for non-target region, thus achieving precise attacks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation metric Editing Precison (EP) that balances effectiveness and precision, enabling our method to simultaneously enhance both. Comprehensive experiments show that M2A achieves 94.56% and 99.11% EP on two state-of-the-art SED models, demonstrating that the framework is sufficiently effective while significantly enhancing attack precision.</description>

      <title>EvolveCaptions: Empowering DHH Users Through Real-Time Collaborative Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often fail to accurately transcribe speech from Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals, especially during real-time conversations. Existing personalization approaches typically require extensive pre-recorded data and place the burden of adaptation on the DHH speaker. We present EvolveCaptions, a real-time, collaborative ASR adaptation system that supports in-situ personalization with minimal effort. Hearing participants correct ASR errors during live conversations. Based on these corrections, the system generates short, phonetically targeted prompts for the DHH speaker to record, which are then used to fine-tune the ASR model. In a study with 12 DHH and six hearing participants, EvolveCaptions reduced Word Error Rate (WER) across all DHH users within one hour of use, using only five minutes of recording time on average. Participants described the system as intuitive, low-effort, and well-integrated into communication. These findings demonstrate the promise of collaborative, real-time ASR adaptation for more equitable communication.</description>

      <title>NeRAF: 3D Scene Infused Neural Radiance and Acoustic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18213v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sound plays a major role in human perception. Along with vision, it provides essential information for understanding our surroundings. Despite advances in neural implicit representations, learning acoustics that align with visual scenes remains a challenge. We propose NeRAF, a method that jointly learns acoustic and radiance fields. NeRAF synthesizes both novel views and spatialized room impulse responses (RIR) at new positions by conditioning the acoustic field on 3D scene geometric and appearance priors from the radiance field. The generated RIR can be applied to auralize any audio signal. Each modality can be rendered independently and at spatially distinct positions, offering greater versatility. We demonstrate that NeRAF generates high-quality audio on SoundSpaces and RAF datasets, achieving significant performance improvements over prior methods while being more data-efficient. Additionally, NeRAF enhances novel view synthesis of complex scenes trained with sparse data through cross-modal learning. NeRAF is designed as a Nerfstudio module, providing convenient access to realistic audio-visual generation.</description>

      <title>PAGURI: a user experience study of creative interaction with text-to-music models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, text-to-music models have been the biggest breakthrough in automatic music generation. While they are unquestionably a showcase of technological progress, it is not clear yet how they can be realistically integrated into the artistic practice of musicians and music practitioners. This paper aims to address this question via Prompt Audio Generation User Research Investigation (PAGURI), a user experience study where we leverage recent text-to-music developments to study how musicians and practitioners interact with these systems, evaluating their satisfaction levels. We developed an online tool through which users can generate music samples and/or apply recently proposed personalization techniques based on fine-tuning to allow the text-to-music model to generate sounds closer to their needs and preferences. Using semi-structured interviews, we analyzed different aspects related to how participants interacted with the proposed tool to understand the current effectiveness and limitations of text-to-music models in enhancing users' creativity. Our research centers on user experiences to uncover insights that can guide the future development of TTM models and their role in AI-driven music creation. Additionally, they offered insightful perspectives on potential system improvements and their integration into their music practices. The results obtained through the study reveal the pros and cons of the use of TTMs for creative endeavors. Participants recognized the system's creative potential and appreciated the usefulness of its personalization features. However, they also identified several challenges that must be addressed before TTMs are ready for real-world music creation, particularly issues of prompt ambiguity, limited controllability, and integration into existing workflows.</description>

      <title>MambAttention: Mamba with Multi-Head Attention for Generalizable Single-Channel Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended (VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all reported evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Unmute the Patch Tokens: Rethinking Probing in Multi-Label Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although probing frozen models has become a standard evaluation paradigm, self-supervised learning in audio defaults to fine-tuning. A key reason is that global pooling creates an information bottleneck causing linear probes to misrepresent the embedding quality: The $\texttt{cls}$-token discards crucial token information about dispersed, localized events in multi-label audio. This weakness is rooted in the mismatch between the pretraining objective (operating globally) and the downstream task (localized events). Across a comprehensive benchmark of 13 datasets and 6 spectrogram-based encoders, we first investigate the global pooling bottleneck. We then introduce binarized prototypical probes: a lightweight and simple pooling method that learns prototypes to perform class-wise information aggregation. Despite its simplicity, our method notably outperforms linear and attentive probing. Our work establishes probing as a competitive and efficient paradigm for evaluating audio SSL models, challenging the reliance on costly fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>ARIONet: An Advanced Self-supervised Contrastive Representation Network for Birdsong Classification and Future Frame Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated birdsong classification is essential for advancing ecological monitoring and biodiversity studies. Despite recent progress, existing methods often depend heavily on labeled data, use limited feature representations, and overlook temporal dynamics essential for accurate species identification. In this work, we propose a self-supervised contrastive network, ARIONet (Acoustic Representation for Interframe Objective Network), that jointly optimizes contrastive classification and future frame prediction using augmented audio representations. The model simultaneously integrates multiple complementary audio features within a transformer-based encoder model. Our framework is designed with two key objectives: (1) to learn discriminative species-specific representations for contrastive learning through maximizing similarity between augmented views of the same audio segment while pushing apart different samples, and (2) to model temporal dynamics by predicting future audio frames, both without requiring large-scale annotations. We validate our framework on four diverse birdsong datasets, including the British Birdsong Dataset, Bird Song Dataset, and two extended Xeno-Canto subsets (A-M and N-Z). Our method consistently outperforms existing baselines and achieves classification accuracies of 98.41%, 93.07%, 91.89%, and 91.58%, and F1-scores of 97.84%, 94.10%, 91.29%, and 90.94%, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates low mean absolute errors and high cosine similarity, up to 95%, in future frame prediction tasks. Extensive experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our self-supervised learning strategy in capturing complex acoustic patterns and temporal dependencies, as well as its potential for real-world applicability in ecological conservation and monitoring.</description>

      <title>XPPG-PCA: Reference-free automatic speech severity evaluation with principal components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliably evaluating the severity of a speech pathology is crucial in healthcare. However, the current reliance on expert evaluations by speech-language pathologists presents several challenges: while their assessments are highly skilled, they are also subjective, time-consuming, and costly, which can limit the reproducibility of clinical studies and place a strain on healthcare resources. While automated methods exist, they have significant drawbacks. Reference-based approaches require transcriptions or healthy speech samples, restricting them to read speech and limiting their applicability. Existing reference-free methods are also flawed; supervised models often learn spurious shortcuts from data, while handcrafted features are often unreliable and restricted to specific speech tasks. This paper introduces XPPG-PCA (x-vector phonetic posteriorgram principal component analysis), a novel, unsupervised, reference-free method for speech severity evaluation. Using three Dutch oral cancer datasets, we demonstrate that XPPG-PCA performs comparably to, or exceeds established reference-based methods. Our experiments confirm its robustness against data shortcuts and noise, showing its potential for real-world clinical use. Taken together, our results show that XPPG-PCA provides a robust, generalizable solution for the objective assessment of speech pathology, with the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of clinical evaluations across a range of disorders. An open-source implementation is available.</description>

      <title>FlexiCodec: A Dynamic Neural Audio Codec for Low Frame Rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs are foundational to speech language models. It is expected to have a low frame rate and decoupled semantic and acoustic information. A lower frame rate codec can reduce the computational cost of speech language models by shortening the sequence length. Recent studies have developed 12.5Hz low-frame-rate audio codecs, but even lower frame rate codecs remain underexplored. We find that a major challenge for very low frame rate tokens is missing semantic information. This paper introduces FlexiCodec to address this limitation. FlexiCodec improves semantic preservation with a dynamic frame rate approach and introduces a novel architecture featuring an ASR feature-assisted dual stream encoding and Transformer bottlenecks. With dynamic frame rates, it uses less frames at information-sparse regions through adaptively merging semantically similar frames. A dynamic frame rate also allows FlexiCodec to support inference-time controllable frame rates between 3Hz and 12.5Hz. Experiments on 6.25Hz, 8.3Hz and 12.5Hz average frame rates confirm that FlexiCodec excels over baseline systems in semantic information preservation and delivers a high audio reconstruction quality. We also validate the effectiveness of FlexiCodec in language model-based TTS. Demos are available at: https://flexicodec.github.io</description>

      <title>Audio-Enhanced Vision-Language Modeling with Latent Space Broadening for High Quality Data Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based multimodal models are widely used in industrial-scale recommendation, search, and advertising systems for content understanding and relevance ranking. Enhancing labeled training data quality and cross-modal fusion significantly improves model performance, influencing key metrics such as quality view rates and ad revenue. High-quality annotations are crucial for advancing content modeling, yet traditional statistical-based active learning (AL) methods face limitations: they struggle to detect overconfident misclassifications and are less effective in distinguishing semantically similar items in deep neural networks. Additionally, audio information plays an increasing role, especially in short-video platforms, yet most pre-trained multimodal architectures primarily focus on text and images. While training from scratch across all three modalities is possible, it sacrifices the benefits of leveraging existing pre-trained visual-language (VL) and audio models. To address these challenges, we propose kNN-based Latent Space Broadening (LSB) to enhance AL efficiency and Vision-Language Modeling with Audio Enhancement (VLMAE), a mid-fusion approach integrating audio into VL models. This system deployed in production systems, leading to significant business gains.</description>

Abstract: High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) model training requires extensive and diverse text and speech data. It is challenging to procure such data from real sources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large language models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create repetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation process. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization. Tools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook valuable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also impractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in commercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges, we propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is capable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets for training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates data that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic and phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while generating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables scalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity, normalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets.</description>
