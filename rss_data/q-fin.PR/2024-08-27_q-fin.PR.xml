      <title>Unveiling Nonlinear Dynamics in Catastrophe Bond Pricing: A Machine Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the implications of using machine learning models in the pricing of catastrophe (CAT) bonds. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques, our approach uncovers nonlinear relationships and complex interactions between key risk factors and CAT bond spreads -- dynamics that are often overlooked by traditional linear regression models. Using primary market CAT bond transaction records between January 1999 and March 2021, our findings demonstrate that machine learning models not only enhance the accuracy of CAT bond pricing but also provide a deeper understanding of how various risk factors interact and influence bond prices in a nonlinear way. These findings suggest that investors and issuers can benefit from incorporating machine learning to better capture the intricate interplay between risk factors when pricing CAT bonds. The results also highlight the potential for machine learning models to refine our understanding of asset pricing in markets characterized by complex risk structures.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil Final: Backdoor attack via Stock market and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14573v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.</description>
