      <title>Homotopy Theory for Ordered Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a model structure on the category of ordered simplicial complexes, Quillen equivalent to the standard model structure on simplicial sets. This shows that simplicial complexes, which are fully combinatorial in nature, provide a new model for the homotopy theory of spaces.</description>

      <title>Double categorical equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient and user-friendly method for constructing any cofibrantly generated model structure on the category of double categories whose trivial fibrations are the "canonical" ones: the double functors which are surjective on objects, full on both horizontal and vertical morphisms, and fully faithful on squares. We show that all of these model structures are left proper and that they are localizations of the gregarious model structure introduced by Campbell. As a notable consequence, this identifies the gregarious weak equivalences as the "canonical" equivalences of double categories, an elusive notion thus far. Moreover, the nature of our method gives an explicit description of the fibrant objects in terms of lifting conditions. We use this to recover several known model structures, as well as construct several new examples whose homotopy theories encode a range of $2$-dimensional structures.</description>

      <title>Quasi-flag manifolds and moment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of topological $G$-spaces generalizing the classical flag manifolds $G/T$ of compact connected Lie groups. These spaces, which we call the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds $ F_m = F_m(G,T) $, are topological realizations of the algebras $ Q_k(W) $ of $k$-quasi-invariant polynomials of the Weyl group $ W $ in the sense that their (even-dimensional) $G$-equivariant cohomology $ H_G(F_m, {\mathbb C}) $ is naturally isomorphic to $ Q_k(W) $, where $ m $ is a $W$-invariant integer-valued function on the system of roots of $W$ and $ k = \frac{m}{2}$ or $ \frac{m+1}{2}$ depending on whether $m$ is even or odd. Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to the flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We obtain our cohomological results by constructing rational algebraic models of quasi-flag manifolds in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks introduced by B.To\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework for rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the equivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our cohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side, our approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the diagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of subgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects introduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory.</description>

      <title>Embedding calculus and Vassiliev spectral sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vassiliev spectral sequence and Sinha spectral sequence are both related to cohomology of the space of long knots $\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^3$. Although they have different origins, the Vassiliev $E_1$-page and the Sinha $E_2$-page are isomorphic (up to a degree shift). In this paper, we prove that they have isomorphic $E_\infty$-pages if the coefficient ring is a field. Together with degeneracy of the Sinha sequence, this implies that the Vassiliev sequence degenerates at $E_1$-page over $\mathbb{Q}$ including the non-diagonal part. Our result also implies that for any coefficient field, the space of finite type $n$ knot invariants is isomorphic to the space of weight systems of weight $\leq n$ if and only if the parts of the Sinha sequence of bidegree $(-i,i)$ degenerate at $E_2$ for $i\leq 2n$. For the construction of the isomorphism, we use a variant of Thom space model which was introduced in the author's previous paper and captures embedding calculus of the knot space in terms of fat diagonals. As a byproduct of the construction, we give a partial computation on differentials of unstable versions of the Vassiliev sequence which converge to finite dimensional approximations of the knot space.</description>

      <title>Interleaving Distance as an Edit distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of edit distance, which dates back to the 1960s in the context of comparing word strings, has since found numerous applications with various adaptations in computer science, computational biology, and applied topology. By contrast, the interleaving distance, introduced in the 2000s within the study of persistent homology, has become a foundational metric in topological data analysis. In this work, we show that the interleaving distance on finitely presented single- and multi-parameter persistence modules can be formulated as an edit distance. The key lies in clarifying a connection between the Galois connection and the interleaving distance, via the established relation between the interleaving distance and free presentations of persistence modules. In addition to offering new perspectives on the interleaving distance, we expect that our findings facilitate the study of stability properties of invariants of multi-parameter persistence modules.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Spatiotemporal Spread of the Ohio Overdose Epidemic with Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, techniques from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) have proven effective at capturing spatial features of multidimensional data. However, applying TDA to spatiotemporal data remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we extend previous studies of disease spread by using the Mapper algorithm to analyze the Ohio drug overdose epidemic from 2007 to 2024. We introduce a novel method for constructing covers in Mapper graphs of spatiotemporal data that respects geographic structure and highlights the time-dependent variables. Finally, we generate a Mapper visualization of regional demographics to examine how these factors relate to overdose deaths. Our approach effectively reveals temporal trends, overdose hotspots, and time-lagged patterns in relation to both geography and community demographics.</description>

      <title>Multiscale 2-Mapper -- Exploratory Data Analysis Guided by the First Betti Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mapper algorithm is a fundamental tool in exploratory topological data analysis for identifying connectivity and topological clustering in data. Derived from the nerve construction, Mapper graphs can contain additional information about clustering density when considering the higher-dimensional skeleta. To observe two-dimensional features, and capture one-dimensional topology, we construct 2-Mapper. A common issue in using Mapper algorithms is parameter choice. We develop tools to choose 2-Mapper parameters that reflect persistent Betti-1 information. Computationally, we study how cover choice affects 2-Mapper and analyze this through a computational Multiscale Mapper algorithm. We test our constructions on three-dimensional shape data, including the Klein bottle.</description>

      <title>On the Sheafification of Higher-Order Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$ (HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge (combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For $k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light -- and explore how it fails to generalize to $k&gt;0$ -- before developing novel theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the action on the deformation space of a formal group by the maximal finite subgroup $G$ of its automorphisms, at the first height where the group has nontrivial $p$-torsion for odd $p$. We show given this group $G$ there is a universal construction of a geometric model of the $G$-action via inverse Galois theory which generalizes the use of level structure to ramification data. We use configuration spaces to understand the model, and conclude that the Lubin-Tate action at $h=p-1$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group action on the configuration space of $p+1$ points on $\mathbb{P}^1$.</description>

      <title>A Fourier-Mukai Transform For KR Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex K-theory, the Fourier-Mukai transform is an isomorphism between K-theory groups of a torus and its dual torus which is defined by pullback, tensoring by the Poincar\'e line bundle and pushforward. The Fourier-Mukai transform extends to families of dual tori provided one works with twisted K-theory. The Fourier-Mukai transform is then an isomorphism between twisted K-theory groups of $T$-dual torus bundles. In this paper we prove an extension of these results to twisted KR-theory. We introduce a notion of Real $T$-duality for torus bundles with Real structures and prove the existence of Real $T$-duals. We then define a Real Fourier-Mukai transform for Real $T$-dual torus bundles and prove that it is an isomorphism. Lastly, we consider an application of these results to the families index of Real Dirac operators which is relevant to Real Seiberg-Witten theory.</description>

      <title>Sinha's spectral sequence for long knots in codimension one and non-formality of the little 2-disks operad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute some differentials of Sinha's spectral sequence for cohomology of the space of long knots modulo immersions in codimension one, mainly over a field of characteristic $2$ or $3$. This spectral sequence is closely related to Vassiliev's spectral sequence for the space of long knots in codimension $\geq 2$. We prove that the $d_2$-differential of an element is non-zero in characteristic $2$, which has already essentially been proved by Salvatore, and the $d_3$-differential of another element is non-zero in characteristic $3$. While the geometric meaning of the sequence is unclear in condimension one, these results have some applications to non-formality of operads. The result in characteristic $3$ implies planar non-formality of the standard map $C_*(E_1)\to C_*(E_2)$ in characteristic $3$, where $C_*(E_k)$ denotes the chain little $k$-disks operad. We also reprove the result of Salvatore which states that $C_*(E_2)$ is not formal as a planar operad in characteristic $2$ using the result in characteristic $2$.
  For the computation, we transfer the structure on configuration spaces behind the spectral sequence onto Thom spaces over fat diagonals through a duality between configuration spaces and fat diagonals. This procedure enables us to describe the differentials by relatively simple maps to Thom spaces. We also show that the $d_2$-differential of the generator of bidegree $(-4,2)$ is zero in characteristic $\not= 2$. This computation illustrates how one can manage the 3-term relation using the description. Although the computations in this paper are concentrated to codimension one, our method also works for codimension $\geq 2$ and we prepare most of basic notions and lemmas for general codimension.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of non-finite CL-shellable posets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shellable complexes are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of possibly different dimensions, so that the (co)homology of the constant functor over the complex is concentrated in those degrees. In this work, we introduce the concept of a stable functor -- a local weakening of fibrancy -- over a shellable poset, which ensures the vanishing of the (co)homology of such a functor in specific degrees. The methods are based on a model category structure on the category of functors indexed by a filtered poset and the combinatorial structure of shellable posets. Our techniques work over non-finite and non-pure posets and employ a description of (co)homology via explicit fibrant replacements. Applications include acyclicity criteria for Mackey functors, computation of cohomology of $j$-th exterior powers over arrangement lattices, and homological decompositions for Bianchi groups $\Gamma_d$ for $d=1,2,7$ and $11$.</description>

      <title>Computing the Topological Degree of Maps Between 2-Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an effective method for computing the topological degree of continuous functions $R:S^2 \to S^2$, where $S^2$ is the Riemann sphere. Our approach generalizes the degree formula for rational functions of complex polynomials, $\frac{f}{g}$, without common zeros. To apply our method, it is necessary to represent the function $R$ as the ratio of two continuous complex-valued functions $f$ and $g$ without common zeros. By utilizing Hopf fibration, this method reduces the problem to computing the winding number of a loop. This enables us to compute the degree of $\frac{f}{g}$ even when $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary continuous complex functions without common zeros, and the fraction has a limit at infinity (which can be finite or infinite). Specifically, if $f$ and $g$ are complex polynomials in $z$ and $\bar{z}$, and the highest-degree homogeneous component of the polynomial with the greater algebraic degree has a finite or infinite limit as $|z|\to\infty$, then the problem reduces to counting the roots of a complex polynomial inside the unit circle, obtained from this component.</description>

      <title>An Intrinsic $L_{\infty}$-Algebra on the Khovanov-Sano Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reinterprets the symmetries of equivariant Khovanov homology, discovered by Khovanov and Sano, within the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism. We identify the Shumakovitch operator $\hat{\nu}$ as a BV Laplacian whose nilpotency, a consequence of the algebra's defining relations, induces an $L_{\infty}$-algebra on homology. We prove this structure is non-trivial through explicit computations of higher brackets. Furthermore, we construct a dual $L_{\infty}$-structure, suggesting a unifying homotopy $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ symmetry. The main result of this paper is to lift this structure from homology to the chain level. Applying the Homotopy Transfer Theorem, we construct an intrinsic $L_{\infty}$-algebra on the Khovanov-Sano complex, whose $\infty$-quasi-isomorphism class is a canonical link invariant. This provides a new algebraic framework in which we conjecture the origin of Steenrod operations in knot homology.</description>
