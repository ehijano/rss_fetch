      <title>First unambiguous detection of ammonia in the atmosphere of a planetary mass companion with JWST/MIRI coronagraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly accessible mid-infrared (MIR) window offered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for exoplanet imaging is expected to provide valuable information to characterize their atmospheres. In particular, coronagraphs on board the JWST Mid-InfraRed instrument (MIRI) are capable of imaging the coldest directly imaged giant planets at the wavelengths where they emit most of their flux. The MIRI coronagraphs have been specially designed to detect the NH3 absorption around 10.5 microns, which has been predicted by atmospheric models. We aim to assess the presence of NH3 while refining the atmospheric parameters of one of the coldest companions detected by directly imaging GJ 504 b. Its mass is still a matter of debate and depending on the host star age estimate, the companion could either be placed in the brown dwarf regime or in the young Jovian planet regime. We present an analysis of MIRI coronagraphic observations of the GJ 504 system. We took advantage of previous observations of reference stars to build a library of images and to perform a more efficient subtraction of the stellar diffraction pattern. We detected the presence of NH3 at 12.5 sigma in the atmosphere, in line with atmospheric model expectations for a planetary-mass object and observed in brown dwarfs within a similar temperature range. The best-fit model with Exo-REM provides updated values of its atmospheric parameters, yielding a temperature of Teff = 512 K and radius of R = 1.08 RJup. These observations demonstrate the capability of MIRI coronagraphs to detect NH3 and to provide the first MIR observations of one of the coldest directly imaged companions. Overall, NH3 is a key molecule for characterizing the atmospheres of cold planets, offering valuable insights into their surface gravity. These observations provide valuable information for spectroscopic observations planned with JWST.</description>

      <title>Exchange of meteorites between the terrestrial planets and the Moon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the orbits of bodies ejected from the Earth, Moon, Mercury and Mars was studied. At ejection velocities about 12-14 km/s, the fraction of bodies ejected from the Earth that fall back onto the Earth was about 0.15-0.25. The total number of bodies ejected from the Earth and delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much. The probability of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with the Moon moving in its present orbit was of the order of 0.01. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mercury were about 0.02-0.08 at ejection velocities greater than 11.3 km/s. The probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from the Earth with Mars did not exceed 0.025. For the ejection of bodies from the present orbit of the Moon, probabilities of collisions of ejected bodies with planets were similar to those ejected from the Earth if we consider smaller ejection velocities from the Moon than from the Earth. The probability of a collision of a body ejected from Mars with Mars usually did not exceed 0.04 at an ejection velocity greater than 5.3 km/s. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mars and collided with Mercury was typically less than 0.08. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mars with the Earth and Venus were about 0.1-0.2 (each) at an ejection velocity between 5.05 and 10 km/s. Most of bodies ejected from Mercury fall back onto Mercury. Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from Mercury with the Earth typically did not exceed 0.02 and 0.1 at an ejection velocity less than 8 km/s and 15 km/s, respectively. The fraction of bodies ejected from Mercury and collided with Venus was greater than that with the Earth typically by an order of magnitude. Probabilities of collisions of bodies with Venus were about 0.1-0.3 at a velocity of ejection from Mercury between 4.3 and 10 km/s.</description>

      <title>Detection of H2O and CO2 in the Atmosphere of the Hot Super-Neptune WASP-166b with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the atmosphere of the hot super-Neptune WASP-166b ($P = 5.44$ d, $R_p = 6.9 \pm 0.3$ R$_\oplus$, $M_p = 32.1 \pm 1.6$ M$_\oplus$, $T_\mathrm{eq} = 1270 \pm 30$ K) orbiting an F9V star using JWST transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with NIRISS SOSS Order-1 and NIRSpec BOTS G395M/F290LP. Our combined spectrum spans wavelengths $0.85$ to $5.17$ $\mu$m (GO ID 2062, PI: Mayo). WASP-166b resides near the edge of the Hot Neptune Desert, a scarcity of intermediate-sized planets at high insolation fluxes; thus, exploring the atmospheric composition and formation processes of WASP-166b can provide insights into the mechanisms sculpting this parameter space. Our POSEIDON free chemistry retrievals confirm the detection of H$_2$O ($15.2\sigma$ significance) and detect CO$_2$ ($14.7\sigma$) for the first time in the planet atmosphere. We also find a hint of NH$_3$ ($2.3\sigma$) and an intermediate pressure cloud deck ($2.6\sigma$). Finally, we report non-detections of CH$_4$, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S. We verify our results using a TauREx free chemistry retrieval. We also measure with POSEIDON a high planetary atmospheric metallicity ($\log(Z) = 1.57^{+0.17}_{-0.18}$, $Z = 37^{+18}_{-13}$) and a potentially substellar C/O ratio for the planet ($C/O = 0.282^{+0.078}_{-0.053}$) compared to the star ($C/O_* = 0.41 \pm 0.08$), suggesting a formation pathway for WASP-166b that includes planetesimal accretion followed by core erosion or photoevaporation, which may indicate these to be plausible driving processes in the formation of the Hot Neptune Desert.</description>

      <title>Chapter 15: Open Questions and Future Directions in Titan Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter we attempt to distill the very large number of possible future inquiries of Titan into a relatively concise list of twenty high level questions - each of which of would necessarily entail a multitude of more specific investigations and studies. While this list does not encompass all possible open questions, and is divided into topics according to our preference and not in any way uniquely, we believe that it does however span a wide range of the most intriguing topics about Titan, and may form some sort of guide especially for those embarking into Titan studies for the first time. At the end of this chapter we return to explore how these four techniques may be used to answer the large, high-level open questions in Titan science.</description>

      <title>Probing exoplanetary magnetism via atomic alignment effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic magnetic fields of exoplanets affect the structure of their atmospheres and plasmaspheres and, therefore, the observational manifestations of transit absorptions. This work proposes a new method for constraining the presence or absence of relatively weak magnetic fields. The method is based on the quantum effect of atomic alignment of the lower energy level resulting in changing the absorption probabilities of individual transitions of multiplets from the equilibrium 2J+1 value. It appears to be sensitive to fields above ~0.001 G. We applied this method to some available transit observations of exoplanets and demonstrate that we indeed have the possibility to constrain the intrinsic magnetic field of some exoplanets right now. However, more precise and repetitive measurements, which might be available in near future, are needed for definite conclusions.</description>

      <title>A Planet as the Possible Cause of the HD 181327 Debris Disk Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The debris disk around HD 181327 shows a significant asymmetry in its surface brightness profile when viewed in visible light. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope STIS instrument show an arc of approximately 90 degrees of higher optical depth at a distance of 84 au from the star. We find that a 2-5 Jupiter-mass planet on a circular orbit at 62 au can produce and maintain a similar feature if the collisional lifetime of dust in the disk is at least 25 kiloyears, and smaller mass planets can produce similar results on longer timescales. We also find that the surface brightness asymmetry is much less pronounced at larger particle sizes, which may account for the fact that observations of HD181327 at longer wavelengths have not reported such an arc. We predict that if a planet is producing the arc in question, the planet is along the line joining the star to the feature, and make some estimates of its observability.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Data Calibration with Transformer Model Using Physical Constraints: A Scalable Method for Satellite Missions, Illustrated by Tianwen-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach that integrates the magnetic field data correction from the Tianwen-1 Mars mission with a neural network architecture constrained by physical principles derived from Maxwell's equation equations. By employing a Transformer based model capable of efficiently handling sequential data, the method corrects measurement anomalies caused by satellite dynamics, instrument interference, and environmental noise. As a result, it significantly improves both the accuracy and the physical consistency of the calibrated data. Compared to traditional methods that require long data segments and manual intervention often taking weeks or even months to complete this new approach can finish calibration in just minutes to hours, and predictions are made within seconds. This innovation not only accelerates the process of space weather modeling and planetary magnetospheric studies but also provides a robust framework for future planetary exploration and solar wind interaction research.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Space Weather Event of 1872 February: Sunspots, Magnetic Disturbance, and Auroral Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review observations of solar activity, geomagnetic variation, and auroral visibility for the extreme geomagnetic storm on 1872 February 4. The extreme storm (referred to here as the Chapman-Silverman storm) apparently originated from a complex active region of moderate area (\approx 500 {\mu}sh) that was favorably situated near disk center (S19{\deg} E05{\deg}). There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9--10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of \approx29 hr to Earth. Magnetograms show that the storm began with a sudden commencement at \approx14:27 UT and allow a minimum Dst estimate of {\pounds} -834 nT. Overhead aurorae were credibly reported at Jacobabad (British India) and Shanghai (China), both at 19{\deg}.9 in magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 24{\deg}. 2 in invariant latitude (ILAT). Auroral visibility was reported from 13 locations with MLAT below |20|{\deg} for the 1872 storm (ranging from |10{\deg}. 0|--|19{\deg}. 9| MLAT) versus one each for the 1859 storm (|17{\deg}. 3| MLAT) and the 1921 storm (|16.{\deg}2| MLAT). The auroral extension and conservative storm intensity indicate a magnetic storm of comparable strength to the extreme storms of 1859 September (25{\deg}.1 \pm 0{\deg}.5 ILAT and -949 \pm 31 nT) and 1921 May (27{\deg}.1 ILAT and -907 \pm 132 nT), which places the 1872 storm among the three largest magnetic storms yet observed.</description>

Abstract: The concept of electromotive field appears in various applications in space and astrophysical plasmas. A review is given on the electromotive field highlighting our current understanding of the theoretical picture and the spacecraft observations in interplanetary space. The electromotive field is a key concept to successfully close the set of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic equations and also to construct a more complete picture of space plasma turbulence. Applications to astrophysical cases (Earth magnetosphere, heliospheric shocks, interstellar medium, and relativistic jets) are also briefly introduced, as well.</description>

      <title>Force chains bias the dynamic response to impacts in rubble-pile asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact response of rubble-pile asteroids is essential for both elucidating their formation and evolution history and evaluating the efficacy of impact defense strategies. Although state-of-the-art numerical simulations have allowed for the replication of many macroscopic impact characteristics consistent with observations, the understanding of dynamics and response mechanisms within rubble-pile structures remains incomplete and requires further in-depth investigation. Such understanding is critical for assessing the effects and safety of impact defense missions. The loose structure of rubble-pile asteroids affects inhomogeneous internal stress propagation via inherent force chains, which may lead to structural fracturing. We demonstrate this phenomenon here, using a proof-of-principle two-dimensional model of granular aggregates. We find that the velocity response front to impact disturbances preferentially propagates along pre-existing force chains, with particles not in chains responding more slowly. The sites within the response zone where high dynamic stresses manifest are strongly correlated with these initial force chains, and the damages that result are predominantly located within areas enclosed by these chains. The strong correlation between pre-existing force chains and dynamic response is independent of the location, magnitude, direction of the disturbance velocity, or the aggregate's particle size distribution. All evidence suggests that the core reasons for this propagation preference lie in the structural heterogeneity of granular aggregates and the resulting differences in mechanical wave propagation. This investigation provides guidance for future research aimed at quantitatively assessing fragmentation risks based on the statistical properties of force chains.</description>

      <title>An estimate of resident time of the Oort Cloud new comets in planetary region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the result of our numerical orbit simulation which traces dynamical evolution of new comets coming from the Oort Cloud. We combine two dynamical models for this purpose. The first one is semi-analytic, and it models an evolving comet cloud under galactic tide and encounters with nearby stars. The second one numerically deals with planetary perturbation in the planetary region. Although our study does not include physical effects such as fading or disintegration of comets, we found that typical dynamical resident time of the comets in the planetary region is about $10^8$ years. We also found that the so-called planet barrier works when the initial orbital inclination of the comets is small. A numerical result concerning the temporary transition of the comets into other small body populations such as transneptunian objects or Centaurs is discussed.</description>
