      <title>Unique continuation for the wave equation based on a discontinuous Galerkin time discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stable unique continuation problem for the wave equation where the initial data is lacking and the solution is reconstructed using measurements in some subset of the bulk domain. Typically fairly sophisticated space-time methods have been used in previous work to obtain stable and accurate solutions to this reconstruction problem. Here we propose to solve the problem using a standard discontinuous Galerkin method for the temporal discretization and continuous finite elements for the space discretization. Error estimates are established under a geometric control condition. We also investigate two preconditioning strategies which can be used to solve the arising globally coupled space-time system by means of simple time-stepping procedures. Our numerical experiments test the performance of these strategies and highlight the importance of the geometric control condition for reconstructing the solution beyond the data domain.</description>

      <title>Energy Bounds for Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Approximations of Well-Posed Overset Grid Problems for Hyperbolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that even though the Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method is stable for hyperbolic boundary-value problems, and the overset domain problem is well-posed in an appropriate norm, the energy of the approximation is bounded by data only for fixed polynomial order and time. In the absence of dissipation, coupling of the overlapping domains is destabilizing by allowing positive eigenvalues in the system to be integrated in time. This coupling can be stabilized in one space dimension by using the upwind numerical flux. To help provide additional dissipation, we introduce a novel penalty method that applies dissipation at arbitrary points within the overlap region and depends only on the difference between the solutions. We present numerical experiments in one space dimension to illustrate the implementation of the well-posed penalty formulation, and show spectral convergence of the approximations when dissipation is applied.</description>

      <title>A general error analysis for randomized low-rank approximation with application to data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms have proven to perform well on a large class of numerical linear algebra problems. Their theoretical analysis is critical to provide guarantees on their behaviour, and in this sense, the stochastic analysis of the randomized low-rank approximation error plays a central role. Indeed, several randomized methods for the approximation of dominant eigen- or singular modes can be rewritten as low-rank approximation methods. However, despite the large variety of algorithms, the existing theoretical frameworks for their analysis rely on a specific structure for the covariance matrix that is not adapted to all the algorithms. We propose a general framework for the stochastic analysis of the low-rank approximation error in Frobenius norm for centered and non-standard Gaussian matrices. Under minimal assumptions on the covariance matrix, we derive accurate bounds both in expectation and probability. Our bounds have clear interpretations that enable us to derive properties and motivate practical choices for the covariance matrix resulting in efficient low-rank approximation algorithms. The most commonly used bounds in the literature have been demonstrated as a specific instance of the bounds proposed here, with the additional contribution of being tighter. Numerical experiments related to data assimilation further illustrate that exploiting the problem structure to select the covariance matrix improves the performance as suggested by our bounds.</description>

      <title>Computation of some dispersive equations through their iterated linearisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often the case that, while the numerical solution of the non-linear dispersive equation $\mathrm{i}\partial_t u(t)=\mathcal{H}(u(t),t)u(t)$ represents a formidable challenge, it is fairly easy and cheap to solve closely related linear equations of the form $\mathrm{i}\partial_t u(t)=\mathcal{H}_1(t)u(t)+\widetilde{\mathcal H}_2(t)u(t)$, where $\mathcal{H}_1(t)+\mathcal{H}_2(v,t)=\mathcal{H}(v,t)$. In that case we advocate an iterative linearisation procedure that involves fixed-point iteration of the latter equation to solve the former. A typical case is when the original problem is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger or Gross--Pitaevskii equation, while the `easy' equation is linear Schr\"odinger with time-dependent potential.
  We analyse in detail the iterative scheme and its practical implementation, prove that each iteration increases the order, derive upper bounds on the speed of convergence and discuss in the case of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with cubic potential the preservation of structural features of the underlying equation: the $\mathrm{L}_2$ norm, momentum and Hamiltonian energy. A key ingredient in our approach is the use of the Magnus expansion in conjunction with Hermite quadratures, which allows effective solutions of the linearised but non-autonomous equations in an iterative fashion. The resulting Magnus--Hermite methods can be combined with a wide range of numerical approximations to the matrix exponential. The paper concludes with a number of numerical experiments, demonstrating the power of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error analysis of hybrid higher order methods for the elliptic obstacle problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a posteriori error analysis of the elliptic obstacle problem is addressed using hybrid high-order methods. The method involve cell unknowns represented by degree-$r$ polynomials and face unknowns represented by degree-$s$ polynomials, where $r=0$ and $s$ is either $0$ or $1$. The discrete obstacle constraints are specifically applied to the cell unknowns. The analysis hinges on the construction of a suitable Lagrange multiplier, a residual functional and a linear averaging map. The reliability and the efficiency of the proposed a posteriori error estimator is discussed, and the study is concluded by numerical experiments supporting the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of small-strain elasto-plastic deformation using local Radial Basis Function approximation with Picard iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a numerical analysis of plastic deformation under various conditions, utilizing Radial Basis Function (RBF) approximation. The focus is on the elasto-plastic von Mises problem under plane-strain assumption. Elastic deformation is modelled using the Navier-Cauchy equation. In regions where the von Mises stress surpasses the yield stress, corrections are applied locally through a return mapping algorithm. The non-linear deformation problem in the plastic domain is solved using the Picard iteration.
  The solutions for the Navier-Cauchy equation are computed using the Radial Basis Function-Generated Finite Differences (RBF-FD) meshless method using only scattered nodes in a strong form. Verification of the method is performed through the analysis of an internally pressurized thick-walled cylinder subjected to varying loading conditions. These conditions induce states of elastic expansion, perfectly-plastic yielding, and plastic yielding with linear hardening. The results are benchmarked against analytical solutions and traditional Finite Element Method (FEM) solutions. The paper also showcases the robustness of this approach by solving case of thick-walled cylinder with cut-outs. The results affirm that the RBF-FD method produces results comparable to those obtained through FEM, while offering substantial benefits in managing complex geometries without the necessity for conventional meshing, along with other benefits of meshless methods.</description>

      <title>An adaptive finite element multigrid solver using GPU acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive finite elements combined with geometric multigrid solvers are one of the most efficient numerical methods for problems such as the instationary Navier-Stokes equations. Yet despite their efficiency, computations remain expensive and the simulation of, for example, complex flow problems can take many hours or days. GPUs provide an interesting avenue to speed up the calculations due to their very large theoretical peak performance. However, the large degree of parallelism and non-standard API make the use of GPUs in scientific computing challenging. In this work, we develop a GPU acceleration for the adaptive finite element library Gascoigne and study its effectiveness for different systems of partial differential equations. Through the systematic formulation of all computations as linear algebra operations, we can employ GPU-accelerated linear algebra libraries, which simplifies the implementation and ensures the maintainability of the code while achieving very efficient GPU utilizations. Our results for a transport-diffusion equation, linear elasticity, and the instationary Navier-Stokes equations show substantial speedups of up to 20X compared to multi-core CPU implementations.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties relative to continuous scale space for hybrid discretizations of Gaussian derivative operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of properties of two hybrid discretization methods for Gaussian derivatives, based on convolutions with either the normalized sampled Gaussian kernel or the integrated Gaussian kernel followed by central differences. The motivation for studying these discretization methods is that in situations when multiple spatial derivatives of different order are needed at the same scale level, they can be computed significantly more efficiently compared to more direct derivative approximations based on explicit convolutions with either sampled Gaussian kernels or integrated Gaussian kernels.
  While these computational benefits do also hold for the genuinely discrete approach for computing discrete analogues of Gaussian derivatives, based on convolution with the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel followed by central differences, the underlying mathematical primitives for the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, in terms of modified Bessel functions of integer order, may not be available in certain frameworks for image processing, such as when performing deep learning based on scale-parameterized filters in terms of Gaussian derivatives, with learning of the scale levels.
  In this paper, we present a characterization of the properties of these hybrid discretization methods, in terms of quantitative performance measures concerning the amount of spatial smoothing that they imply, as well as the relative consistency of scale estimates obtained from scale-invariant feature detectors with automatic scale selection, with an emphasis on the behaviour for very small values of the scale parameter, which may differ significantly from corresponding results obtained from the fully continuous scale-space theory, as well as between different types of discretization methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topology optimization governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes flows using a phase field model. Novel stabilized semi-implicit schemes for the gradient flows of Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard types are proposed for solving the resulting optimal control problem. Unconditional energy stability is shown for the gradient flow schemes in continuous and discrete spaces. Numerical experiments of computational fluid dynamics in 2d and 3d show the effectiveness and robustness of the optimization algorithms proposed.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the SQP Method for Hyperbolic PDE-Constrained Optimization in Acoustic Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the SQP method applied to a hyperbolic PDE-constrained optimization problem is considered. The model arises from the acoustic full waveform inversion in the time domain. The analysis is mainly challenging due to the involved hyperbolicity and second-order bilinear structure. This notorious character leads to an undesired effect of loss of regularity in the SQP method, calling for a substantial extension of developed parabolic techniques. We propose and analyze a novel strategy for the well-posedness and convergence analysis based on the use of a smooth-in-time initial condition, a tailored self-mapping operator, and a two-step estimation process along with Stampacchia's method for second-order wave equations. Our final theoretical result is the R-superlinear convergence of the SQP method.</description>

      <title>Detection of a piecewise linear crack with one incident wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with inverse crack scattering problems for time-harmonic acoustic waves. We prove that a piecewise linear crack with the sound-soft boundary condition in two dimensions can be uniquely determined by the far-field data corresponding to a single incident plane wave or point source. We propose two non-iterative methods for imaging the location and shape of a crack. The first one is a contrast sampling method, while the second one is a variant of the classical factorization method but only with one incoming wave. Newton's iteration method is then employed for getting a more precise reconstruction result. Numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method.</description>

      <title>Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo and Owen's boundary growth condition: A spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the convergence rate of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods under Owen's boundary growth condition [Owen, 2006] via spectral analysis. Specifically, we examine the RQMC estimator variance for the two commonly studied sequences: the lattice rule and the Sobol' sequence, applying the Fourier transform and Walsh--Fourier transform, respectively, for this analysis. Assuming certain regularity conditions, our findings reveal that the asymptotic convergence rate of the RQMC estimator's variance closely aligns with the exponent specified in Owen's boundary growth condition for both sequence types. We also provide guidance on choosing the importance sampling density to minimize RQMC estimator variance.</description>

      <title>A score-based particle method for homogeneous Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel score-based particle method for solving the Landau equation in plasmas, that seamlessly integrates learning with structure-preserving particle methods [arXiv:1910.03080]. Building upon the Lagrangian viewpoint of the Landau equation, a central challenge stems from the nonlinear dependence of the velocity field on the density. Our primary innovation lies in recognizing that this nonlinearity is in the form of the score function, which can be approximated dynamically via techniques from score-matching. The resulting method inherits the conservation properties of the deterministic particle method while sidestepping the necessity for kernel density estimation in [arXiv:1910.03080]. This streamlines computation and enhances scalability with dimensionality. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical estimate by demonstrating that the KL divergence between our approximation and the true solution can be effectively controlled by the score-matching loss. Additionally, by adopting the flow map viewpoint, we derive an update formula for exact density computation. Extensive examples have been provided to show the efficiency of the method, including a physically relevant case of Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Full error analysis of the random deep splitting method for nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with infinite activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a randomized extension of the deep splitting algorithm introduced in [Beck, Becker, Cheridito, Jentzen, and Neufeld (2021)] using random neural networks suitable to approximately solve both high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with jumps having (possibly) infinite activity. We provide a full error analysis of our so-called random deep splitting method. In particular, we prove that our random deep splitting method converges to the (unique viscosity) solution of the nonlinear PDE or PIDE under consideration. Moreover, we empirically analyze our random deep splitting method by considering several numerical examples including both nonlinear PDEs and nonlinear PIDEs relevant in the context of pricing of financial derivatives under default risk. In particular, we empirically demonstrate in all examples that our random deep splitting method can approximately solve nonlinear PDEs and PIDEs in 10'000 dimensions within seconds.</description>

      <title>Exponential time propagators for elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a computationally efficient and systematically convergent approach for elastodynamics simulations. We recast the second-order dynamical equation of elastodynamics into an equivalent first-order system of coupled equations, so as to express the solution in the form of a Magnus expansion. With any spatial discretization, it entails computing the exponential of a matrix acting upon a vector. We employ an adaptive Krylov subspace approach to inexpensively and and accurately evaluate the action of the exponential matrix on a vector. In particular, we use an apriori error estimate to predict the optimal Kyrlov subspace size required for each time-step size. We show that the Magnus expansion truncated after its first term provides quadratic and superquadratic convergence in the time-step for nonlinear and linear elastodynamics, respectively. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for one linear (linear cantilever beam) and three nonlinear (nonlinear cantilever beam, soft tissue elastomer, and hyperelastic rubber) benchmark systems. For a desired accuracy in energy, displacement, and velocity, our method allows for $10-100\times$ larger time-steps than conventional time-marching schemes such as Newmark-$\beta$ method. Computationally, it translates to a $\sim$$1000\times$ and $\sim$$10-100\times$ speed-up over conventional time-marching schemes for linear and nonlinear elastodynamics, respectively.</description>

      <title>Numerical Fuzz: A Type System for Rounding Error Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms operating on real numbers are implemented as floating-point computations in practice, but floating-point operations introduce roundoff errors that can degrade the accuracy of the result. We propose $\Lambda_{num}$, a functional programming language with a type system that can express quantitative bounds on roundoff error. Our type system combines a sensitivity analysis, enforced through a linear typing discipline, with a novel graded monad to track the accumulation of roundoff errors. We prove that our type system is sound by relating the denotational semantics of our language to the exact and floating-point operational semantics. To demonstrate our system, we instantiate $\Lambda_{num}$ with error metrics proposed in the numerical analysis literature and we show how to incorporate rounding operations that faithfully model aspects of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard. To show that $\Lambda_{num}$ can be a useful tool for automated error analysis, we develop a prototype implementation for $\Lambda_{num}$ that infers error bounds that are competitive with existing tools, while often running significantly faster. Finally, we consider semantic extensions of our graded monad to bound error under more complex rounding behaviors, such as non-deterministic and randomized rounding.</description>

      <title>Effective alpha theory certification using interval arithmetic: alpha theory over regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reexamine Smale's alpha theory as a way to certify a numerical solution to an analytic system. For a given point and a system, Smale's alpha theory determines whether Newton's method applied to this point shows the quadratic convergence to an exact solution. We introduce the alpha theory computation using interval arithmetic to avoid costly exact arithmetic. As a straightforward variation of the alpha theory, our work improves computational efficiency compared to software employing the traditional alpha theory.</description>

      <title>Geometric Decomposition and Efficient Implementation of High Order Face and Edge Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates high-order face and edge elements in finite element methods, with a focus on their geometric attributes, indexing management, and practical application. The exposition begins by a geometric decomposition of Lagrange finite elements, setting the foundation for further analysis. The discussion then extends to $H(\rm{div})$-conforming and $H(\rm{curl})$-conforming finite element spaces, adopting variable frames across differing sub-simplices. The imposition of tangential or normal continuity is achieved through the strategic selection of corresponding bases. The paper concludes with a focus on efficient indexing management strategies for degrees of freedom, offering practical guidance to researchers and engineers. It serves as a comprehensive resource that bridges the gap between theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Automatic and Computationally Efficient Alignment in Fan- and Cone-beam Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is concerned with fan- and cone-beam computed tomography with circular source trajectory, where the reconstruction inverse problem requires an accurate knowledge of source, detector and rotational axis relative positions and orientations. We address this additional inverse problem as a preceding step of the reconstruction process directly from the acquired projections. In the cone-beam case, we present a method that estimates both the detector shift (orthogonal to both focal and rotational axes) and the in-plane detector rotation (over the focal axis) based on the variable projection optimization approach. In addition and for the fan-beam case, two new strategies with low computational cost are presented to estimate the detector shift based on a fan-beam symmetry condition. The methods are validated with simulated and experimental industrial tomographic data with code examples available for both fan- and cone-beam geometries.</description>

      <title>Acoustic shape optimization using energy stable curvilinear finite differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A gradient-based method for shape optimization problems constrained by the acoustic wave equation is presented. The method makes use of high-order accurate finite differences with summation-by-parts properties on multiblock curvilinear grids to discretize in space. Representing the design domain through a coordinate mapping from a reference domain, the design shape is obtained by inverting for the discretized coordinate map. The adjoint state framework is employed to efficiently compute the gradient of the loss functional. Using the summation-by-parts properties of the finite difference discretization, we prove stability and dual consistency for the semi-discrete forward and adjoint problems. Numerical experiments verify the accuracy of the finite difference scheme and demonstrate the capabilities of the shape optimization method on two model problems with real-world relevance.</description>

      <title>Modal Analysis of the Wake Shed Behind a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine with Flexible Blades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proper orthogonal decomposition has been applied on a full-scale horizontal-axis wind turbine to shed light on the wake characteristics behind the wind turbine. In reality, the blade tip experiences high deflections even at the rated conditions which definitely alter the wake flow field, and in the case of a wind farm, may complicate the inlet conditions of the downstream wind turbine. The turbine under consideration is the full-scale model of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5MW onshore wind turbine which is accompanied by several simulation complexities including turbulence, mesh motion and fluid-structure interaction. Results indicated an almost similar modal behaviour for the rigid and flexible turbines at the wake region. In addition, more flow structures in terms of local vortices and fluctuating velocity fields take place at the far wake region. The flow structures due to the wake shed from the tower tend to move towards the center and merge with that of the nacelle leading to an integral vortical structure 2.5 diameter away from the rotor. Also, it is concluded that the exclusion of the tower leads to missing a major part of the wake structures, especially at far-wake positions.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Monte Carlo methods for the Dean-Kawasaki equation from Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic PDEs of Fluctuating Hydrodynamics are a powerful tool for the description of fluctuations in many-particle systems. In this paper, we develop and analyze a Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) scheme for the Dean--Kawasaki equation, a pivotal representative of this class of SPDEs. We prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that our MLMC scheme provides a significant reduction in computational cost (with respect to a standard Monte Carlo method) in the simulation of the Dean--Kawasaki equation. Specifically, we link this reduction in cost to having a sufficiently large average particle density, and show that sizeable cost reductions can be obtained even when we have solutions with regions of low density. Numerical simulations are provided in the two-dimensional case, confirming our theoretical predictions.
  Our results are formulated entirely in terms of the law of distributions rather than in terms of strong spatial norms: this crucially allows for MLMC speed-ups altogether despite the Dean--Kawasaki equation being highly singular.</description>

      <title>Optimal complexity of goal-oriented adaptive FEM for nonsymmetric linear elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a goal-oriented adaptive algorithm that aims to efficiently compute the quantity of interest $G(u^\star)$ with a linear goal functional $G$ and the solution $u^\star$ to a general second-order nonsymmetric linear elliptic partial differential equation. The current state of the analysis of iterative algebraic solvers for nonsymmetric systems lacks the contraction property in the norms that are prescribed by the functional analytic setting. This seemingly prevents their application in the optimality analysis of goal-oriented adaptivity. As a remedy, this paper proposes a goal-oriented adaptive iteratively symmetrized finite element method (GOAISFEM). It employs a nested loop with a contractive symmetrization procedure, e.g., the Zarantonello iteration, and a contractive algebraic solver, e.g., an optimal multigrid solver. The various iterative procedures require well-designed stopping criteria such that the adaptive algorithm can effectively steer the local mesh refinement and the computation of the inexact discrete approximations. The main results consist of full linear convergence of the proposed adaptive algorithm and the proof of optimal convergence rates with respect to both degrees of freedom and total computational cost (i.e., optimal complexity). Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and investigate the selection of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Randomized iterative methods for generalized absolute value equations: Solvability and error bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized iterative methods, such as the Kaczmarz method and its variants, have gained growing attention due to their simplicity and efficiency in solving large-scale linear systems. Meanwhile, absolute value equations (AVE) have attracted increasing interest due to their connection with the linear complementarity problem. In this paper, we investigate the application of randomized iterative methods to generalized AVE (GAVE). Our approach differs from most existing works in that we tackle GAVE with non-square coefficient matrices. We establish more comprehensive sufficient and necessary conditions for characterizing the solvability of GAVE and propose precise error bound conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a flexible and efficient randomized iterative algorithmic framework for solving GAVE, which employs sampling matrices drawn from user-specified distributions. This framework is capable of encompassing many well-known methods, including the Picard iteration method and the randomized Kaczmarz method. Leveraging our findings on solvability and error bounds, we establish both almost sure convergence and linear convergence rates for this versatile algorithmic framework. Finally, we present numerical examples to illustrate the advantages of the new algorithms.</description>

      <title>Solving Elliptic Optimal Control Problems via Neural Networks and Optimality System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a neural network based solver for optimal control problems (without / with box constraint) for linear and semilinear second-order elliptic problems. It utilizes a coupled system derived from the first-order optimality system of the optimal control problem, and employs deep neural networks to represent the solutions to the reduced system. We present an error analysis of the scheme, and provide $L^2(\Omega)$ error bounds on the state, control and adjoint in terms of neural network parameters (e.g., depth, width, and parameter bounds) and the numbers of sampling points. The main tools in the analysis include offset Rademacher complexity and boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of neural network functions. We present several numerical examples to illustrate the method and compare it with two existing ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present novel Monte Carlo (MC) and multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods to determine the unbiased covariance of random variables using h-statistics. The advantage of this procedure lies in the unbiased construction of the estimator's mean square error in a closed form. This is in contrast to conventional MC and MLMC covariance estimators, which are based on biased mean square errors defined solely by upper bounds, particularly within the MLMC. The numerical results of the algorithms are demonstrated by estimating the covariance of the stochastic response of a simple 1D stochastic elliptic PDE such as Poisson's model.</description>

      <title>Coseparable Nonnegative Tensor Factorization With T-CUR Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an important unsupervised learning method to extract meaningful features from data. To address the NMF problem within a polynomial time framework, researchers have introduced a separability assumption, which has recently evolved into the concept of coseparability. This advancement offers a more efficient core representation for the original data. However, in the real world, the data is more natural to be represented as a multi-dimensional array, such as images or videos. The NMF's application to high-dimensional data involves vectorization, which risks losing essential multi-dimensional correlations. To retain these inherent correlations in the data, we turn to tensors (multidimensional arrays) and leverage the tensor t-product. This approach extends the coseparable NMF to the tensor setting, creating what we term coseparable Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF). In this work, we provide an alternating index selection method to select the coseparable core. Furthermore, we validate the t-CUR sampling theory and integrate it with the tensor Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (t-DEIM) to introduce an alternative, randomized index selection process. These methods have been tested on both synthetic and facial analysis datasets. The results demonstrate the efficiency of coseparable NTF when compared to coseparable NMF.</description>
