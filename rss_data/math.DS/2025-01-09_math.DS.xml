      <title>Computability of Brjuno-like functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his seminal paper from 1936, Alan Turing introduced the concept of non-computable real numbers and presented examples based on the algorithmically unsolvable Halting problem. We describe a different, analytically natural mechanism for the appearance of non-computability. Namely, we show that additive sampling of orbits of certain skew products over expanding dynamics produces Turing non-computable reals. We apply this framework to Brjuno-type functions to demonstrate that they realize bijections between computable and lower-computable numbers, generalizing previous results of M. Braverman and the second author for the Yoccoz-Brjuno function to a wide class of examples, including Wilton's functions and generalized Brjuno functions.</description>

      <title>A shadowable chain recurrent set with an attached hyperbolic singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a $C^\infty$-flow on the four-dimensional sphere whose nonwandering set contains an attached hyperbolic singularity yet possesses the standard shadowing property. This gives a counterexample to a conjecture given by Arbieto, L\'{o}pez, Rego and S\'{a}nchez (Math. Annalen 390:417-437).</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive reduced-order modeling for dynamical systems with spatially localized features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a non-intrusive reduced-order modeling framework for dynamical systems with spatially localized features characterized by slow singular value decay. The proposed approach builds upon two existing methodologies for reduced and full-order non-intrusive modeling, namely Operator Inference (OpInf) and sparse Full-Order Model (sFOM) inference. We decompose the domain into two complementary subdomains which exhibit fast and slow singular value decay. The dynamics of the subdomain exhibiting slow singular value decay are learned with sFOM while the dynamics with intrinsically low dimensionality on the complementary subdomain are learned with OpInf. The resulting, coupled OpInf-sFOM formulation leverages the computational efficiency of OpInf and the high resolution of sFOM, and thus enables fast non-intrusive predictions for conditions beyond those sampled in the training data set. A novel regularization technique with a closed-form solution based on the Gershgorin disk theorem is introduced to promote stable sFOM and OpInf models. We also provide a data-driven indicator for the subdomain selection and ensure solution smoothness over the interface via a post-processing interpolation step. We evaluate the efficiency of the approach in terms of offline and online speedup through a quantitative, parametric computational cost analysis. We demonstrate the coupled OpInf-sFOM formulation for two test cases: a one-dimensional Burgers' model for which accurate predictions beyond the span of the training snapshots are presented, and a two-dimensional parametric model for the Pine Island Glacier ice thickness dynamics, for which the OpInf-sFOM model achieves an average prediction error on the order of $1 \%$ with an online speedup factor of approximately $8\times$ compared to the numerical simulation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In De Simoi J., Kaloshin V., Wei Q. "Dynamical spectral rigidity among $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric strictly convex domains close to a circle" (Appendix B coauthored with H. Hezari) Ann. of Math. 186.1 (2017), pp. 277-314 deformational spectral rigidity of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric domains close to the circle has been shown. One of the steps of the proof was to express the maximal symmetric periodic orbits in the Lazutkin parametrization. Here using the action-angle variables we find the second order approximation of Lazutkin coordinates of the maximal symmetric periodic orbits on the ellipses.</description>

      <title>Rigidity in a Fixed Number Field and a Directional $p$-Adic Littlewood Conjecture for Algebraic Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_n$ be the space of unimodular lattices in $\RR^n$ and let $A$ be the full diagonal group in $\on{SL}_n(\RR)$. It is known that compact $A$-orbits originate from moduls in totally real degree $n$ number fields. Our first result shows that for a natural family of compact orbits $(Ax_k)_k$ all originating from a fixed number field $K$, every weak limit of the Haar measures on those orbits $m_{Ax_k}$ must contain the Haar measure $m_{X_n}$ as an ergodic component. This result generalizes certain aspects of the work by Aka and Shapira in \cite{Shapira-Aka} to arbitrary dimensions, as well as elements from Shapira-Zheng in \cite{shapira2021translates}.
  For every vector $\overline \alpha\in \RR^n$ and for every rational approximation $(\overline p,q)\in \RR^n\times\RR$ we can associate the displacement vector $q\alpha-\overline p$. We focus on algebraic vectors, namely $\overline \alpha=(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)$ such that $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ span a rank $n$ number field. For these vectors, we investigate the size of their displacements as well as the distribution of their directions. We establish that algebraic vector $\overline \alpha$ satisfy the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture. Namely, we prove that \begin{equation}
  \liminf_{k \to \infty} \left( k \|k\|_p \right)^{1/n} \| k (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \|_\infty = 0. \end{equation} Additionally, we classify all limiting distributions, with a special weighting, of the sequence of directions of the defects in the $\varepsilon$-approximations of $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$. Each such limiting measure is expressed as the pushforward of an algebraic measure on $X_n$ to the sphere.
  Our proof relies on estimates of the asymptotic orders of units in fixed number fields modulo families of natural numbers and on rigidity results from \cite{ELMV1}.</description>

      <title>Discrete $\mu$-dichotomy spectrum: beyond uniformity and new insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop spectral theorems for nonautonomous linear difference systems, considering different types of $\mu$-dichotomies, both uniform and nonuniform. In the nonuniform case, intriguing scenarios emerge -- that have been employed but whose consequences have not been thoroughly explored -- which surprisingly exhibit unconventional behavior. These particular cases motivate us to introduce two novel properties of nonautonomous systems (even in the continuous-time framework), which appear to have been overlooked in the existing literature. Additionally, we introduce a new conceptualization of a nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy spectrum, which lies between the traditional nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy spectrum and the slow nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy spectrum. Moreover, and this is particularly noteworthy, we propose a conjecture that enables the derivation of spectral theorems in this new setting. Finally, contrary to what has been believed in recent years, through the lens of optimal ratio maps, we show that the nonuniform exponential dichotomy spectrum is not preserved between systems that are weakly kinematically similar.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Super-Resolution Diffusion for 6D Phase Space Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive physics-informed super-resolution diffusion is developed for non-invasive virtual diagnostics of the 6D phase space density of charged particle beams. An adaptive variational autoencoder (VAE) embeds initial beam condition images and scalar measurements to a low-dimensional latent space from which a 326 pixel 6D tensor representation of the beam's 6D phase space density is generated. Projecting from a 6D tensor generates physically consistent 2D projections. Physics-guided super-resolution diffusion transforms low-resolution images of the 6D density to high resolution 256x256 pixel images. Un-supervised adaptive latent space tuning enables tracking of time-varying beams without knowledge of time-varying initial conditions. The method is demonstrated with experimental data and multi-particle simulations at the HiRES UED. The general approach is applicable to a wide range of complex dynamic systems evolving in high-dimensional phase space. The method is shown to be robust to distribution shift without re-training.</description>

      <title>On the basins of attraction of a one-dimensional family of root finding algorithms: from Newton to Traub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of damped Traub's methods $T_\delta$ when applied to polynomials. The family of damped Traub's methods consists of root finding algorithms which contain both Newton's ($\delta=0$) and Traub's method ($\delta=1$). Our goal is to obtain several topological properties of the basins of attraction of the roots of a polynomial $p$ under $T_1$, which are used to determine a (universal) set of initial conditions for which convergence to all roots of $p$ can be guaranteed. We also numerically explore the global properties of the dynamical plane for $T_\delta$ to better understand the connection between Newton's method and Traub's method.</description>

      <title>Additive and geometric transversality of fractal sets in the integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.05480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By juxtaposing ideas from fractal geometry and dynamical systems, Furstenberg proposed a series of conjectures in the late 1960's that explore the relationship between digit expansions with respect to multiplicatively independent bases. In this work, we introduce and study - in the discrete context of the integers - analogues of some of the notions and results surrounding Furstenberg's work. In particular, we define a new class of fractal sets of integers that parallels the notion of $\times r$-invariant sets on the 1-torus and investigate the additive and geometric independence between two such fractal sets when they are structured with respect to multiplicatively independent bases. Our main results in this direction parallel the works of Furstenberg, Hochman-Shmerkin, Shmerkin, Wu, and Lindenstrauss-Meiri-Peres and include:
  -a classification of all subsets of the positive integers that are simultaneously $\times r$- and $\times s$-invariant;
  -integer analogues of two of Furstenberg's transversality conjectures pertaining to the dimensions of the intersection $A\cap B$ and the sumset $A+B$ of $\times r$- and $\times s$-invariant sets $A$ and $B$ when $r$ and $s$ are multiplicatively independent; and
  -a description of the dimension of iterated sumsets $A+A+\cdots+A$ for any $\times r$-invariant set $A$.
  We achieve these results by combining ideas from fractal geometry and ergodic theory to build a bridge between the continuous and discrete regimes. For the transversality results, we rely heavily on quantitative bounds on the $L^q$-dimensions of projections of restricted digit Cantor measures obtained recently by Shmerkin. We end by outlining a number of open questions and directions regarding fractal subsets of the integers.</description>
