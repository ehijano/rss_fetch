      <title>Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.</description>

      <title>Atom-Molecule Superradiance and Entanglement with Cavity-Mediated Three-Body Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms coupled to optical cavities offer a powerful platform for studying strongly correlated many-body physics. Here, we propose an experimental scheme for creating biatomic molecules via cavity-enhanced photoassociation from an atomic condensate. This setup realizes long-range three-body interactions mediated by tripartite cavity-atom-molecule coupling. Beyond a critical pump strength, a self-organized square lattice phase for molecular condensate emerges, resulting in hybrid atom-molecule superradiance with spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking. Distinct from previously observed ultracold bosonic (fermionic) atomic superradiance, our findings demonstrate bosonic enhancement characterized by a cubic scaling of steady-state photon number with total atom number. Additionally, strong photon-matter entanglement is shown to effectively characterize superradiant quantum phase transition. Our findings deepen the understanding of quantum superchemistry and exotic many-body nonequilibrium dynamics in cavity-coupled quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Polarons in atomic gases and two-dimensional semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we provide a comprehensive review of theoretical and experimental studies of the properties of polarons formed by mobile impurities strongly interacting with quantum many-body systems. We present a unified perspective on the universal concepts and theoretical techniques used to characterize polarons in two distinct platforms, ultracold atomic gases and atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides, which are linked by many deep parallels. We review polarons in both fermionic and bosonic environments, highlighting their similarities and differences including the intricate interplay between few- and many-body physics. Various kinds of polarons with long-range interactions or in magnetic backgrounds are discussed, and the theoretical and experimental progress towards understanding interactions between polarons is described. We outline how polaron physics, regarded as the low density limit of quantum mixtures, provides fundamental insights regarding the phase diagram of complex condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we describe how polarons may serve as quantum sensors of many-body physics in complex environments. Our work highlights the open problems, identifies new research directions and provides a comprehensive framework for this rapidly evolving research field.</description>

      <title>Supersolid dipolar phases in planar geometry: effects of tilted polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates in planar geometries is investigated, focusing on the effects of the polarization orientation. While perpendicular polarization produces a phase diagram with hexagonal, stripes, and honeycomb phases ending at a single critical point, the presence of an in-plane polarization component transforms the critical point into three critical lines, separating two phases at a time and changing radically the appearance of the phase diagram. All transition lines contain first- and second-order regions, while the phase diagram itself shows a resemblance with those displayed by quasi-one-dimensional dipolar systems. Finally, we investigate the effect of introducing an in-plane polarization on the structural properties of the phases and determine the superfluid fraction. Our results show that this process induces an axial deformation on the hexagonal and honeycomb phases, resulting in an anisotropic behavior in the long distance properties of the system like superfluidity. We expect that the rich phenomenology observed provides motivation for new experiments and theoretical works.</description>

      <title>From Complexification to Self-Similarity: New Aspects of Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are a fascinating area of condensed matter physics. The extension through complexification not only broadens the scope of this field but also offers a new framework for understanding criticality and its statistical implications. This mini review provides a concise overview of recent developments in complexification, primarily covering finite temperature and equilibrium quantum phase transitions, as well as their connection with dynamical quantum phase transitions and non-Hermitian physics, with a particular focus on the significance of Fisher zeros. Starting from the newly discovered self-similarity phenomenon associated with complex partition functions, we further discuss research on self-similar systems briefly. Finally, we offer a perspective on these aspects.</description>

      <title>Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e. the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the survival amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate another scenario of ergodicity breaking, where lines of Fisher zeros repeatedly intersect the imaginary $\beta$ axis. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of easily spotting the emergence of scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</description>

      <title>Exact Parent Hamiltonians for All Landau Level States in a Half-flux Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing topological flat bands with tailored single-particle Hilbert spaces is a critical step toward exploring many-body phases, such as those featuring anyonic excitations. One prominent example is the Kapit-Mueller model, a variant of the Harper-Hofstadter model that stabilizes lattice analogs of the lowest Landau level states. The Kapit-Mueller model is constructed based on the Poisson summation rule, an exact lattice sum rule for coherent states. In this work, we consider higher Landau-level generalizations of the Poisson summation rule, from which we derive families of parent Hamiltonians on a half-flux lattice which have exact flat bands whose flatband wavefunctions are lattice version of higher Landau level states. Focusing on generic Bravais lattices with only translation and inversion symmetries, we discuss how these symmetries enforced gaplessness and singular points for odd Landau level series, and how to achieve fully gapped parent Hamiltonians by mixing even and odd series. Our model points to a large class of tight-binding models with suitable energetic and quantum geometries that are potentially useful for realizing non-Abelian fractionalized states when interactions are included. The model exhibits fast decay hopping amplitudes, making it potentially realizable with neutral atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity in Rydberg tweezer arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a versatile platform to explore quantum magnets with dipolar XY or van-der-Waals Ising ZZ interactions. Here, we propose a scheme combining dipolar and van-der-Waals interactions between two Rydberg states, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of the former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in optical tweezer arrays. On the triangular lattice with repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of a robust supersolid phase with a critical entropy per particle $S/N \approx 0.19$ accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We further demonstrate the experimental feasibility by identifying pairs of Rydberg states in ${}^{87}$Rb realizing the required interactions. Such a lattice supersolid is long-lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat two-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for 100s of particles allowing one to directly probe the defect-induced picture of supersolids. Its thermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger scale than hitherto possible.</description>

      <title>Fr\"ohlich versus Bose-Einstein Condensation in Pumped Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnon-condensation, which emerges in pumped bosonic systems at room temperature, continues to garner great interest for its long-lived coherence. While traditionally formulated in terms of Bose-Einstein condensation, which typically occurs at ultra-low temperatures, it could potentially also be explained by Fr\"ohlich-condensation, a hypothesis of Bose-Einstein-like condensation in living systems at ambient temperatures. This prompts general questions relating to fundamental differences between coherence phenomena in open and isolated quantum systems. To that end, we introduce a simple model of bosonic condensation in an open quantum system (OQS) formulation, wherein bosons dissipatively interact with an oscillator (phonon) bath. Our derived equations of motion for expected boson occupations turns out to be similar in form to the rate equations governing Fr\"ohlich-condensation. Provided that specific system parameters result in correlations that amplify or diminish the condensation effects, we thereby posit that our treatment offers a better description of high-temperature condensation compared to traditional formulations obtained using equilibrium thermodynamics. By comparing our OQS derivation with the original uncorrelated and previous semi-classical rate equations, we furthermore highlight how both classical anti-correlations and quantum correlations alter the bosonic occupation distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and dynamics of Jones-Roberts solitons in a smoothly inhomogeneous quantum fluid. To do so, we create a superfluid of light using paraxial, near-resonant laser beam propagating through a hot rubidium vapor. We excite a bounded vortex-antivortex dipole in the superfluid and observe its transition to a rarefaction pulse and back, in agreement with the seminal predictions of Jones and Roberts. Employing an analogy with ray optics, we calculate the trajectory of the interacting vortices, deriving an effective refractive index from the inhomogeneous fluid density. Finally, we examine analytically and experimentally the superfluid velocity correlations, observing a transfer of coherence from incompressible to compressible velocity of the quantum fluid, a direct signature of the dynamical conversion between vortices and rarefaction pulse.</description>

      <title>Unconventional spin Hall effect in PT symmetric spin-orbit coupled quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the intrinsic spin Hall effect in PT symmetric, spin-orbit coupled quantum gases confined in an optical lattice. The interplay of the PT symmetry and the spin-orbit coupling leads to a doubly degenerate non-interacting band structure in which the spin polarization and the Berry curvature of any Bloch state are opposite to those of its degenerate partner. Using experimentally available systems as examples, we show that such a system with a two-component Fermi gas exhibits an intrinsic spin Hall effect akin to that found in the context of electronic materials. For a two-component Bose gas, however, an unconventional spin Hall effect emerges in which the spin polarization and the currents are coplanar and the spin Hall conductivity displays a characteristic anisotropy. We propose to detect such an unconventional spin Hall effect in harmonically trapped systems using dipole oscillations and perform extensive numerical simulations to validate the proposal. Our work paves the way for quantum simulation of the solid-state intrinsic spin Hall effect and experimental explorations of unconventional spin Hall effects in quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude, including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by the numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show that similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore, the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. Fixing instead the gauge freedom using the parallel-transport gauge uniquely decomposes Floquet dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical average-energy operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a unique Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain. We elucidate the geometric origin of inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy gap in discrete time crystals or $\pi$-edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the average-energy operator is a susceptible indicator for both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates. This work directly bridges seemingly unrelated areas of nonequilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum many-body scars in the presence of Markovian bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization. It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent dynamics.</description>
