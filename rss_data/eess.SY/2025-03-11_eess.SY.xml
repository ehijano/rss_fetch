      <title>Collaborative design of fault diagnosis and fault tolerance control under nested signal temporal logic specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications play a crucial role in defining complex temporal properties and behaviors in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, fault diagnosis (FD) and fault-tolerant control (FTC) for CPS with nonlinear dynamics remain significant challenges, particularly when dealing with nested signal temporal logic (NSTL) specifications. This paper introduces a novel framework for the collaborative design of FD and FTC, aimed at optimizing fault diagnostic performance while ensuring fault tolerance under NSTL specifications. The proposed framework consists of four key steps: (1) construction of the Signal Temporal Logic Tree (STLT), (2) fault detection via the construction of fault-tolerant feasible sets, (3) evaluation of fault detection performance, and (4) synthesis of fault-tolerant control. Initially, a controller for nonlinear systems is designed to satisfy NSTL specifications, and a fault detection observer is developed alongside fault-tolerant feasible sets. To address the challenge of maintaining solution feasibility in dynamic optimization control problems, the concept of fault-tolerant control recursive feasibility is introduced. Subsequently, suboptimal controller gains are derived through a quadratic programming approach to ensure fault tolerance. The collaborative design framework enables more rapid and accurate fault detection while preserving FTC performance. A simulation study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Drill Alignment in Surgical Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic assistance allows surgeries to be reliably and accurately executed while still under direct supervision of the surgeon, combining the strengths of robotic technology with the surgeon's expertise. This paper describes a robotic system designed to assist in surgical procedures by implementing a virtual drill guide. The system integrates virtual-fixture functionality using a novel virtual-mechanism controller with additional visual feedback. The controller constrains the tool to the desired axis, while allowing axial motion to remain under the surgeon's control. Compared to prior virtual-fixture approaches -- which primarily perform pure energy-shaping and damping injection with linear springs and dampers -- our controller uses a virtual prismatic joint to which the robot is constrained by nonlinear springs, allowing us to easily shape the dynamics of the system. We detail the calibration procedures required to achieve sufficient precision, and describe the implementation of the controller. We apply this system to a veterinary procedure: drilling for transcondylar screw placement in dogs. The results of the trials on 3D-printed bone models demonstrate sufficient precision to perform the procedure and suggest improved angular accuracy and reduced exit translation errors compared to patient specific guides (PSG). Discussion and future improvements follow.</description>

      <title>Ro-To-Go! Robust Reactive Control with Signal Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) robustness is a common objective for optimal robot control, but its dependence on history limits the robot's decision-making capabilities when used in Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches. In this work, we introduce Signal Temporal Logic robustness-to-go (Ro-To-Go), a new quantitative semantics for the logic that isolates the contributions of suffix trajectories. We prove its relationship to formula progression for Metric Temporal Logic, and show that the robustness-to-go depends only on the suffix trajectory and progressed formula. We implement robustness-to-go as the objective in an MPC algorithm and use formula progression to efficiently evaluate it online. We test the algorithm in simulation and compare it to MPC using traditional STL robustness. Our experiments show that using robustness-to-go results in a higher success rate.</description>

      <title>Fault Localization and State Estimation of Power Grid under Parallel Cyber-Physical Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel cyber-physical attacks (PCPA) refer to those attacks on power grids by disturbing/cutting off physical transmission lines and meanwhile blocking transmission of measurement data to dwarf or delay the system protection and recovery actions. Such fierce hostile attacks impose critical threats to the modern power grids when there is a fusion of power grids and telecommunication technologies. In this paper, we investigate the fault diagnosis problem of faulty transmission lines under a broader spectrum of PCPA for a linearized (or DC) power flow model. The physical attack mechanism of PCPA includes not only disconnection but also admittance value modification on transmission lines, for example, by invading distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS). To tackle the problem, we first recover the information of voltage phase angles within the attacked area. Using the information of voltage phase angle and power injection of buses, a graph attention network-based fault localization (GAT-FL) algorithm is proposed to find the locations of the physical attacks. By capitalizing on the feature extraction capability of the GAT on graph data, the fault localization algorithm outperforms the existing results when under cyber attacks, e.g., denial of service (DoS) attacks. A line state identification algorithm is then developed to identify the states of the transmission lines within the attacked area. Specifically, the algorithm restores the power injection of buses within the attacked area and then identities the state of all the transmission lines within the attacked area by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. Experimental simulations are effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithms.</description>

      <title>Automating Hot-Rolling: Designing an Integrated Mechatronics System for Enhanced Efficiency in Sheet Metal Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot-rolling process is a critical stage in sheet metal production within the heavy steel industry. Traditionally, parameter adjustments such as sheet metal velocity and roll gap are performed manually, leading to inefficiencies and limited precision. This project introduces an integrated mechatronics system designed to automate the control of rolling speed and sheet metal thickness, enhancing efficiency, consistency, and quality. The proposed system consists of a pair of rolls applying compression loads, with a mechanism for gap control, suitable motors and sensors, and dynamic modeling to optimize performance. Through simulation and practical implementation strategies, we demonstrate the feasibility of automating the hot-rolling process. By integrating mechatronics, this solution aims to modernize sheet metal production, improve productivity, and enhance product quality in the steel industry.</description>

      <title>From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part III: Stochastic Process Modeling and Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the third part of a series of studies that model the target trajectory, which describes the target state evolution over continuous time, as a sample path of a stochastic process (SP). By adopting a deterministic-stochastic decomposition framework, we decompose the learning of the trajectory SP into two sequential stages: the first fits the deterministic trend of the trajectory using a curve function of time, while the second estimates the residual stochastic component through parametric learning of either a Gaussian process (GP) or Student's-$t$ process (StP). This leads to a Markov-free data-driven tracking approach that produces the continuous-time trajectory with minimal prior knowledge of the target dynamics. Notably, our approach explicitly models both the temporal correlations of the state sequence and of measurement noises through the SP framework. It does not only take advantage of the smooth trend of the target but also makes use of the long-term temporal correlation of both the data noise and the model fitting error. Simulations in four maneuvering target tracking scenarios have demonstrated its effectiveness and superiority in comparison with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Establishment and Solution of a Multi-Stage Decision Model Based on Hypothesis Testing and Dynamic Programming Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-stage decision-making model that integrates hypothesis testing and dynamic programming algorithms to address complex decision-making scenarios.Initially,we develop a sampling inspection scheme that controls for both Type I and Type II errors using a simple random sampling method without replacement,ensuring the randomness and representativeness of the sample while minimizing selection bias.Through the application of hypothesis testing theory,a hypothesis testing model concerning the defect rate is established,and formulas for the approximate distribution of the sample defect rate and the minimum sample size required under two different scenarios are derived. Subsequently,a multi-stage dynamic programming decision model is constructed.This involves defining the state transition functions and stage-specific objective functions,followed by obtaining six optimal decision strategies under various conditions through backward recursion.The results demonstrate the model's potent capability for multi-stage decision-making and its high interpretability,offering significant advantages in practical applications.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised C-Uniform Trajectory Sampler with Applications to Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive controllers generate trajectories by sampling control inputs from a fixed, simple distribution such as the normal or uniform distributions. This sampling method yields trajectory samples that are tightly clustered around a mean trajectory. This clustering behavior in turn, limits the exploration capability of the controller and reduces the likelihood of finding feasible solutions in complex environments. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by either reshaping the resulting trajectory distribution or increasing the sample entropy to enhance diversity and promote exploration. In our recent work, we introduced the concept of C-Uniform trajectory generation [1] which allows the computation of control input probabilities to generate trajectories that sample the configuration space uniformly. In this work, we first address the main limitation of this method: lack of scalability due to computational complexity. We introduce Neural C-Uniform, an unsupervised C-Uniform trajectory sampler that mitigates scalability issues by computing control input probabilities without relying on a discretized configuration space. Experiments show that Neural C-Uniform achieves a similar uniformity ratio to the original C-Uniform approach and generates trajectories over a longer time horizon while preserving uniformity. Next, we present CU-MPPI, which integrates Neural C-Uniform sampling into existing MPPI variants. We analyze the performance of CU-MPPI in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that in settings where the optimal solution has high curvature, CU-MPPI leads to drastic improvements in performance.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Functional Unknown Input Observers for LTV and MIMO LTI Systems with Arbitrary Relative Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the development of functional unknown input observers for systems with arbitrary relative degree. Two distinct approaches are presented to address this challenge. The first approach is tailored to a class of time-varying systems expressed in a canonical controllable form. This method leverages the Generalized Parameter Estimation-Based Observer framework. The article derives the conditions for applicability of this solution and outlines the limitations on the number of estimable state variables. The second approach targets multi-input multi-output systems. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed solution is applicable to systems with arbitrary relative degree, significantly broadening its scope of application. The theoretical results are validated through simulation studies, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed observers.</description>

      <title>A Novel Control Strategy for Offset Points Tracking in the Context of Agricultural Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method to control a rigidly connected location on the vehicle, such as a point on the implement in case of agricultural tasks. Agricultural robots are transforming modern farming by enabling precise and efficient operations, replacing humans in arduous tasks while reducing the use of chemicals. Traditionnaly, path_following algorithms are designed to guide the vehicle's center along a predefined trajetory. However, since the actual agronomic task is performed by the implement, it is essential to control a specific point on the implement itself rather than vehicle's center. As such, we present in this paper two approaches for achieving the control of an offset point on the robot. The first approach adapts existing control laws, initially inteded for rear axle's midpoint, to manage the desired lateral deviation. The second approach employs backstepping control techniques to create a control law that directly targets the implement. We conduct real-world experiments, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches for offset points control, and demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Safe Distributed Learning-Enhanced Predictive Control for Multiple Quadrupedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit remarkable adaptability in unstructured environments, making them well-suited for formation control in real-world applications. However, keeping stable formations while ensuring collision-free navigation presents significant challenges due to dynamic obstacles, communication constraints, and the complexity of legged locomotion. This paper proposes a distributed model predictive control framework for multi-quadruped formation control, integrating Control Lyapunov Functions to ensure formation stability and Control Barrier Functions for decentralized safety enforcement. To address the challenge of dynamically changing team structures, we introduce Scale-Adaptive Permutation-Invariant Encoding (SAPIE), which enables robust feature encoding of neighboring robots while preserving permutation invariance. Additionally, we develop a low-latency Data Distribution Service-based communication protocol and an event-triggered deadlock resolution mechanism to enhance real-time coordination and prevent motion stagnation in constrained spaces. Our framework is validated through high-fidelity simulations in NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim and real-world experiments using our custom quadrupedal robotic system, XG. Results demonstrate stable formation control, real-time feasibility, and effective collision avoidance, validating its potential for large-scale deployment.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Koopman Operator Approximation for Nonlinear Systems Using Broading Learning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional control methods often show limitations in dealing with complex nonlinear systems, especially when it is difficult to accurately obtain the exact system model, and the control accuracy and stability are difficult to guarantee. To solve this problem, the Koopman operator theory provides an effective method to linearise nonlinear systems, which simplifies the analysis and control of the system by mapping the nonlinear dynamics into a high-dimensional space. However, the existing extended dynamical mode decomposition (EDMD) methods suffer from randomness in the selection of basis functions, which leads to bias in the finite-dimensional approximation to the Koopman operator, thus affecting the accuracy of model prediction. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a BLS-EDMD method based on the Broad learning system (BLS) network. The method achieves a high-precision approximation to the Koopman operator by learning more accurate basis functions, which significantly improves the prediction ability of the model. Building on this, we further develop a model predictive controller (MPC) called BE-MPC. This controller directly utilises the high-dimensional and high-precision predictors generated by BLS-EDMD to predict the system state more accurately, thus achieving precise control of the underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV), and its effectiveness is verified by simulation.</description>

      <title>A 2-6 GHz Ultra-Wideband CMOS Transceiver for Radar Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a low power, low cost transceiver architecture to implement radar-on-a-chip. The transceiver comprises of a full ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter and a full UWB band receiver. A design methodology to maximize the tuning range of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is presented. At the transmitter side, a sub-harmonic mixer is used for signal up-conversion. The receiver low noise amplifier (LNA) has a 2 to 6 GHz input matching bandwidth with a power gain of 9 dB and a noise figure of 2.5 dB. The transceiver is implemented in Cadence EDA tools using 65nm CMOS technology. The system achieves a total dc power consumption of 50 mW. Good noise figure performance; good wide-band matching; gain; high level of integration; low power; low cost of the proposed UWB radar transceiver front-end make it a highly competitive SoC solution for low power UWB transceivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper bridges optimization and control, and presents a novel closed-loop control framework based on natural gradient descent, offering a trajectory-oriented alternative to traditional cost-function tuning. By leveraging the Fisher Information Matrix, we formulate a preconditioned gradient descent update that explicitly shapes system trajectories. We show that, in sharp contrast to traditional controllers, our approach provides flexibility to shape the system's low-level behavior. To this end, the proposed method parameterizes closed-loop dynamics in terms of stationary covariance and an unknown cost function, providing a geometric interpretation of control adjustments. We establish theoretical stability conditions. The simulation results on a rotary inverted pendulum benchmark highlight the advantages of natural gradient descent in trajectory shaping.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based Distributed Resource Scheduling Optimization Subject to Sector-Bound Nonlinearity and Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an accelerated consensus-based distributed iterative algorithm for resource allocation and scheduling. The proposed gradient-tracking algorithm introduces an auxiliary variable to add momentum towards the optimal state. We prove that this solution is all-time feasible, implying that the coupling constraint always holds along the algorithm iterative procedure; therefore, the algorithm can be terminated at any time. This is in contrast to the ADMM-based solutions that meet constraint feasibility asymptotically. Further, we show that the proposed algorithm can handle possible link nonlinearity due to logarithmically-quantized data transmission (or any sign-preserving odd sector-bound nonlinear mapping). We prove convergence over uniformly-connected dynamic networks (i.e., a hybrid setup) that may occur in mobile and time-varying multi-agent networks. Further, the latency issue over the network is addressed by proposing delay-tolerant solutions. To our best knowledge, accelerated momentum-based convergence, nonlinear linking, all-time feasibility, uniform network connectivity, and handling (possible) time delays are not altogether addressed in the literature. These contributions make our solution practical in many real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal Output Feedback Learning Control for Discrete-Time Linear Quadratic Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem of unknown discrete-time systems via dynamic output feedback learning control. In contrast to the state feedback, the optimality of the dynamic output feedback control for solving the LQR problem requires an implicit condition on the convergence of the state observer. Moreover, due to unknown system matrices and the existence of observer error, it is difficult to analyze the convergence and stability of most existing output feedback learning-based control methods. To tackle these issues, we propose a generalized dynamic output feedback learning control approach with guaranteed convergence, stability, and optimality performance for solving the LQR problem of unknown discrete-time linear systems. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to be equivalent to a state feedback controller. This equivalence relationship is an inherent property without requiring convergence of the estimated state by the state observer, which plays a key role in establishing the off-policy learning control approaches. By value iteration and policy iteration schemes, the adaptive dynamic programming based learning control approaches are developed to estimate the optimal feedback control gain. In addition, a model-free stability criterion is provided by finding a nonsingular parameterization matrix, which contributes to establishing a switched iteration scheme. Furthermore, the convergence, stability, and optimality analyses of the proposed output feedback learning control approaches are given. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Dense or Sparse? Post-Packing Interconnection Analysis in FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Packing is a crucial step of FPGA design, directly impacting interconnect complexity, routing congestion, and overall performance. This paper presents a post-packing interconnect-aware analysis, illustrating how dense (sparse) packing changes the interconnection structure. We introduce a new metric, RDensity, to define post-packing density and investigate its influence on routability. Through a comparative study of two packing tools, we demonstrate that density directly impacts routability. Our findings provide valuable insights into how packing decisions affect FPGA efficiency and offer guidance for improving FPGA packing tools and architecture design by integrating interconnect-aware methods. The goal is to achieve efficient routing while maintaining an optimal balance between cluster density, CLB pin counts, and logical block sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses the key principles of radio spectrum management with a focus on spectrum allocation and access. We show the current regime's inherent rigidity and constrained possibilities for introducing new radiocommunication services and applications. The article proposes how governments and spectrum users could cooperate in taking spectrum management to a qualitatively new level, characterized by light touch regulation and flexible use. This could be achieved through the broader introduction of emerging practices such as Spectrum Usage Rights, liberalized spectrum trading, and full shared spectrum access. We conclude by presenting a vision for a 'perfect' spectrum management arrangement and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Load Balancing for EV Charging Stations Using Reinforcement Learning and Demand Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for load balancing and dynamic pricing in electric vehicle (EV) charging networks, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance network performance. The proposed framework integrates a pre-trained graph neural network to predict demand elasticity and inform pricing decisions. The spatio-temporal EV charging demand prediction (EVCDP) dataset from Shenzhen is utilized to capture the geographic and temporal characteristics of the charging stations. The RL model dynamically adjusts prices at individual stations based on occupancy, maximum station capacity, and demand forecasts, ensuring an equitable network load distribution while preventing station overloads. By leveraging spatially-aware demand predictions and a carefully designed reward function, the framework achieves efficient load balancing and adaptive pricing strategies that respond to localized demand and global network dynamics, ensuring improved network stability and user satisfaction. The efficacy of the approach is validated through simulations on the dataset, showing significant improvements in load balancing and reduced overload as the RL agent iteratively interacts with the environment and learns to dynamically adjust pricing strategies based on real-time demand patterns and station constraints. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive pricing and load-balancing strategies to address the complexities of EV infrastructure, paving the way for scalable and user-centric solutions.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Black Box: Integrating Moral Imagination with Technical AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the intricate interplay among AI safety, security, and governance by integrating technical systems engineering with principles of moral imagination and ethical philosophy. Drawing on foundational insights from Weapons of Math Destruction and Thinking in Systems alongside contemporary debates in AI ethics, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework designed to regulate AI technologies deployed in high-stakes domains such as defense, finance, healthcare, and education. Our approach combines rigorous technical analysis, quantitative risk assessment, and normative evaluation to expose systemic vulnerabilities inherent in opaque, black-box models. Detailed case studies, including analyses of Microsoft Tay (2016) and the UK A-Level Grading Algorithm (2020), demonstrate how security lapses, bias amplification, and lack of accountability can precipitate cascading failures that undermine public trust. We conclude by outlining targeted strategies for enhancing AI resilience through adaptive regulatory mechanisms, robust security protocols, and interdisciplinary oversight, thereby advancing the state of the art in ethical and technical AI governance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel formulation to evaluate the local synchronization of power system devices, namely Synchronization Energy (SE). The formulation is derived based on the complex frequency concept and the Teager Energy Operator applied to the complex power. This formulation offers valuable insights into the relationship between complex frequency of voltage and current of the device and its stationary operating. Based on this relationship we derive the conditions for a novel definition of local synchronization of power system devices. Through various case studies, the paper demonstrates how SE can effectively assess local synchronization under diverse operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Control of Merging Car-following and Lane-Changing Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has paid little attention to complex driving behaviors, namely merging car-following and lane-changing behavior, and how lane-changing affects algorithms designed to model and control a car-following vehicle. During the merging behavior, the Follower Vehicle (FV) might significantly diverge from typical car-following models. Thus, this paper aims to control the FV witnessing lane-changing behavior based on anticipation, perception, preparation, and relaxation states defined by a novel measurable human perception index. Data from human drivers are utilized to create a perception-based fuzzy controller for the behavior vehicle's route guidance, taking into account the opacity of human driving judgments. We illustrate the efficacy of the established technique using simulated trials and data from actual drivers, focusing on the benefits of the increased comfort, safety, and uniformity of traffic flow and the decreased of wait time and motion sickness this brings about.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model Based Probabilistic Day-ahead Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate probabilistic load forecasting is crucial for maintaining the safety and stability of power systems. However, the mainstream approach, multi-step prediction, must be improved by cumulative errors and latency issues, which limits its effectiveness in probabilistic day-ahead load forecasting (PDALF). To overcome these challenges, we introduce DALNet, a novel denoising diffusion model designed to generate load curves rather than relying on direct prediction. By shifting the focus to curve generation, DALNet captures the complex distribution of actual load time-series data under specific conditions with greater fidelity. To further enhance DALNet, we propose the temporal multi-scale attention block (TMSAB), a mechanism designed to integrate both positional and temporal information for improved forecasting precision. Furthermore, we utilize kernel density estimation (KDE) to reconstruct the distribution of generated load curves and employ KL divergence to compare them with the actual data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that DALNet excels in load forecasting accuracy and offers a novel perspective for other predictive tasks within power systems.</description>

      <title>Precise Insulin Delivery for Artificial Pancreas: A Reinforcement Learning Optimized Adaptive Fuzzy Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of a Type-1 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller, designed to operate as an artificial pancreas for Type 1 diabetes. The primary challenge in diabetes management is the dynamic nature of blood glucose levels, which are influenced by several factors such as meal intake and timing. Traditional controllers often struggle to adapt to these changes, leading to suboptimal insulin administration. To address this issue, we employ a reinforcement learning agent tasked with adjusting 27 parameters of the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller at each time step, ensuring real-time adaptability. The study's findings demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the robustness of the controller against variations in meal size and timing, while also stabilizing glucose levels with minimal exogenous insulin. This adaptive method holds promise for improving the quality of life and health outcomes for individuals with Type 1 diabetes by providing a more responsive and precise management tool. Simulation results are given to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Novel Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Pursuit-Evasion Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical application, the pursuit-evasion game (PEG) often involves multiple complex and conflicting objectives. The single-objective reinforcement learning (RL) usually focuses on a single optimization objective, and it is difficult to find the optimal balance among multiple objectives. This paper proposes a three-objective RL algorithm based on fuzzy Q-learning (FQL) to solve the PEG with different optimization objectives. First, the multi-objective FQL algorithm is introduced, which uses the reward function to represent three optimization objectives: evading pursuit, reaching target, and avoiding obstacle. Second, a multi-objective evaluation method and action selection strategy based on three-dimensional hypervolume are designed, which solved the dilemma of exploration-exploitation. By sampling the Pareto front, the update rule of the global strategy is obtained. The proposed algorithm reduces computational load while ensuring exploration ability. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is verified by simulation results.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for LQR Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a transfer learning framework for Linear
  Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control, where (i) the dynamics of the
  system of interest (target system) are unknown and only a short
  trajectory of impulse responses from the target system is provided,
  and (ii) impulse responses are available from $N$ source systems
  with different dynamics. We show that the LQR controller can be
  learned from a sufficiently long trajectory of impulse
  responses. Further, a transferable mode set can be identified using
  the available data from source systems and the target system,
  enabling the reconstruction of the target system's impulse responses
  for controller design. By leveraging data from the source systems we
  demonstrate that only n+1 (n being the system dimension) samples
  of data from the target system are needed to learn the LQR
  controller, this yields a significant reduction of the required
  data.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Ramp Metering Control based on Scalable Nonlinear Traffic Dynamics Model Discovery in a Large Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a coordinated ramp metering control framework in large networks based on scalable nonlinear traffic dynamics model discovery. Existing coordinated ramp metering control methods often require accurate traffic dynamics models in real time, however, for large-scale highway networks, since these models are always nonlinear, they are extremely challenging to obtain. To overcome this limitation, this study utilizes the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with Control (SINDYc) to derive the accurate nonlinear traffic dynamics model from observed data. The discovered dynamics model is then integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) coordinated ramp metering controller, enabling optimized control actions that enhance traffic flow and efficiency. The proposed framework is tested on a large-scale highway network that includes three intersecting highways and eight on-ramps, which outperforms the existing approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-time application. This framework can offer a scalable and robust solution for improving real-time traffic management in complex urban environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the design of an inexpensive and agile climate sensor system which can be repurposed easily to measure various pollutants. We also propose the use of machine learning regression methods to calibrate CO2 data from this cost-effective sensing platform to a reference sensor at the South African Weather Service's Cape Point measurement facility. We show the performance of these methods and found that Random Forest Regression was the best in this scenario. This shows that these machine learning methods can be used to improve the performance of cost-effective sensor platforms and possibly extend the time between manual calibration of sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Design Optimal Backstepping Controller for Quadrotor Based on Lyapunov Theory for Disturbances Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various control methods have been studied to control the position and attitude of quadrotors. There are some differences in the mathematical equations between the two types of quadrotor configurations that lead to different control efficiency in disturbance environments. This paper described the nonlinear back stepping approach based on the Lyapunov function theory and LaSalle Principle for the quadrotor control system, which can provide the stability of all system states during the tracking of the desired trajectory. Accordingly, a mathematical model of the cross quadrotor configuration together with the controller has been built to stabilize the altitude and position of the quadrotor. To clarify the effectiveness of this method with the selected quadrotor configuration, we compare it with a traditional PID controller in an environment affected by disturbances. The simulation results in MATLAB show satisfactory stability of the quadrotor flight and following certain trajectories, confirming the accuracy and validity of the control method.</description>

      <title>Recursive Estimation for Dynamical Systems with Measurement Bias, Outliers and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes recursive algorithms for state estimation of linear dynamical systems when measurements are noisy with unknown bias and/or outliers. For situations with noisy and biased measurements, algorithms are proposed that minimize $\epsilon$ insensitive loss function. In this approach which is often used in Support Vector Machines, small errors are ignored making the algorithm less sensitive to measurement bias. Apart from $\epsilon$ insensitive quadratic loss function, estimation algorithms are also presented for $\epsilon$ insensitive Huber M loss function which provides good performance in presence of both small noises as well as outliers. The advantage of Huber cost function based estimator in presence of outliers is due to the fact the error penalty function switches from quadratic to linear for errors beyond a certain threshold. For both objective functions, estimation algorithms are extended to cases when there are additional constraints on states and exogenous signals such as known range of some states or exogenous signals or measurement noises. Interestingly, the filtering algorithms are recursive and structurally similar to Kalman filter with the main difference being that the updates based on the new measurement ("innovation term") are based on solution of a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Based Symbolic Regression for Load Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, growing demand variability, and evolving grid control strategies, accurate and efficient load modeling has become a critical yet challenging task. Traditional methods, such as fixed-form parametric models and data-driven approaches, often struggle to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel symbolic regression algorithm based on the Actor-Critic reinforcement learning framework, specifically tailored for dynamic load modeling. The algorithm employs a trainable expression tree with controlled depth and a predefined set of operators to generate compact and interpretable mathematical expressions. The Actor network probabilistically selects operators for the symbolic expression, while the Critic evaluates the resulting expression tree through a loss function. To further enhance performance, a candidate pool mechanism is implemented to store high-performing expressions, which are subsequently fine-tuned using gradient descent. By focusing on simplicity and precision, the proposed method significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving interpretability. Experimental results validate its superior performance compared to existing benchmarks, which offers a robust and scalable solution for dynamic load modeling and system analysis in modern power systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Pose Graph Optimization using the Splitting Method based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optimization aims to leverage the local computation and communication capabilities of each agent to achieve a desired global objective. This paper addresses the distributed pose graph optimization (PGO) problem under non-convex constraints, with the goal of approximating the rotation and translation of each pose given relevant noisy measurements. To achieve this goal, the splitting method based on the concepts of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and Bregman iteration are applied to solve the rotation subproblems. The proposed approach enables the iterative resolution of constrained problems, achieved through solving unconstrained problems and orthogonality-constrained quadratic problems that have analytical solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against two practical methods in pose graph optimization: the Distributed Gauss-Seidel (DGS) algorithm and the centralized pose graph optimizer with an optimality certificate (SE-Sync). The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through its application to several simulated and real-world pose graph datasets. Unlike the DGS method, our approach attempts to solve distributed PGO problems without relaxing the non-convex constraints.</description>

      <title>Existence and Design of Target Output Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces new conditions for target output controllability and provides existence conditions for placing a specific number of poles with a target output controller. Additionally, an algorithm is presented for the design of a target output controller. Controllability of the system under consideration is not required for designing target output controllers in this context. The findings in this paper extend the principles of full state feedback control. Moreover, we present conditions for static output feedback control under specific constraints. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>EnCortex: A General, Extensible and Scalable Framework for Decision Management in New-age Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increased global warming, there has been a significant emphasis to replace fossil fuel-dependent energy sources with clean, renewable sources. These new-age energy systems are becoming more complex with an increasing proportion of renewable energy sources (like solar and wind), energy storage systems (like batteries), and demand side control in the mix. Most new-age sources being highly dependent on weather and climate conditions bring about high variability and uncertainty. Energy operators rely on such uncertain data to make different planning and operations decisions periodically, and sometimes in real-time, to maintain the grid stability and optimize their objectives (cost savings, carbon footprint, etc.). Hitherto, operators mostly rely on domain knowledge, heuristics, or solve point problems to take decisions. These approaches fall short because of their specific assumptions and limitations. Further, there is a lack of a unified framework for both research and production environments at scale. In this paper, we propose EnCortex to address these challenges. EnCortex provides a general, easy-to-use, extensible, and scalable energy decision framework that enables operators to plan, build and execute their real-world scenarios efficiently. We show that using EnCortex, we can define and compose complex new-age scenarios, owing to industry-standard abstractions of energy entities and the modularity of the framework. EnCortex provides a foundational structure to support several state-of-the-art optimizers with minimal effort. EnCortex supports both quick developments for research prototypes and scaling the solutions to production environments. We demonstrate the utility of EnCortex with three complex new-age real-world scenarios and show that significant cost and carbon footprint savings can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Explicit Solution of Tunable Input-to-State Safe-Based Controller Under High-Relative-Degree Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the safety analysis and verification of nonlinear systems subject to high-relative-degree constraints and unknown disturbance. The closed-form solution of the high-order control barrier functions (HOCBF) optimization problem with and without a nominal controller is first provided, making it unnecessary to solve the quadratic program problem online and facilitating the analysis. Further, we introduce the concept of tunable input-to-state safety(ISSf), and a new tunable function in conjunction with HOCBF is provided. When combined with the existing ISSf theorem, produces controllers for constrained nonlinear systems with external disturbances. The theoretical results are proven and supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Energy-Trajectory Economic Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Surface Vehicles under Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a novel Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) scheme for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to simultaneously address path following accuracy and energy constraints under environmental disturbances. By formulating lateral deviations as energy-equivalent penalties in the cost function, our method enables explicit trade-offs between tracking precision and energy consumption. Furthermore, a motion-dependent decomposition technique is proposed to estimate terminal energy costs based on vehicle dynamics. Compared with the existing EMPC method, simulations with real-world ocean disturbance data demonstrate the controller's energy consumption with a 0.06 energy increase while reducing cross-track errors by up to 18.61. Field experiments conducted on an ASV equipped with an Intel N100 CPU in natural lake environments validate practical feasibility, achieving 0.22 m average cross-track error at nearly 1 m/s and 10 Hz control frequency. The proposed scheme provides a computationally tractable solution for ASVs operating under resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Efficient Integration of Distributed Learning Services in Next-Generation Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) is considered a cornerstone of intelligence enabler, since it allows for collaborative training without the necessity for local clients to share raw data with other parties, thereby preserving privacy and security. Integrating DL into the 6G networks requires coexistence design with existing services such as high-bandwidth (HB) traffic like eMBB. Current designs in the literature mainly focus on communication round (CR)-wise designs that assume a fixed resource allocation during each CR. However, fixed resource allocation within a CR is a highly inefficient and inaccurate representation of the system's realistic behavior. This is due to the heterogeneous nature of the system, where clients inherently need to access the network at different times. This work zooms into one arbitrary communication round and demonstrates the importance of considering a time-dependent resource-sharing design with HB traffic. We propose a time-dependent optimization problem for minimizing the consumed time and energy by DL within the CR. Due to its intractability, a session-based optimization problem has been proposed assuming a large-scale coherence time. An iterative algorithm has been designed to solve such problems and simulation results confirm the importance of such efficient and accurate integration design.</description>

      <title>Communication-aware Multi-agent Systems Control Based on $k$-hop Distributed Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a distributed control strategy to allow the control of a multi-agent system requiring k-hop interactions based on the design of distributed state and input observers. In particular, we design for each agent a finite time convergent state and input observer that exploits only the communication with the 1-hop neighbors to reconstruct the information regarding those agents at a 2-hop distance or more. We then demonstrate that if the k-hop based control strategy is set-Input to State Stable with respect to the set describing the goal, then the observer information can be adopted to achieve the team objective with stability guarantees.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control Selection over the Edge-Cloud Continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging computing continuum paves the way for exploiting multiple computing devices, ranging from the edge to the cloud, to implement the control algorithm. Different computing units over the continuum are characterized by different computational capabilities and communication latencies, thus resulting in different control performances and advocating for an effective trade-off. To this end, in this work, we first introduce a multi-tiered controller and we propose a simple network delay compensator. Then we propose a control selection policy to optimize the control cost taking into account the delay and the disturbances. We theoretically investigate the stability of the switching system resulting from the proposed control selection policy. Accurate simulations show the improvements of the considered setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an advanced wind turbine control scheme for power maximization as well as for active power control, which is designed using $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ loop-shaping. Our approach involves the synthesis of two separate controllers for two different operating modes. To ensure smooth transitions between these modes, we implement a bumpless transfer strategy that reduces transient effects. A comprehensive case study demonstrates the efficacy of our control scheme, showing significant improvements in power tracking accuracy and a reduction in mechanical wear. Moreover, our control strategy comes with robust stability guarantees.</description>

      <title>AttentionSwarm: Reinforcement Learning with Attention Control Barier Function for Crazyflie Drones in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AttentionSwarm, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate safe and efficient swarm control across three challenging environments: a landing environment with obstacles, a competitive drone game setting, and a dynamic drone racing scenario. Central to our approach is the Attention Model Based Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework, which integrates attention mechanisms with safety-critical control theory to enable real-time collision avoidance and trajectory optimization. This framework dynamically prioritizes critical obstacles and agents in the swarms vicinity using attention weights, while CBFs formally guarantee safety by enforcing collision-free constraints. The safe attention net algorithm was developed and evaluated using a swarm of Crazyflie 2.1 micro quadrotors, which were tested indoors with the Vicon motion capture system to ensure precise localization and control. Experimental results show that our system achieves landing accuracy of 3.02 cm with a mean time of 23 s and collision-free landings in a dynamic landing environment, 100% and collision-free navigation in a drone game environment, and 95% and collision-free navigation for a dynamic multiagent drone racing environment, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. This work offers a promising foundation for applications in dynamic environments where safety and fastness are paramount.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic-free onboard battery health assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse usage patterns induce complex and variable aging behaviors in lithium-ion batteries, complicating accurate health diagnosis and prognosis. Separate diagnostic cycles are often used to untangle the battery's current state of health from prior complex aging patterns. However, these same diagnostic cycles alter the battery's degradation trajectory, are time-intensive, and cannot be practically performed in onboard applications. In this work, we leverage portions of operational measurements in combination with an interpretable machine learning model to enable rapid, onboard battery health diagnostics and prognostics without offline diagnostic testing and the requirement of historical data. We integrate mechanistic constraints within an encoder-decoder architecture to extract electrode states in a physically interpretable latent space and enable improved reconstruction of the degradation path. The health diagnosis model framework can be flexibly applied across diverse application interests with slight fine-tuning. We demonstrate the versatility of this model framework by applying it to three battery-cycling datasets consisting of 422 cells under different operating conditions, highlighting the utility of an interpretable diagnostic-free, onboard battery diagnosis and prognosis model.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Tube-based Model Predictive Control for Cyber-Physical Systems under False Data Injection Attacks with Bounded Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07385v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of amplitude-unbounded false data injection (FDI) attacks targeting the sensor-to-controller (S-C) channel in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). We introduce a resilient tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This scheme incorporates a threshold-based attack detector and a control sequence buffer to enhance system security. We mathematically model the common FDI attacks and derive the maximum duration of such attacks based on the hypothesis testing principle. Following this, the minimum feasible sequence length of the control sequence buffer is obtained. The system is proven to remain input-to-state stable (ISS) under bounded external disturbances and amplitude-unbounded FDI attacks. Moreover, the feasible region under this scenario is provided in this paper. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and shows superior control performance compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Design of Grid-tied Community Microgrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a cost-effective microgrid design that optimally balances the economic feasibility, reliability, efficiency, and environmental impact in a grid-tied community microgrid. A multi-objective optimization framework is employed, integrating HOMER Pro for system sizing with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate the system performance under varying load demand and renewable energy fluctuations, while an economic sensitivity assessment examines the impact of electricity prices and capital costs on the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). The proposed microgrid configuration achieves high reliability, satisfying 100% of the load, even under adverse weather conditions. The proposed framework attains an efficiency of 91.99% while maintaining a carbon footprint of 302,747 kg/year, which is approximately 95% lower than that of the grid system. The economic analysis indicates a net present cost (NPC) of $4.83M with a competitive LCOE of $0.208/kWh. In addition, the operation cost is $201,473 per year with a capital investment of $1.42M, rendering it a financially viable alternative to conventional grid-dependent systems.This work can be valuable in identifying effective solutions for supplying reliable and cost-effective power to regional and remote areas.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares Data-driven Robustly Stabilizing and Contracting Controller Synthesis for Polynomial Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a computationally efficient approach to data-driven robust contracting controller synthesis for polynomial control-affine systems based on a sum-of-squares program. In particular, we consider the case in which a system alternates between periods of high-quality sensor data and low-quality sensor data. In the high-quality sensor data regime, we focus on robust system identification based on the data informativity framework. In low-quality sensor data regimes we employ a robustly contracting controller that is synthesized online by solving a sum-of-squares program based on data acquired in the high-quality regime, so as to limit state deviation until high-quality data is available. This approach is motivated by real-life control applications in which systems experience periodic data blackouts or occlusion, such as autonomous vehicles undergoing loss of GPS signal or solar glare in machine vision systems. We apply our approach to a planar unmanned aerial vehicle model subject to an unknown wind field, demonstrating its uses for verifiably tight control on trajectory deviation.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Load Estimation for Load-lifting Exoskeletons Using Insole Pressure Sensors and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for real-time lifting-load estimation to enhance the control strategies of upper-limb assistive exoskeletons. By leveraging cost-effective insole pressure sensors, the proposed system extracts differential pressure data that minimizes disturbances from variations in body weight and sensor placement. Two modeling approaches are explored: a channel-based method that employs traditional regression techniques-Elastic Net, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-and a map-based method that utilizes transfer learning with a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. The experiment is in the preliminary test stage, covering load ranges from 2 kg to 10 kg in increments of 0.5 kg, and collecting data from three subjects to test the approach. In the Channel-based method, the average Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error(WMAPE) for three subjects showed that the SVR achieved 13.46%, with the MLP performing similarly. In the Map-based method, using data from one subject, the Fully Fine-Tuned MobileNetV2 model reached a WMAPE of 9.74%. The results indicate that the integration of insole sensor technology with advanced machine learning models provides an effective solution for dynamic load estimation, potentially reducing the risks of over- and under-compensation in exoskeleton control.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Structural Deflection Estimation in Hydraulically Actuated Systems Using 3D Flexible Multibody Simulation and DNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision, stability, and performance of lightweight high-strength steel structures in heavy machinery is affected by their highly nonlinear dynamics. This, in turn, makes control more difficult, simulation more computationally intensive, and achieving real-time autonomy, using standard approaches, impossible. Machine learning through data-driven, physics-informed and physics-inspired networks, however, promises more computationally efficient and accurate solutions to nonlinear dynamic problems. This study proposes a novel framework that has been developed to estimate real-time structural deflection in hydraulically actuated three-dimensional systems. It is based on SLIDE, a machine-learning-based method to estimate dynamic responses of mechanical systems subjected to forced excitations.~Further, an algorithm is introduced for the data acquisition from a hydraulically actuated system using randomized initial configurations and hydraulic pressures.~The new framework was tested on a hydraulically actuated flexible boom with various sensor combinations and lifting various payloads. The neural network was successfully trained in less time using standard parameters from PyTorch, ADAM optimizer, the various sensor inputs, and minimal output data. The SLIDE-trained neural network accelerated deflection estimation solutions by a factor of $10^7$ in reference to flexible multibody simulation batches and provided reasonable accuracy. These results support the studies goal of providing robust, real-time solutions for control, robotic manipulators, structural health monitoring, and automation problems.</description>

      <title>Research the influence of road surface conditions on vibration and safety of Semi Trailer vehicle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Depending on the road surface profile, moving speed, transport weight, etc., the vehicle's body acceleration and dynamic load coefficient change as it moves. This study's goal is to ascertain the result of the road surface's influence on the vehicle, calculate the average vehicle body displacement acceleration and dynamic load coefficient, and validate your findings through testing. To confirm the simulation model's accuracy, experimental and theoretical simulation results are compared.. Methods: The Neuton-Euler approach and the multi-body system structure separation method are used in the paper to create dynamic equations using theoretical research methods [1]. Simulations are carried out using Matlab Simulink software to examine and assess the dynamics. Results: According to ISO 8608:2016 standard [2], theoretical research results have determined the average acceleration of the vehicle body, dynamic load coefficient, horizontal sway angle, and longitudinal sway angle when the vehicle moves on profiles C, D , E, F. Experiments show that there is an error of 7.4% and 8.1% when measuring the average acceleration and dynamic load coefficient k{\dj}max when the vehicle moves at a speed of 50 km/h on the road surface C compared to theory.</description>

      <title>A Human-In-The-Loop Simulation Framework for Evaluating Control Strategies in Gait Assistive Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the global population ages, effective rehabilitation and mobility aids will become increasingly critical. Gait assistive robots are promising solutions, but designing adaptable controllers for various impairments poses a significant challenge. This paper presented a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) simulation framework tailored specifically for gait assistive robots, addressing unique challenges posed by passive support systems. We incorporated a realistic physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) model to enable a quantitative evaluation of robot control strategies, highlighting the performance of a speed-adaptive controller compared to a conventional PID controller in maintaining compliance and reducing gait distortion. We assessed the accuracy of the simulated interactions against that of the real-world data and revealed discrepancies in the adaptation strategies taken by the human and their effect on the human's gait. This work underscored the potential of HITL simulation as a versatile tool for developing and fine-tuning personalized control policies for various users.</description>

      <title>Enhancing AUTOSAR-Based Firmware Over-the-Air Updates in the Automotive Industry with a Practical Implementation on a Steering System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automotive industry is increasingly reliant on software to manage complex vehicle functionalities, making efficient and secure firmware updates essential. Traditional firmware update methods, requiring physical connections through On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) ports, are inconvenient, costly, and time-consuming. Firmware Over-the-Air (FOTA) technology offers a revolutionary solution by enabling wireless updates, reducing operational costs, and enhancing the user experience. This project aims to design and implement an advanced FOTA system tailored for modern vehicles, incorporating the AUTOSAR architecture for scalability and standardization, and utilizing delta updating to minimize firmware update sizes, thereby improving bandwidth efficiency and reducing flashing times. To ensure security, the system integrates the UDS 0x27 protocol for authentication and data integrity during the update process. Communication between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) is achieved using the CAN protocol, while the ESP8266 module and the master ECU communicate via SPI for data transfer. The system's architecture includes key components such as a bootloader, boot manager, and bootloader updater to facilitate seamless firmware updates. The functionality of the system is demonstrated through two applications: a blinking LED and a Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system, showcasing its versatility in handling critical automotive features. This project represents a significant step forward in automotive technology, offering a user-centric, efficient, and secure solution for automotive firmware management.</description>

      <title>Merry-Go-Round: Safe Control of Decentralized Multi-Robot Systems with Deadlock Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach for decentralized multi-robot navigation that ensures both safety and deadlock prevention. Building on a standard control formulation, we add a lightweight deadlock prevention mechanism by forming temporary "roundabouts" (circular reference paths). Each robot relies only on local, peer-to-peer communication and a controller for base collision avoidance; a roundabout is generated or joined on demand to avert deadlocks. Robots in the roundabout travel in one direction until an escape condition is met, allowing them to return to goal-oriented motion. Unlike classical decentralized methods that lack explicit deadlock resolution, our roundabout maneuver ensures system-wide forward progress while preserving safety constraints. Extensive simulations and physical robot experiments show that our method consistently outperforms or matches the success and arrival rates of other decentralized control approaches, particularly in cluttered or high-density scenarios, all with minimal centralized coordination.</description>

      <title>Ergodic-Risk Constrained Policy Optimization: The Linear Quadratic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Risk-sensitive control balances performance with resilience to unlikely events in uncertain systems. This paper introduces ergodic-risk criteria, which capture long-term cumulative risks through probabilistic limit theorems. By ensuring the dynamics exhibit strong ergodicity, we demonstrate that the time-correlated terms in these limiting criteria converge even with potentially heavy-tailed process noises as long as the noise has a finite fourth moment. Building upon this, we proposed the ergodic-risk constrained policy optimization which incorporates an ergodic-risk constraint to the classical Linear Quadratic Regulation (LQR) framework. We then propose a primal-dual policy optimization method that optimizes the average performance while satisfying the ergodic-risk constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that the new risk-constrained LQR not only optimizes average performance but also limits the asymptotic variance associated with the ergodic-risk criterion, making the closed-loop system more robust against sporadic large fluctuations in process noise.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Motion Planner for Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an online motion planner for legged robot locomotion with the primary objective of achieving energy efficiency. The conceptual idea is to leverage a placement set of footstep positions based on the robot's body position to determine when and how to execute steps. In particular, the proposed planner uses virtual placement sets beneath the hip joints of the legs and executes a step when the foot is outside of such placement set. Furthermore, we propose a parameter design framework that considers both energy-efficiency and robustness measures to optimize the gait by changing the shape of the placement set along with other parameters, such as step height and swing time, as a function of walking speed. We show that the planner produces trajectories that have a low Cost of Transport (CoT) and high robustness measure, and evaluate our approach against model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) and motion imitation using biological dog motion priors as the reference. Overall, within low to medium velocity range, we show a 50.4% improvement in CoT and improved robustness over model-free RL, our best performing baseline. Finally, we show ability to handle slippery surfaces, gait transitions, and disturbances in simulation and hardware with the Unitree A1 robot.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Modular Pulse Synthesizer: A High-Power High-Granularity Electronics Solution for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Practically Any Pulse Shape for Neural Activation Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noninvasive brain stimulation can activate neurons in the brain but requires power electronics with exceptionally high power in the mega-volt-ampere and high frequencies in the kilohertz range. Whereas oscillator circuits offered only one or very few pulse shapes, modular power electronics solved a long-standing problem for the first time and enabled arbitrary software-based design of the temporal shape of stimuli. However, synthesizing arbitrary stimuli with a high output quality requires a large number of modules. Systems with few modules and pulse-width modulation may generate apparently smooth current shapes in the highly inductive coil, but the stimulation effect of the neurons depends on the electric field and the electric field becomes a burst of ultra-brief rectangular pulses. We propose an alternative solution that achieves high-resolution pulse shaping with fewer modules by implementing high-power wide-bandwidth voltage asymmetry. Rather than equal voltage steps, our system strategically assigns different voltages to each module to achieve a near-exponential improvement in resolution. Compared to prior designs, our experimental prototype achieved better output quality, although it uses only half the number of modules.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control for Magnetic Micro-robot Navigation with Immersive Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic micro-robots have demonstrated immense potential in biomedical applications, such as in vivo drug delivery, non-invasive diagnostics, and cell-based therapies, owing to their precise maneuverability and small size. However, current micromanipulation techniques often rely solely on a two-dimensional (2D) microscopic view as sensory feedback, while traditional control interfaces do not provide an intuitive manner for operators to manipulate micro-robots. These limitations increase the cognitive load on operators, who must interpret limited feedback and translate it into effective control actions. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control (DRL-SC) framework for magnetic micro-robot navigation in a simulated microvascular system. Our framework integrates Mixed Reality (MR) to facilitate immersive manipulation of micro-robots, thereby enhancing situational awareness and control precision. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves navigation efficiency, reduces control errors, and enhances the overall robustness of the system in simulated microvascular environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an optimization-based motion planning methodology for snake robots operating in constrained environments. By using a reduced-order model, the proposed approach simplifies the planning process, enabling the optimizer to autonomously generate gaits while constraining the robot's footprint within tight spaces. The method is validated through high-fidelity simulations that accurately model contact dynamics and the robot's motion. Key locomotion strategies are identified and further demonstrated through hardware experiments, including successful navigation through narrow corridors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MAV-capturing-MAV (MCM) is one of the few effective methods for physically countering misused or malicious MAVs.This paper presents a vision-based cooperative MCM system, where multiple pursuer MAVs equipped with onboard vision systems detect, localize, and pursue a target MAV. To enhance robustness, a distributed state estimation and control framework enables the pursuer MAVs to autonomously coordinate their actions. Pursuer trajectories are optimized using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and executed via a low-level SO(3) controller, ensuring smooth and stable pursuit. Once the capture conditions are satisfied, the pursuer MAVs automatically deploy a flying net to intercept the target. These capture conditions are determined based on the predicted motion of the net. To enable real-time decision-making, we propose a lightweight computational method to approximate the net motion, avoiding the prohibitive cost of solving the full net dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated through simulations and real-world experiments. In real-world tests, our approach successfully captures a moving target traveling at 4 meters per second with an acceleration of 1 meter per square second, achieving a success rate of 64.7 percent.</description>

      <title>Explaining Control Policies through Predicate Decision Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety-critical controllers of complex systems are hard to construct manually. Automated approaches such as controller synthesis or learning provide a tempting alternative but usually lack explainability. To this end, learning decision trees (DTs) have been prevalently used towards an interpretable model of the generated controllers. However, DTs do not exploit shared decision-making, a key concept exploited in binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to reduce their size and thus improve explainability. In this work, we introduce predicate decision diagrams (PDDs) that extend BDDs with predicates and thus unite the advantages of DTs and BDDs for controller representation. We establish a synthesis pipeline for efficient construction of PDDs from DTs representing controllers, exploiting reduction techniques for BDDs also for PDDs.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Machine Learning Models for Predicting Data Center Server Power, Efficiency, and Throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving digital era, comprehending the intricate dynamics influencing server power consumption, efficiency, and performance is crucial for sustainable data center operations. However, existing models lack the ability to provide a detailed and reliable understanding of these intricate relationships. This study employs a machine learning-based approach, using the SPECPower_ssj2008 database, to facilitate user-friendly and generalizable server modeling. The resulting models demonstrate high accuracy, with errors falling within approximately 10% on the testing dataset, showcasing their practical utility and generalizability. Through meticulous analysis, predictive features related to hardware availability date, server workload level, and specifications are identified, providing insights into optimizing energy conservation, efficiency, and performance in server deployment and operation. By systematically measuring biases and uncertainties, the study underscores the need for caution when employing historical data for prospective server modeling, considering the dynamic nature of technology landscapes. Collectively, this work offers valuable insights into the sustainable deployment and operation of servers in data centers, paving the way for enhanced resource use efficiency and more environmentally conscious practices.</description>

      <title>Abdominal Undulation with Compliant Mechanism Improves Flight Performance of Biomimetic Robotic Butterfly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abdominal Undulation with Compliant Mechanism Improves Flight Performance of Biomimetic Robotic ButterflThis paper presents the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a biomimetic robotic butterfly (BRB) that integrates a compliant mechanism to achieve coupled wing-abdomen motion. Drawing inspiration from the natural f light dynamics of butterflies, a theoretical model is developed to investigate the impact of abdominal undulation on flight performance. To validate the model, motion capture experi ments are conducted on three configurations: a BRB without an abdomen, with a fixed abdomen, and with an undulating abdomen. The results demonstrate that abdominal undulation enhances lift generation, extends flight duration, and stabilizes pitch oscillations, thereby improving overall flight performance. These findings underscore the significance of wing-abdomen interaction in flapping-wing aerial vehicles (FWAVs) and lay the groundwork for future advancements in energy-efficient biomimetic flight designs.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium MAV-Capture-MAV via Time-Optimal Planning and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capture of flying MAVs (micro aerial vehicles) has garnered increasing research attention due to its intriguing challenges and promising applications. Despite recent advancements, a key limitation of existing work is that capture strategies are often relatively simple and constrained by platform performance. This paper addresses control strategies capable of capturing high-maneuverability targets. The unique challenge of achieving target capture under unstable conditions distinguishes this task from traditional pursuit-evasion and guidance problems. In this study, we transition from larger MAV platforms to a specially designed, compact capture MAV equipped with a custom launching device while maintaining high maneuverability. We explore both time-optimal planning (TOP) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Simulations demonstrate that TOP offers highly maneuverable and shorter trajectories, while RL excels in real-time adaptability and stability. Moreover, the RL method has been tested in real-world scenarios, successfully achieving target capture even in unstable states.</description>

      <title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Minimum-Exposure Paths in Spatiotemporally Varying Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance and reliability analyses of autonomous vehicles (AVs) can benefit from tools that ``amplify'' small datasets to synthesize larger volumes of plausible samples of the AV's behavior. We consider a specific instance of this data synthesis problem that addresses minimizing the AV's exposure to adverse environmental conditions during travel to a fixed goal location. The environment is characterized by a threat field, which is a strictly positive scalar field with higher intensities corresponding to hazardous and unfavorable conditions for the AV. We address the problem of synthesizing datasets of minimum exposure paths that resemble a training dataset of such paths. The main contribution of this paper is an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) model to solve this problem. We consider time-invariant (static) as well as time-varying (dynamic) threat fields. We find that the proposed IRL model provides excellent performance in synthesizing paths from initial conditions not seen in the training dataset, when the threat field is the same as that used for training. Furthermore, we evaluate model performance on unseen threat fields and find low error in that case as well. Finally, we demonstrate the model's ability to synthesize distinct datasets when trained on different datasets with distinct characteristics.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation for Minimum-Exposure Navigation in a Time-Varying Environment using Generative AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of synthetic generation of samples of environmental features for autonomous vehicle navigation. These features are described by a spatiotemporally varying scalar field that we refer to as a threat field. The threat field is known to have some underlying dynamics subject to process noise. Some "real-world" data of observations of various threat fields are also available. The assumption is that the volume of ``real-world'' data is relatively small. The objective is to synthesize samples that are statistically similar to the data. The proposed solution is a generative artificial intelligence model that we refer to as a split variational recurrent neural network (S-VRNN). The S-VRNN merges the capabilities of a variational autoencoder, which is a widely used generative model, and a recurrent neural network, which is used to learn temporal dependencies in data. The main innovation in this work is that we split the latent space of the S-VRNN into two subspaces. The latent variables in one subspace are learned using the ``real-world'' data, whereas those in the other subspace are learned using the data as well as the known underlying system dynamics. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate that the proposed S-VRNN can synthesize data that are statistically similar to the training data even in the case of very small volume of ``real-world'' training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address safe multi-robot interaction under uncertainty. In particular, we formulate a chance-constrained linear quadratic Gaussian game with coupling constraints and system uncertainties. We find a tractable reformulation of the game and propose a dual ascent algorithm. We prove that the algorithm converges to a generalized Nash equilibrium of the reformulated game, ensuring the satisfaction of the chance constraints. We test our method in driving simulations and real-world robot experiments. Our method ensures safety under uncertainty and generates less conservative trajectories than single-agent model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Trajectory Planning with Multimodal Environmental Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle safe trajectory planning under Gaussian mixture model (GMM) uncertainty. Specifically, we use a GMM to model the multimodal behaviors of obstacles' uncertain states. Then, we develop a mixed-integer conic approximation to the chance-constrained trajectory planning problem with deterministic linear systems and polyhedral obstacles. When the GMM moments are estimated via finite samples, we develop a tight concentration bound to ensure the chance constraint with a desired confidence. Moreover, to limit the amount of constraint violation, we develop a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach corresponding to the chance constraints and derive a tractable approximation for known and estimated GMM moments. We verify our methods with state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms and autonomous driving datasets.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Online Feedback Optimization to time-varying parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization uses optimization algorithms as dynamic systems to design optimal control inputs. The results obtained from Online Feedback Optimization depend on the setup of the chosen optimization algorithm. In this work we analyse the sensitivity of Online Feedback Optimization to the parameters of projected gradient descent as the algorithm of choice. We derive closed-form expressions for sensitivities of the objective function with respect to the parameters of the projected gradient and to time-varying model mismatch. The formulas are then used for analysis of model mismatch in a gas lift optimization problem. The results of the case study indicate that the sensitivity of Online Feedback Optimization to the model mismatch depends on how long the controller has been running, with decreasing sensitivity to mismatch in individual timesteps for long operation times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples classical symbolic planning with transformer-based policies to address complex, long-horizon decision-making tasks. At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Within the context of renewable energy communities, this paper focuses on optimal operation of producers equipped with energy storage systems in the presence of demand response. A novel strategy for optimal scheduling of the storage systems of the community members under price-volume demand response programs, is devised. The underlying optimization problem is designed as a low-complexity mixed-integer linear program that scales well with the community size. Once the optimal solution is found, an algorithm for distributing the demand response rewards is introduced in order to guarantee fairness among participants. The proposed approach ensures increased benefits for producers joining a community compared to standalone operation.</description>

      <title>Decision-Dependent Stochastic Optimization: The Role of Distribution Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution shifts have long been regarded as troublesome external forces that a decision-maker should either counteract or conform to. An intriguing feedback phenomenon termed decision dependence arises when the deployed decision affects the environment and alters the data-generating distribution. In the realm of performative prediction, this is encoded by distribution maps parameterized by decisions due to strategic behaviors. In contrast, we formalize an endogenous distribution shift as a feedback process featuring nonlinear dynamics that couple the evolving distribution with the decision. Stochastic optimization in this dynamic regime provides a fertile ground to examine the various roles played by dynamics in the composite problem structure. To this end, we develop an online algorithm that achieves optimal decision-making by both adapting to and shaping the dynamic distribution. Throughout the paper, we adopt a distributional perspective and demonstrate how this view facilitates characterizations of distribution dynamics and the optimality and generalization performance of the proposed algorithm. We showcase the theoretical results in an opinion dynamics context, where an opportunistic party maximizes the affinity of a dynamic polarized population, and in a recommender system scenario, featuring performance optimization with discrete distributions in the probability simplex.</description>

      <title>Advances in Hybrid Modular Climbing Robots: Design Principles and Refinement Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the design strategies for hybrid pole- or trunk-climbing robots, focusing on methods to inform design decisions and assess metrics such as adaptability and performance. A wheeled-grasping hybrid robot with modular, tendon-driven grasping arms and a wheeled drive system mounted on a turret was developed to climb columns of varying diameters. Here, the key innovation is the underactuated arms that can be adjusted to different column sizes by adding or removing modular linkages, though the robot also features capabilities like self-locking (the ability of the robot to stay on the column by friction without power), autonomous grasping, and rotation around the column axis. Mathematical models describe conditions for self-locking and vertical climbing. Experimental results demonstrate the robot's efficacy in climbing and self-locking, validating the proposed models and highlighting the potential for fully automated solutions in industrial applications. This work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and designing hybrid climbing robots, contributing to advancements in autonomous robotics for environments where climbing tall structures is critical.</description>

Abstract: The split covariance intersection filter (split CIF) is a useful tool for general data fusion and has the potential to be applied in a variety of engineering tasks. An indispensable optimization step (referred to as w-optimization) involved in the split CIF concerns the performance and implementation efficiency of the Split CIF, but explanation on w-optimization is neglected in the paper [1] that provides a theoretical foundation for the Split CIF. This note complements [1] by providing a theoretical proof for the convexity of the w-optimization problem involved in the split CIF (convexity is always a desired property for optimization problems as it facilitates optimization considerably).</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the finite sample identification performance of an n dimensional discrete-time Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Linear Time-Invariant system, with p inputs and m outputs. We prove that the widely-used Ho-Kalman algorithm and Multivariable Output Error State Space (MOESP) algorithm are ill-conditioned for MIMO systems when n/m or n/p is large. Moreover, by analyzing the Cra\'mer-Rao bound, we derive a fundamental limit for identifying the real and stable (or marginally stable) poles of MIMO system and prove that the sample complexity for any unbiased pole estimation algorithm to reach a certain level of accuracy explodes superpolynomially with respect to n/(pm). Numerical results are provided to illustrate the ill-conditionedness of Ho-Kalman algorithm and MOESP algorithm as well as the fundamental limit on identification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a chance-constrained model predictive control (MPC) framework under Gaussian mixture model (GMM) uncertainty. Specifically, we consider the uncertainty that arises from predicting future behaviors of moving obstacles, which may exhibit multiple modes (for example, turning left or right). To address the multi-modal uncertainty distribution, we propose three MPC formulations: nominal chance-constrained planning, robust chance-constrained planning, and contingency planning. We prove that closed-loop trajectories generated by the three planners are safe. The approaches differ in conservativeness and performance guarantee. In particular, the robust chance-constrained planner is recursively feasible under certain assumptions on the propagation of prediction uncertainty. On the other hand, the contingency planner generates a less conservative closed-loop trajectory than the nominal planner. We validate our planners using state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms in autonomous driving simulators.</description>

      <title>Sufficient and Necessary Barrier-like Conditions for Safety and Reach-avoid Verification of Stochastic Discrete-time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions for infinite-horizon safety verification and reach-avoid verification of stochastic discrete-time systems, derived through a relaxation of Bellman equations. Unlike previous methods focused on barrier-like conditions that primarily address sufficiency, our work rigorously integrates both necessity and sufficiency for properties pertaining to infinite time. Safety verification aims to certify the satisfaction of the safety property, which stipulates that the probability of the system, starting from a specified initial state, remaining within a safe set always is greater than or equal to a specified lower bound. A necessary and sufficient barrier-like condition is formulated for safety verification. In contrast, reach-avoid verification extends beyond safety to include reachability, seeking to certify the satisfaction of the reach-avoid property. It requires that the probability of the system, starting from a specified initial state, reaching a target set eventually while remaining within a safe set until the first hit of the target, is greater than or equal to a specified lower bound. Two necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions are formulated under certain assumptions.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based control using sum-of-squares optimization: Improved stability guarantees and data efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown nonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the recently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear surrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the obtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one can guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While existing approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model, thus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we explicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a rational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model and, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS optimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions for unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach significantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of attraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Dynamic Line Rating Forecasting with Line Graph Convolutional LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) is a promising solution to increase the utilization of transmission lines by adjusting ratings based on real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecast at the scheduling stage is thus necessary for system operators to proactively optimize power flows, manage congestion, and reduce the cost of grid operations. However, the DLR forecast remains challenging due to weather uncertainty. To reliably predict DLRs, we propose a new probabilistic forecasting model based on line graph convolutional LSTM. Like standard LSTM networks, our model accounts for temporal correlations between DLRs across the planning horizon. The line graph-structured network additionally allows us to leverage the spatial correlations of DLR features across the grid to improve the quality of predictions. Simulation results on the synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the baseline probabilistic DLR forecasting models regarding reliability and sharpness while using the fewest parameters.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-based neural representations for computational adaptive optics in widefield microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03812v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of evolving supply chain management, the significance of efficient inventory management has grown substantially for businesses. However, conventional manual and experience-based approaches often struggle to meet the complexities of modern market demands. This research introduces an intelligent inventory management system to address challenges related to inaccurate data, delayed monitoring, and overreliance on subjective experience in forecasting. The proposed system integrates bar code and distributed flutter application technologies for intelligent perception, alongside comprehensive big data analytics to enable data-driven decision-making. Through meticulous analysis, system design, critical technology exploration, and simulation validation, the effectiveness of the proposed system is successfully demonstrated. The intelligent system facilitates second-level monitoring, high-frequency checks, and artificial intelligence-driven forecasting, consequently enhancing the automation, precision, and intelligence of inventory management. This system contributes to cost reduction and optimized inventory sizes through accurate predictions and informed decisions, ultimately achieving a mutually beneficial scenario.

      <title>Underwater Motions Analysis and Control of a Coupling-Tiltable Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupling-Tiltable Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicles (UAAVs) have gained increasing importance, yet lack comprehensive analysis and suitable controllers. This paper analyzes the underwater motion characteristics of a self-designed UAAV, Mirs-Alioth, and designs a controller for it. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through experiments. The singularities of Mirs-Alioth are derived as Singular Thrust Tilt Angle (STTA), which serve as an essential tool for an analysis of its underwater motion characteristics. The analysis reveals several key factors for designing the controller. These include the need for logic switching, using a Nussbaum function to compensate control direction uncertainty in the auxiliary channel, and employing an auxiliary controller to mitigate coupling effects. Based on these key points, a control scheme is designed. It consists of a controller that regulates the thrust tilt angle to the singular value, an auxiliary controller incorporating a Saturated Nussbaum function, and a logic switch. Eventually, two sets of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the controller and demonstrate the necessity of the Nussbaum function.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kalman-Informed Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a widely adopted method for sensor fusion in navigation applications. A crucial aspect of the EKF is the online determination of the process noise covariance matrix reflecting the model uncertainty. While common EKF implementation assumes a constant process noise, in real-world scenarios, the process noise varies, leading to inaccuracies in the estimated state and potentially causing the filter to diverge. Model-based adaptive EKF methods were proposed and demonstrated performance improvements to cope with such situations, highlighting the need for a robust adaptive approach. In this paper, we derive an adaptive Kalman-informed transformer (A-KIT) designed to learn the varying process noise covariance online. Built upon the foundations of the EKF, A-KIT utilizes the well-known capabilities of set transformers, including inherent noise reduction and the ability to capture nonlinear behavior in the data. This approach is suitable for any application involving the EKF. In a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of A-KIT in nonlinear fusion between a Doppler velocity log and inertial sensors. This is accomplished using real data recorded from sensors mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle operating in the Mediterranean Sea. We show that A-KIT outperforms the conventional EKF by more than 49.5% and model-based adaptive EKF by an average of 35.4% in terms of position accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.</description>

      <title>Online 4D Ultrasound-Guided Robotic Tracking Enables 3D Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy with Large Tissue Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-Resolution Ultrasound (SRUS) imaging through localising and tracking microbubbles, also known as Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy (ULM), has demonstrated significant potential for reconstructing microvasculature and flows with sub-diffraction resolution in clinical diagnostics. However, imaging organs with large tissue movements, such as those caused by respiration, presents substantial challenges. Existing methods often require breath holding to maintain accumulation accuracy, which limits data acquisition time and ULM image saturation. To improve image quality in the presence of large tissue movements, this study introduces an approach integrating high-frame-rate ultrasound with online precise robotic probe control. Tested on a microvasculature phantom with translation motions up to 20 mm, twice the aperture size of the matrix array used, our method achieved real-time tracking of the moving phantom and imaging volume rate at 85 Hz, keeping majority of the target volume in the imaging field of view. ULM images of the moving cross channels in the phantom were successfully reconstructed in post-processing, demonstrating the feasibility of super-resolution imaging under large tissue motions. This represents a significant step towards ULM imaging of organs with large motion.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Control for Tendon-Driven Continuum Robotic Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based approach for centralized position control of Tendon Driven Continuum Robots (TDCRs) using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), with a particular focus on the Sim-to-Real transfer of control policies. The proposed control method employs the Modified Transpose Jacobian (MTJ) control strategy, with its parameters optimally tuned using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Classical model-based controllers encounter significant challenges due to the inherent uncertainties and nonlinear dynamics of continuum robots. In contrast, model-free control strategies require efficient gain-tuning to handle diverse operational scenarios. This research aims to develop a model-free controller with performance comparable to model-based strategies by integrating an optimal adaptive gain-tuning system. Both simulations and real-world implementations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the trajectory-tracking performance of continuum robots independent of initial conditions and paths within the operational task-space, effectively establishing a task-free controller.</description>

      <title>TinySense: A Lighter Weight and More Power-efficient Avionics System for Flying Insect-scale Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce advances in the sensor suite of an autonomous flying insect robot (FIR) weighing less than a gram. FIRs, because of their small weight and size, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics, restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hovering -- the first level of ``sensor autonomy'' -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of 1.573 deg, 0.186 m/s, and 0.136 m, respectively, relative to motion capture.</description>

      <title>Robust time series generation via Schr\"odinger Bridge: a comprehensive evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generative capabilities of the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) approach for time series. The SB framework formulates time series synthesis as an entropic optimal interpolation transport problem between a reference probability measure on path space and a target joint distribution. This results in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series generation methods across diverse datasets, assessing its strengths, limitations, and capacity to model complex temporal dependencies. Our results offer valuable insights into the SB framework's potential as a versatile and robust tool for time series generation.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Enabled Blockage-Aware Dynamic mmWave Multi-Hop V2X Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication offers unprecedented data rates and low latency, but faces significant reliability challenges due to signal blockages and limited range. This paper introduces a novel system for managing dynamic multi-hop mmWave V2X communications in complex blocking environments. We present a system architecture that integrates a mobility digital twin (DT) with the multi-hop routing control plane, providing a comprehensive, real-time view of the network and its surrounding traffic environment. This integration enables the control plane to make informed routing decisions based on rich contextual data about vehicles, infrastructure, and potential signal blockages. Leveraging this DT-enhanced architecture, we propose an advanced routing algorithm that combines high-precision environmental data with trajectory prediction to achieve blockage-aware mmWave multi-hop V2X routing. Our algorithm anticipates network topology changes and adapts topology dynamically to maintain reliable connections. We evaluate our approach through proof-of-concept simulations using a mobility DT of the Nishishinjuku area. Results demonstrate that our DT-enabled routing strategy significantly outperforms conventional methods in maintaining reliable mmWave V2X connections across various traffic scenarios, including fully connected and mixed traffic environments.</description>

      <title>TeraSim: Uncovering Unknown Unsafe Events for Autonomous Vehicles through Generative Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic simulation is essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling comprehensive safety evaluation across diverse driving conditions. However, traditional rule-based simulators struggle to capture complex human interactions, while data-driven approaches often fail to maintain long-term behavioral realism or generate diverse safety-critical events. To address these challenges, we propose TeraSim, an open-source, high-fidelity traffic simulation platform designed to uncover unknown unsafe events and efficiently estimate AV statistical performance metrics, such as crash rates. TeraSim is designed for seamless integration with third-party physics simulators and standalone AV stacks, to construct a complete AV simulation system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating diverse safety-critical events involving both static and dynamic agents, identifying hidden deficiencies in AV systems, and enabling statistical performance evaluation. These findings highlight TeraSim's potential as a practical tool for AV safety assessment, benefiting researchers, developers, and policymakers. The code is available at https://github.com/mcity/TeraSim.</description>
