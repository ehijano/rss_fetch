      <title>Evidence of Replica Symmetry Breaking under the Nishimori conditions in epidemic inference on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Bayesian inference, computing the posterior distribution from the data is typically a non-trivial problem, which usually requires approximations such as mean-field approaches or numerical methods, like the Monte Carlo Markov Chain. Being a high-dimensional distribution over a set of correlated variables, the posterior distribution can undergo the notorious replica symmetry breaking transition. When it happens, several mean-field methods and virtually every Monte Carlo scheme can not provide a reasonable approximation to the posterior and its marginals. Replica symmetry is believed to be guaranteed whenever the data is generated with known prior and likelihood distributions, namely under the so-called Nishimori conditions. In this paper, we break this belief, by providing a counter-example showing that, under the Nishimori conditions, replica symmetry breaking arises. Introducing a simple, geometrical model that can be thought of as a patient zero retrieval problem in a highly infectious regime of the epidemic Susceptible-Infectious model, we show that under the Nishimori conditions, there is evidence of replica symmetry breaking. We achieve this result by computing the instability of the replica symmetric cavity method toward the one step replica symmetry broken phase. The origin of this phenomenon -- replica symmetry breaking under the Nishimori conditions -- is likely due to the correlated disorder appearing in the epidemic models.</description>

      <title>Emergent extended states in an unbounded quasiperiodic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have established that quasiperiodic lattice models with unbounded potentials can exhibit localized and multifractal states, yet preclude the existence of extended states. In this work, we introduce a quasiperiodic system that incorporates both unbounded potentials and unbounded hopping amplitudes, where extended states emerge as a direct consequence of the unbounded hopping terms overcoming the localization constraints imposed by the unbounded potential, thereby facilitating enhanced particle transport. By using Avila's global theory, we derive analytical expressions for the phase boundaries, with exact results aligning closely with numerical simulations.Intriguingly, we uncover a hidden self-duality in the proposed model by establishing a mapping to the Aubry-Andr\'e model, revealing a profound structural connection between these systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.</description>

      <title>Symmetries at the Anderson transition of correlated two-dimensional electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its Mott and antiferromagnetic behavior, as it undergoes a metal-insulator transition near a band edge. By analyzing spatial correlations of the local density of states (LDOS) with scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge and determine its critical exponent as nu = 0.75 +/- 0.1. Our findings show that both LDOS distribution functions and multifractal spectra obey two exact symmetry relations based on the Weyl group symmetry of nonlinear sigma-models. These symmetries hold across the entire transition, from extended to strongly localized states, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Additionally, we observe a power-law scaling of LDOS fluctuations close to the band edge (power -1.7), deep in the localized regime. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate that breaking time-reversal symmetry significantly improves the agreement between our experimental data and theory compared to the standard Anderson model. Overall, our results provide a unifying framework for understanding localization at the band gap edge of a strongly correlated 2D material and show how localization patterns reflect the symmetry class of disordered electronic systems.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional manifold of solutions in neural networks: insights from statistical physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these pedagogic notes I review the statistical mechanics approach to neural networks, focusing on the paradigmatic example of the perceptron architecture with binary an continuous weights, in the classification setting. I will review the Gardner's approach based on replica method and the derivation of the SAT/UNSAT transition in the storage setting. Then, I discuss some recent works that unveiled how the zero training error configurations are geometrically arranged, and how this arrangement changes as the size of the training set increases. I also illustrate how different regions of solution space can be explored analytically and how the landscape in the vicinity of a solution can be characterized. I give evidence how, in binary weight models, algorithmic hardness is a consequence of the disappearance of a clustered region of solutions that extends to very large distances. Finally, I demonstrate how the study of linear mode connectivity between solutions can give insights into the average shape of the solution manifold.</description>

      <title>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17267v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $&lt;$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</description>

      <title>Planted vertex cover problem on regular random graphs and nonmonotonic temperature-dependence in the supercooled region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a planted vertex cover problem on regular random graphs and study it by the cavity method of statistical mechanics. Different from conventional Ising models, the equilibrium ferromagnetic phase transition of this binary-spin two-body interaction system is discontinuous, as the paramagnetic phase is separated from the ferromagnetic phase by an extensive free energy barrier. The free energy landscape can be distinguished into three different types depending on the two degree parameters of the planted graph. The critical inverse temperatures at which the paramagnetic phase becomes locally unstable towards the ferromagnetic phase ($\beta_{\textrm{pf}}$) and towards spin glass phases ($\beta_{\textrm{pg}}$) satisfy $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} &gt; \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$, $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} &lt; \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$ and $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} = \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$, respectively, in these three landscapes. A locally stable anti-ferromagnetic phase emerges in the free energy landscape if $\beta_{\textrm{pf}} &lt; \beta_{\textrm{pg}}$. When exploring the free energy landscape by stochastic local search dynamics, we find that in agreement with our theoretical prediction, the first-passage time from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase is nonmonotonic with the inverse temperature. The potential relevance of the planted vertex cover model to supercooled glass-forming liquids is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of Green's functions in disordered non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization leads to various intriguing phenomena concerning spectrums and wavefunctions. Here, we study the linear response of disordered non-Hermitian systems, which is precisely described by the Green's function. We show that the average maximum value of matrix elements of Green's functions, which quantifies the maximal response against an external perturbation, exhibits different phases characterized by different scaling behaviors with respect to the system size. Whereas the exponential-growth phase is also seen in the translation-invariant systems, the algebraic-growth phase is unique to disordered non-Hermitian systems. We explain the numerical findings using the large deviation theory, which provides analytical insights into the algebraic scaling factors of non-Hermitian disordered Green's functions. Furthermore, we show that these scaling behaviors can be observed in the steady states of disordered open quantum systems, offering a quantum-mechanical avenue for their experimental detection. Our work highlights an unexpected interplay between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Sampling from the Continuous Random Energy Model in Total Variation Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous random energy model (CREM) is a toy model of spin glasses on $\{0,1\}^N$ that, in the limit, exhibits an infinitely hierarchical correlation structure. We give two polynomial-time algorithms to approximately sample from the Gibbs distribution of the CREM in the high-temperature regime $\beta&lt;\beta_{\min}:=\min\{\beta_c,\beta_G\}$, based on a Markov chain and a sequential sampler. The running time depends algebraically on the desired TV distance and failure probability and exponentially in $(1/g)^{O(1)}$, where $g$ is the gap to a certain inverse temperature threshold $\beta_{\min}$; this contrasts with previous results which only attain $o(N)$ accuracy in KL divergence. If the covariance function $A$ of the CREM is concave, the algorithms work up to the critical threshold $\beta_c$, which is the static phase transition point; while for $A$ non-concave, if $\beta_G&lt;\beta_c$, the algorithms work up to the known algorithmic threshold $\beta_G$ proposed in Addario-Berry and Maillard (2020) for non-trivial sampling guarantees. Our result depends on quantitative bounds for the fluctuation of the partition function and a new contiguity result of the ``tilted" CREM obtained from sampling, which is of independent interest. We also show that the spectral gap is exponentially small with high probability, suggesting that the algebraic dependence is unavoidable with a Markov chain approach.</description>

      <title>Abstraction requires breadth: a renormalisation group approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstraction is the process of extracting the essential features from raw data while ignoring irrelevant details. This is similar to the process of focusing on large-scale properties, systematically removing irrelevant small-scale details, implemented in the renormalisation group of statistical physics. This analogy is suggestive because the fixed points of the renormalisation group offer an ideal candidate of a truly abstract -- i.e. data independent -- representation. It has been observed that abstraction emerges with depth in neural networks. Deep layers of neural network capture abstract characteristics of data, such as "cat-ness" or "dog-ness" in images, by combining the lower level features encoded in shallow layers (e.g. edges). Yet we argue that depth alone is not enough to develop truly abstract representations. We advocate that the level of abstraction crucially depends on how broad the training set is. We address the issue within a renormalisation group approach where a representation is expanded to encompass a broader set of data. We take the unique fixed point of this transformation -- the Hierarchical Feature Model -- as a candidate for an abstract representation. This theoretical picture is tested in numerical experiments based on Deep Belief Networks trained on data of different breadth. These show that representations in deep layers of neural networks approach the Hierarchical Feature Model as the data gets broader, in agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: Artificial neural networks have been shown to be state-of-the-art machine learning models in a wide variety of applications, including natural language processing and image recognition. However, building a performant neural network is a laborious task and requires substantial computing power. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) addresses this issue by an automatic selection of the optimal network from a set of potential candidates. While many NAS methods still require training of (some) neural networks, zero-cost proxies promise to identify the optimal network without training. In this work, we propose the zero-cost proxy \textit{Network Expressivity by Activation Rank} (NEAR). It is based on the effective rank of the pre- and post-activation matrix, i.e., the values of a neural network layer before and after applying its activation function. We demonstrate the cutting-edge correlation between this network score and the model accuracy on NAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench-SSS/TSS. In addition, we present a simple approach to estimate the optimal layer sizes in multi-layer perceptrons. Furthermore, we show that this score can be utilized to select hyperparameters such as the activation function and the neural network weight initialization scheme.</description>
