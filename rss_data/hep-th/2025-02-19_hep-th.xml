      <title>Entropy Inequalities Constrain Holographic Erasure Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We interpret holographic entropy inequalities in terms of erasure correction. The non-saturation of an inequality is a necessary condition for certain schemes of holographic erasure correction, manifested in the bulk as non-empty overlaps of corresponding entanglement wedges.</description>

      <title>Particle production from inhomogeneities: general metric perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present universal formulas for particle production from gravitational inhomogeneities. In the massless limit the result is strikingly simple and completely determined by the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor that is fixed up to a constant - the central charge - for conformally coupled scalars, massless fermions and gauge fields. This result can be applied to any conformally coupled theory, weakly or strongly interacting, unifying previous derivations for fields of different spin and for scalar and tensor perturbations. We derive the results using the Schwinger method of 1PI effective action and through Bogoliubov transformations that allows to compute exclusive information on the distribution of particles. We then apply these results to stochastic backgrounds of scalar and tensor perturbations that can be generated by various phenomena such us inflationary perturbations and first order phase transitions. Differently from particle production usually considered in cosmology this mechanism allows for the production of massless fields. In particular the abundance induced by inhomogeneities can easily reproduce the dark matter abundance if scalar perturbations produced from inflation are enhanced at short scales.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Overlaps in JT Gravity: From Spectral Form Factor to Generating Functions of Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between black hole interior dynamics and quantum chaos provides a crucial framework for probing quantum effects in quantum gravity. In this work, we investigate non-perturbative overlaps in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to uncover universal signatures of quantum chaos and quantum complexity. Taking advantage of universal spectral correlators from random matrix theory, we compute the overlaps between the thermofield double (TFD) state and two distinct classes of states: fixed-length states, which encode maximal volume slices, and time-shifted TFD states. The squared overlaps naturally define probability distributions that quantify the expectation values of gravitational observables. Central to our results is the introduction of generating functions for quantum complexity measures, such as $\langle e^{-\alpha \ell} \rangle$. The time evolution of these generating functions exhibits the universal slope-ramp-plateau structure, mirroring the behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF). Using generating functions, we further demonstrate that the universal time evolution of complexity for chaotic systems, which is characterized by a linear growth followed by a late-time plateau, arises from the disappearance of the linear ramp as the regularization parameter $\alpha$ decreases. With regard to the time-shifted TFD state, we derive a surprising result: the expectation value of the time shift, which classically grows linearly, vanishes when non-perturbative quantum corrections are incorporated. This cancellation highlights a fundamental distinction between semiclassical and quantum gravitational descriptions of the black hole interior. All our findings establish generating functions as powerful probes of quantum complexity and chaos in gravitational and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic safety, quantum gravity, and the swampland: a conceptual assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a conceptual assessment of some aspects of fundamental quantum field theories of gravity in light of foundational aspects of the swampland program. On the one hand, asymptotically safe quantum gravity may provide a simple and predictive framework, thanks to a finite number of relevant parameters. On the other hand, a (sub-)set of intertwined swampland conjectures on the consistency of quantum gravity can be argued to be universal via effective field theory considerations. We answer whether some foundational features of these frameworks are compatible. This involves revisiting and refining several arguments (and loopholes) concerning the relation between field-theoretic descriptions of gravity and general swampland ideas. We identify the thermodynamics of black holes, spacetime topology change, and holography as the core aspects of this relation. We draw lessons on the features that a field theoretic description of gravity must (not) have to be consistent with fundamental principles underlying the swampland program, and on the universality of the latter.</description>

      <title>Exact expressions for the renormalization constants in the MS-like schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We briefly review how it is possible to derive some exact expressions for the renormalization constants for the MS-like renormalization prescriptions using the arguments based on the renormalization group. These expressions are obtained for a version of the dimensional technique in which the dimensionful parameter $\Lambda$ differs from the renormalization scale $\mu$. They encode the equations relating the coefficients at higher $\varepsilon$-poles, powers of $\ln \Lambda/\mu$, and mixed terms of the structure $\varepsilon^{-q} \ln^p \Lambda/\mu$ to the coefficients of the renormalization group functions (i.e. of the $\beta$-function and the anomalous dimension). The general results are verified by some multiloop calculations.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Chemistry Knows Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: : In this note, we study an extra dimension effect on the black hole chemistry in the 8-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-Maxwell theory. The base spacetime contains 4- dimensional compact manifolds and an instanton on top of those. We demonstrate how the extra dimensions affect the phase transition and viable black hole sizes in the 4-dimensional Einstein frame through the black hole chemistry. We focus on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes for the effective 4-dimensional model obtained by a dimensional reduction. The extra-dimension size determines thermodynamic pressure, and the thermodynamic volume is roughly the horizon size of black holes. Thus, the extra dimension and black hole sizes are related as a conjugate pair of thermodynamic variables. In addition, we discuss the zeroth-order phase transition of the 4-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD model for heavy and exotic mesons at finite density: A self-consistent dynamical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent dynamical holographic QCD model to investigate the mass spectra and melting behavior of heavy and exotic mesons at finite temperature and finite density. Our approach is based on the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) framework and incorporates an elsewhere already introduced, albeit by hand, phenomenological non-quadratic dilaton profile. This allows one to capture the non-linear Regge trajectories of heavy-flavor mesons and model certain exotic states. We show how to construct such models by actually solving the coupled Einstein, Maxwell, and dilaton field equations, ensuring mathematical self-consistency to replace any ad-hoc input. At finite temperature, we analyze the confinement-deconfinement transition via a Hawking-Page phase transition. We compute the spectral functions, revealing the sequential melting of quarkonia as the temperature is increased. Extending to finite density, we explore the impact of baryon chemical potential on meson stability, showing significant modifications in spectral peaks and effective potentials that indicate a more rapid melting of mesonic states as the chemical potential increases in the deconfined phase. The dual of the small/large black hole transition now indicates towards a first order phase transition line ending at a second order critical point. Interestingly, the spectral functions smoothly cross this phase transition line.</description>

      <title>Thermal time of noncommutative Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the thermal time hypothesis of arXiv:gr-qc/9406019 in the context of noncommutative deformations of Minkowski. We show that a natural modular group arises from the modular function of the momentum space. In the specific case of $\kappa$-Minkowski, we show that this thermal time flow corresponds to the globally defined time coordinate translation. On the other hand, the absence of thermal time for $\rho$-Minkowski is directly related to the discreteness of its global time. The impact of inner automorphism transformation on the physics and the treatment of unimodular case (unthermalised spacetimes) are discussed. Moreover, a reflection on the use of thermal field theory for quantum gravity phenomenology is put forward, as we just bridged thermal spacetimes with $\kappa$-Minkowski, often considered a "flat limit" of a quantum gravity candidate theory.</description>

      <title>Compact kinks in a modified Christ-Lee model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compact kinks in a modified Christ-Lee model where the potential is a non-analytic function at the minima. The model has two control parameters that determine the order of the potential and its overall shape. We consider cases in which the potential has a double well shape, a triple well shape, as well as cases with a false vacuum. Compact kink solutions and their internal modes are found for each of these cases. We also study the collision of such kinks and their dependence on the solitons velocity and on the potential parameters. Several interesting dynamical processes are reported, such as the formation of central oscillons for some high velocity collisions, absence of outgoing solitons in cases where the potential is given by piece-wise linear functions, and the decoupling of subkinks from the larger kink in cases with false vacuum, leading to the formation of false vacuum bubbles.</description>

      <title>U(1) Gauging, Continuous TQFTs, and Higher Symmetry Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theories can exhibit various generalized symmetry structures, among which higher-group symmetries and non-invertible symmetry defects are particularly prominent. In this work, we explore a new general scenario in which these two structures are intertwined. This phenomenon arises in four dimensions when gauging one of multiple $U(1)$ 0-form symmetries in the presence of mixed 't Hooft anomalies. We illustrate this with two distinct models that flow to an IR gapless phase and a gapped phase, respectively, and examine how this symmetry structure manifests in each case. Additionally, we investigate a five-dimensional model where a similar structure exists intrinsically. Our main tool is a symmetry TQFT in one higher dimension, formulated using non-compact gauge fields and having infinitely many topological operators. We carefully determine its boundary conditions and provide a detailed discussion on various dressing choices for its bulk topological operators.</description>

      <title>Geometric and General Relativistic Techniques for Non-relativistic Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores the application of differential geometric and general relativistic techniques to deepen our understanding of quantum mechanical systems. We focus on three systems, employing these mathematical frameworks to uncover subtle features within each. First, we examine Unruh radiation in the context of an accelerated two-state atom, determining transition frequencies for a variety of accelerated trajectories via first-order perturbation theory. For harmonic motion of the atom in a vacuum, we derive transition rates with potential experimental realizations. Next, we investigate the quantum Hall effect in a spherical geometry using the Dirac operator for non-interacting fermions in a background magnetic field generated by a Wu-Yang monopole. The Atiyah-Singer index theorem constrains the degeneracy of the ground state, and the fractional quantum Hall effect is studied using the composite fermion model, where Dirac strings associated with the monopole field supply the statistical gauge field vortices. A unique, gapped ground state emerges, yielding fractions of the form $\nu = \frac{1}{2k+1}$ for large particle numbers. Finally, we examine the AdS/CMT correspondence through a bulk fermionic field in an RN-AdS$_4$ background (with a U(1) gauge field), dual to a boundary fermionic operator. Spherical and planar event horizon geometries are discussed, with the temperature of the RN black hole identified with that of the dual system on the boundary. By numerically solving for the spectral functions of the dual theory, for a spherical event horizon at zero temperature, we identify a shift in the Fermi surface from that which arises in the planar case. Preliminary evidence of a phase transition emerges upon examining these spectral functions, again for the spherical horizon, at non-zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Records from the S-Matrix Marathon: Asymptotic Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures introduce the notion of asymptotic observables, which are classes of measurable quantities predicted by quantum field theory. In gapped theories with trivial infrared dynamics, these include scattering amplitudes, expectation values of operators approaching infinity, inclusive cross sections, etc. We argue for a unified picture in which various asymptotic observables are related by analytic continuation embodying new versions of crossing symmetry. As an application, we discuss the exponentiation of infrared divergences for inclusive observables in Quantum Electrodynamics using time-folded contours. Finally, we outline prospects for a systematic study of analyticity properties of asymptotic observables using the Fourier-Bros-Iagolnitzer transform. These notes are based on a series of lectures held during the S-Matrix Marathon workshop at the Institute for Advanced Study on 11-22 March 2024.</description>

      <title>AInstein: Numerical Einstein Metrics via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new semi-supervised machine learning package is introduced which successfully solves the Euclidean vacuum Einstein equations with a cosmological constant, without any symmetry assumptions. The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in that patch, with the associated Einstein conditions, of the form $R_{\mu \nu} - \lambda g_{\mu \nu} = 0$, being used as independent loss components; in our conventions, $\mu,\nu = 1, 2, \cdots, n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold and $\lambda \in \{+1, 0, -1\}$. To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, $ g' = J g J^T$, for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian $J$. We test our method for the case of spheres represented with 2 patches in dimensions $2,3,4,5$; in dimensions $2, 3$ the geometries have been fully classified, however it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can be put on spheres in dimensions $4, 5$, which we provide numerical evidence against.</description>

      <title>Learning Fricke signs from Maass form Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a data-scientific investigation of Maass forms. We find that averaging the Fourier coefficients of Maass forms with the same Fricke sign reveals patterns analogous to the recently discovered "murmuration" phenomenon, and that these patterns become more pronounced when parity is incorporated as an additional feature. Approximately 43% of the forms in our dataset have an unknown Fricke sign. For the remaining forms, we employ Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to machine learn their Fricke sign, achieving 96% (resp. 94%) accuracy for forms with even (resp. odd) parity. We apply the trained LDA model to forms with unknown Fricke signs to make predictions. The average values based on the predicted Fricke signs are computed and compared to those for forms with known signs to verify the reasonableness of the predictions. Additionally, a subset of these predictions is evaluated against heuristic guesses provided by Hejhal's algorithm, showing a match approximately 95% of the time. We also use neural networks to obtain results comparable to those from the LDA model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the vanishing order of rational $L$-functions from a data scientific perspective. Each $L$-function is represented in our data by finitely many Dirichlet coefficients, the normalisation of which depends on the context. We observe murmuration-like patterns in averages across our dataset, find that PCA clusters rational $L$-functions by their vanishing order, and record that LDA and neural networks may accurately predict this quantity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the early literature on black holes focused on event horizons, subsequently it was realized that their teleological nature makes them unsuitable for many physical applications both in classical and quantum gravity. Therefore, over the past two decades, event horizons have been steadily replaced by quasi-local horizons which do not suffer from teleology. In numerical simulations event horizons can be located as an `after thought' only after the entire space-time has been constructed. By contrast, quasi-local horizons naturally emerge in the course of these simulations, providing powerful gauge-invariant tools to extract physics from the numerical outputs. They also lead to interesting results in mathematical GR, providing unforeseen insights. For example, for event horizons we only have a qualitative result that their area cannot decrease, while for quasi-local horizons the increase in the area during a dynamical phase is quantitatively related to local physical processes at the horizon. In binary black hole mergers, there are interesting correlations between observables associated with quasi-local horizons and those defined at future null infinity. Finally, the quantum Hawking process is naturally described as formation and evaporation of a quasi-local horizon. This review focuses on the dynamical aspects of quasi-local horizons in classical general relativity, emphasizing recent results and ongoing research.</description>

      <title>Nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr$\phi$m metric in the perturbative $f(R)$ theory: Embedding in the background of the FLRW cosmology, uniqueness of solutions, the TOV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr$\phi$m metric, a metric that does not emit electromagnetic waves but can emit gravitational waves. We first use the GR theory to study a charged spherically symmetric gravitational source (CSSGS), the obtained results are further improved in comparison with the previous studies. In particular, this article considers that the field is not necessarily static. The metric tensors $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are considered both outside and inside the gravitational source (the results show that in the first case $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are time independent, in the latter case they are time dependent). The gravitational acceleration and the event horizon of a charged black hole are investigated. The results prove that the gravitational field is always attractive. We then use the perturbative $ f(R) $ theory to consider CSSGS. The obtained results not only correct the solution of Einstein's equation in magnitude (this will describe astronomical and cosmological quantities more accurately than Einstein's equation), but also reveal new effects. Outside the gravitational source, the metric tensors can depend on time, this makes it possible for a spherically symmetric gravitational source to emit gravitational waves (Einstein's equation cannot give this effect). However, a spherically symmetric field still does not emit electromagnetic waves. Next we present a new method for embedding the spherically symmetric metrics of a star (or a black hole) in the background of the FLRW cosmological. Finally, we discuss the uniqueness of the solutions of the f(R) theory. The perturbative TOV equation is also found.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of EMD-AdS black hole with deformed horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the horizon shapes of static Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) black holes can be deformed through an approach analogous to those observed in novel topological black hole solutions supported by two massless axion fields. Particularly, the radial part of the spacetime remains unchanged, while the angular part has a non-constant Ricci scalar, signaling the presence of anisotropy. We further explore the implications of this anisotropy for the thermodynamic properties of the black hole. The validity of the Misner-Sharp (MS) mass and the unified first law are also addressed in this study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel family of entanglement measures for time-separated subsystems. Our definitions are applicable to any quantum system, continuous or discrete. To illustrate their utility, we derive upper and lower bounds on time-separated correlation functions, akin to the bound on spatially separated correlators in terms of the mutual information. In certain cases our bounds are tight. For relativistic quantum field theories our definition agrees with the analytic continuation from spacelike to timelike separated regions. We provide relevant measurement protocols and execute them on the IBM quantum device ibm_sherbrooke for a simple qubit system. Also we perform explicit computations for an Ising spin chain, free fermions, (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories and holographic theories. Finally we explain how the proposed entanglement in time provides a microscopic definition for the recently introduced timelike pseudoentropy.</description>

      <title>Weighing the curvature invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove several inequalities between the curvature invariants, which impose constraints on curvature singularities, as well as asymptotic properties of spacetimes. Some of the inequalities hold for a family of spacetimes which include static, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker, and Bianchi type I metrics, independently of whether they are solutions of some particular field equations. In contrast, others hold for solutions of Einstein's gravitational field equation and a family of energy-momentum tensors, independently of the specific form of the spacetime metric. We illustrate different behaviour of the basic curvature invariants with numerous examples and discuss the consequences and limitations of the proven results.</description>

      <title>Lower bound on the radii of circular orbits in the extremal Kerr black-hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often stated in the physics literature that maximally-spinning Kerr black-hole spacetimes are characterized by near-horizon co-rotating circular geodesics of radius $r_{\text{circular}}$ with the property $r_{\text{circular}}\to r^+_{\text{H}}$, where $r_{\text{H}}$ is the horizon radius of the extremal black hole. Based on the famous Thorne hoop conjecture, in the present compact paper we provide evidence for the existence of a non-trivial lower bound ${{r_{\text{circular}}-r_{\text{H}}}\over{r_{\text{H}}}}\gtrsim (\mu/M)^{1/2}$ on the radii of circular orbits in the extremal Kerr black-hole spacetime, where $\mu/M$ is the dimensionless mass ratio which characterizes the composed black-hole-orbiting-particle system.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmic acceleration from quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <title>Parameter scanning in a quantum-gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) experiment with electromagnetic screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Witnessing the quantum nature of spacetime is an exceptionally challenging task. However, the quantum gravity-induced entanglement of matter (QGEM) protocol proposes such a test by testing entanglement between adjacent matter-wave interferometers. One key obstacle to experimentally realising this protocol is the creation of a spatial quantum superposition with heavy masses. Initially, it was envisaged that the superposition size would have to be of order 200 micron for a mass $10^{-14}$ kg (to obtain the entanglement phase of order unity when the centre of mass of the two interferometers are at a separation of 450 microns). The experimental design has since improved, e.g. by assuming that the two interferometers are separated by an electromagnetic screen, which helps bring the separation distance close to 35 micron. Here, we do parameter scans taking into account the electromagnetic screening, and we consider different geometrical setups; we show superpositions of at least a micron-size for mass $10^{-14}$ kg with a decoherence rate of order $10^{-3}$ Hz are required.</description>

      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of final particle states in the resonant trident pair production in a strong electromagnetic wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12619v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resonant trident pair production process in the collision of ultrarelativistic electrons with a strong electromagnetic wave is theoretically studied. Under resonant conditions, the intermediate virtual gamma-quantum becomes real. As a result, the original resonant trident pair production process effectively splits into two first-order processes by the fine structure constant: the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect and the electromagnetic field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler process. The kinematics of the resonant trident pair production process are studied in detail. It is shown that there are two different cases for the energies and outgoing angles of final particles (an electron and an electron-positron pair) in which their quantum entanglement is realized. In the first case, the energy and outgoing angles of final ultrarelativistic particles are uniquely determined by the parameters of the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect (the outgoing angle of the final electron and the quantum parameter of the Compton effect). In the second case, the energy and outgoing angles of final particles are uniquely determined by the electromagnetic field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler process (the electron-positron pair outgoing angle and the Breit-Wheeler quantum parameter). It is shown that in a sufficiently wide range of frequencies and intensities of a strong electromagnetic wave, and in the case of ultrarelativistic initial electrons, the differential probability of the resonant trident pair production process with simultaneous registration of the outgoing angles of final particles can significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceed the total probability of the electromagnetic field-stimulated Compton-effect.</description>

      <title>Can wormholes mirror the quasi-normal mode spectrum of Schwarzschild black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wormholes are exotic compact objects characterized by the absence of essential singularities and horizons, acting as slender bridges linking two distinct regions of spacetime. Despite their theoretical significance, they remain however undetected, possibly due to their ability to closely mimic the observational properties of black holes. This study explores whether a static and spherically symmetric wormhole within General Relativity can reproduce the quasi-normal mode spectrum of a Schwarzschild black hole under scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational perturbations, both individually and in combination. To address this, we reformulate the wormhole metric components using a near-throat parametrization. Our analysis concentrates on the fundamental mode and first overtone, estimated via the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. By employing a customized minimization strategy, we demonstrate that within a specific region of the parameter space, a wormhole can successfully replicate a subset of the black hole quasi-normal mode spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we study cosmology in dilatonic $f(R,T)$ gravity to address the inflationary phase of the early Universe. As usual, in dilatonic gravity the scalar potential assumes the exponential form. However, this potential is not good enough to be in accord with the Planck 2018 data. More strikingly, the generalized $\beta$-exponential cannot take this into account either. It is just the presence of the dilatonic sector, in the intermediate coupling regime, that can help the theory to be in full accord with the observational data.</description>

      <title>Probing Chaos in Schwarzschild-de Sitter Spacetime: The Role of Black Hole and Cosmological Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the motion of a massless, chargeless particle in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, revealing exponential radial growth and potential chaos in an integrable system. Poincar\'e sections show regular Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tori when black hole and cosmological horizons are distant, but distortions and chaos emerge as they converge. As the horizons coincide, the Poincar\'e sections fully contract and vanish, marking the system's transition to Nariai spacetime. \textit{Our analysis also suggests that, within the parameter range explored, the event horizon exerts a comparatively more substantial chaotic influence on the system, primarily due to its consistent proximity.} Additionally, we analyze the Lyapunov exponents to quantify the degree of chaos in the system. Our findings indicate that as the closeness of the two horizons increases, the most prominent Lyapunov exponent also increases, signifying a rise in chaotic behavior. By examining the long-term saturation values of the Lyapunov exponents, we confirm that they consistently comply with the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound.</description>

      <title>Geometric Flavours of Quantum Field Theory on a Cauchy Hypersurface: Gaussian Analysis for the Hamiltonian Formalism and Applications to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis explores Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on curved spacetimes using a geometric Hamiltonian approach to the Schr\"odinger-like representation. In particular it studies the theory of the scalar field described through its configurations over a Cauchy hypersurface. It is focused on mathematical consistency based on analytic and geometric tools.
  The mathematical aspects of Gaussian integration theory in infinite-dimensional Topological Vector Spaces (TVS) are thoroughly reviewed. It also reviews the complex and holomorphic versions of important results and concepts of Gaussian integration. For example, the Wiener-It\^o decomposition theorem or the definition of Hida test functions.
  The physical framework builds upon three interconnected levels: classical General Relativity (GR), Classical Statistical Field Theory (CSFT), and QFT. The work begins by extending the Koopman-van Hove (KvH) formalism of classical statistical mechanics to CSFT. This description is based upon prequantization theory. It reveals features inherent to both CSFT and QFT, that help delineate the genuine quantum features of a theory.
  Upon the prequantum program, the QFT of the scalar field is built mixing Geometric Quantization with the choice of Wick and Weyl orderings. Various quantum representations are introduced: the holomorphic, Schr\"odinger, field-momentum, and antiholomorphic. The relation among them is studied using integral transforms, including novel infinite-dimensional Fourier transforms. From a geometrical analysis, it is argued that a covariant time derivative that modifies the evolution equations should be added to the Schr\"odinger equation. This connection is unique and required by the geometrodynamical description ofthe coupling of QFT and GR.
  Finally, studying the free model on cosmological spacetimes it obtains particle creation effects on a dynamical equation.</description>

      <title>Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings with next-generation detector networks: Component separation based on a multi-source astrophysical foreground noise model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe and validating non-standard cosmological models. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. By constructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical foreground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact binary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter estimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical simulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1) The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\Delta G\mu / G\mu &lt; 0.5$ for $G\mu &gt; 3.5 \times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework; (2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard cosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies CBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of such signals could further refine $G\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of third-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates the intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological parameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing scientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Universality and emergent effective fluid from jets and string breaking in the massive Schwinger model using tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the correlation between the energy, momentum and spatial entanglement produced by two luminal jets in the massive Schwinger model. Using tensor network methods, we show that for m/g &gt; 1/{\pi}, in the vicinity of the strong to weak coupling transition, a nearly perfect and chargeless effective fluid behavior appears around the mid-rapidity region with a universal energy-pressure relationship. The evolution of energy and pressure is strongly correlated with the rise of the spatial entanglement entropy, indicating a key role of quantum dynamics. Some of these observations may be used to analyze high multiplicity jet fragmentation events, energy-energy and energy-charge correlators at current collider energies.</description>

      <title>Late-time behaviors of scalar field modes for a collapsing null shell spacetime and for the Unruh state in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behaviors of the modes for a massless minimally coupled scalar field are investigated for the Unruh state for Schwarzschild spacetime and the "in" vacuum state for a spacetime in which a spherically symmetric null shell collapses to form a nonrotating black hole. In both cases there are two different sets of solutions to the mode equation that make up the state. For both spacetimes, one set of modes oscillates forever with no damping of the oscillations and the other set approaches zero at late times. The difference between a mode that oscillates forever in the null-shell spacetime and the corresponding mode for the Unruh state vanishes as a power law in time. The modes that approach zero at late times also vanish at late times as a power law in time. In all cases the power-law damping is preceded by a period of oscillations that appear to be due to quasi-normal modes.</description>

Abstract: We show that near the edges of the conformal window of supersymmetric $SU(N_c)$ QCD, perturbed by Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB), chiral symmetry can be broken depending on the initial conditions of the RG flow. We do so by perturbatively expanding around Banks--Zaks fixed points and taking advantage of Seiberg duality. Interpolating between the edges of the conformal window, we predict that non-supersymmetric QCD breaks chiral symmetry up to $N_f \leq 3N_c - 1$, while we cannot say anything definitive for $N_f \geq 3N_c$ at this moment.</description>

      <title>An axion-like mechanism for confinement in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01047v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter is about confinement in QCD. At the moment we have pictures of confinement to complete our understanding of the physics of strongly interacting particles, interaction which asks for confinement. As it is said in [1] : " In principle it should be possible to derive the confinement hypothesis from the QCD Lagrangian. At this time, no rigorous derivation exists, so it is not absolutely clear that the confinement hypothesis is a bone fide prediction of QCD". In this letter we show that a sufficient (of course not necessary) condition for confinement is that topological structure of vacuum in Nature does not correspond to the $\theta$-vacuum. Therefore, if different vacua with nontrivial winding number cannot be connected by tunneling, we obtain confinement as a consequence. Moreover, we show that an axion-like mechanism would suffice to describe a confined QCD phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conformal version of the antisymmetric second-order tensor field in four spacetime dimensions does not have gauge invariance extensively discussed in the literature for more than half a century. Our first observation is that, when coupled to fermions, only the conformal version provides renormalizability of the theory at the one-loop level. General considerations are supported by the derivation of one-loop divergences in the fermionic sector, indicating good chances for asymptotic freedom. The arguments concerning one-loop renormalizability remain valid in the presence of self-interactions and the masses for both fermion and antisymmetric tensor fields. In the flat spacetime limit, regardless of the conformal symmetry has gone, there is an expectation to meet renormalizability in all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretical Approach to Detecting Quantum Gravitational Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One way to test quantum gravitational corrections is through black hole physics. In this paper, We investigate the scales at which quantum gravitational corrections can be detected in a black hole using information theory. This is done by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence for the probability distributions obtained from the Parikh-Wilczek formalism. We observe that the quantum gravitational corrections increase the Kullback-Leibler divergence as the mass of the black hole decreases, which is expected as quantum gravitational corrections can be neglected for larger black holes. However, we further observe that after a certain critical value, quantum gravitational corrections tend to decrease again as the mass of the black hole decreases. To understand the reason behind this behavior, we explicitly obtain Fisher information about such quantum gravitational corrections and find that it also increases as the mass decreases, but again, after a critical value, it decreases. This is because at such a scale, quantum fluctuations dominate the system and we lose information about the system. We obtain these results for higher-dimensional black holes and observe this behavior for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information depending on the dimensions of the black hole. These results can quantify the scale dependence and dimension dependence of the difficulty in detecting quantum gravitational corrections.</description>

      <title>$\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05778v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an extensive bootstrap study of Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories based on the novel analytic continuation of $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ in $n$. We first use the quantum harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap method, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. Then we derive highly accurate solutions for the anharmonic oscillators with the parity invariant potential $V(\phi)=\phi^2+\phi^{m}$ and the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant potential $V(\phi)=-(i\phi)^{m}$ for a large range of integral $m$, showing the high efficiency and general applicability of this new bootstrap approach. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we further verify that the non-integer $n$ results for $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ are consistent with those from the wave function approach. In the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant case, the existence of $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the non-Hermitian theories with non-integer powers, such as fractional and irrational $m$.</description>

      <title>Conformal anomalies for (maximal) 6d conformal supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the conformal anomalies for 6d (2,0) conformal supergravity by direct calculation in component fields. The main novel results consist of the type-B anomaly coefficients for the gravitino and the 3-form, as well as their explicit quadratic action on some specific backgrounds. We also comment on the graviton contribution, whose Lagrangian is essentially given by the $\mathscr Q$-curvature. We confirm the expectation that, when coupling (2,0) conformal supergravity to 26 copies of the (2,0) tensor multiplet, the resulting theory is free of conformal anomalies. We also consider the conformal anomalies for its (1,0) truncation and confirm their relation with the chiral anomaly polynomial recently derived. For calculating the anomalies, we work with an Einstein on-shell background and make a factorised Ansatz for the operators governing the quadratic fluctuations. This reduces the calculation to evaluating heat-kernel coefficients of standard 2-derivative operators. We fix and check the Ansatz against the explicit evaluation of the component-field supergravity action in some cases.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents and geodesic stability of Schwarzschild black hole in the non-commutative gauge theory of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of geodesic motion for both massive and massless particles using Lyapunov exponents in the non-commutative (NC) Schwarzschild black hole (BH) via the gauge theory of gravity. As a first step, we investigate the both time-like and null radial motion of particles, the mean result in NC geometry shows that the particles take infinity proper time to reach the NC singularity (infinite time affine parameter framework for photons). The proper/coordinate time of Lyapunov exponents and their ratio of time-like geodesic for the circular motion of this black hole shows a new behavior, which describes a new range of stable circular orbits between unstable ones. Then we analyze the circular motion of photons, where the result shows a new photon sphere near the event horizon which is not allowed in the commutative case, and the Lyapunov exponent is expressed in this geometry, where this confirms the instability of the outer photon sphere and the stability of the inner one. Moreover, we studied the effect of noncommutativity on the black hole shadow radius, We found a similarity between the non-commutativity and the mass of a black hole. Then we using experimental data from the event horizon telescope, we show that a noncommutativity parameter of the order of $\Theta^{\text{Phy}}\sim 10^{-32}m$.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatics, Pentagon Equations, and Hexagon Equations of Topological Orders with Loop- and Membrane-like Excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spacetime dimensions of 4 (i.e., 3+1) and higher, topological orders exhibit spatially extended excitations like loops and membranes, which support diverse topological data characterizing braiding, fusion, and shrinking processes, despite the absence of anyons. Our understanding of these topological data remains less mature compared to 3D, where anyons have been extensively studied and can be fully described through diagrammatic representations. Inspired by recent advancements in field theory descriptions of higher-dimensional topological orders, this paper systematically constructs diagrammatic representations for 4D and 5D topological orders, generalizable to higher dimensions. We introduce elementary diagrams for fusion and shrinking processes, treating them as vectors in fusion and shrinking spaces, respectively, and build complex diagrams by combining these elementary diagrams. Within these vector spaces, we design unitary operations represented by \(F\)-, \(\Delta\)-, and \(\Delta^2\)-symbols to transform between different bases. We discover \textit{pentagon equations} and \textit{(hierarchical) shrinking-fusion hexagon equations} that impose constraints on the legitimate forms of these unitary operations. We conjecture that all anomaly-free higher-dimensional topological orders must satisfy these conditions and any violations indicate a quantum anomaly. This work opens promising avenues for future research, including the exploration of diagrammatic representations involving braiding and the study of non-invertible symmetries and symmetry topological field theories in higher spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that some Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories, such as those with higher-dimensional operators with negative coefficients, lead to superluminality on some classical backgrounds. While superluminality by itself is not logically inconsistent, these theories also predict the formation of closed time-like curves at the classical level, starting from initial conditions without such curves. This leads to the formation of a Cauchy Horizon which prevents a complete description of the time evolution of such systems. Inspired by the chronology protection arguments of General Relativity, we show that quantum mechanical effects from low energy quanta strongly backreact on such configurations, exciting unknown short-distance degrees of freedom and invalidating the classical predictions. Thus, there is no obvious low-energy obstruction to the existence of these operators.</description>

Abstract: We analyze thermal correlators in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model away from the maximally chaotic limit. Despite the absence of a weakly curved black hole dual, the two point function decomposes into a sum over a discrete set of quasinormal modes. To compute the spectrum of modes, we analytically solve the Schwinger-Dyson equations to a high order in perturbation theory, and then numerically fit to a sum of exponentials using a technique analogous to the double cone construction. The resulting spectrum has a tree-like structure which is reminiscent of AdS black holes with curvature singularities. We present a simple toy model of stringy black holes that qualitatively reproduces some aspects of this structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the wave form emitted by a particle moving along an arbitrary (in general open) geodesic of the Schwarzschild geometry. The mathematical problem can be phrased in terms of quantities in ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories that can be calculated by using localization and the AGT correspondence. In particular through this mapping, the post-Newtonian expansion of the wave form is expressed as a double instanton sum with rational coefficients that resums all tail contributions into Gamma functions and exponentials. The formulae we obtain are valid for generic values of the orbital quantum numbers $\ell$ and $m$. For $\ell=2,3$ we check explicitly that our results agree with the small mass ratio limit of the wave forms derived in the Multipole Post-Minkowskian and the amplitudes approaches. We show how the so-called tail and tail of tail contributions to the wave form arise in our approach. Finally, we derive a universal formula for the soft limit of the wave form that resums all logarithmic divergent terms of the form $\omega^{n-1} (\log \omega)^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known for some time that generalised geometry provides a particularly elegant rewriting of the action and symmetries of 10-dimensional supergravity theories, up to the lowest nontrivial order in fermions. By exhibiting the full symmetry calculations in the second-order formalism, we show in the $\mathcal N=1$ case that this analysis can be upgraded to all orders in fermions and we obtain a strikingly simple form of the action as well as of the supersymmetry transformations, featuring overall only five higher-fermionic terms. Surprisingly, even after expressing the action in terms of classical (non-generalised geometric) variables one obtains a simplification of the usual formulae. This in particular confirms that generalised geometry provides the natural set of variables for studying (the massless level of) string theory. We also show how this new reformulation implies the compatibility of the Poisson-Lie T-duality with the equations of motion of the full supergravity theory.</description>

      <title>Effective Strings in QED$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective string theory describes the physics of long confining strings in theories, like Yang-Mills theory, where the mass gap $M_{gap}^2$ is of the same order as the string tension $T$. In $2+1$ dimensions, there is a class of confining theories, including massive QED$_3$ as first analyzed by Polyakov, for which $M_{gap}^2\ll T$. These theories are weakly coupled at low energies of order $M_{gap}$, and may be analyzed perturbatively. In this paper, we analyze the physics of strings in such theories, focusing on QED$_3$, at energies of order $M_{gap}$ (but still well below $\sqrt{T}$). We argue that the width of the string in these theories should be of order $1/M_{gap}$ independently of its length, as long as the string is not exponentially long. We also compute at leading order in perturbation theory the ground state energy of a confining string on a circle, and the scattering of Nambu-Goldstone bosons on the string worldsheet.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Pre-Big Bang scenario from a cosmological interpretation of the NANOGrav data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a recently proposed fit of the 15-year data set obtained from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) in terms of a relic stochastic background of primordial gravitons, produced in the context of the string cosmology pre-big bang scenario. We show that such interpretation cannot be reconciled with a phenomenologically viable minimal version of such scenario, while it can be allowed if one considers an equally viable but generalised, non-minimal version of pre-big bang evolution. Maintaining the $S$-duality symmetry throughout the high-curvature string phase is possible although somewhat disfavoured. The implications of this non-minimal scenario for the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation on relativistic neutral scalar bosons: Scattering and bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on a relativistic neutral scalar boson within the framework of the Klein-Gordon formalism. We consider a tensor $(K_F)_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ out of the Standard Model Extension, which describes the field configuration consisting of a constant magnetic field $\vec{B}=B\hat{z}$ and a cylindrical electric field $\vec{E}=\frac{\lambda}{r}\hat{r}$. We analyze and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the equation of motion and show that the presence of a specific Lorentz symmetry violation parameter is essential to obtain analytical solutions for scattering and bound states. Employing the partial wave approach in cylindrical coordinates, we calculate the relativistic phase shift, scattering amplitude and $S$-matrix, and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the phase shift. Furthermore, we obtain bound-state solutions by examining the poles of the $S$-matrix and compare our findings with those reported in the literature. Our results reveal that bound-state solutions are only feasible for a restrict range of Lorentz symmetry violation parameters, which contradict previous studies.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents as probes for phase transitions of Kerr-AdS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study proper time Lyapunov exponents and coordinate time Lyapunov exponents of chaos for both massless and massive particles orbiting four-dimensional and five-dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes, and explore their relationships with phase transitions of these black holes. The results reveal that these exponents can reflect the occurrence of phase transitions. Specifically, when compared to the Lyapunov exponents of massive particles in chaotic states, the exponents corresponding to massless particles demonstrate a more robust capability in describing the phase transitions. Furthermore, we conduct a study on critical exponents associated with the Lyapunov exponents in these black holes, identifying a critical exponent value of 1/2.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Quartic-in-Spin Binary Dynamics at Third Post-Minkowskian Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the conservative and radiation-reaction contributions to classical observables in the gravitational scattering between a spinning and a spinless black hole to the fourth order in spin and third order in the gravitational constant. The conservative results are obtained from two-loop amplitudes for the scattering process of a massive scalar with a massive spin-$s$ field $(s=0, 1, 2)$ minimally coupled to gravity, employing the recently introduced spin interpolation method to resolve all spin-Casimir terms. The two-loop amplitude exhibits a spin-shift symmetry in both probe limits, which we conjecture to be a sign of yet unknown integrability of Kerr orbits through the quartic order in spin and to all orders in the gravitational constant. We obtain the radial action from the finite part of the amplitude and use it to compute classical observables, including the impulse and spin kick. This is done using the recently introduced covariant Dirac brackets, which allow for the computation of classical scattering observables for general (non-aligned) spin configurations. Finally, employing the radiation-reaction amplitude proposed by Alessio and Di Vecchia, together with the Dirac brackets, we obtain radiation-reaction contributions to observables at all orders in spin and beyond the aligned-spin limit. We find agreement with known results up to the quadratic order in spin for both conservative and radiation-reaction contributions. Our results advance the state of the art in the understanding of spinning binary dynamics in general relativity and demonstrate the power and simplicity of the Dirac bracket formalism for relating scattering amplitudes to classical observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate tensor condensates and chiral condensates in the (2+1)-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at finite temperature and density in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The emergence of the tensor condensate is attributed to the four-fermion interaction. It is shown that a sufficiently large chemical potential is necessary for the occurrence of a phase transition towards tensor condensate. Furthermore, we investigate the correlation between tensor condensate and spin polarization, which accounts for the oscillatory behavior of the spin polarization during the transition from the chiral condensate to tensor condensate phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.08027v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 1-parameter families of holomorphic curves with Lagrangian boundary in Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We show that the expected codimension-1 phenomena can be organized to match the HOMFLYPT skein relations from quantum topology. It follows that counting holomorphic curves by the class of their boundaries in the skein module of the Lagrangian gives a deformation invariant result. This is a mathematically rigorous incarnation of Witten's assertion that boundaries of open topological strings create line defects in Chern-Simons theory.
  Using this theory, we rigorously establish the following prediction of Ooguri and Vafa: the coefficients of the HOMFLYPT polynomial of a link in the three-sphere count the holomorphic curves in the resolved conifold, with boundary on (a pushoff of) the link conormal.</description>

Abstract: We study the notion of optical geometry, defined to be a Lorentzian manifold equipped with a null line distribution, from the perspective of intrinsic torsion. This is an instance of a non-integrable version of holonomy reduction in Lorentzian geometry. These generate congruences of null curves, which play an important r\^{o}le in general relativity. Conformal properties of these are investigated. We also extend this concept to generalised optical geometries as introduced by Robinson and Trautman.</description>

      <title>Relative quantum cohomology of the Chiang Lagrangian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the open Gromov-Witten disk invariants and the relative quantum cohomology of the Chiang Lagrangian $L_\triangle \subset \mathbb{C}P^3$. Since $L_\triangle$ is not fixed by any anti-symplectic involution, the invariants may augment straightforward $J$-holomorphic disk counts with correction terms arising from the formalism of Fukaya $A_\infty$-algebras and bounding cochains. These correction terms are shown in fact to be non-trivial for many invariants. Moreover, examples of non-vanishing mixed disk and sphere invariants are obtained.
  We characterize a class of open Gromov-Witten invariants, called basic, which coincide with straightforward counts of $J$-holomorphic disks. Basic invariants for the Chiang Lagrangian are computed using the theory of axial disks developed by Evans-Lekili and Smith in the context of Floer cohomology. The open WDVV equations give recursive relations which determine all invariants from the basic ones. The denominators of all invariants are observed to be powers of $2$ indicating a non-trivial arithmetic structure of the open WDVV equations. The magnitude of invariants is not monotonically increasing with degree. Periodic behavior is observed with periods $8$ and $16.$</description>

Abstract: We study nonequilibrium spin dynamics in differentially rotating systems, deriving an effective Hamiltonian for conduction electrons in the comoving frame. In contrast to conventional spin current generation mechanisms that require vorticity, our theory describes spins and spin currents arising from differentially rotating systems regardless of vorticity. We demonstrate the generation of spin currents in differentially rotating systems, such as liquid metals with Taylor-Couette flow. Our alternative mechanism will be important in the development of nanomechanical spin devices.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as possible probes for quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>

      <title>Nucleation of de Sitter from the anti de Sitter spacetime in scalar field models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in the framework of Einstein-scalar gravity, the gravitational coupling can drive the nucleation of the de Sitter (dS) spacetime from an anti de Sitter (AdS) one. This is done using a static and spherically-symmetric metastable scalar lump solution. This features an $\text{AdS}_4$ spacetime in the solution's core, allows for $\text{dS}_4$ vacua and is plagued by a tachyonic instability. Using the Euclidean action formalism in the semiclassical approximation, we compute and compare the probability amplitudes and the free energies of the $\text{AdS}_{4}$ lump and the $\text{dS}_4$ vacua. Our results show that the former is generally less favored than the latter, with the most preferred state being a $\text{dS}_4$ vacuum. Thus, we interpret the lump as a metastable state which mediates the decay of the $\text{AdS}_4$ spacetime into the true $\text{dS}_4$ vacuum. We argue that this nucleation mechanism of dS spacetime may provide insights into the short-distance behavior of gravity, in particular for the characterization of supergravity vacua, cosmological inflation and the black-hole singularity problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into the deformation of spinor structures within nontrivial topologies and their physical implications. The deformation is modeled by introducing real functions that modify the standard spinor dynamics, leading to distinct physical regions characterized by varying degrees of Lorentz symmetry violation. It allows us to investigate the effects in the dynamical equation and a geometrized nonlinear sigma model. The findings suggest significant implications for the spinor fields in regions with nontrivial topologies, providing a robust mathematical approach to studying exotic spinor behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.</description>
