      <title>Studying Two-Photon Exchange in Deep Inelastic Scattering with the HERA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon exchange (TPE) is one of the leading explanations for discrepancies in measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factors. It has been proposed that TPE could impact not only elastic scattering, but also the cross sections for both inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS, thereby affecting the interpretation of DIS structure functions in terms of parton distributions. It is expected that higher-order QED effects such as TPE should manifest as a deviation from unity in the ratio of \epp and \emp DIS cross sections. We use the existing inclusive $e^{\pm}p$ DIS data from HERA and SLAC to constrain higher-order QED effects on inclusive DIS.</description>

      <title>Mapped $spdf$ interacting boson model for quadrupole-octupole collective states in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dipole bosons are introduced in the interacting boson model (IBM) by means of the self-consistent mean-field method. The constrained mean-field calculations employing a given nuclear energy density functional yield the potential energy surfaces in terms of the axially-symmetric quadrupole-octupole, dipole-quadrupole, and dipole-octupole deformations. By mapping these energy surfaces onto the expectation values of the IBM Hamiltonian in the coherent state of the interacting $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$ bosons, strength parameters of the $spdf$-IBM Hamiltonian are determined. In an illustrative application to octupole-deformed actinides $^{218-230}$Ra and $^{220-232}$Th, it is shown that effects of including $p$ bosons in the IBM mapping are to lower significantly negative-parity yrast levels, and to improve descriptions of observed energy-level systematic in nearly spherical and transitional nuclei, and of the behaviors of the reduced electric dipole transitions and intrinsic dipole moments with neutron number.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e covariant quantum molecular dynamics: a covariant description of a system of interacting wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new formulation for the mean-field propagation part of the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics, simulating an $N$-body system of interacting Gaussian wave packets via Lorentz scalar and vector potentials. Covariant equations of motion are derived based on the principle of least action. These covariant equations of motion can be solved with a computational cost comparable to that of conventional noncovariant quantum molecular dynamics. Furthermore, the new equations of motion accurately estimate the density-dependent potential, as demonstrated through comparison of the forces with the numerical integration. We apply them to $N$-body systems interacting via the Skyrme-type potentials or the relativistic mean field to simulate heavy-ion collisions. Our results show that the derived equations of motion provide a robust approximation to the dynamics of the full numerical integrations.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Ray Composition and Muon-philic Dark Matter via Muon Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel cosmic-ray scattering experiment employing a Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) muon tomography system. By introducing the scattering angle between incident and outgoing cosmic-ray tracks as a key observable, this approach enables simultaneous studies of secondary cosmic-ray composition and searching for new physics. During a 63-day campaign, 1.18 million cosmic ray scattering events were recorded and analyzed. By performing combined template fits to the observed angular distribution, particle abundances are measured, for example, resolving the electron component at $\sim 2\%$ precision. Furthermore, constraints are established on elastic muon-dark matter (DM) scattering cross-sections for muon-philic dark matter. At the 95\% confidence level, the limit reaches 1.62 $\times$ $10^{-17}$ $\rm{cm}^{2}$ for 1 GeV slow DM, demonstrating sensitivity limit to light muon-coupled slow DM.</description>

      <title>Production of Jets at STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jets serve as an important tool to probe QCD both in the vacuum and in the hot and dense medium. The STAR experiment at RHIC plays a key role in studying QCD phenomena across different collision systems ($p$+$p$, $p$+A, A+A), offering access to a kinematic regime that complements that of the LHC. Building on recent jet and event activity studies at STAR, we present recent measurements on charged-particle jets at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~200$ GeV. In $p$+Au collisions, we explore event activity (EA) measured in the Au-going direction and its correlation with particle production at mid-rapidity. While soft particle production increases with EA, high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ jets are found to be inversely related to EA. Ratios of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ imbalance and azimuthal dijet separation between high- and low-EA events show no significant differences, suggesting no strong evidence of jet quenching in high-EA $p$+Au collisions. In Au+Au collisions, we report semi-inclusive measurements of jets recoiling from $\gamma$ and $\pi^0$ triggers, using mixed-event techniques to subtract background and study jet suppression, intra-jet broadening, and acoplanarity. Additionally, we present inclusive charged-particle jet spectra corrected for background fluctuations, extending the kinematic reach of previous measurements. These results provide crucial insight into the modification of jets in the medium and contribute to a deeper understanding of QCD in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Higher-order symmetry plane correlations in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{{\it s}_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlations between event-by-event fluctuations of symmetry planes are measured in Pb--Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV recorded by the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. This analysis is conducted using the Gaussian Estimator technique, which is insensitive to biases from correlations between different flow amplitudes. The study presents, for the first time, the centrality dependence of correlations involving up to five different symmetry planes. The correlation strength varies depending on the harmonic order of the symmetry plane and the collision centrality. Comparisons with measurements from lower energies indicate no significant differences within uncertainties. Additionally, the results are compared with hydrodynamic model calculations. Although the model predictions provide a qualitative explanation of the experimental results, they overestimate the data for some observables. This is particularly true for correlators that are sensitive to the non-linear response of the medium to initial-state anisotropies in the collision system. As these new correlators provide unique information -- independent of flow amplitudes -- their usage in future model developments can further constrain the properties of the strongly-interacting matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>J/$\psi$-hadron correlations at midrapidity in pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{\it s}}$ = 13 TeV</title>

Abstract: We report on the measurement of inclusive, non-prompt, and prompt J/$\psi$-hadron correlations by the ALICE Collaboration at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $13~\text{TeV}$. The correlations are studied at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.9$) in the transverse momentum ranges $p_{\rm T} &lt; 40~\text{GeV}/c$ for the J/$\psi$ and $0.15 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 10~\text{GeV}/c$ and $|\eta|&lt;0.9$ for the associated hadrons. The measurement is based on minimum bias and high multiplicity data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of $L_{\text{int}} = 34~\text{nb}^{-1}$ and $L_{\text{int}} = 6.9~\text{pb}^{-1}$, respectively. In addition, two more data samples are employed, requiring, on top of the minimum bias condition, a threshold on the tower energy of $E = 4$ and $9~\text{GeV}$ in the ALICE electromagnetic calorimeters, which correspond to integrated luminosities of $L_{\text{int}} = 0.9~\text{pb}^{-1}$ and $L_{\text{int}} = 8.4~\text{pb}^{-1}$, respectively. The azimuthally integrated near and away side yields of associated charged hadrons per J/$\psi$ trigger are presented as a function of the J/$\psi$ and associated hadron transverse momentum. The measurements are discussed in comparison to PYTHIA calculations.</description>

      <title>Search for quasi-particle scattering in the quark-gluon plasma with jet splittings in pp and Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{\textit{s}_{\rm NN}} = 5.02}$ TeV</title>

Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration reports measurements of the large relative transverse momentum ($k_{\text{T}}$) component of jet substructure in pp and Pb$-$Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. Enhancement in the yield of such large-$k_{\text{T}}$ emissions in head-on Pb$-$Pb collisions is predicted to arise from partonic scattering with quasi-particles of the quark-gluon plasma. The analysis utilizes charged-particle jets reconstructed by the anti-$k_{\text{T}}$ algorithm with resolution parameter $R=0.2$ in the transverse-momentum interval $60 &lt; p_{\text{T,ch jet}} &lt; 80$ GeV/$c$. The soft drop and dynamical grooming algorithms are used to identify high transverse momentum splittings in the jet shower. Comparison of measurements in Pb$-$Pb and pp collisions shows medium-induced narrowing, corresponding to yield suppression of high-$k_{\text{T}}$ splittings, in contrast to the expectation of yield enhancement due to quasi-particle scattering. The measurements are compared to theoretical model calculations incorporating jet modification due to jet-medium interactions ("jet quenching"), both with and without quasi-particle scattering effects. These measurements provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms and theoretical modeling of jet quenching.</description>

      <title>System size and energy dependence of the mean transverse momentum fluctuations at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-by-event fluctuations of the event-wise mean transverse momentum, $\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}\rangle$, of charged particles produced in proton$-$proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeV, Xe$-$Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 5.44 TeV, and Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 5.0 TeV are studied using the ALICE detector based on the integral correlator $\langle\langle \Delta p_{\rm T}\Delta p_{\rm T}\rangle\rangle $. The correlator strength is found to decrease monotonically with increasing produced charged-particle multiplicity measured at midrapidity in all three systems. In Xe$-$Xe and Pb$-$Pb collisions, the multiplicity dependence of the correlator deviates significantly from a simple power-law scaling as well as from the predictions of the HIJING and AMPT models. The observed deviation from power-law scaling is expected from transverse radial flow in semicentral to central Xe$-$Xe and Pb$-$Pb collisions. In pp collisions, the correlation strength is also studied by classifying the events based on the transverse spherocity, $S_0$, of the particle production at midrapidity, used as a proxy for the presence of a pronounced back-to-back jet topology. Low-spherocity (jetty) events feature a larger correlation strength than those with high spherocity (isotropic). The strength and multiplicity dependence of jetty and isotropic events are well reproduced by calculations with the PYTHIA 8 and EPOS LHC models.</description>

      <title>Studying charm hadronisation into baryons with azimuthal correlations of $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ with charged particles in pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{\it s} = 13}$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of angular correlations between prompt charm hadrons and primary charged particles in pp collisions is sensitive to the charm-quark hadronisation process. In this letter, charm-baryon correlations are measured for the first time by studying the azimuthal-angle difference between charged particles and prompt $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryons produced in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, with the ALICE detector. $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryons are reconstructed at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.5$) in the transverse-momentum interval $3 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 16$ GeV/$c$, and correlated with charged particles with $p_{\rm T} &gt; 0.3$ GeV/$c$ and pseudorapidity $|\eta| &lt; 0.8$. For $3&lt; p_{\rm T}^{\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+},{\rm D}} &lt;5$ GeV/$c$, the comparison with published measurements of D-meson and charged-particle correlations in the same collision system hints at a larger number of low-momentum particles associated with $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$-baryon triggers than with D-meson triggers, both in the collinear and opposite directions with respect to the trigger particle. These differences can be quantified by the comparison of the properties of the near- and away-side correlation peaks, and are not reproduced by predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, generally underpredicting the associated particle yields at $p_{\rm T}^{\rm assoc}&lt;1$ GeV/$c$. This tension between $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$-baryon and D-meson associated peak yields could suggest a modified fragmentation of the charm quark, or a different hadronisation process, when a charm baryon is produced in the final state.</description>

      <title>Mirror-skin thickness: a possible observable sensitive to the charge symmetry breaking energy density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new observable, named the mirror-skin thickness, in order to extract the strength of the charge symmetry breaking (CSB) term in an energy density functional (EDF). The mirror-skin thickness of $ N = 20 $ isotones and $ Z = 20 $ isotopes is studied by using Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations with various Skyrme EDFs and adding CSB and charge independence breaking (CIB) terms. It is shown that the mirror-skin thickness is sensitive only to the CSB EDF, but hardly depends on either the isospin symmetric part of the nuclear EDF or the CIB term. Therefore, this observable can be used to extract the magnitude of the CSB term in the EDF quantitatively, either from experimental data or ab initio calculations. We have studied the accuracy in the mirror-skin thickness that is needed to extract sensible information. Our study may also help to understand the inconsistency between the strength of the phenomenological CSB and that extracted from ab initio calculations [Naito et al. Nuovo. Cim. C 47, 52 (2024)]. Among possible mirror pairs for experimental study, we propose the mirror-skin thickness between $ {}^{42} \mathrm{Ca} $ and $ {}^{42} \mathrm{Ti} $, which could be accessed in future experiments in RIBF and/or FRIB.</description>

      <title>Transverse spin polarization as a novel probe of medium-induced transverse-momentum-broadening effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons within unpolarized jets originates from the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) fragmentation function $D_{1T}^\perp (z, p_T, \mu^2)$. In the vacuum environment, the QCD evolution of this TMD fragmentation function is governed by the Collins-Soper equation. However, in the presence of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium, the jet-medium interaction induces a transverse-momentum-broadening effect that modifies the QCD evolution. As a result, the transverse spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions differs from that in $pp$ collisions. We demonstrate that this difference serves as a sensitive probe for studying jet-medium interaction, offering a novel perspective through the spin degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>
