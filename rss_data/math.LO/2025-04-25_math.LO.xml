      <title>Feasibility of Primality in Bounded Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the correctness of the AKS algorithm \cite{AKS} within the bounded arithmetic theory $T^{count}_2$ or, equivalently, the first-order consequence of the theory $VTC^0$ expanded by the smash function, which we denote by $VTC^0_2$. Our approach initially demonstrates the correctness within the theory $S^1_2 + iWPHP$ augmented by two algebraic axioms and then show that they are provable in $VTC^0_2$. The two axioms are: a generalized version of Fermat's Little Theorem and an axiom adding a new function symbol which injectively maps roots of polynomials over a definable finite field to numbers bounded by the degree of the given polynomial. To obtain our main result, we also give new formalizations of parts of number theory and algebra:
  $\bullet$ In $PV_1$: We formalize Legendre's Formula on the prime factorization of $n!$, key properties of the Combinatorial Number System and the existence of cyclotomic polynomials over the finite fields $Z/p$.
  $\bullet$ In $S^1_2$: We prove the inequality $lcm(1,\dots, 2n) \geq 2^n$.
  $\bullet$ In $VTC^0$: We verify the correctness of the Kung--Sieveking algorithm for polynomial division.</description>

      <title>Many-valued aspects of tense an related operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our research builds upon Halmos's foundational work on functional monadic Boolean algebras and our previous work on tense operators to develop three essential constructions, including the important concepts of fuzzy sets and powerset operators. These constructions have widespread applications across contemporary mathematical disciplines, including algebra, logic, and topology. The framework we present generates four covariant and two contravariant functors, establishing three adjoint situations.</description>

      <title>On the structure of modal and tense operators on a boolean algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the poset NO(B) of necessity operators on a boolean algebra B. We show that NO(B) is a meet-semilattice that need not be distributive. However, when B is complete, NO(B) is necessarily a frame, which is spatial iff B is atomic. In that case, NO(B) is a locally Stone frame. Dual results hold for the poset PO(B) of possibility operators. We also obtain similar results for the posets TNO(B) and TPO(B) of tense necessity and possibility operators on B. Our main tool is Jonsson-Tarski duality, by which such operators correspond to continuous and interior relations on the Stone space of B.</description>

      <title>Outward compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new type of compactness principle for strong logics that, roughly speaking, infers the consistency of a theory from the consistency of its small fragments in certain outer models of the set-theoretic universe. We refer to this type of compactness property as outward compactness, and we show that instances of this type of principle for second-order logic can be used to characterize various large cardinal notions between measurability and extendibility, directly generalizing a classical result of Magidor that characterizes extendible cardinals as the strong compactness cardinals of second-order logic. In addition, we generalize a result of Makowsky that shows that Vop\v{e}nka's Principle is equivalent to the existence of compactness cardinals for all abstract logics by characterizing the principle "Ord is Woodin" through outward compactness properties of abstract logics.</description>
