      <title>Algorithmic Idealism II: Reassessment of Competing Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the intersection of identity, individuality, and reality through competing frameworks, including classical metaphysics, quantum mechanics, and computational theories. Traditional metaphysical notions of fixed identity are challenged by advancements in cloning, teletransportation, and digital replication, which reveal the fluid and relational nature of individuality. Quantum mechanics further complicates these notions, emphasizing the indistinguishability and contextuality of fundamental particles. Computational approaches, such as the Ruliad and Constructor Theory, offer expansive views of emergent realities but often lack practical constraints for observer relevance. Algorithmic idealism is introduced as a unifying framework, proposing that reality is an emergent construct governed by computational rules prioritizing coherence, sufficiency, and observer-dependent experiences. By redefining identity as an informational construct and reality as a process shaped by algorithmic transitions, algorithmic idealism resolves foundational paradoxes and offers a superior lens for understanding existence in an increasingly digital and interconnected world. The framework bridges gaps between competing theories, providing a coherent and pragmatic model for addressing ethical, metaphysical, and technological challenges.</description>

      <title>Trajectories of Change: Approaches for Tracking Knowledge Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore local vs. global evolution of knowledge systems through the framework of socio-epistemic networks (SEN), applying two complementary methods to a corpus of scientific texts. The framework comprises three interconnected layers-social, semiotic (material), and semantic-proposing a multilayered approach to understanding structural developments of knowledge. To analyse diachronic changes on the semantic layer, we first use information-theoretic measures based on relative entropy to detect semantic shifts, assess their significance, and identify key driving features. Second, variations in document embedding densities reveal changes in semantic neighbourhoods, tracking how concentration of similar documents increase, remain stable, or disperse. This enables us to trace document trajectories based on content (topics) or metadata (authorship, institution). Case studies of Joseph Silk and Hans-J\"urgen Treder illustrate how individual scholar's work aligns with broader disciplinary shifts in general relativity and gravitation research, demonstrating the applications, limitations, and further potential of this approach.</description>

      <title>Two Egyptian Kings, Shepseskaf and Userkaf, and a solar eclipse (2471 BC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, arXiv published a work by G. Magli about the eclipse of 1 April 2471 BC and a supposed influence of it on the end of the fourth Egyptian dynasty and the beginning of the fifth one. In Magli's arXiv/2412.13640 paper, the eclipse is defined as the 'Shepseskaf eclipse'. Magli considers that this eclipse happened during the reign of the 'last ruler of the 4th dynasty, Shepseskaf'. Some literature is giving the name of further members of this dynasty. Therefore, here we add some references, besides those given in arXiv. We will show that, in this literature, the same eclipse of 2471 BC is linked to king Userkaf of the fifth dynasty. Some observations about chronological data proposed by Magli are also necessary. Since in arxiv/2412.13640 paper we find mentioned by Magli the pyramid of Cheops (that is Akhet Khufu, a name which is generally translated as the Khufu's horizon) and the symbol of the 'solarized' horizon, N27 of the Gardiner's list, it is necessary to stress that the word Akhet was written with the crested ibis, G25, as clearly shown by the Wadi al-Jarf papyri, which are contemporary to Khufu's reign. Mark Lehner, 2001, recognizing a translation problem, rendered Akhet Khufu as the 'Spirit of Khufu'. The use of the crested ibis, in a locution translated as 'dwellers of the horizon' is attested in a Pepi II letter to his vizier Herkhuf, then three centuries after Khufu.</description>
