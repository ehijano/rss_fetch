      <title>Identifiability Limits of Low-Rank RFI Mitigation Under Single-Epoch Constraints: A Controlled Failure-Mode Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has introduced a new class of radio frequency interference (RFI) that poses a fundamental challenge to modern radio astronomy. In particular, unintended electromagnetic radiation emitted by satellite electronics exhibits strong temporal variability and weak spectral regularity, limiting the effectiveness of conventional mitigation techniques that rely on long term averaging or multi epoch observations. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of low rank interference mitigation in the single epoch regime, where only a single time frequency snapshot is available. We formulate satellite induced interference as a structured but non stationary component superposed on astrophysical signals and thermal noise, and analyze the conditions under which low rank decomposition can successfully suppress interference while preserving underlying astronomical information. Through controlled simulations and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that aggressive rank truncation can lead to substantial signal distortion, particularly for diffuse or low signal to noise astrophysical features. We quantify this trade off using preservation and suppression metrics, and show that beyond a critical interference strength, low rank methods inevitably induce irreversible information loss. Our results clarify the operational boundaries of low rank approaches for next generation radio observations and highlight the need for interference aware, data driven mitigation strategies tailored to the single epoch regime.</description>

      <title>Light-tight skipper-CCDs for X-ray detection in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skipper Charge-Coupled Devices (skipper-CCDs) are pixelated silicon detectors with deep sub-electron resolution. Their radiation hardness and capability to reconstruct energy deposits with unprecedented precision make them a promising technology for space-based X-ray astronomy. In this scenario, optical and near-infrared photons may saturate the sensor, distorting the reconstructed signal. We present a light-tight shield for skipper-CCDs to suppress optical backgrounds while preserving X-ray detection efficiency. We deposited thin aluminum layers on the CCD surface using an e-beam evaporator and evaluated their blinding performance across wavelengths from 650 to 1000 nm using a monochromator, as well as the X-ray transmission using an $^{55}$Fe source. We find that 50 and 100\,nm layers provide &gt;99.6\% light suppression, with no efficiency loss for 5.9 and 6.4\,keV X-rays. In addition, we used Geant4 simulations to extend these results to a broader energy range and quantify the efficiency loss for different aluminum thicknesses. Results show that thin aluminum coatings are an effective, low-cost solution for optical suppression in skipper-CCDs intended for X-ray detection and space instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Combining datasets with different ground truths using Low-Rank Adaptation to generalize image-based CNN models for photometric redshift prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can be used to combine different galaxy imaging datasets to improve redshift estimation with CNN models for cosmology. LoRA is an established technique for large language models that adds adapter networks to adjust model weights and biases to efficiently fine-tune large base models without retraining. We train a base model using a photometric redshift ground truth dataset, which contains broad galaxy types but is less accurate. We then fine-tune using LoRA on a spectroscopic redshift ground truth dataset. These redshifts are more accurate but limited to bright galaxies and take orders of magnitude more time to obtain, so are less available for large surveys. Ideally, the combination of the two datasets would yield more accurate models that generalize well. The LoRA model performs better than a traditional transfer learning method, with $\sim2.5\times$ less bias and $\sim$2.2$\times$ less scatter. Retraining the model on a combined dataset yields a model that generalizes better than LoRA but at a cost of greater computation time. Our work shows that LoRA is useful for fine-tuning regression models in astrophysics by providing a middle ground between full retraining and no retraining. LoRA shows potential in allowing us to leverage existing pretrained astrophysical models, especially for data sparse tasks.</description>

      <title>Spectral performance of single-channel plastic and GAGG scintillator bars of the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our Sun is the closest X-ray astrophysical source to Earth. As such, it makes a formidable case study to better understand astrophysical processes. Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model.</description>

      <title>ASCNet: Research on all-sky camera images classification at the Muztagh-ata site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud coverage is one of the crucial elements of site testing in astronomy. All-sky camera (ASC) images are beneficial for our research on cloud coverage. In this paper, we propose ASCNet, an innovative model specifically designed for classifying nighttime ASC images collected at the Muztagh-ata site from 2022 March to 2024 June. ASCNet integrates ResNet34 with an ASCModule, which employs Depthwise Dilated Convolution and embeds lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation attention within its branches to extract fine-grained texture information from the luminance channel. The data set is partitioned by category, with 70% of images assigned to the training set and 30% to the test set. The model's performance is assessed by comparing its predictions on the test set with manually annotated labels, yielding a consistency rate of 92.7%. All evaluation metrics of ASCNet are as follows: Accuracy 92.66%, Precision 83.26%, Recall 84.25%, and F1-Score 83.67%, and both ablation and comparative experiments demonstrate significant superiority over other models. A confusion matrix is utilized to analyze the differences between manual classification and model classification. The statistical results demonstrate the model's excellent classification performance and its robust generalization ability, illustrating that ASCNet has potential for application in future astronomical image classifications.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Future of X-Ray Polarimetry with IXPE: Lessons Learned and Next Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses issues encountered during the early development of the instrument on the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), a NASA ASI Small Explorer mission launched on 9 December 2021. IXPE has observed about 100 sources, yielding meaningful polarimetry for most of them. An on-board calibration system mitigated most non-ideal detector behaviors during operations. Data from the on-board polarized and unpolarized X-ray sources are routinely ingested by the flight pipeline to correct the instrument response in a manner transparent to users. Based on its scientific return and payload health, the IXPE mission has been extended through 2028. The lessons learned are informing the design of next-generation X-ray polarimetry missions, as discussed elsewhere in these conferences.</description>

      <title>Covertly Active Comet (139359) 2001 ME1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 2018 November 18, coronagraphs onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) captured an unrecognized comet crossing its fields of view. We identified this comet to be the minor planet (139359) 2001 ME1 whose previously unnoticed dust activity near perihelion became optically amplified by efficient forward scattering of sunlight as the comet crossed between the Sun and SOHO/Earth at up to 175.6 deg phase angle. Simultaneous backscattering observations by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) precisely constrain the comet's ~7 mag forward scattering brightening, enabling a direct comparison with the ~3 mag brightening of the more active but optically dust-poor comet 2P/Encke seen by SOHO and STEREO under similar geometry in 2017. Earlier STEREO observations from 2014 additionally show the newly recognized activity to be recurrent -- consistent with a reanalysis of the comet's associated meteor activity -- and has likely only been previously overlooked due to the comet's faintness and proximity to the Sun while active. Orbital integrations show the comet has likely followed a near-Earth orbit for at least the past 10 kyr, suggesting that the weakness of its observed activity evolved through its continued depletion of accessible volatiles.</description>

      <title>Evolution of bar formation in galaxies over the last 6 giga-years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the evolution of bar formation in disk galaxies over the last 6 giga-years by analyzing the barred galaxy fraction as a function of key structural parameters. A representative sample of local and distant field galaxies was studied using bar detection techniques based on elliptical isophotes and Fourier decomposition. The analysis focuses on the dependence of bar formation on stellar mass, color index, and bulge-to-total ratio (B/T). In the local universe, the bar fraction increases with stellar mass and is higher in red, more evolved galaxies, suggesting that disk stability plays a fundamental role in bar formation. In contrast, distant galaxies exhibit a significantly lower bar fraction, indicating that dynamically unstable disks in earlier cosmic epochs limited both the formation and persistence of bars. Bars are more frequent in galaxies with disk-dominated structures (low B/T) at all redshifts; however, even these systems show a reduced bar fraction at higher redshift. Overall, the results highlight the importance of disk stabilization in driving the morphological evolution of galaxies across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial Test of Shapiro Time Delay: Forth test of Einstein General Theory of Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Shapiro time delay is one of the four classical tests of Einstein general theory of relativity and is commonly interpreted as a constrain on the parametrized post Newtonian (PPN) parameter gamma, which is exactly unity in general relativity. To date all measurement of the Shapiro time delay have been confined to astrophysical and solar system observations, yielding constrains on the PPN parameter gamma at the 10-5 level. In this work, we propose a fiber based Sagnac interferometer for precision terrestrial measurements of the Shapiro time delay, enabling a laboratory scale determination of gamma with an intrinsic sensitivity approaching 10-9. This approach provides an independent test of general relativity in a previously unexplored regime.</description>

      <title>A New Empirical Fit to Galaxy Rotation Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new empirical model for galaxy rotation curves that introduces a velocity correction term {\omega}, derived from observed stellar motion and anchored to Keplerian baselines. Unlike parametric halo models or modified gravity theories, this approach does not alter Newtonian dynamics or invoke dark matter distributions. Instead, it identifies a repeatable kinematic offset that aligns with observed rotation profiles across a wide range of galaxies. Using SPARC data [1], we demonstrate that this model consistently achieves high fidelity fits, often outperforming MOND and CDM halo models in RMSE and R-squared metrics without parametric tuning. The method is reproducible, minimally dependent on mass modeling, and offers a streamlined alternative for characterizing galactic dynamics. While the velocity correction {\omega} lacks a definitive physical interpretation, its empirical success invites further exploration. We position this model as a local kinematic tool rather than a cosmological framework, and we welcome dialogue on its implications for galactic structure and gravitational theory. Appendix B presents RMSE and R2 comparisons showing that this method consistently outperforms MOND and CDM halo models across a representative galaxy sample.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Imprints in the Lyman-Alpha Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy (DE) remains elusive, even though it constitutes the dominant energy-density component of the Universe and drives the late-time acceleration of cosmic expansion. By combining measurements of the expansion history from baryon acoustic oscillations, supernova surveys, and cosmic microwave background data, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has inferred that the DE equation of state may evolve over time. The profound implications of a time-variable, ``dynamical" DE (DDE) that departs from a cosmological constant motivate the need for independent observational tests. In this work, we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation to investigate how DDE affects the properties of the Lyman-Alpha ``forest'' of absorption features produced by neutral hydrogen in the cosmic web. We find that DDE models consistent with the DESI constraints induce a spectral tilt in the forest transmitted flux power spectrum, imprinting a scale- and redshift-dependent signature relative to standard Lambda-CDM cosmologies. These models also yield higher intergalactic medium temperatures and reduced Lyman-Alpha opacity compared to Lambda-CDM. We discuss the observational implications of these trends as potential avenues for independent confirmation of DDE.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO XIX. Measuring stellar velocity dispersion with sub-percent accuracy for cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of massive elliptical galaxies is a key ingredient in breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy and obtaining precise and accurate cosmography from gravitational time delays. The relative uncertainty on the Hubble constant H$_0$ is double the relative error on $\sigma$. Therefore, time-delay cosmography imposes much more demanding requirements on the precision and accuracy of $\sigma$ than galaxy studies. While precision can be achieved with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), the accuracy critically depends on key factors such as the elemental abundance and temperature of stellar templates, flux calibration, and wavelength ranges. We carried out a detailed study of the problem using multiple sets of
  galaxy spectra of massive elliptical galaxies with S/N$\sim$30--160 \AA$^{-1}$, along with state-of-the-art empirical and semi-empirical stellar libraries and stellar population synthesis templates. We show that the choice of stellar library is generally the dominant source of residual systematic errors. We propose a general recipe for mitigating and accounting for residual uncertainties. We show that a sub-percent level of accuracy can be achieved on individual spectra with our data quality, which we subsequently validated with simulated mock datasets. The covariance between velocity dispersions measured for a sample of spectra can also be reduced to sub-percent levels. We recommend this recipe for all applications that require high precision and accurate stellar kinematics. Thus, we have made all the software publicly available to facilitate its implementation. This recipe will also be used in future TDCOSMO collaboration papers.</description>
