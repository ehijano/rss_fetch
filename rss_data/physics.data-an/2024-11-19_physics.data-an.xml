      <title>Constrained composite Bayesian optimization for rational synthesis of polymeric particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymeric nano- and micro-scale particles have critical roles in tackling critical healthcare and energy challenges with their miniature characteristics. However, tailoring their synthesis process to meet specific design targets has traditionally depended on domain expertise and costly trial-and-errors. Recently, modeling strategies, particularly Bayesian optimization (BO), have been proposed to aid materials discovery for maximized/minimized properties. Coming from practical demands, this study for the first time integrates constrained and composite Bayesian optimization (CCBO) to perform efficient target value optimization under black-box feasibility constraints and limited data for laboratory experimentation. Using a synthetic problem that simulates electrospraying, a model nanomanufacturing process, CCBO strategically avoided infeasible conditions and efficiently optimized particle production towards predefined size targets, surpassing standard BO pipelines and providing decisions comparable to human experts. Further laboratory experiments validated CCBO capability to guide the rational synthesis of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles with diameters of 300 nm and 3.0 $\mu$m via electrospraying. With minimal initial data and unknown experiment constraints, CCBO reached the design targets within 4 iterations. Overall, the CCBO approach presents a versatile and holistic optimization paradigm for next-generation target-driven particle synthesis empowered by artificial intelligence (AI).</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Model Identification Using Time Delayed Nonlinear Maps for Systems with Multiple Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a method, along with its algorithmic and computational framework implementation, and performance verification for dynamical system identification. The approach incorporates insights from phase space structures, such as attractors and their basins. By understanding these structures, we have improved training and testing strategies for operator learning and system identification. Our method uses time delay and non-linear maps rather than embeddings, enabling the assessment of algorithmic accuracy and expressibility, particularly in systems exhibiting multiple attractors. This method, along with its associated algorithm and computational framework, offers broad applicability across various scientific and engineering domains, providing a useful tool for data-driven characterization of systems with complex nonlinear system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model reconstruction for nonlinear wave dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to predict wave dynamics is a topic of growing interest, but commonly-used deep learning approaches suffer from a lack of interpretability of the trained models. Here we present an interpretable machine learning framework for analyzing the nonlinear evolution dynamics of optical wavepackets in complex wave media. We use sparse regression to reduce microscopic discrete lattice models to simpler effective continuum models which can accurately describe the dynamics of the wavepacket envelope. We apply our approach to valley-Hall domain walls in honeycomb photonic lattices of laser-written waveguides with Kerr-type nonlinearity and different boundary shapes. The reconstructed equations accurately reproduce the linear dispersion and nonlinear effects including self-steepening and self-focusing. This scheme is proven free of the a priori limitations imposed by the underlying hierarchy of scales traditionally employed in asymptotic analytical methods. It represents a powerful interpretable machine learning technique of interest for advancing design capabilities in photonics and framing the complex interaction-driven dynamics in various topological materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose estimators for dynamic second order response theory in coarse grained variables for driven out-of-equilibrium subsystems. The error is controlled through the the notion of subsystem spectral gap for the convergence of coarse grained observables.</description>

      <title>Deep Multimodal Representation Learning for Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL), a technique most prominently used in natural language and computer vision, has been used to train informative representation spaces for galaxy spectra and images in a self-supervised manner. Following this idea, we implement CL for stars in the Milky Way, for which recent astronomical surveys have produced a huge amount of heterogeneous data. Specifically, we investigate Gaia XP coefficients and RVS spectra. Thus, the methods presented in this work lay the foundation for aggregating the knowledge implicitly contained in the multimodal data to enable downstream tasks like cross-modal generation or fused stellar parameter estimation. We find that CL results in a highly structured representation space that exhibits explicit physical meaning. Using this representation space to perform cross-modal generation and stellar label regression results in excellent performance with high-quality generated samples as well as accurate and precise label predictions.</description>
