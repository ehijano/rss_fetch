      <title>Ultra-broadband soliton microcombs in resonantly-coupled microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton microcombs -- equidistant spectral lines generated from nonlinear microresonators -- have endowed integrated photonics with unprecedented precision and parallelization. However, generating broadband microcombs is challenged by the required pump power that scales quadratically with the number of comb lines. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating a resonant coupler passively enhances the effective pump power by several orders of magnitude, thereby expanding the soliton microcomb's usable bandwidth by a factor of 3. Moreover, the resonant coupler enables unconventional tuning dynamics that facilitate thermally robust access to soliton states. Powered by an on-chip laser, the soliton microcomb delivers unprecedented spectral coverage. Our strategy overcomes the power constraints in generating broadband soliton microcombs and paves the way for their deployment in timing, metrology, and communications.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast one-chip optical receiver with functional metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed optical receivers are crucial in modern optical communication systems. While complex photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are widely employed to harness the full degrees of freedom (DOFs) of light for efficient data transmission, their waveguide nature inherently constrains two-dimensional spatial scaling to accommodate a large number of optical signals in parallel. Here, we present a novel optical receiver platform that fully exploits the high spatial parallelism and ultrabroad bandwidth of light, while leveraging all DOFs - intensity, phase, and polarization. Our solution integrates a thin metasurface, composed of silicon nanoposts, with ultrafast membrane photodetectors on a compact chip. The metasurface provides all the functionalities of conventional PICs for normal-incident spatially parallelized light, enabling high-speed detection of optical signals in various modulation formats, including simultaneous detection of 320-gigabits-per-second four-channel signals and coherent detection of a 240-gigabits-per-second signal.</description>

      <title>Integrated microring resonator and waveguide polarizers based on partially photo-reduced 2D graphene oxide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical polarizers, which selectively transmit light with specific polarization states, are essential components in modern optical systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate integrated waveguide and microring resonator (MRR) polarizers incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO). 2D graphene oxide (GO) films are integrated onto silicon photonic devices with precise control over their thicknesses and sizes, followed by GO reduction via two different methods including uniform thermal reduction and localized photothermal reduction. We measure devices with different lengths, thicknesses, and reduction degrees of the GO films. The results show that the devices with rGO exhibit better performance than those with GO, achieving a polarization-dependent loss of ~47 dB and a polarization extinction ratio of ~16 dB for the hybrid waveguides and MRRs with rGO, respectively. By fitting the experimental results with theory, it is found that rGO exhibits more significant anisotropy in loss, with an anisotropy ratio over 4 times that of GO. In addition, rGO shows higher thermal stability and greater robustness to photothermal reduction than GO. These results highlight the strong potential of rGO films for implementing high-performance polarization selective devices in integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Hybrid confinement techniques for polariton simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons in III-V semiconductor microcavities offer a robust platform for emulating complex Hamiltonians, enabling advancements in photonic applications and quantum simulation. Here, two novel fabrication techniques designed to overcome the limitations of traditional photonic confinement methods are introduced. The two distinct approaches - etch-and-oversputter (EnS) and deposit-and-oversputter (DnS) - are both based on a structured, locally elongated semiconductor cavity, leading to a deep and highly controllable spatially dependent potential. By utilizing an all-dielectric sputtered top mirror, sample iteration time, workflow complexity and expense is reduced while increasing the overall yield compared to methods such as deep ion etching. Employing a Kagome lattice and its flatband and Dirac-cone dispersions as a benchmark, high quality optical band structures are achieved, which so far have not been realized using a deep etching approach. To highlight the precise control over the lattice couplings, the eigenmodes in a two-dimensional breathing Kagome lattice are studied and polariton lasing from a zerodimensional corner mode is observed. This confirms the effectiveness of the methods presented in this paper for generating well-controlled, deep and homogeneous trapping potentials. These pave the way for fabricating intricate lattices, such as higher-order topological insulators, or on-chip quantum emitters utilizing the polariton blockade mechanism.</description>

      <title>Hermite-Gaussian multi-mode excitation in spatial gain shaping approaches for laser resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the excitation of transverse laser modes through spatial gain shaping, while focusing on the boundary between selective single-mode and multi-mode lasing. By deliberately reducing the similarity between intensity distributions of pump and laser mode, it was studied, if and which other modes are excited besides the target mode, and how the modes compete for the spatially distributed gain. Analysis of the usually unwanted multi-mode lasing revealed characteristic properties of pump distributions adapted to Hermite-Gaussian $\text{HG}_{m,0}$ modes: a center-heavy pump distribution at first distinctly excites the target mode and eventually low-order modes, whereas an eccentric pump distribution reduces the lasing threshold at the expense of distinction to the neighboring modes. By understanding why certain gain distributions do not excite a single mode, we infer guidelines for the design of pump patterns in spatial gain shaping approaches.</description>

      <title>A compact unshielded optically-pumped magnetic gradiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically-pumped magnetic gradiometers (OPGs) play a crucial role in applications such as magnetic anomaly detection and bio-magnetic measurements. This study classifies current OPGs into four types based on their differential modes: voltage, frequency, optical rotation, and magnetic field differential modes. We introduce the concept of inherent Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) and analyze the differences between the inherent CMRR and the measured CMRR, as well as the upper limit of inherent CMRR. We point out that although magnetic field differential method has the potential to increase inherent CMRR by a factor of 1+AF, the difference between the feedback gains is often neglected, which may set the limit of inherent CMRR. We designed and fabricated a compact, unshielded OPG with a specially designed scheme to minimize the distance between the sensing heads and the magnetic source. Measurement results demonstrate a measured CMRR of 1200@1Hz and a sensitivity of approximately 5 pT/cm/\sqrt{Hz} from 1 Hz to 100 Hz.</description>

      <title>Extreme Terahertz Nonlinearity of AlGaN/GaN-based Grating-Gate Plasmonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to enhance THz nonlinearity by the resonant excitation of two-dimensional plasmons in grating-gate plasmonic crystals. Using a high-electric-field THz pump-THz probe technique, we investigate the nonlinear interaction of spectrally narrow THz pulses with plasmon oscillations in a two-dimensional electron gas on an AlGaN/GaN interface integrated with metallic grating. Nonlinear effects are observed as ultrafast, pump-induced changes in THz transmission, with relative transparency strongly dependent on plasmonic mode excitation and saturating at pump fluences of about 200 nJ cm-2. The maximal relative transparency, reaching 45 % at 350 nJ cm -2, occurs under resonant excitation of a localized plasmon mode at the strong electrostatic modulation of 2DEG concentration. Transient dynamics reveal ultrafast relaxation times of 15-20 ps, while the effects can be observed at elevated temperatures of up to 150 K. A nonlinear model of plasmonic crystal, based on finite-difference time-domain electrodynamic simulations coupled with viscous hydrodynamic electron transport model, elucidates key nonlinear mechanisms, including near-field effects under metallic gratings, electron heating, plasmon resonance broadening, and redshift. These results demonstrate that even conventional semiconductors such as AlGaN/GaN can achieve nonlinear THz responses comparable to or exceeding those of graphene, showing strong potential for ultrafast THz modulation and nonlinear photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Space compatibility of emerging, wide-bandgap, ultralow-loss integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonics has revolutionized optical communication, sensing, and computation, offering miniaturized and lightweight solutions for spacecraft with limited size and payload. Novel chip-scale instruments based on ultralow-loss integrated photonic platforms, including lasers, frequency combs and atomic traps, have been developed for space applications. Therefore, quantifying the space compatibility of ultralow-loss photonic integrated circuits (PICs), particularly their radiation resistance, is critical. This study experimentally evaluates the radiation resistance of ultralow-loss Si$_3$N$_4$, 4H-SiC, and LiNbO$_3$ PICs under intense $\gamma$-ray and high-energy proton irradiation. Results show that proton irradiation with $1.1 \times 10^{10}$ $\mathrm{p/cm^2}$ total flux does not significantly increase optical loss or alter the refractive index of these PICs, while $\gamma$-ray irradiation with 1.2 Mrad accumulated dose only marginally increases their optical loss. These findings provide preliminary evidence of the excellent space compatibility of ultralow-loss Si$_3$N$_4$, 4H-SiC, and LiNbO$_3$ PICs, highlighting their potential for compact and lightweight space systems.</description>

      <title>On-Demand Pulse Shaping with Partially Coherent Pulses in Nonlinear Dispersive Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we employ the complex screen method to investigate the dynamic evolution of partially coherent pulses with specified properties as they propagate through a nonlinear Kerr medium. Our results reveal that partially coherent pulses can retain stable pulse characteristics and exhibit enhanced robustness when the source coherence is reduced. Importantly, by adjusting the source pulse properties, the far-zone pulse properties can be customized on demand, even in highly nonlinear environments. These findings are of significant importance for applications such as pulse shaping, free-space optical communication, information encryption etc. in nonlinear media. Notably, the results offer valuable insights for mitigating nonlinear effects in light beams within the spatial domain.</description>

      <title>Low-Loss Integration of High-Density Polymer Waveguides with Silicon Photonics for Co-Packaged Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-Packaged Optics applications require scalable and high-yield optical interfacing solutions to silicon photonic chiplets, offering low-loss, broadband, and polarization-independent optical coupling while maintaining compatibility with widely used approaches for electrical redistribution. We present two heterogeneous integration techniques that enable high-density electrical and optical I/O connections, utilizing adiabatic coupling between on-chip silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides and package-level polymer optical waveguides. In the first approach, polymer waveguides are patterned using standard lithography directly on the surface of the photonic chip, ensuring compatibility with chip embedding as commonly employed in chip-first fanout wafer-level packaging. In the second approach, photonic chips are flip-chip bonded to the package substrate. Both techniques have been experimentally validated, achieving a coupling efficiency near 1 dB between SiN and polymer waveguides in O-band, for both TE and TM polarizations. SiN tapers were designed using the "Mono" method to optimize phase-matching conditions between the two waveguides, a critical requirement for integrating diverse optical components. These results demonstrate the potential of polymer waveguides in Co-Packaged Optics applications, achieving sub-2 dB chip-to-chip and chip-to-fiber coupling losses.</description>

      <title>Universal analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a structural point of view, plasmonic nanoparticles are always at least two-layer structures with a dielectric layer of stabilizing, targeting, fluorescent, Raman, or other functional molecules, often embedded in a matrix such as porous silica. To optimize the optical properties of such bioconjugates, one needs efficient analytical models based on simple physical ideas and with reasonable accuracy comparable to rigorous numerical methods requiring significant computer resources. Here, we present such type models based on a combination of the modal expansion method (MEM) and the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The MEM+DEM approach makes it possible to use the MEM parameters of the original metal particles and does not require additional numerical calculations to build models for bilayered or multilayered conjugates. Our analytical solutions depend on the particle shape, the shell thickness, and the shell refractive index, regardless of the particle size and the metal's nature. To illustrate the universality of our method, we calculate extinction and scattering spectra of gold and silver nanorods, nanodiscs, triangle nanoprisms, bicones, and bipyramids with a dielectric coating thickness from 0 to 30 nm. For the main plasmonic peaks, we found excellent agreement between our analytical method and numerical simulations performed with COMSOL. Due to the simplicity and reasonable accuracy of the MEM+DEM analytical models, they can help apply machine learning to predict various plasmonic responses such as light absorption, scattering, SERS, and metal-enhanced fluorescence.</description>

      <title>Comments on: "Introduction to the Absolute Brightness and Number Statistics in Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion" (2019 J. Opt. 21, 043501)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These comments contain two primary improvements to the aforementioned article:
  Where previously mentioned in passing in section 3.4 of our article, we now provide, using the same basic steps as in Bennink's paper, [Phys. Rev. A 81, 053805 (2010)] (with some expanded discussion), a full derivation for the absolute generation rate of photon pairs from Spontaneous-Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) when using a focused gaussian pump beam as input, and collecting the output biphotons in a pair of focused gaussian collection modes. We do this to both show consistency between our formalism and his treatment, and to be able to use it to predict the absolute brightness of photon pair generation in these sources. In doing so, our formula differs from that in [Phys. Rev. A 81, 053805 (2010)] by only a constant factor based on the ratio of products of indices of refraction.
  Second, we correct an abuse of notation in our main work in which the quantization dimensions of the cavity modes of the electromagnetic field are conflated with the dimensions of the nonlinear medium. While this does not meaningfully affect the final formulas we obtain for the generation rates in the paper (adding a dimensionless correction factor of order unity), we use the gaussian-mode SPDC derivation here to show how the factors of the quantization dimensions disappear when converting from a discrete-momentum basis of rectangular cavity modes to a continuous frequency basis of gaussian spatial modes. In doing this, we find that applying this correction factor to our previous theoretical predictions for the photon pair generation rates brings them closer to the obtained experimental values.</description>

      <title>Chemically resolved nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy by longitudinal magnetization detection with a diamond magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-inductive magnetometers based on solid-state spins offer a promising solution for small-volume nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection. A remaining challenge is to operate at a sufficiently high magnetic field to resolve chemical shifts at the part-per-billion level. Here, we demonstrate a Ramsey-M_z protocol that uses Ramsey interferometry to convert an analyte's transverse spin precession into a longitudinal magnetization (M_z), which is subsequently modulated and detected with a diamond magnetometer. We record NMR spectra at B0=0.32 T with a fractional spectral resolution of ~350 ppb, limited by the stability of the electromagnet bias field. We perform NMR spectroscopy on a ~1 nL detection volume of ethanol and resolve the chemical shift structure with negligible distortion. Through simulation, we show that the protocol can be extended to fields up to B0=3 T, with minimal spectral distortion, using composite nuclear-spin inversion pulses. For sub-nanoliter analyte volumes, we estimate a resolution of ~1 ppb and concentration sensitivity of ~40 mM s^{1/2} is feasible with improvements to the sensor design. Our results establish diamond magnetometers as high-resolution NMR detectors in the moderate magnetic field regime, with potential applications in metabolomics and pharmaceutical research.</description>

      <title>Giant moment increase by ultrafast laser light</title>

Abstract: It is now well established that a few femtosecond laser pulse will induce an ultrafast loss of moment in a magnetic material. Here we show that the opposite effect can also occur: an ultrafast increase in moment. Employing both tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory we find that laser light tuned to the majority spin conduction band in the 2d magnets CrI$_3$ and CrSBr generates an ultrafast giant moment increase, of up to 33\% in the case of CrI$_3$ (2~$\mu_B$). Underpinning this is spin-orbit induced valence band spin texture that, in combination with a strong field light pulse, facilitates an optical spin flip transition involving both intra- and inter-band excitation. Our findings, that establish a general mechanism by which ultrafast light pulses may enhance as well as decrease the magnetic moment, point towards rich possibilities for light control over magnetic matter at femtosecond times.</description>

      <title>Scene-based nonuniformity correction with homography transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their affordable, low mass, and small dimensions, uncooled microbolometer-based thermal focal plane arrays (UC-FPAs) are useful for long-wave infrared (LWIR)imaging applications. However, in outdoor conditions typical in agricultural remote sensing, cameras based on UC-FPAs may suffer from drift in offset and gain. To tackle the persistent drift, the system requires continuous calibration. Our goal in this study was to eliminate this requirement via a computational schema. In a former study, we estimated unknown gain and offset values and thermographic images of an object from a sequence of pairs of successive images taken at two different blur levels.In the current work, we took on a similar problem using a sequence of shifted images, with relative shifts caused by realistic drone hovering modeled by homography transformation. This places our work in the realm of scene-based nonuniformity correction problems. We show that an object's thermographic values, as well as gain and offset, can be jointly estimated by relying on a few sets of shifted images. We use a minimum likelihood estimator, which is found using alternating minimization. Registration is done using a generalized Lucas-Kanade method. Simulations show promising accuracy with mean Pearson correlation of more than 0.9999998 between ground truth and restoration. Under ideal assumptions, this is equivalent to a mean restoration error of less than 0.01 Celsius degree.</description>

      <title>THz-Driven Coherent Phonon Fingerprints of Hidden Symmetry Breaking in 2D Layered Hybrid Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) emerged as a family of novel semiconductors with outstanding optoelectronic properties for applications in photovoltaics and light emission. Recently, they also attract interest as promising candidates for spintronics. In materials lacking inversion symmetry, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leads to the Rashba-Dresselhaus effect, offering a pathway for spin current control. Therefore, inversion symmetry breaking in MHPs, which are characterized by strong SOC, has crucial implications. Yet, in complex low-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), the presence of and structural contributions to inversion symmetry breaking remain elusive. Here, employing intense THz fields, we coherently drive lattice dynamics carrying spectroscopic fingerprints of inversion symmetry breaking in Ruddlesden-Popper (PEA)$_2$(MA)$_{n-1}$PbnI${3n+1}$ perovskites, which are globally assigned to a centrosymmetric space group. We demonstrate coherent control by THz pulses over specific phonons, which we assign to either purely inorganic or highly anharmonic hybrid cage-ligand vibrations. By developing a general polarization analysis for THz-driven phonons, we pinpoint linear and nonlinear driving mechanisms. From this, we identify simultaneous IR- and Raman-activity of inorganic cage modes below 1.5 THz, indicating mode-selective inversion symmetry breaking. By exploring the driving pathways of these coherent phonons, we lay the groundwork for simultaneous ultrafast control of optoelectronic and spintronic properties in 2D HOIPs.</description>

      <title>Generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs from two interacting quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled photon pairs are key elements in quantum communication and quantum cryptography. State-of-the-art sources of entangled photons are mainly based on parametric-down conversion from nonlinear crystals, which is probabilistic in nature, and on cascade emission from biexciton quantum dots, which finds difficulties in generating entangled photons in the visible regime. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that polarization-entangled photon pairs can be emitted from two interacting quantum emitters with two-level-system behaviour and perpendicular transition dipole moments. These emitters can represent a large variety of systems (e.g., organic molecules, quantum dots and diamond-color centers) offering a large technological versatility, for example in the spectral regime of the emission. We show that a highly entangled photon pair can be post-selected from this system by including optical filters. Additionally, we verify that the photon entanglement is not significantly affected by small changes in the detection directions and in the orientation between the dipole moments.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Computational Photovoltaic Study of Lead-free Inorganic NaSnCl$_3$-based Perovskite Solar Cell: Effect of Charge Transport Layers and Material Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead-free all-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising alternative to toxic lead-based solar cells and organic solar cells, which have limited stability. This work explores such a PSC with sodium tin chloride (NaSnCl$_3$) as the absorber, due to its significant potential for optoelectronic applications. To investigate this potential, a comprehensive computational analysis of NaSnCl$_3$-based solar cells is performed using the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS -1D). Simulations are performed for device structures with front contact/Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/electron transport layer (ETL)/NaSnCl$_3$/hole transport layer (HTL)/back contact configuration, where TiO$_2$, SnS$_2$, IGZO, ZnSe, CdS, GaSe, ZnSnN$_2$, WS$_2$, PCBM, STO, and CSTO are utilized as ETLs and CNTS, GO, Mg-CuCrO$_2$, Spiro-OMeTAD, CdTe, GaAs, MoTe$_2$, BaSi$_2$, and P3HT are utilized as HTLs. Based on the obtained power conversion efficiency (PCE), six best ETL-HTL combinations with SnS$_2$, STO, WS$_2$, IGZO, ZnSe and CSTO as ETLs and MoTe$_2$ as HTL are chosen for further analysis. The effects of different material and device parameters, such as thickness and doping density; effective density of states; bulk and interface defects; series and shunt resistance; and operating conditions, such as temperature and light intensity are investigated. Using the optimized material parameters, SnS$_2$ ETL and MoTe$_2$ HTL-based solar cell show the best performance with open circuit voltage, Voc = 1.196V, short circuit current density, Jsc = 35.82 mA/cm$^2$, fill factor, FF = 89.72% and PCE = 38.42%. This detailed study provides valuable insights for the fabrication of high efficiency NaSnCl$_3$-based solar cells.</description>

      <title>Complementary Speckle STED Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy has emerged as a powerful technique providing visualization of biological structures at the molecular level in living samples. In this technique, the diffraction limit is broken by selectively depleting the fluorophore's excited state by stimulated emission, typically using a donut-shaped optical vortex beam. STED microscopy performs unrivalably well in degraded optical conditions such as living tissues. Nevertheless, photo-bleaching and acquisition time are among the main challenges for imaging large volumetric field of views. In this regard, random light beams like speckle patterns have proved to be especially promising for three-dimensional imaging in compressed sensing schemes. Taking advantage of the high spatial density of intrisic optical vortices in speckles -- the most commonly used beam spatial structure used in STED microscopy -- we propose here a novel scheme consisting in performing STED microscopy using speckles. Two speckle patterns are generated at the excitation and the depletion wavelengths, respectively, exhibiting inverted intensity contrasts. We illustrate spatial resolution enhancement using complementary speckles as excitation and depletion beam on both fluorescent beads and biological samples. Our results establish a robust method for super-resolved three-dimensional imaging with promising perspectives in terms of temporal resolution and photobleaching.</description>

Abstract: The work shows that visualization using microparticles allows one to distinguish objects that are inaccessible during direct observation. This analysis is based on a full two-dimensional simulation of optical image formation taking into account the diffraction of partially coherent light on the microparticle and the objects under study. The oscillating nature of optical resolution is shown depending on the size of the microparticle. The presence of strong resonances is shown in both transmission and reflection modes.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of biological cells using surface plasmon coupled emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological cell imaging has become one of the most crucial research interests due to its wide-ranging applications in biomedical and microbiology studies. However, three-dimensional (3D) imaging of biological cells remains critically challenging and often requires prohibitively expensive and complex equipment. Therefore, a low-cost imaging technique with a simpler optical arrangement is highly desirable. We propose an approach to obtain accurate 3D cell images using surface plasmon coupled emission (SPCE) patterns from a fluorescently labeled biological cell, eliminating the need for conventional microscopes or extensive data processing. An imaging methodology has been developed and theoretically demonstrated to reconstruct 3D cell structures from detected SPCE patterns. The reconstructed 3D images closely match the actual cell geometries. The technique has been applied to both regular and irregular cell shapes. In each case, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the reconstructed images and the actual structures remains within a few percent. For a circular-shaped cell base, the RMSE is $\lesssim 1.4\%$, while for irregular cell bases, the RMSE is $\lesssim 2.8\%$. Finally, a 3D image of a random cellular structure is obtained with an RMSE of $\lesssim 6.5\%$. Despite being in its initial stages of development, the proposed technique demonstrates promising results considering its simplicity and low cost.</description>
