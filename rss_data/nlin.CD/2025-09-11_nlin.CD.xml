      <title>Analog-based ensembles to characterize turbulent dynamics from observed data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology for the study of the dispersion of trajectories of stochastic processes in reconstructed phase spaces from observed data. The methodology allows to find ensembles of analog states, i.e. states that are infinitesimally close in the phase space. Once these states are found, we focus on the characterization of their dispersion in function of 1) the time and 2) their initial separation. We study a experimental turbulent velocity measurement and two scale-invariant stochastic processes: a regularized fractional Brownian motion and a regularized multifractal random walk. Both stochastic processes are synthesized to have the same covariance structure as the experimental turbulent velocity, but only the regularized multifractal random walk mimics the intermittency of turbulent velocity. We illustrate that while the covariance structure of the processes governs the time dependence of the dispersion of the analog states, the intermittency phenomenon is responsible of the impact of the initial separation of the analogs on their dispersion.</description>

      <title>Paperfolding Structures as Templates for Horseshoes in Multidimensional H\'enon Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for analyzing the geometric structure of horseshoes arising in three- and four-dimensional H\'enon-type maps by introducing paperfolding structures as geometric templates. These structures capture the folding and stacking mechanisms characteristic of high-dimensional chaotic dynamics, offering a combinatorial and visual language to describe complex horseshoe formations. By systematically relating iterated paperfolding patterns to the observed geometries in multidimensional maps, our approach provides a concrete method for visualizing and classifying the topological features of chaotic sets in dimensions higher than two. This framework offers new insight into the organization of chaos in higher-dimensional discrete dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Free Cumulants and Full Eigenstate Thermalization from Boundary Scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) and their higher-order generalizations present important probes of quantum information dynamics and scrambling. We introduce a solvable many-body quantum model, which we term boundary scrambling, for which the full dynamics of higher-order OTOCs is analytically tractable. These dynamics support a decomposition into free cumulants and unify recent extensions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis with predictions from random quantum circuit models. We obtain exact expressions for (higher-order) correlations between matrix elements and show these to be stable away from the solvable point. The solvability is enabled by the identification of a higher-order Markovian influence matrix, capturing the effect of the full system on a local subsystem. These results provide insight into the emergence of random-matrix behavior from structured Floquet dynamics and show how techniques from free probability can be applied in the construction of exactly-solvable many-body models.</description>

      <title>Spectral density characteristics of self-organized structuring in phase-synchronized oscillator ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of coherent structures in developed turbulence can be described as a self-organization process, where macroscopic order emerges from a chaotic background through nonequilibrium phase transitions. We model this mechanism by simulating an ensemble of locally coupled classical oscillators, representing the oscillatory modes of fluctuation within a turbulent medium, which synchronize via a propagating Kuramoto-like interaction field. Upon synchronization, the system spontaneously self-organizes into dense structures, and we demonstrate a tendency for those structures to form quantized loop currents of phase information. These currents are governed by topological constraints that arise from statistical instabilities within the system's oscillatory interaction network. We show that the power spectral density of these emergent structures exhibits a stable, universal power-law behaviour, with spectral indices characteristic of natural plasma turbulence. These findings suggest that the statistical markers of turbulence can arise from universal principles of topological self-organization, independent of the system's specific physical constraints.</description>
