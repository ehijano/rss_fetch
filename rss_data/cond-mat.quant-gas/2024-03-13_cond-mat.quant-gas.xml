      <title>Spin-orbit coupling in symmetric and mixed spin-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetically spin-orbit coupling in cold atoms couples the pseudo-spin and spatial degrees of freedom, and therefore the inherent spin symmetry of the system plays an important role. In systems of two pseudo-spin degrees, two particles configure symmetric states and anti-symmetric states, but the spin symmetry can be mixed for more particles. We study the role of mixed spin symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and consider the system of three bosons with two hyper-fine states trapped in a harmonic potential. We investigate the ground state and the energy spectrum by implementing exact diagonalization. It is found that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and repulsive interactions between anti-aligned pseudo-spins increases the population of the unaligned spin components in the ground state. The emergence of the mixed spin symmetric states compensates for the rise of the interaction energy. With the aligned interaction on, the avoided crossing between the ground state and the first excited state is observed only for small interaction, and this causes shape changes in the spin populations. Furthermore, we find that the pair correlation of the ground state shows similarly to that of Tonks-Girardeau gas even for relatively small contact interactions and such strong interaction feature is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Simulating Meson Scattering on Spin Quantum Simulators</title>

Abstract: Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Controlling Nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein Condensation with Engineered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out of thermal equilibrium, bosonic quantum systems can Bose-condense away from the ground state, featuring a macroscopic occupation of an excited state or even of multiple states in the so-called Bose-selection scenario. In previous work, a theory was developed that predicts, in which states a driven-dissipative ideal Bose gas condenses. Here, we address the inverse problem: Given a target state with desired condensate fractions in certain single-particle states, how can this configuration be achieved by tuning available control parameters? Which type of experimental setup allows for flexible condensation control? We solve these problems, on the one hand, by developing a theory to solve the inverse problem based on linear programming methods. On the other, we propose a Bose `condenser', experimentally implementable in a superconducting circuit, where targeted Bose condensation into eigenstates of a chain of resonators is driven through the coupling to artificial quantum baths, realized via auxiliary two-level systems. We further discuss the engineering of transition points between different Bose condensation configurations, which may find application for amplification, heat-flow control, and the design of highly-structured quantum baths.</description>

      <title>Identifying diffusive length scales in one-dimensional Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the hydrodynamics of integrable models, diffusion is a subleading correction to ballistic propagation. Here we quantify the diffusive contribution for one-dimensional Bose gases and find it most influential in the crossover between the main thermodynamic regimes of the gas. Analysing the experimentally measured dynamics of a single density mode, we find diffusion to be relevant only for high wavelength excitations. Instead, the observed relaxation is solely caused by a ballistically driven dephasing process, whose time scale is related to the phonon lifetime of the system and is thus useful to evaluate the applicability of the phonon bases typically used in quantum field simulators.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type superconducting state in a voltage-driven superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a voltage-biased normal metal-superconductor-normal metal (N-S-N) junction. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function technique, we derive a quantum kinetic equation, to determine the superconducting order parameter self-consistently. The derived equation is an integral-differential equation with memory effects. We solve this equation by converting it into a system of ordinary differential equations with the use of a pole expansion of the Fermi-Dirac function. When the applied voltage exceeds the critical value, the superconductor switches to the normal state. We find that when the voltage is decreased from the normal phase, the system relaxes to a Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)-type inhomogeneous superconducting state, even in the absence of a magnetic Zeeman field. We point out that the emergence of the LO-type state can be attributed to the nonequilibrium energy distribution of electrons due to the bias voltage. We also point out that the system exhibits bistability, which leads to hysteresis in the voltage-current characteristic of the N-S-N junction.</description>
