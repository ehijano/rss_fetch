      <title>Digital logic from high-efficiency superconducting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the realizations of superconducting diodes have pushed the diode coefficient $\eta$ towards its theoretical maximum of $\eta=1$. In this work, we describe the construction of logic gates NOT, AND, OR, NAND and NOR using superconducting diodes with $\eta\approx1$ by exploiting their dynamically tunable polarity. We then argue that fundamental theorems suppress $\eta$ in intrinsic superconductors, rendering them likely unsuitable for the proposed devices, and point out that several previous proposals and platforms, remarkably, bypassed this suppression unwittingly. We discuss the realization of the digital logic in one such platform -- Josephson triodes that yielded $\eta\approx1$ -- and argue that phases with spontaneous spatial or magnetic order can overcome some of its drawbacks. Thus, this work provides guiding principles for future platforms and develops the building blocks for superconductors-based digital electronics.</description>

      <title>Charge density waves and pinning by lattice anisotropy in 214 cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of static charge density waves (CDWs) in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) with x $\sim$ 0.12 at relatively high temperatures has raised the question of what lattice feature pins the CDWs. Some recent structural studies have concluded that some form of monoclinic distortion, indicated by the appearance of certain weak Bragg peaks (type M peaks) at otherwise forbidden positions, are responsible for CDW pinning. As a test of this idea, we present neutron diffraction results for a single crystal of La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ (LBCO) with x = 1/8, which is known to undergo two structural transitions on cooling, from high-temperature tetragonal (HTT) to low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) near 240 K, involving a collective tilt pattern of the corner-sharing CuO$_6$ octahedra, and from LTO to low temperature tetragonal (LTT) near 56 K, involving a new tilt pattern and the appearance of intensity at peaks of type T. We observe both type M and type T peaks in the LTT phase, while the type M peaks (but not type T) are still present in the LTO phase. Given that CDW order is observed only in the LTT phase of LBCO, it is apparent that the in-plane Cu-O bond anisotropy associated with the octahedral tilt pattern is responsible for charge pinning. We point out that evidence for a similar, but weaker, bond anisotropy has been observed previously in LSCO and should be responsible for CDW pinning there. In the case of LBCO, the monoclinic distortion may help to explain previously-reported magneto-optical evidence for gyrotropic order.</description>

      <title>Superconducting order parameter structure in the nematic phase of iron-based materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effect of the nematic order on the formation of the superconducting state in iron pnictides and chalcogenides. Nematic order with the $B_{2g}$ symmetry is modelled as the $d$-type Pomeranchuk instability and treated within the mean-field approach. Calculated nematic order parameter depends on the nematic interaction coefficient and abruptly changes with the coefficient's increase. The superconducting solution is obtained within the spin-fluctuation pairing theory. We show that the leading solution in the nematic phase has a $s_{\pi\pm}$ structure. From the critical temperature $T_c$ estimations, we conclude that the nematic superconducting state of the $s_{\pi\pm}$ type is more favorable than the usual $s_\pm$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ type states appearing in the absence of the nematicity.</description>

      <title>Improving the accuracy of circuit quantization using the electromagnetic properties of superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum information processing with superconducting qubits have fueled a growing demand for scaling and miniaturizing circuit layouts. Despite significant progress, accurately predicting the Hamiltonian of complex circuits remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose an improved method for quantizing superconducting circuits that incorporates material- and geometry-dependent kinetic inductance. Our approach models thin superconducting films as equivalent reactive boundary elements, seamlessly integrating into the conventional circuit quantization framework without adding computational complexity. As a proof of concept, we experimentally verify our method using planar superconducting quantum devices made of 35 nm-thick disordered niobium films, known to exhibit large kinetic inductance values. We demonstrate significantly improved accuracy in predicting the Hamiltonian based solely on the chip layout and material properties of the superconducting films and Josephson junctions, with discrepancies in mode frequencies remaining below 2%. Our method enables systematic studies of superconducting devices based on disordered thin films or compact, fine-pitched elements and, more broadly, facilitates the precise engineering of superconducting quantum circuits at scale.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Stiffness and Flat-Band Superconductivity in Magic-Angle Graphene Probed by cQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moir\'e systems research, and it may provide insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ superconductors. Here, we use DC-transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to measure directly the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG via its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory; rather, it is comparable to theoretical predictions involving quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness follows a power-law, which contraindicates an isotropic BCS model; instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted within the Fermi liquid framework or by considering quantum geometry of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, a quadratic dependence of the superfluid stiffness on both DC and microwave current is observed, which is consistent with Ginzburg-Landau theory. Taken together, our findings indicate that MATBG is an unconventional superconductor with an anisotropic gap and strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness, and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. The combined DC-microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.</description>
