      <title>The Problem of the Priors, or Posteriors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of the priors is well known: it concerns the challenge of identifying norms that govern one's prior credences. I argue that a key to addressing this problem lies in considering what I call the problem of the posteriors -- the challenge of identifying norms that directly govern one's posterior credences, which backward induce some norms on the priors via the diachronic requirement of conditionalization. This forward-looking approach can be summarized as: Think ahead, work backward. Although this idea can be traced to Freedman (1963), Carnap (1963), and Shimony (1970), I believe that it has not received enough attention. In this paper, I initiate a systematic defense of forward-looking Bayesianism, addressing potential objections from more traditional views (both subjectivist and objectivist). I also develop a specific approach to forward-looking Bayesianism -- one that values the convergence of posterior credences to the truth, and treats it as a fundamental rather than derived norm. This approach, called {\em convergentist Bayesianism}, is argued to be crucial for a Bayesian foundation of Ockham's razor in statistics and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Improved Semi-Parametric Bounds for Tail Probability and Expected Loss: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many management decisions involve accumulated random realizations for which only the first and second moments of their distribution are available. The sharp Chebyshev-type bound for the tail probability and Scarf bound for the expected loss are widely used in this setting. We revisit the tail behavior of such quantities with a focus on independence. Conventional primal-dual approaches from optimization are ineffective in this setting. Instead, we use probabilistic inequalities to derive new bounds and offer new insights. For non-identical distributions attaining the tail probability bounds, we show that the extreme values are equidistant regardless of the distributional differences. For the bound on the expected loss, we show that the impact of each random variable on the expected sum can be isolated using an extension of the Korkine identity. We illustrate how these new results open up abundant practical applications, including improved pricing of product bundles, more precise option pricing, more efficient insurance design, and better inventory management. For example, we establish a new solution to the optimal bundling problem, yielding a 17% uplift in per-bundle profits, and a new solution to the inventory problem, yielding a 5.6% cost reduction for a model with 20 retailers.</description>
