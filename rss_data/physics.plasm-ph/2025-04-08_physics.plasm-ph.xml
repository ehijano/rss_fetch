      <title>A simple, accurate model for detachment access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In next-step fusion tokamaks such as SPARC and ITER, achieving high levels of scrape-off-layer power dissipation will be essential to protect the divertor while maintaining good core plasma performance. The Lengyel model for power dissipation is easy to interpret and fast enough to incorporate into plasma control and scoping tools, but it systematically overestimates the impurity concentration required to reach detachment by a factor of ~5 relative to experiments and higher-fidelity simulations. In this work, we extend the Lengyel model to match the semi-empirical Kallenbach scaling, which successfully describes detachment access on several operating tokamaks. We found that we can reproduce the experimental scaling by accounting for cross-field transport in the divertor, power loss due to neutral ionization close to the divertor target and turbulent broadening of the upstream heat flux channel. These corrections cause the impurity concentration required for detachment to decrease faster than $n_{e,u}^2$, reproducing the $c_z\propto 1/n_{e,u}^{2.7-3.2}$ scalings found in experiment. The model also quantitatively reproduces the impurity concentration needed to reach detachment in experiment, demonstrating that the extended Lengyel model can be used as a simple, accurate model for detachment access.</description>

      <title>Non-Maxwellianity of Ion Velocity Distributions in the Earth's Magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the ion velocity distribution function (iVDF) deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in collisionless plasma turbulence. Using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we examine the non-Maxwellianity of 441,577 iVDFs in the Earth's magnetosheath. We find that the iVDFs' anisotropy is overall limited, while high-order non-LTE features can be significant. Our results show that the complexity of the iVDFs is strongly influenced by the ion plasma beta and the turbulence intensity, with high-order non-LTE features emerging with large-amplitude magnetic field fluctuations. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that turbulence-driven magnetic curvature contributes to the isotropization of the iVDFs by scattering the ions, emphasizing the complex interaction between turbulence and the velocity distribution of charged particles in collisionless plasmas.</description>

      <title>Survey of the Edge Radial Electric Field in L-mode TCV Plasmas using Doppler Backscattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic has recently been installed on the Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) to facilitate the study of edge turbulence and flow shear in a versatile experimental environment. The dual channel V-band DBS system is coupled to TCV's quasi-optical diagnostic launcher, providing access to the upper low-field side region of the plasma cross-section. Verifications of the DBS measurements are presented. The DBS equilibrium $v_\perp$ profiles are found to compare favorably with gas puff imaging (GPI) measurements and to the $E_r$ inferred from the radial force balance of the carbon impurity. The radial structure of the edge $E_r \times B$ equilibrium flow and its dependencies are investigated across a representative set of L-mode TCV discharges, by varying density, auxiliary heating and magnetic configuration.</description>

      <title>Spin Dynamics in Rotating Quantum Plasmas: Coupled EPI Dispersion and Solitary wave analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of an electrostatic wave in a three-component e-p-I astrophysical quantum plasma in a rotating frame has been studied, taking into account the particle spin, Fermi pressure, and quantum Bohm potential. Spin polarization plays a key role in explaining the dynamics of quantum plasmas, especially in astrophysical contexts due to the high external magnetic field prevalent in such environments. Effects specific to this particular environment, like rotation as well as gravity, have also been included. Coupled dispersion of electron, positron, and ion modes has been obtained. Further, the investigation of solitary waves by the Korteweg de Vries method has been carried out, and a soliton solution has been obtained. Quantum effects increase wave dispersion and soliton stability in quantum plasma, thereby affecting the electrostatic potential.</description>

      <title>Transient population dynamics of nanoparticles during pulsed EUV exposures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transient population dynamics of charged (postive or negative) and neutral nanoparticles have been investigated in a pulsed Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) exposure environment with 3DPIC simulations. At the initial stage of the simulation, all the particles are kept neutral. As the number of EUV pulses increases over time, the population of neutral particle decreases faster at the expense of negatively charged particle generation outside the beam location. However, a small population (&lt; 1%) of neutral particles become positively charged due to EUV photon interaction within the beam area and remains in steady state over time. The critical pulse numbers have been estimated for different nanometer size particles above which most of the particles outside the beam locations become negatively charged: smaller is the particle size, larger is the critical pulse number.</description>

      <title>Beam-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration (PWFA) has emerged as a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize the field of particle acceleration, especially toward compact accelerators for high-energy and high-power applications. Charged particle beams are used to excite density waves in plasma with accelerating fields reaching up to 100 GV/m, thousands of times stronger than the fields provided by radio-frequency cavities. Plasma-wakefield-accelerator research has matured over the span of four decades from basic concepts and proof-of-principle experiments to a rich and rapidly progressing sub-field with dedicated experimental facilities and state-of-the-art simulation codes. We review the physics, including theory of linear and nonlinear plasma wakefields as well as beam dynamics of both the wakefield driver and trailing bunches accelerating in the plasma wake, and address challenges associated with energy efficiency and preservation of beam quality. Advanced topics such as positron acceleration, self-modulation, internal injection, long-term plasma evolution and multistage acceleration are discussed. Simulation codes and major experiments are surveyed, spanning the use of electron, positron and proton bunches as wakefield drivers. Finally, we look ahead to future particle colliders and light sources based on plasma technology.</description>

      <title>Infinite Boundary Terms and Pairwise Interactions: A Unified Framework for Periodic Coulomb Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of the infinite boundary terms and the pairwise interactions [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 10, 5254, (2014)] enables a physically intuitive approach for deriving electrostatic energy and pressure for both neutral and non-neutral systems under the periodic boundary condition. For a periodic system consisting of $N$ point charges (with charge $q_j$ located at ${\mathbf r}_j$ where $j=1,2,\cdots N$) and one charge distribution of density $\rho({\mathbf r})$ within a primary cell of volume $V$, the derived electrostatic energy can be expressed as, \[ {\mathcal U} = \sum_{i&lt;j}^N q_iq_j\nu({\mathbf r}_{ij} ) + \sum_{j=1}^N q_j \int_V d{\mathbf r}_0\,\rho({\mathbf r}_0) \nu({\mathbf r}_{0j} ) + \frac{1}{2}\int_V d{\mathbf r}_0 \int_V d{\mathbf r}_1\,\rho({\mathbf r}_0)\rho({\mathbf r}_1) \nu({\mathbf r}_{01}), \] where ${\mathbf r}_{ij}={\mathbf r}_i - {\mathbf r}_j$ is the relative vector and $\nu({\mathbf r})$ represents the effective pairwise interaction. The charge density $\rho({\mathbf r})$ is free of Delta-function-like divergence throughout the volume but may exhibit discontinuity. This unified formulation directly follows that of the isolated system by replacing the Coulomb interaction $1/\lvert {\mathbf r} \rvert$ or other modified Coulomb interactions with $\nu({\mathbf r})$. For a particular system of one-component plasma with a uniform neutralizing background, the implementation of various pairwise formulations clarifies the contribution of the background and subsequently reveals criteria for arbitrary volume-dependent potentials that preserve the simple relation between energy and pressure.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Drift Waves Beyond the Hasegawa-Mima Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general nonlinear equation for drift waves is derived, incorporating both the nonlinear electron density term (scalar nonlinearity) and the ion vorticity term (vector nonlinearity). It is noted that the Hasegawa-Mima (HM) equation (A. Hasegawa and K. Mima, The Physics of Fluids 21, 87 (1978)) includes only the ion vorticity term, while it omits the nonlinear electron density term, which is a dominant nonlinear effect. The general nonlinear equation reduces to the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation (H. Saleem, Physics of Plasmas 31, 112102 (2024)) if the normalized electrostatic potential is assumed to depend only on a single spatial coordinate along the direction of predominant wave propagation, i.e., \( \Phi = \Phi(y) \). If the scalar nonlinearity is artificially neglected and a two-dimensional dependence of the electrostatic potential is assumed, \( \Phi = \Phi(x, y) \), the equation reduces to a Hasegawa-Mima-like equation, which admits a solution in the form of dipolar vortices. It is further pointed out that, in the presence of a Boltzmann density distribution for electrons, the HM equation was derived using the approximation \( \frac{\partial_t \tilde{n}_i}{n_{i0}} \simeq \partial_t \Phi \), whereas the more accurate expression \( \frac{\partial_t \tilde{n}_i}{n_{i0}} \simeq \partial_t \left( \Phi + \frac{1}{2} \Phi^2 \right) \) should be used.</description>

      <title>Turnstile area as a measure for chaotic transport in magnetic confinement fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze stochasticity in the magnetic fields of magnetic confinement fusion reactors by calculating the lobe areas of turnstiles - a method developed for characterizing transport into and out of resonance zones in Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We develop an efficient algorithm based on an action principle to calculate this quantity directly from the magnetic field, including stellarator magnetic fields which are sourced by a complicated set of three-dimensional coils. In the analyzed devices, the turnstile area on the inboard (plasma-facing) manifolds is much smaller than the turnstile area on the outboard (wall-facing) manifolds. The application of the turnstile area calculation for the design of future reactors will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Rarefied xenon flow in orificed hollow cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parametric study is conducted to quantify the effect of the keeper electrode geometry on the neutral flow quantities within orificed hollow cathodes, prior to cathode ignition. The keeper impinges directly on the flow out of the cathode orifice and its geometry strongly influences the product between the pressure in the orifice-keeper region and the distance between cathode and keeper, $P_{ko}\cdot D_{ko}$, a key parameter for successful cathode ignition. A representative cathode equipped with a keeper is simulated using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method. The numerical model is first validated with computational results from the literature, and a parametric study is then conducted. Parameters include the cathode pressure-diameter in the range of 1-5 Torr-cm and the following geometric ratios: cathode orifice-to-cathode inner radii in the range of 0.1-0.7, keeper orifice-to-cathode orifice radii in the range of 1-5, and keeper distance-to-cathode-orifice diameter, in the range of 0.5-10. If both keeper and cathode have identical orifice radii, the flow remains subsonic in the cathode orifice-to-keeper region. In most cases, however, the flow becomes underexpanded and supersonic, and the static pressure within the cathode orifice-keeper region is, on average, 4% that of the upstream pressure value. The orifice-keeper region pressure increases with either a decrease in the keeper orifice diameter or an increase in the distance between the cathode orifice plate and the keeper plate, in agreement with literature data. Trends are explained through control-volume-based conservation laws. The ratio of ignition-to-nominal mass flow rates is found to be in the range of 9-120, with a most probable value of 40, in agreement with literature data. This suggests that heater-less cathode ignition at a minimum DC voltage may be achieved by increasing the input mass flow rate by a factor of 40.</description>
