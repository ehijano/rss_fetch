      <title>Semi-coarse Spaces: Fundamental Groupoid and the van Kampen Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In algebraic topology, the fundamental groupoid is a classical homotopy invariant which is defined using continuous maps from the closed interval to a topological space. In this paper, we construct a semi-coarse version of this invariant, using as paths a finite sequences of maps from $\mathbb{Z}_1$ to a semi-coarse space, connecting their tails through semi-coarse homotopy. In contrast to semi-coarse homotopy groups, this groupoid is not necessarily trivial for coarse spaces, and, unlike coarse homotopy, it is well-defined for general semi-coarse spaces. In addition, we show that the semi-coarse fundamental groupoid which we introduce admits a version of the Van Kampen Theorem.</description>

      <title>Countably compact extensions and cardinal characteristics of the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the existence of certain first-countable compact-like extensions is equivalent to the equality between corresponding cardinal characteristics of the continuum. For instance, $\mathfrak b=\mathfrak s=\mathfrak c$ if and only if every regular first-countable space of weight $&lt; \mathfrak c$ can be densely embedded into a regular first-countable countably compact space.</description>

      <title>Cauchy convergence in V-normed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the notion of normed category as suggested by Lawvere, we introduce notions of Cauchy convergence and cocompleteness which differ from proposals in previous works. Key to our approach is to treat them consequentially as categories enriched in the monoidal-closed category of normed sets. Our notions largely lead to the anticipated outcomes when considering individual metric spaces as small normed categories, but they can be challenging when considering some large categories, like those of semi-normed or normed vector spaces and all linear maps, or of generalized metric spaces and all mappings. These are the key example categories discussed in detail in this paper. Working with a general commutative quantale V as a value recipient for norms, rather than only with Lawvere's quantale of the extended real half-line, we observe that the categorically atypical structure gap between objects and morphisms in the example categories is already present in the underlying normed category of the enriching category of V-normed sets. To show that this normed category and, in fact, all presheaf categories over it, are Cauchy cocomplete, we assume the quantale V to satisfy a couple of light alternative extra properties. Of utmost importance to the general theory is the fact that our notion of normed colimit is subsumed by the notion of weighted colimit of enriched category theory. With this theory we are able to prove that all V-normed categories have correct-size Cauchy cocompletions. We also prove a Banach Fixed Point Theorem for contractive endofunctors of Cauchy cocomplete normed categories.</description>

      <title>Inductive dimensions of coarse proximity spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.09687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize Dranishnikov's asymptotic inductive dimension to the setting of coarse proximity spaces. We show that in this more general context, the asymptotic inductive dimension of a coarse proximity space is bigger or equal to the inductive dimension of its boundary, and consequently may be strictly bigger than the covering dimension of the boundary. We also give a condition, called complete traceability, on the boundary of the coarse proximity space under which the asymptotic inductive dimension of a coarse proximity space and the inductive dimension of its boundary coincide. Finally, we show that spaces whose boundaries are $Z$-sets and spaces admitting metrizable compactifications have completely traceable boundaries.</description>
