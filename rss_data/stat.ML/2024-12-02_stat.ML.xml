      <title>The Return of Pseudosciences in Artificial Intelligence: Have Machine Learning and Deep Learning Forgotten Lessons from Statistics and History?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's world, AI programs powered by Machine Learning are ubiquitous, and have achieved seemingly exceptional performance across a broad range of tasks, from medical diagnosis and credit rating in banking, to theft detection via video analysis, and even predicting political or sexual orientation from facial images. These predominantly deep learning methods excel due to their extraordinary capacity to process vast amounts of complex data to extract complex correlations and relationship from different levels of features.
  In this paper, we contend that the designers and final users of these ML methods have forgotten a fundamental lesson from statistics: correlation does not imply causation. Not only do most state-of-the-art methods neglect this crucial principle, but by doing so they often produce nonsensical or flawed causal models, akin to social astrology or physiognomy. Consequently, we argue that current efforts to make AI models more ethical by merely reducing biases in the training data are insufficient. Through examples, we will demonstrate that the potential for harm posed by these methods can only be mitigated by a complete rethinking of their core models, improved quality assessment metrics and policies, and by maintaining humans oversight throughout the process.</description>

      <title>Graph Max Shift: A Hill-Climbing Method for Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for graph clustering that is analogous with gradient ascent methods previously proposed for clustering points in space. We show that, when applied to a random geometric graph with data iid from some density with Morse regularity, the method is asymptotically consistent. Here, consistency is understood with respect to a density-level clustering defined by the partition of the support of the density induced by the basins of attraction of the density modes.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Wrapped Gaussian Process Regression Modeling for Manifold-valued Response Variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel intrinsic wrapped Gaussian process regression model for response variable measured on Riemannian manifold. We apply the parallel transport operator to define an intrinsic covariance structure addressing a critical aspect of constructing a well defined Gaussian process regression model. We show that the posterior distribution of regression function is invariant to the choice of orthonormal frames for the coordinate representations of the covariance function. This method can be applied to data situated not only on Euclidean submanifolds but also on manifolds without a natural ambient space. The asymptotic properties for estimating the posterior distribution is established. Numerical studies, including simulation and real-world examples, indicate that the proposed method delivers strong performance.</description>

      <title>ABROCA Distributions For Algorithmic Bias Assessment: Considerations Around Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic bias continues to be a key concern of learning analytics. We study the statistical properties of the Absolute Between-ROC Area (ABROCA) metric. This fairness measure quantifies group-level differences in classifier performance through the absolute difference in ROC curves. ABROCA is particularly useful for detecting nuanced performance differences even when overall Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) values are similar. We sample ABROCA under various conditions, including varying AUC differences and class distributions. We find that ABROCA distributions exhibit high skewness dependent on sample sizes, AUC differences, and class imbalance. When assessing whether a classifier is biased, this skewness inflates ABROCA values by chance, even when data is drawn (by simulation) from populations with equivalent ROC curves. These findings suggest that ABROCA requires careful interpretation given its distributional properties, especially when used to assess the degree of bias and when classes are imbalanced.</description>

      <title>Contrastive representations of high-dimensional, structured treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects is vital for decision making. In standard causal effect estimation, treatments are usually binary- or continuous-valued. However, in many important real-world settings, treatments can be structured, high-dimensional objects, such as text, video, or audio. This provides a challenge to traditional causal effect estimation. While leveraging the shared structure across different treatments can help generalize to unseen treatments at test time, we show in this paper that using such structure blindly can lead to biased causal effect estimation. We address this challenge by devising a novel contrastive approach to learn a representation of the high-dimensional treatments, and prove that it identifies underlying causal factors and discards non-causally relevant factors. We prove that this treatment representation leads to unbiased estimates of the causal effect, and empirically validate and benchmark our results on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>LD-EnSF: Synergizing Latent Dynamics with Ensemble Score Filters for Fast Data Assimilation with Sparse Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation techniques are crucial for correcting the trajectory when modeling complex physical systems. A recently developed data assimilation method, Latent Ensemble Score Filter (Latent-EnSF), has shown great promise in addressing the key limitation of EnSF for highly sparse observations in high-dimensional and nonlinear data assimilation problems. It performs data assimilation in a latent space for encoded states and observations in every assimilation step, and requires costly full dynamics to be evolved in the original space. In this paper, we introduce Latent Dynamics EnSF (LD-EnSF), a novel methodology that completely avoids the full dynamics evolution and significantly accelerates the data assimilation process, which is especially valuable for complex dynamical problems that require fast data assimilation in real time. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel variant of Latent Dynamics Networks (LDNets) to effectively capture and preserve the system's dynamics within a very low-dimensional latent space. Additionally, we propose a new method for encoding sparse observations into the latent space using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which leverage not only the current step's observations, as in Latent-EnSF, but also all previous steps, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of the observation encoding. We demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method for two challenging dynamical systems with highly sparse (in both space and time) and noisy observations.</description>

      <title>Concept-driven Off Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating off-policy decisions using batch data poses significant challenges due to limited sample sizes leading to high variance. To improve Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE), we must identify and address the sources of this variance. Recent research on Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) shows that using human-explainable concepts can improve predictions and provide better understanding. We propose incorporating concepts into OPE to reduce variance. Our work introduces a family of concept-based OPE estimators, proving that they remain unbiased and reduce variance when concepts are known and predefined. Since real-world applications often lack predefined concepts, we further develop an end-to-end algorithm to learn interpretable, concise, and diverse parameterized concepts optimized for variance reduction. Our experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets show that both known and learned concept-based estimators significantly improve OPE performance. Crucially, we show that, unlike other OPE methods, concept-based estimators are easily interpretable and allow for targeted interventions on specific concepts, further enhancing the quality of these estimators.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Instrumental Regression via Kernel Methods is Minimax Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the kernel instrumental variable algorithm of \citet{singh2019kernel}, a nonparametric two-stage least squares (2SLS) procedure which has demonstrated strong empirical performance. We provide a convergence analysis that covers both the identified and unidentified settings: when the structural function cannot be identified, we show that the kernel NPIV estimator converges to the IV solution with minimum norm. Crucially, our convergence is with respect to the strong $L_2$-norm, rather than a pseudo-norm. Additionally, we characterize the smoothness of the target function without relying on the instrument, instead leveraging a new description of the projected subspace size (this being closely related to the link condition in inverse learning literature). With the subspace size description and under standard kernel learning assumptions, we derive, for the first time, the minimax optimal learning rate for kernel NPIV in the strong $L_2$-norm. Our result demonstrates that the strength of the instrument is essential to achieve efficient learning. We also improve the original kernel NPIV algorithm by adopting a general spectral regularization in stage 1 regression. The modified regularization can overcome the saturation effect of Tikhonov regularization.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Model Selection for Data Clustering and Dimension Reduction Using Relative von Neumann Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a pair of completely data-driven algorithms for unsupervised classification and dimension reduction, and we empirically study their performance on a number of data sets, both simulated data in three-dimensions and images from the COIL-20 data set. The algorithms take as input a set of points sampled from a uniform distribution supported on a metric space, the latter embedded in an ambient metric space, and they output a clustering or reduction of dimension of the data. They work by constructing a natural family of graphs from the data and selecting the graph which maximizes the relative von Neumann entropy of certain normalized heat operators constructed from the graphs. Once the appropriate graph is selected, the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian may be used to reduce the dimension of the data, and clusters in the data may be identified with the kernel of the associated graph Laplacian. Notably, these algorithms do not require information about the size of a neighborhood or the desired number of clusters as input, in contrast to popular algorithms such as $k$-means, and even more modern spectral methods such as Laplacian eigenmaps, among others.
  In our computational experiments, our clustering algorithm outperforms $k$-means clustering on data sets with non-trivial geometry and topology, in particular data whose clusters are not concentrated around a specific point, and our dimension reduction algorithm is shown to work well in several simple examples.</description>

      <title>Another look at inference after prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction-based (PB) inference is increasingly used in applications where the outcome of interest is difficult to obtain, but its predictors are readily available. Unlike traditional inference, PB inference performs statistical inference using a partially observed outcome and a set of covariates by leveraging a prediction of the outcome generated from a machine learning (ML) model. Motwani and Witten (2023) recently revisited two innovative PB inference approaches for ordinary least squares. They found that the method proposed by Wang et al. (2020) yields a consistent estimator for the association of interest when the ML model perfectly captures the underlying regression function. Conversely, the prediction-powered inference (PPI) method proposed by Angelopoulos et al. (2023) yields valid inference regardless of the model's accuracy. In this paper, we study the statistical efficiency of the PPI estimator. Our analysis reveals that a more efficient estimator, proposed 25 years ago by Chen and Chen (2000), can be obtained by simply adding a weight to the PPI estimator. We also contextualize PB inference with methods from the economics and statistics literature dating back to the 1960s. Our extensive theoretical and numerical analyses indicate that the Chen and Chen (CC) estimator offers a balance between robustness to ML model specification and statistical efficiency, making it the preferred choice for use in practice.</description>

      <title>ScaleViz: Scaling Visualization Recommendation Models on Large Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated visualization recommendations (vis-rec) help users to derive crucial insights from new datasets. Typically, such automated vis-rec models first calculate a large number of statistics from the datasets and then use machine-learning models to score or classify multiple visualizations choices to recommend the most effective ones, as per the statistics. However, state-of-the art models rely on very large number of expensive statistics and therefore using such models on large datasets become infeasible due to prohibitively large computational time, limiting the effectiveness of such techniques to most real world complex and large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement-learning (RL) based framework that takes a given vis-rec model and a time-budget from the user and identifies the best set of input statistics that would be most effective while generating the visual insights within a given time budget, using the given model. Using two state-of-the-art vis-rec models applied on three large real-world datasets, we show the effectiveness of our technique in significantly reducing time-to visualize with very small amount of introduced error. Our approach is about 10X times faster compared to the baseline approaches that introduce similar amounts of error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a locally differentially private (LDP) algorithm for online federated learning that employs temporally correlated noise to improve utility while preserving privacy. To address challenges posed by the correlated noise and local updates with streaming non-IID data, we develop a perturbed iterate analysis that controls the impact of the noise on the utility. Moreover, we demonstrate how the drift errors from local updates can be effectively managed for several classes of nonconvex loss functions. Subject to an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-LDP budget, we establish a dynamic regret bound that quantifies the impact of key parameters and the intensity of changes in the dynamic environment on the learning performance. Numerical experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Conditional Density Estimation with Neural Networks for Bias Correction of Multivariate Climate Model Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are numerical models that simulate complex physical processes within the Earth's climate system, and are essential for understanding and predicting climate change. However, GCMs suffer from systemic biases due to assumptions about and simplifications made to the underlying physical processes. GCM output therefore needs to be bias corrected before it can be used for future climate projections. Most common bias correction methods, however, cannot preserve spatial, temporal, or inter-variable dependencies. We propose a new bias correction method based on conditional density estimation for the simultaneous bias correction of daily precipitation and maximum temperature data obtained from gridded GCM spatial fields. The Vecchia approximation is employed to preserve dependencies in the data, and conditional density estimation is carried out using semi-parametric quantile regression. Illustration on historical data from 1951-2014 over two 5 x 5 spatial grids in the US indicate that our method can preserve key marginal and joint distribution properties of precipitation and maximum temperature, and predictions obtained using our approach are better calibrated compared to predictions using asynchronous quantile mapping and canonical correlation analysis, two commonly used alternative bias correction approaches.</description>

      <title>Convex Regularization and Convergence of Policy Gradient Flows under Safety Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies reinforcement learning (RL) in infinite-horizon dynamic decision processes with almost-sure safety constraints. Such safety-constrained decision processes are central to applications in autonomous systems, finance, and resource management, where policies must satisfy strict, state-dependent constraints. We consider a doubly-regularized RL framework that combines reward and parameter regularization to address these constraints within continuous state-action spaces. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a convex regularized objective with parametrized policies in the mean-field regime. Our approach leverages recent developments in mean-field theory and Wasserstein gradient flows to model policies as elements of an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold, with policy updates evolving via gradient flows on the space of parameter distributions. Our main contributions include establishing solvability conditions for safety-constrained problems, defining smooth and bounded approximations that facilitate gradient flows, and demonstrating exponential convergence towards global solutions under sufficient regularization. We provide general conditions on regularization functions, encompassing standard entropy regularization as a special case. The results also enable a particle method implementation for practical RL applications. The theoretical insights and convergence guarantees presented here offer a robust framework for safe RL in complex, high-dimensional decision-making problems.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Calibration of Statistical Confidence Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing valid confidence sets is a crucial task in statistical inference, yet traditional methods often face challenges when dealing with complex models or limited observed sample sizes. These challenges are frequently encountered in modern applications, such as Likelihood-Free Inference (LFI). In these settings, confidence sets may fail to maintain a confidence level close to the nominal value. In this paper, we introduce two novel methods, TRUST and TRUST++, for calibrating confidence sets to achieve distribution-free conditional coverage. These methods rely entirely on simulated data from the statistical model to perform calibration. Leveraging insights from conformal prediction techniques adapted to the statistical inference context, our methods ensure both finite-sample local coverage and asymptotic conditional coverage as the number of simulations increases, even if n is small. They effectively handle nuisance parameters and provide computationally efficient uncertainty quantification for the estimated confidence sets. This allows users to assess whether additional simulations are necessary for robust inference. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on models with both tractable and intractable likelihoods, we demonstrate that our methods outperform existing approaches, particularly in small-sample regimes. This work bridges the gap between conformal prediction and statistical inference, offering practical tools for constructing valid confidence sets in complex models.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Density-Calibrated Conformal Quantile Regression (CQR-d) method, a novel approach for constructing prediction intervals that adapts to varying uncertainty across the feature space. Building upon conformal quantile regression, CQR-d incorporates local information through a weighted combination of local and global conformity scores, where the weights are determined by local data density. We prove that CQR-d provides valid marginal coverage at level $1 - \alpha - \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ represents a small tolerance from numerical optimization. Through extensive simulation studies and an application to the a heteroscedastic dataset available in R, we demonstrate that CQR-d maintains the desired coverage while producing substantially narrower prediction intervals compared to standard conformal quantile regression (CQR). Notably, in our application on heteroscedastic data, CQR-d achieves an $8.6\%$ reduction in average interval width while maintaining comparable coverage. The method's effectiveness is particularly pronounced in settings with clear local uncertainty patterns, making it a valuable tool for prediction tasks in heterogeneous data environments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of High-dimensional Gaussian Labeled-unlabeled Mixture Model via Message-passing Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning methodology that leverages unlabeled data in conjunction with a limited amount of labeled data. Although SSL has been applied in various applications and its effectiveness has been empirically demonstrated, it is still not fully understood when and why SSL performs well. Some existing theoretical studies have attempted to address this issue by modeling classification problems using the so-called Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). These studies provide notable and insightful interpretations. However, their analyses are focused on specific purposes, and a thorough investigation of the properties of GMM in the context of SSL has been lacking. In this paper, we conduct such a detailed analysis of the properties of the high-dimensional GMM for binary classification in the SSL setting. To this end, we employ the approximate message passing and state evolution methods, which are widely used in high-dimensional settings and originate from statistical mechanics. We deal with two estimation approaches: the Bayesian one and the l2-regularized maximum likelihood estimation (RMLE). We conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two approaches, examining aspects such as the global phase diagram, estimation error for the parameters, and prediction error for the labels. A specific comparison is made between the Bayes-optimal (BO) estimator and RMLE, as the BO setting provides optimal estimation performance and is ideal as a benchmark. Our analysis shows that with appropriate regularizations, RMLE can achieve near-optimal performance in terms of both the estimation error and prediction error, especially when there is a large amount of unlabeled data. These results demonstrate that the l2 regularization term plays an effective role in estimation and prediction in SSL approaches.</description>

      <title>CAdam: Confidence-Based Optimization for Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recommendation systems frequently employ online learning to dynamically update their models with freshly collected data. The most commonly used optimizer for updating neural networks in these contexts is the Adam optimizer, which integrates momentum ($m_t$) and adaptive learning rate ($v_t$). However, the volatile nature of online learning data, characterized by its frequent distribution shifts and presence of noises, poses significant challenges to Adam's standard optimization process: (1) Adam may use outdated momentum and the average of squared gradients, resulting in slower adaptation to distribution changes, and (2) Adam's performance is adversely affected by data noise. To mitigate these issues, we introduce CAdam, a confidence-based optimization strategy that assesses the consistence between the momentum and the gradient for each parameter dimension before deciding on updates. If momentum and gradient are in sync, CAdam proceeds with parameter updates according to Adam's original formulation; if not, it temporarily withholds updates and monitors potential shifts in data distribution in subsequent iterations. This method allows CAdam to distinguish between the true distributional shifts and mere noise, and adapt more quickly to new data distributions. Our experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CAdam surpasses other well-known optimizers, including the original Adam, in efficiency and noise robustness. Furthermore, in large-scale A/B testing within a live recommendation system, CAdam significantly enhances model performance compared to Adam, leading to substantial increases in the system's gross merchandise volume (GMV).</description>

      <title>CantorNet: A Sandbox for Testing Geometrical and Topological Complexity Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19713v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many natural phenomena are characterized by self-similarity, for example the symmetry of human faces, or a repetitive motif of a song. Studying of such symmetries will allow us to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems. Recognizing the importance of understanding these patterns, we propose a geometrically inspired framework to study such phenomena in artificial neural networks. To this end, we introduce \emph{CantorNet}, inspired by the triadic construction of the Cantor set, which was introduced by Georg Cantor in the $19^\text{th}$ century. In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line that is self-similar and has a counter intuitive property of being an uncountably infinite null set. Similarly, we introduce CantorNet as a sandbox for studying self-similarity by means of novel topological and geometrical complexity measures. CantorNet constitutes a family of ReLU neural networks that spans the whole spectrum of possible Kolmogorov complexities, including the two opposite descriptions (linear and exponential as measured by the description length). CantorNet's decision boundaries can be arbitrarily ragged, yet are analytically known. Besides serving as a testing ground for complexity measures, our work may serve to illustrate potential pitfalls in geometry-ignorant data augmentation techniques and adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum-enhanced classical simulation for patches of quantum landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the capabilities of classical simulation methods is key to identifying where quantum computers are advantageous. Not only does this ensure that quantum computers are used only where necessary, but also one can potentially identify subroutines that can be offloaded onto a classical device. In this work, we show that it is always possible to generate a classical surrogate of a sub-region (dubbed a "patch") of an expectation landscape produced by a parameterized quantum circuit. That is, we provide a quantum-enhanced classical algorithm which, after simple measurements on a quantum device, allows one to classically simulate approximate expectation values of a subregion of a landscape. We provide time and sample complexity guarantees for a range of families of circuits of interest, and further numerically demonstrate our simulation algorithms on an exactly verifiable simulation of a Hamiltonian variational ansatz and long-time dynamics simulation on a 127-qubit heavy-hex topology.</description>

      <title>Geometry of fibers of the multiplication map of deep linear neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the algebraic set of tuples of composable matrices which multiply to a fixed matrix, using tools from the theory of quiver representations. In particular, we determine its codimension $C$ and the number $\theta$ of its top-dimensional irreducible components. Our solution is presented in three forms: a Poincar\'e series in equivariant cohomology, a quadratic integer program, and an explicit formula. In the course of the proof, we establish a surprising property: $C$ and $\theta$ are invariant under arbitrary permutations of the dimension vector. We also show that the real log-canonical threshold of the function taking a tuple to the square Frobenius norm of its product is $C/2$. These results are motivated by the study of deep linear neural networks in machine learning and Bayesian statistics (singular learning theory) and show that deep linear networks are in a certain sense ``mildly singular".</description>

      <title>Scalable Out-of-distribution Robustness in the Presence of Unobserved Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where the distribution shift is due to an unobserved confounder ($Z$) affecting both the covariates ($X$) and the labels ($Y$). In this setting, traditional assumptions of covariate and label shift are unsuitable due to the confounding, which introduces heterogeneity in the predictor, i.e., $\hat{Y} = f_Z(X)$. OOD generalization differs from traditional domain adaptation by not assuming access to the covariate distribution ($X^\text{te}$) of the test samples during training. These conditions create a challenging scenario for OOD robustness: (a) $Z^\text{tr}$ is an unobserved confounder during training, (b) $P^\text{te}{Z} \neq P^\text{tr}{Z}$, (c) $X^\text{te}$ is unavailable during training, and (d) the posterior predictive distribution depends on $P^\text{te}(Z)$, i.e., $\hat{Y} = E_{P^\text{te}(Z)}[f_Z(X)]$. In general, accurate predictions are unattainable in this scenario, and existing literature has proposed complex predictors based on identifiability assumptions that require multiple additional variables. Our work investigates a set of identifiability assumptions that tremendously simplify the predictor, whose resulting elegant simplicity outperforms existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for High-dimensional Quantile Regression with Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information from related source studies can often enhance the findings of a target study. However, the distribution shift between target and source studies can severely impact the efficiency of knowledge transfer. In the high-dimensional regression setting, existing transfer approaches mainly focus on the parameter shift. In this paper, we focus on the high-dimensional quantile regression with knowledge transfer under three types of distribution shift: parameter shift, covariate shift, and residual shift. We propose a novel transferable set and a new transfer framework to address the above three discrepancies. Non-asymptotic estimation error bounds and source detection consistency are established to validate the availability and superiority of our method in the presence of distribution shift. Additionally, an orthogonal debiased approach is proposed for statistical inference with knowledge transfer, leading to sharper asymptotic results. Extensive simulation results as well as real data applications further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>Fast post-process Bayesian inference with Variational Sparse Bayesian Quadrature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In applied Bayesian inference scenarios, users may have access to a large number of pre-existing model evaluations, for example from maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) optimization runs. However, traditional approximate inference techniques make little to no use of this available information. We propose the framework of post-process Bayesian inference as a means to obtain a quick posterior approximation from existing target density evaluations, with no further model calls. Within this framework, we introduce Variational Sparse Bayesian Quadrature (VSBQ), a method for post-process approximate inference for models with black-box and potentially noisy likelihoods. VSBQ reuses existing target density evaluations to build a sparse Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model of the log posterior density function. Subsequently, we leverage sparse-GP Bayesian quadrature combined with variational inference to achieve fast approximate posterior inference over the surrogate. We validate our method on challenging synthetic scenarios and real-world applications from computational neuroscience. The experiments show that VSBQ builds high-quality posterior approximations by post-processing existing optimization traces, with no further model evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10413v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signatures are iterated path integrals of continuous and discrete-time processes, and their universal nonlinearity linearizes the problem of feature selection in time series data analysis. This paper studies the consistency of signature using Lasso regression, both theoretically and numerically. We establish conditions under which the Lasso regression is consistent both asymptotically and in finite sample. Furthermore, we show that the Lasso regression is more consistent with the It\^o signature for time series and processes that are closer to the Brownian motion and with weaker inter-dimensional correlations, while it is more consistent with the Stratonovich signature for mean-reverting time series and processes. We demonstrate that signature can be applied to learn nonlinear functions and option prices with high accuracy, and the performance depends on properties of the underlying process and the choice of the signature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy maximization and free energy minimization are general physical principles for modeling the dynamics of various physical systems. Notable examples include modeling decision-making within the brain using the free-energy principle, optimizing the accuracy-complexity trade-off when accessing hidden variables with the information bottleneck principle (Tishby et al., 2000), and navigation in random environments using information maximization (Vergassola et al., 2007). Built on this principle, we propose a new class of bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the information of a key variable within the system. To this end, we develop an approximated analytical physics-based representation of an entropy to forecast the information gain of each action and greedily choose the one with the largest information gain. This method yields strong performances in classical bandit settings. Motivated by its empirical success, we prove its asymptotic optimality for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards. Owing to its ability to encompass the system's properties in a global physical functional, this approach can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings, calling for further investigation of information maximization approaches for multi-armed bandit problems.</description>

      <title>A transfer learning framework for weak-to-strong generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) alignment techniques rely on human feedback, but it is unclear whether these techniques fundamentally limit the capabilities of aligned LLMs. In particular, it is unknown if it is possible to align (stronger) LLMs with superhuman capabilities with (weaker) human feedback without degrading their capabilities. This is an instance of the weak-to-strong generalization problem: using feedback from a weaker (less capable) model to train a stronger (more capable) model. We prove that weak-to-strong generalization is possible by eliciting latent knowledge from pre-trained LLMs. In particular, we cast the weak-to-strong generalization problem as a transfer learning problem in which we wish to transfer a latent concept prior from a weak model to a strong pre-trained model. We prove that a naive fine-tuning approach suffers from fundamental limitations, but an alternative refinement-based approach suggested by the problem structure provably overcomes the limitations of fine-tuning. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the refinement approach in multiple LLM alignment tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of symmetrising a neural network along a group homomorphism: given a homomorphism $\varphi : H \to G$, we would like a procedure that converts $H$-equivariant neural networks to $G$-equivariant ones. We formulate this in terms of Markov categories, which allows us to consider neural networks whose outputs may be stochastic, but with measure-theoretic details abstracted away. We obtain a flexible and compositional framework for symmetrisation that relies on minimal assumptions about the structure of the group and the underlying neural network architecture. Our approach recovers existing canonicalisation and averaging techniques for symmetrising deterministic models, and extends to provide a novel methodology for symmetrising stochastic models also. Beyond this, our findings also demonstrate the utility of Markov categories for addressing complex problems in machine learning in a conceptually clear yet mathematically precise way.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Level Set Estimation Using Randomized Straddle Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Level set estimation (LSE), the problem of identifying the set of input points where a function takes value above (or below) a given threshold, is important in practical applications. When the function is expensive-to-evaluate and black-box, the \textit{straddle} algorithm, which is a representative heuristic for LSE based on Gaussian process models, and its extensions having theoretical guarantees have been developed. However, many of existing methods include a confidence parameter $\beta^{1/2}_t$ that must be specified by the user, and methods that choose $\beta^{1/2}_t$ heuristically do not provide theoretical guarantees. In contrast, theoretically guaranteed values of $\beta^{1/2}_t$ need to be increased depending on the number of iterations and candidate points, and are conservative and not good for practical performance. In this study, we propose a novel method, the \textit{randomized straddle} algorithm, in which $\beta_t$ in the straddle algorithm is replaced by a random sample from the chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom. The confidence parameter in the proposed method has the advantages of not needing adjustment, not depending on the number of iterations and candidate points, and not being conservative. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method has theoretical guarantees that depend on the sample complexity and the number of iterations. Finally, we confirm the usefulness of the proposed method through numerical experiments using synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Exchangeable Sequence Models Quantify Uncertainty Over Latent Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent agents must be able to articulate its own uncertainty. In this work, we show that pre-trained sequence models are naturally capable of probabilistic reasoning over exchangeable data points -- forming informed beliefs and sharpening them as it gathers more information. A sequence model learns the relationship between observations, which differs from typical Bayesian models that quantify uncertainty over latent parameters through priors and likelihoods (e.g., topic models). Despite the apparent difference, we illustrate how exchangeable sequence modeling provides a valid Bayesian model by going back to De Finetti's classical predictive view of probabilistic reasoning: uncertainty comes from data that has not been observed yet, rather than latent parameters. From this perspective, pre-training autoregressive models is equivalent to formulating informed beliefs based on prior observations ("empirical Bayes"), and forward generation is equivalent to simulating instantiations of an environment ("posterior inference"). In particular, exchangeable sequence models can explicitly perform statistical inference; epistemic uncertainty over latent environments is captured by variation in predicted future observations. Formally, we show the sequence prediction loss controls the quality of uncertainty quantification, and propose several approaches for encoding exchangeability in sequence model architectures: data augmentation, regularization, and causal masking.</description>

      <title>Linear combinations of Gaussian latents in generative models: interpolation and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08558v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling from generative models has become a crucial tool for applications like data synthesis and augmentation. Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalizing Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on Gaussian latent variables for generation. For search-based or creative applications that require additional control over the generation process, it has become common to manipulate the latent variable directly. However, existing approaches for performing such manipulations (e.g. interpolation or forming low-dimensional representations) only work well in special cases or are network or data-modality specific. We propose Combination of Gaussian variables (COG) as a general purpose method to form linear combinations of latent variables while adhering to the assumptions of the generative model. COG is easy to implement yet outperforms recent sophisticated methods for interpolation. As COG naturally addresses the broader task of forming linear combinations, new capabilities are afforded, including the construction of subspaces of the latent space, dramatically simplifying the creation of expressive low-dimensional spaces of high-dimensional objects.</description>

      <title>Stein transport for Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Stein transport}$, a novel methodology for Bayesian inference designed to efficiently push an ensemble of particles along a predefined curve of tempered probability distributions. The driving vector field is chosen from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and can be derived either through a suitable kernel ridge regression formulation or as an infinitesimal optimal transport map in the Stein geometry. The update equations of Stein transport resemble those of Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), but introduce a time-varying score function as well as specific weights attached to the particles. While SVGD relies on convergence in the long-time limit, Stein transport reaches its posterior approximation at finite time $t=1$. Studying the mean-field limit, we discuss the errors incurred by regularisation and finite-particle effects, and we connect Stein transport to birth-death dynamics and Fisher-Rao gradient flows. In a series of experiments, we show that in comparison to SVGD, Stein transport not only often reaches more accurate posterior approximations with a significantly reduced computational budget, but that it also effectively mitigates the variance collapse phenomenon commonly observed in SVGD.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of Persistent Homology with Neural Networks for Time-Series Prediction: A Case Study in Wave Height</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series prediction is an active area of research across various fields, often challenged by the fluctuating influence of short-term and long-term factors. In this study, we introduce a feature engineering method that enhances the predictive performance of neural network models. Specifically, we leverage computational topology techniques to derive valuable topological features from input data, boosting the predictive accuracy of our models. Our focus is on predicting wave heights, utilizing models based on topological features within feedforward neural networks (FNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and RNNs with gated recurrent units (GRU). For time-ahead predictions, the enhancements in $R^2$ score were significant for FNNs, RNNs, LSTM, and GRU models. Additionally, these models also showed significant reductions in maximum errors and mean squared errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Inside-Out Nested Particle Filter (IO-NPF), a novel, fully recursive, algorithm for amortized sequential Bayesian experimental design in the non-exchangeable setting. We frame policy optimization as maximum likelihood estimation in a non-Markovian state-space model, achieving (at most) $\mathcal{O}(T^2)$ computational complexity in the number of experiments. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees and introduce a backward sampling algorithm to reduce trajectory degeneracy. IO-NPF offers a practical, extensible, and provably consistent approach to sequential Bayesian experimental design, demonstrating improved efficiency over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Fast, Precise Thompson Sampling for Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) has optimal regret and excellent empirical performance in multi-armed bandit problems. Yet, in Bayesian optimization, TS underperforms popular acquisition functions (e.g., EI, UCB). TS samples arms according to the probability that they are optimal. A recent algorithm, P-Star Sampler (PSS), performs such a sampling via Hit-and-Run. We present an improved version, Stagger Thompson Sampler (STS). STS more precisely locates the maximizer than does TS using less computation time. We demonstrate that STS outperforms TS, PSS, and other acquisition methods in numerical experiments of optimizations of several test functions across a broad range of dimension. Additionally, since PSS was originally presented not as a standalone acquisition method but as an input to a batching algorithm called Minimal Terminal Variance (MTV), we also demon-strate that STS matches PSS performance when used as the input to MTV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.06872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of tensor network based machine learning methods to scale to large image and text data sets. For that, we study how the mutual information between a subregion and its complement scales with the subsystem size $L$, similarly to how it is done in quantum many-body physics. We find that for text, the mutual information scales as a power law $L^\nu$ with a close to volume law exponent, indicating that text cannot be efficiently described by 1D tensor networks. For images, the scaling is close to an area law, hinting at 2D tensor networks such as PEPS could have an adequate expressibility. For the numerical analysis, we introduce a mutual information estimator based on autoregressive networks, and we also use convolutional neural networks in a neural estimator method.</description>

      <title>Bias-inducing geometries: an exactly solvable data model with fairness implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15935v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) may be oblivious to human bias but it is not immune to its perpetuation. Marginalisation and iniquitous group representation are often traceable in the very data used for training, and may be reflected or even enhanced by the learning models. In the present work, we aim at clarifying the role played by data geometry in the emergence of ML bias. We introduce an exactly solvable high-dimensional model of data imbalance, where parametric control over the many bias-inducing factors allows for an extensive exploration of the bias inheritance mechanism. Through the tools of statistical physics, we analytically characterise the typical properties of learning models trained in this synthetic framework and obtain exact predictions for the observables that are commonly employed for fairness assessment. Despite the simplicity of the data model, we retrace and unpack typical unfairness behaviour observed on real-world datasets. We also obtain a detailed analytical characterisation of a class of bias mitigation strategies. We first consider a basic loss-reweighing scheme, which allows for an implicit minimisation of different unfairness metrics, and quantify the incompatibilities between some existing fairness criteria. Then, we consider a novel mitigation strategy based on a matched inference approach, consisting in the introduction of coupled learning models. Our theoretical analysis of this approach shows that the coupled strategy can strike superior fairness-accuracy trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Uncertainty Disentanglement: Specialized Uncertainties for Specialized Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification, once a singular task, has evolved into a spectrum of tasks, including abstained prediction, out-of-distribution detection, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. The latest goal is disentanglement: the construction of multiple estimators that are each tailored to one and only one source of uncertainty. This paper presents the first benchmark of uncertainty disentanglement. We reimplement and evaluate a comprehensive range of uncertainty estimators, from Bayesian over evidential to deterministic ones, across a diverse range of uncertainty tasks on ImageNet. We find that, despite recent theoretical endeavors, no existing approach provides pairs of disentangled uncertainty estimators in practice. We further find that specialized uncertainty tasks are harder than predictive uncertainty tasks, where we observe saturating performance. Our results provide both practical advice for which uncertainty estimators to use for which specific task, and reveal opportunities for future research toward task-centric and disentangled uncertainties.

      <title>Solution space and storage capacity of fully connected two-layer neural networks with generic activation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The storage capacity of a binary classification model is the maximum number of random input-output pairs per parameter that the model can learn. It is one of the indicators of the expressive power of machine learning models and is important for comparing the performance of various models. In this study, we analyze the structure of the solution space and the storage capacity of fully connected two-layer neural networks with general activation functions using the replica method from statistical physics. Our results demonstrate that the storage capacity per parameter remains finite even with infinite width and that the weights of the network exhibit negative correlations, leading to a 'division of labor'. In addition, we find that increasing the dataset size triggers a phase transition at a certain transition point where the permutation symmetry of weights is broken, resulting in the solution space splitting into disjoint regions. We identify the dependence of this transition point and the storage capacity on the choice of activation function. These findings contribute to understanding the influence of activation functions and the number of parameters on the structure of the solution space, potentially offering insights for selecting appropriate architectures based on specific objectives.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks-based Random Vortex Methods for Modelling Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a novel Neural Networks-based approach for approximating solutions to the (2D) incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, which is an extension of so called Deep Random Vortex Methods (DRVM), that does not require the knowledge of the Biot--Savart kernel associated to the computational domain. Our algorithm uses a Neural Network (NN), that approximates the vorticity based on a loss function that uses a computationally efficient formulation of the Random Vortex Dynamics. The neural vorticity estimator is then combined with traditional numerical PDE-solvers, which can be considered as a final implicit linear layer of the network, for the Poisson equation to compute the velocity field. The main advantage of our method compared to the standard DRVM and other NN-based numerical algorithms is that it strictly enforces physical properties, such as incompressibility or (no slip) boundary conditions, which might be hard to guarantee otherwise. The approximation abilities of our algorithm, and its capability for incorporating measurement data, are validated by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Resetting Mitigates Latent Gradient Bias of SGD from Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Giving up and starting over may seem wasteful in many situations such as searching for a target or training deep neural networks (DNNs). Our study, though, demonstrates that resetting from a checkpoint can significantly improve generalization performance when training DNNs with noisy labels. In the presence of noisy labels, DNNs initially learn the general patterns of the data but then gradually memorize the corrupted data, leading to overfitting. By deconstructing the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we identify the behavior of a latent gradient bias induced by noisy labels, which harms generalization. To mitigate this negative effect, we apply the stochastic resetting method to SGD, inspired by recent developments in the field of statistical physics achieving efficient target searches. We first theoretically identify the conditions where resetting becomes beneficial, and then we empirically validate our theory, confirming the significant improvements achieved by resetting. We further demonstrate that our method is both easy to implement and compatible with other methods for handling noisy labels. Additionally, this work offers insights into the learning dynamics of DNNs from an interpretability perspective, expanding the potential to analyze training methods through the lens of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence Rates of Set Membership Estimation of Linear Systems with Disturbances Bounded by General Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the uncertainty set estimation of system parameters of linear dynamical systems with bounded disturbances, which is motivated by robust (adaptive) constrained control. Departing from the confidence bounds of least square estimation from the machine-learning literature, this paper focuses on a method commonly used in (robust constrained) control literature: set membership estimation (SME). SME tends to enjoy better empirical performance than LSE's confidence bounds when the system disturbances are bounded. However, the theoretical guarantees of SME are not fully addressed even for i.i.d. bounded disturbances. In the literature, SME's convergence has been proved for general convex supports of the disturbances, but SME's convergence rate assumes a special type of disturbance support: $ \ell_\infty $ ball. The main contribution of this paper is relaxing the assumption on the disturbance support and establishing the convergence rates of SME for general convex supports, which closes the gap on the applicability of the convergence and convergence rates results. Numerical experiments on SME and LSE's confidence bounds are also provided for different disturbance supports.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs dream of elephants (when told not to)? Latent concept association and associative memory in transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the capacity to store and recall facts. Through experimentation with open-source models, we observe that this ability to retrieve facts can be easily manipulated by changing contexts, even without altering their factual meanings. These findings highlight that LLMs might behave like an associative memory model where certain tokens in the contexts serve as clues to retrieving facts. We mathematically explore this property by studying how transformers, the building blocks of LLMs, can complete such memory tasks. We study a simple latent concept association problem with a one-layer transformer and we show theoretically and empirically that the transformer gathers information using self-attention and uses the value matrix for associative memory.</description>

      <title>Scalable Exploration via Ensemble++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable exploration in high-dimensional, complex environments is a significant challenge in sequential decision making, especially when utilizing neural networks. Ensemble sampling, a practical approximation of Thompson sampling, is widely adopted but often suffers performance degradation due to {ensemble coupling} in shared layer architectures, leading to reduced diversity and ineffective exploration. In this paper, we introduce Ensemble++, a novel method that addresses these challenges through architectural and algorithmic innovations. To prevent ensemble coupling, Ensemble++ decouples mean and uncertainty estimation by separating the base network and ensemble components, employs a symmetrized loss function and the stop-gradient operator. To further enhance exploration, it generates richer hypothesis spaces through random linear combinations of ensemble components using continuous index sampling. Theoretically, we prove that Ensemble++ matches the regret bounds of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits while maintaining a scalable per-step computational complexity of $\tilde{O}( \log T)$. This provides the first rigorous analysis demonstrating that ensemble sampling can be an scalable and effective approximation to Thompson Sampling, closing a key theoretical gap in exploration efficiency. Empirically, we demonstrate Ensemble++'s effectiveness in both regret minimization and computational efficiency across a range of nonlinear bandit environments, including a language-based contextual bandits where the agents employ GPT backbones.

      <title>Learning to Embed Distributions via Maximum Kernel Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical data can often be considered as samples from a set of probability distributions. Kernel methods have emerged as a natural approach for learning to classify these distributions. Although numerous kernels between distributions have been proposed, applying kernel methods to distribution regression tasks remains challenging, primarily because selecting a suitable kernel is not straightforward. Surprisingly, the question of learning a data-dependent distribution kernel has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel objective for the unsupervised learning of data-dependent distribution kernel, based on the principle of entropy maximization in the space of probability measure embeddings. We examine the theoretical properties of the latent embedding space induced by our objective, demonstrating that its geometric structure is well-suited for solving downstream discriminative tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the learned kernel across different modalities.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition: A Robust and Automated Approach for Optimally Sparse Mode Selection in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition (parsDMD), a novel algorithm designed to automatically select an optimally sparse subset of dynamic modes for both spatiotemporal and purely temporal data. By incorporating time-delay embedding and leveraging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), parsDMD ensures robustness against noise and effectively handles complex, nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm is validated on a diverse range of datasets, including standing wave signals, identifying hidden dynamics, fluid dynamics simulations (flow past a cylinder and transonic buffet), and atmospheric sea-surface temperature (SST) data. ParsDMD addresses a significant limitation of the traditional sparsity-promoting DMD (spDMD), which requires manual tuning of sparsity parameters through a rigorous trial-and-error process to balance between single-mode and all-mode solutions. In contrast, parsDMD autonomously determines the optimally sparse subset of modes without user intervention, while maintaining minimal computational complexity. Comparative analyses demonstrate that parsDMD consistently outperforms spDMD by providing more accurate mode identification and effective reconstruction in noisy environments. These advantages render parsDMD an effective tool for real-time diagnostics, forecasting, and reduced-order model construction across various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Unpicking Data at the Seams: VAEs, Disentanglement and Independent Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disentanglement, or identifying salient statistically independent factors of the data, is of interest in many areas of machine learning and statistics, such as synthetic data generation with controlled properties, robust classification of features, parsimonious encoding, and improving our understanding of the generative process underlying the data. Disentanglement is observed in several generative paradigms, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Particular progress has recently been made in understanding disentanglement in VAEs, where the choice of diagonal posterior covariance matrices is proposed to promote mutual orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. We continue this thread to show how such linear independence translates to statistical independence, completing the chain in understanding how the VAE's objective identifies independent components of, or disentangles, the data.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Spurious Correlations via Disagreement Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) are prone to be biased towards spurious correlations between target labels and bias attributes, which leads to poor performance on data groups lacking spurious correlations. It is particularly challenging to address this problem when access to bias labels is not permitted. To mitigate the effect of spurious correlations without bias labels, we first introduce a novel training objective designed to robustly enhance model performance across all data samples, irrespective of the presence of spurious correlations. From this objective, we then derive a debiasing method, Disagreement Probability based Resampling for debiasing (DPR), which does not require bias labels. DPR leverages the disagreement between the target label and the prediction of a biased model to identify bias-conflicting samples-those without spurious correlations-and upsamples them according to the disagreement probability. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DPR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines that do not use bias labels. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis that details how DPR reduces dependency on spurious correlations.</description>

      <title>SLED: Self Logits Evolution Decoding for Improving Factuality in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their outputs can sometimes be unreliable or factually incorrect. To address this, we introduce Self Logits Evolution Decoding (SLED), a novel decoding framework that enhances the truthfulness of LLMs without relying on external knowledge bases or requiring further fine-tuning. From an optimization perspective, our SLED framework leverages the latent knowledge embedded within the LLM by contrasting the output logits from the final layer with those from early layers. It then utilizes an approximate gradient approach to enable latent knowledge to guide the self-refinement of outputs, thereby effectively improving factual accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on established benchmarks across a diverse range of model families (LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, Gemma) and scales (from 2B to 70B), including more advanced architectural configurations such as the mixture of experts (MoE). Our evaluation spans a wide variety of tasks, including multi-choice, open-generation, and adaptations to chain-of-thought reasoning tasks. The results demonstrate that SLED consistently improves factual accuracy by up to 20\% compared to existing decoding methods while maintaining natural language fluency and negligible latency overhead. Furthermore, it can be flexibly combined with other decoding methods to further enhance their performance.</description>

      <title>A Note on Doubly Robust Estimator in Regression Continuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note introduces a doubly robust (DR) estimator for regression discontinuity (RD) designs. RD designs provide a quasi-experimental framework for estimating treatment effects, where treatment assignment depends on whether a running variable surpasses a predefined cutoff. A common approach in RD estimation is the use of nonparametric regression methods, such as local linear regression. However, the validity of these methods still relies on the consistency of the nonparametric estimators. In this study, we propose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for the conditional expected outcomes. The primary advantage of the DR-RD estimator lies in its ability to ensure the consistency of the treatment effect estimation as long as at least one of the two estimators is consistent. Consequently, our DR-RD estimator enhances robustness of treatment effect estimators in RD designs.</description>

      <title>To bootstrap or to rollout? An optimal and adaptive interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bootstrapping and rollout are two fundamental principles for value function estimation in reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce a novel class of Bellman operators, called subgraph Bellman operators, that interpolate between bootstrapping and rollout methods. Our estimator, derived by solving the fixed point of the empirical subgraph Bellman operator, combines the strengths of the bootstrapping-based temporal difference (TD) estimator and the rollout-based Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Specifically, the error upper bound of our estimator approaches the optimal variance achieved by TD, with an additional term depending on the exit probability of a selected subset of the state space. At the same time, the estimator exhibits the finite-sample adaptivity of MC, with sample complexity depending only on the occupancy measure of this subset. We complement the upper bound with an information-theoretic lower bound, showing that the additional term is unavoidable given a reasonable sample size. Together, these results establish subgraph Bellman estimators as an optimal and adaptive framework for reconciling TD and MC methods in policy evaluation.</description>
