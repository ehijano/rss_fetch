      <title>Preserving Privacy in Cloud-based Data-Driven Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent years, we have observed three significant trends in control systems: a renewed interest in data-driven control design, the abundance of cloud computational services and the importance of preserving privacy for the system under control. Motivated by these factors, this work investigates privacy-preserving outsourcing for the design of a stabilizing controller for unknown linear time-invariant systems.The main objective of this research is to preserve the privacy for the system dynamics by designing an outsourcing mechanism. To achieve this goal, we propose a scheme that combines transformation-based techniques and robust data-driven control design methods. The scheme preserves the privacy of both the open-loop and closed-loop system matrices while stabilizing the system under control.The scheme is applicable to both data with and without disturbance and is lightweight in terms of computational overhead. Numerical investigations for a case study demonstrate the impacts of our mechanism and its role in hindering malicious adversaries from achieving their goals.</description>

      <title>Invisible Manipulation Deep Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Stealthy Attacks on Battery Energy Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces "invisible manipulation", an innovative cyber-attack mechanism achieved through strategically timed stealthy false data injection attacks (SFDIAs). By stealthily manipulating measurements of a critical asset prior to the target time period, the attacker can subtly guide the engineering system toward a predetermined operational state without detection. Using the battery energy management system (BEMS) as a case study, we employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate synthetic measurements, such as battery voltage and current, that align closely with actual measurements. These synthetic measurements, falling within the acceptable error margin of residual-based bad data detection algorithm provided by state estimation, can evade detection and mislead Extended Kalman-filter-based State of Charge estimation. Subsequently, considering the deceptive data as valid inputs, the BEMS will operate the BESS towards the attacker desired operational states when the targeted time period come. The use of the DRL-based scheme allows us to covert an online optimization problem into an offline training process, thereby alleviating the computational burden for real-time implementation. Comprehensive testing on a high-fidelity microgrid real-time simulation testbed validates the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed methods in achieving different attack objectives.</description>

      <title>AI-focused HPC Data Centers Can Provide More Power Grid Flexibility and at Lower Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly large language models, requires energy-demanding high-performance computing (HPC) data centers, which poses a significant burden on power system capacity. Scheduling data center computing jobs to manage power demand can alleviate network stress with minimal infrastructure investment and contribute to fast time-scale power system balancing. This study, for the first time, comprehensively analyzes the capability and cost of grid flexibility provision by GPU-heavy AI-focused HPC data centers, along with a comparison with CPU-heavy general-purpose HPC data centers traditionally used for scientific computing. Using real-world data from 7 AI-focused HPC data centers, 7 general-purpose HPC data centers, and 3 cloud platforms, we find that AI-focused HPC data centers can offer greater flexibility at 50% lower cost for a range of power system services. By comparing the cost to flexibility market prices, we illustrate the financial profitability of flexibility provision for AI-focused HPC data centers.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Accelerated Network-Reconfigured Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal power flow (OPF) has been used for real-time grid operations. Prior efforts demonstrated that utilizing flexibility from dynamic topologies will improve grid efficiency. However, this will convert the linear OPF into a mixed-integer linear programming network-reconfigured OPF (NR-OPF) problem, substantially increasing the computing time. Thus, a machine learning (ML)-based approach, particularly utilizing graph neural network (GNN), is proposed to accelerate the solution process. The GNN model is trained offline to predict the best topology before entering the optimization stage. In addition, this paper proposes an offline pre-ML filter layer to reduce GNN model size and training time while improving its accuracy. A fast online post-ML selection layer is also proposed to analyze GNN predictions and then select a subset of predicted NR solutions with high confidence. Case studies have demonstrated superior performance of the proposed GNN-accelerated NR-OPF method augmented with the proposed pre-ML and post-ML layers.</description>

      <title>Electric Grid Topology and Admittance Estimation: Quantifying Phasor-based Measurement Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we quantify voltage and current phasor-based measurement requirements for the unique identification of the electric grid topology and admittance parameters. Our approach is underpinned by the concept of a rigidity matrix that has been extensively studied in graph rigidity theory. Specifically, we show that the rank of the rigidity matrix is the same as that of a voltage coefficient matrix in a corresponding electric power system. Accordingly, we show that there is a minimum number of measurements required to uniquely identify the admittance matrix and corresponding grid topology. By means of a numerical example on the IEEE 4-node radial network, we demonstrate that our approach is suitable for applications in electric power grids.</description>

      <title>Risk-sensitive Affine Control Synthesis for Stationary LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address deviations from expected performance in stochastic systems, we propose a risk-sensitive control synthesis method to minimize certain risk measures over the limiting stationary distribution. Specifically, we extend Worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk (W-CVaR) optimization for Linear Time-invariant (LTI) systems to handle nonzero-mean noise and affine controllers, using only the first and second moments of noise, which enhances robustness against model uncertainty. Highlighting the strong coupling between the linear and bias terms of the controller, we reformulate the synthesis problem as a Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI), and propose an alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Finally, we demonstrate the numerical performance of our approach in two representative settings, which shows that the proposed algorithm successfully synthesizes risk-sensitive controllers that outperform the na\"ive LQR baseline.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Data Centres and Local Energy Communities Synergies for Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolving energy landscape has propelled energy communities to the forefront of modern energy management. However, existing research has yet to explore the potential synergies between data centres and energy communities, necessitating an assessment on their collective capabilities for cost efficiency, waste heat optimisation, and market participation. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming model to assess the collaborative performance of energy communities, data centres and energy markets. The evaluation focuses on the efficient use of waste heat and the flexibility of job scheduling while minimising system energy costs and maintaining quality of service requirements for data centres. Our results, based on realistic profiles of an energy community and a data centre, showcase significant benefits of these synergies, with a 38% reduction in operating costs and an 87% decrease in heat demand.</description>

      <title>Constraint Removal for MPC with Performance Preservation and a Hyperthermia Cancer Treatment Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is an optimization-based control strategy with broad industrial adoption. Unfortunately, the required computation time to solve the receding-horizon MPC optimization problem can become prohibitively large for many applications with a large number of state constraints. This large number of state constraints can, for instance, originate from spatially discretizing a partial differential equation of which the solution has to satisfy constraints over the full spatial domain. This is particularly the case in MPC for RF-based hyperthermia cancer treatments, which forms a strong motivation for this study. To address this problem, we propose a novel constraint-adaptive MPC framework for linear discrete-time systems. In this framework, we select at each time-step a subset of the state constraints that are included in the optimization problem, thereby reducing the online computational burden. Critically, our framework guarantees the same closed-loop performance, recursive feasibility, and constraint satisfaction properties as the original (non-reduced) MPC scheme. We achieve this result by efficiently exploiting reachable set computations and the MPC cost function. We will demonstrate our novel method using a hyperthermia cancer treatment case study showing a two-orders of magnitude improvement in computation time, with identical closed-loop performance as the original (non-reduced) MPC scheme.</description>

      <title>Approximate Kalman filtering for large-scale systems with an application to hyperthermia cancer treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate state estimates are required for increasingly complex systems, to enable, for example, feedback control. However, available state estimation schemes are not necessarily real-time feasible for certain large-scale systems. Therefore, we develop in this paper, a real-time feasible state-estimation scheme for a class of large-scale systems that approximates the steady state Kalman filter. In particular, we focus on systems where the state-vector is the result of discretizing the spatial domain, as typically seen in Partial Differential Equations. In such cases, the correlation between states in the state-vector often have an intuitive interpretation on the spatial domain, which can be exploited to obtain a significant reduction in computational complexity, while still providing accurate state estimates. We illustrate these strengths of our method through a hyperthermia cancer treatment case study. The results of the case study show significant improvements in the computation time, while simultaneously obtaining good state estimates, when compared to Ensemble Kalman filters and Kalman filters using reduced-order models.</description>

      <title>Accelerating soft-constrained MPC for linear systems through online constraint removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization-based controllers, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), have attracted significant research interest due to their intuitive concept, constraint handling capabilities, and natural application to multi-input multi-output systems. However, the computational complexity of solving a receding horizon problem at each time step remains a challenge for the deployment of MPC. This is particularly the case for systems constrained by many inequalities. Recently, we introduced the concept of constraint-adaptive MPC (ca-MPC) to address this challenge for linear systems with hard constraints. In ca-MPC, at each time step, a subset of the constraints is removed from the optimization problem, thereby accelerating the optimization procedure, while resulting in identical closed-loop behavior. The present paper extends this framework to soft-constrained MPC by detecting and removing constraints based on sub-optimal predicted input sequences, which is rather easy for soft-constrained MPC due to the receding horizon principle and the inclusion of slack variables. We will translate these new ideas explicitly to an offset-free output tracking problem. The effectiveness of these ideas is demonstrated on a two-dimensional thermal transport model, showing a three order of magnitude improvement in online computational time of the MPC scheme.</description>

      <title>Markov Potential Game with Final-time Reach-Avoid Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a Markov potential game with final-time reach-avoid objectives by integrating potential game theory with stochastic reach-avoid control. Our focus is on multi-player trajectory planning where players maximize the same multi-player reach-avoid objective: the probability of all participants reaching their designated target states by a specified time, while avoiding collisions with one another. Existing approaches require centralized computation of actions via a global policy, which may have prohibitively expensive communication costs. Instead, we focus on approximations of the global policy via local state feedback policies. First, we adapt the recursive single player reach-avoid value iteration to the multi-player framework with local policies, and show that the same recursion holds on the joint state space. To find each player's optimal local policy, the multi-player reach-avoid value function is projected from the joint state to the local state using the other players' occupancy measures. Then, we propose an iterative best response scheme for the multi-player value iteration to converge to a pure Nash equilibrium. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in finding collision-free policies for multi-player motion planning in simulation.</description>

      <title>Deoxys: A Causal Inference Engine for Unhealthy Node Mitigation in Large-scale Cloud Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of unhealthy nodes in cloud infrastructure signals the potential failure of machines, which can significantly impact the availability and reliability of cloud services, resulting in negative customer experiences. Effectively addressing unhealthy node mitigation is therefore vital for sustaining cloud system performance. This paper introduces Deoxys, a causal inference engine tailored to recommending mitigation actions for unhealthy node in cloud systems to minimize virtual machine downtime and interruptions during unhealthy events. It employs double machine learning combined with causal forest to produce precise and reliable mitigation recommendations based solely on limited observational data collected from the historical unhealthy events. To enhance the causal inference model, Deoxys further incorporates a policy fallback mechanism based on model uncertainty and action overriding mechanisms to (i) improve the reliability of the system, and (ii) strike a good tradeoff between downtime reduction and resource utilization, thereby enhancing the overall system performance.
  After deploying Deoxys in a large-scale cloud infrastructure at Microsoft, our observations demonstrate that Deoxys significantly reduces average VM downtime by 53% compared to a legacy policy, while leading to 49.5% lower VM interruption rate. This substantial improvement enhances the reliability and stability of cloud platforms, resulting in a seamless customer experience.</description>

      <title>Fiber Activation by Bipolar Stimulation in Deep Brain Stimulation: A Patient Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a therapy widely used for treating the symptoms of neurological disorders. Electrical pulses are chronically delivered in DBS to a disease-specific brain target via a surgically implanted electrode. The stimulating contact configuration, stimulation polarity, as well as amplitude, frequency, and pulse width of the DBS pulse sequence are utilized to optimize the therapeutic effect. In this paper, the utility of therapy individualization by means of patient-specific mathematical modeling is investigated with respect to a specific case of a patient diagnosed with Essential Tremor (ET). Two computational models are compared in their ability to elucidate the impact of DBS stimulation on the dentato-rubrothalamic tract: (i) a conventional model of Volume of Tissue Activated (VTA) and (ii) a well-established neural fiber activation modeling framework known as OSS-DBS. The simulation results are compared with tremor measured in the patient under different DBS settings using a smartphone application. The findings of the study highlight that temporally static VTA models do not adequately describe the differences in the outcomes of bipolar stimulation settings with switched polarity, whereas neural fiber activation models hold potential in this regard. However, it is noted that neither of the investigated models fully accounts for the measured symptom pattern, particularly regarding a bilateral effect produced by unilateral stimulation.</description>

      <title>e-Values for Real-Time Residential Electricity Demand Forecast Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing number of forecasting techniques and the increasing significance of forecast-based operation - particularly in the rapidly evolving energy sector - selecting the most effective forecasting model has become a critical task. Given the dynamic nature of energy forecasting, it is highly advantageous to assess the superiority of forecasting models not only retrospectively but continuously in real-time as new data and evidence becomes available, while simultaneously providing strong probabilistic guarantees for these decisions. In this work, we show that this can be achieved through the mathematical concept of e-values, which has recently gained massive attention in the field of statistics. It allows for unified construction principles for powerful tests and accurate statistical decisions, which can be evaluated at any chosen time points while maintaining an overall probabilistic error control. We extend the use of e-values by developing a simple persistence approach that dynamically combines input forecasts to generate new fused predictions. To demonstrate the performance of our method we apply it to electricity demand forecasts based on different artificial intelligence based models. Our results indicate that e-values are able to improve the accuracy and reliability of forecasts in a dynamic environment, offering a valuable tool for real-time decision-making in the energy sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sinusoidal excitation is particularly popular for testing structures in the nonlinear regime. Due to the nonlinear behavior and the inevitable feedback of the structure on the exciter, higher harmonics in the applied excitation are generated. This is undesired, because the acquired response may deviate substantially from that of the structure under purely sinusoidal excitation, in particular if one of the higher harmonics engages into resonance. We present a new approach to suppress those higher excitation harmonics and thus the unwanted exciter-structure interaction: Higher harmonics are added to the voltage input to the shaker whose Fourier coefficients are adjusted via feedback control until the excitation is purely sinusoidal. The stability of this method is analyzed for a simplified model; the resulting closed-form expressions are useful, among others, to select an appropriate exciter configuration, including the drive point. A practical procedure for the control design is suggested. The proposed method is validated in virtual and real experiments of internally resonant structures, in the two common configurations of force excitation via a stinger and base excitation. Excellent performance is achieved already when using the same control gains for all harmonics, throughout the tested range of amplitudes and frequencies, even in the strongly nonlinear regime. Compared to the iterative state of the art, it is found that the proposed method is simpler to implement, enables faster testing and it is easy to achieve a lower harmonic distortion.</description>

      <title>Role of hydrogen in decarbonizing China's electricity and hard-to-abate sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green hydrogen has the potential to address two pressing problems in a zero-carbon energy system: balancing seasonal variability of solar and wind in the electricity sector, and replacing fossil fuels in hard-to-abate sectors. However, the previous research only separately modeled the electricity and hard-to-abate sectors, which is unable to capture how the interaction between the two sectors influences the energy system cost. In this study, focusing on China, we deploy an electricity system planning model to examine the cost implications of green hydrogen to fully decarbonize the electricity system and hard-to-abate sectors. Our results reveal that green hydrogen enables a 17% reduction in the levelized cost of a zero-carbon electricity system relative to that without hydrogen. However, cost savings hinge on the availability of underground hydrogen storage capacities and electric transmission expansion. More importantly, coupling hydrogen infrastructure in the electricity and hard-to-abate sectors not only reduces energy costs compared to a decoupled energy system but also makes green hydrogen cost-competitive compared to fossil fuel-based gray and blue hydrogen in China.</description>

      <title>Effective Finite Time Stability Control for Human-Machine Shared Vehicle Following System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of intelligent connected vehicle technology, human-machine shared control has gained popularity in vehicle following due to its effectiveness in driver assistance. However, traditional vehicle following systems struggle to maintain stability when driver reaction time fluctuates, as these variations require different levels of system intervention. To address this issue, the proposed human-machine shared vehicle following assistance system (HM-VFAS) integrates driver outputs under various states with the assistance system. The system employs an intelligent driver model that accounts for reaction time delays, simulating time-varying driver outputs. A control authority allocation strategy is designed to dynamically adjust the level of intervention based on real-time driver state assessment. To handle instability from driver authority switching, the proposed solution includes a two-layer adaptive finite time sliding mode controller (A-FTSMC). The first layer is an integral sliding mode adaptive controller that ensures robustness by compensating for uncertainties in the driver output. The second layer is a fast non-singular terminal sliding mode controller designed to accelerate convergence for rapid stabilization. Using real driver videos as inputs, the performance of the HM-VFAS was evaluated. Results show that the proposed control strategy maintains a safe distance under time-varying driver states, with the actual acceleration error relative to the target acceleration maintained within 0.5m/s~2 and the maximum acceleration error reduced by 1.2m/s~2. Compared to traditional controllers, the A-FTSMC controller offers faster convergence and less vibration, reducing the stabilization time by 27.3%.</description>

Abstract: This work considers infinite-horizon optimal control of positive linear systems applied to the case of network routing problems. We demonstrate the equivalence between Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems and optimal control of a certain class of linear systems. This is used to construct a heuristic search framework for this class of linear systems inspired by existing methods for SSP. We propose a heuristics-based algorithm for finding local solutions to the analyzed class of optimal control problems with positive state and linear dynamics. More fundamentally, the results allow for analysis of the conditions for explicit solutions to the Bellman equation utilized by heuristic search methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces an innovative approach to industrial maintenance leveraging augmented reality (AR) technology, focusing on enhancing the user experience and efficiency. The shift from traditional to proactive maintenance strategies underscores the significance of maintenance in industrial systems. The proposed solution integrates AR interfaces, particularly through Head-Mounted Display (HMD) devices, to provide expert personnel-aided decision support for maintenance technicians, with the association of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. The study explores the user experience aspect of AR interfaces in a simulated industrial environment, aiming to improve the maintenance processes' intuitiveness and effectiveness. Evaluation metrics such as the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and the System Usability Scale (SUS) are employed to assess the usability, performance, and workload implications of the AR maintenance system. Additionally, the paper discusses the technical implementation, methodology, and results of experiments conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling human trajectories in crowded environments is challenging due to the complex nature of pedestrian behavior and interactions. This paper proposes a geometric graph neural network (GNN) architecture that integrates domain knowledge from psychological studies to model pedestrian interactions and predict future trajectories. Unlike prior studies using complete graphs, we define interaction neighborhoods using pedestrians' field of view, motion direction, and distance-based kernel functions to construct graph representations of crowds. Evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate improved prediction accuracy through reduced average and final displacement error metrics. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating domain knowledge with data-driven approaches for effective modeling of human interactions in crowds.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid development of electric vehicles, formula races that face high school and university students have become more popular than ever as the threshold for design and manufacturing has been lowered. In many cases, we see teams inspired by or directly using toolkits and technologies inherited from standardized commercial vehicles. These architectures are usually overly complicated for amateur applications like the races. In order to improve the efficiency and simplify the development of instrumentation, control, and analysis systems, we propose LEADS (Lightweight Embedded Assisted Driving System), a dedicated solution for such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Time-to-Lie: Identifying Industrial Control System Honeypots Using the Internet Control Message Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of information and operational technology networks has created previously unforeseen security issues. To address these issues, both researchers and practitioners have integrated threat intelligence methods into the security operations of converged networks, with some of the most valuable tools being honeypots that imitate industrial control systems (ICS). However, the development and deployment of such honeypots is a process rich with pitfalls, which can lead to undiagnosed weaknesses in the threat intelligence being gathered. This paper presents a side-channel method of covertly identifying ICS honeypots using the time-to-live (TTL) values of target devices. We show that many ICS honeypots can be readily identified, via minimal interactions, using only basic networking tools. In a study of over 8,000 devices presenting as ICS systems, we detail how our method compares to an existing honeypot detection approach, and outline what our methodology reveals about the current population of live ICS honeypots. In demonstrating our method, this study aims to raise awareness of the viability of the TTL heuristic and the prevalence of its misconfiguration despite its presence in literature.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Representation and Model Learning for Latent Dynamic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning identifiable representations and models from low-level observations is useful for an intelligent spacecraft to reliability finish downstream tasks. For temporal observations, to ensure that the data generating process is provably inverted, most existing works either assume the noise variables in the dynamic mechanisms are (conditionally) independent, or require interventions which can directly affect each latent variable. However, in practice, the relationship between the exogenous inputs/interventions and the latent variables may follow some complex deterministic mechanisms. In this work, we study the problem of identifiable representation and model learning for latent dynamic systems. The key idea is that we use an inductive bias inspired by controllable canonical forms, which is invariant, sparse, and input dependent by definition. We prove that, for linear or affine nonlinear latent dynamic systems, it is possible to identify the representations up to scaling and determine the models up to some simple transformations. The results have potential to provide some theoretical guarantees for developing more trustworthy decision-making and control methods for intelligent spacecrafts.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Hydrostatics: Toward Multifunctional and Powerful Wearable Robotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable and locomotive robot designers face multiple challenges when choosing actuation. Traditional fully actuated designs using electric motors are multifunctional but oversized and inefficient for bearing conservative loads and for being backdrivable. Alternatively, quasi-passive and underactuated designs reduce the size of motorization and energy storage, but are often designed for specific tasks. Designers of versatile and stronger wearable robots will face these challenges unless future actuators become very torque-dense, backdrivable and efficient.
  This paper explores a design paradigm for addressing this issue: reconfigurable hydrostatics. We show that a hydrostatic actuator can integrate a passive force mechanism and a sharing mechanism in the fluid domain and still be multifunctional. First, an analytical study compares how these two mechanisms can relax the motorization requirements in the context of a load-bearing exoskeleton. Then, the hydrostatic concept integrating these two mechanisms using hydraulic components is presented. A case study analysis shows the mass/efficiency/inertia benefits of the concept over a fully actuated one. Then, the feasibility of the concept is partially validated with a proof-of-concept that actuates the knees of an exoskeleton. The experiments show that it can track the vertical ground reaction force (GRF) profiles of walking, running, squatting, and jumping, and that the energy consumption is 6x lower. The transient force behaviors due to switching from one leg to the other are also analyzed along with some mitigation to improve them.</description>

Abstract: While blockchain offers inherent security, trust issues among stakeholders in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications remain unresolved due to a lack of regulatory frameworks and standardization. Additionally, a tailored decentralized privacy-preserved coordination scheme for blockchain in V2G networks is needed to ensure user privacy and efficient energy transactions. This paper proposes a V2G trading and coordination scheme tailored to the decentralized nature of blockchain as well as the interests of stakeholders utilizing smart charging points (SCPs) and Stackelberg game model. Case studies using real-world data from Southern University of Science and Technology demonstrate the efficacy of proposed scheme in reducing EV charging costs and the potential for supporting auxiliary grid services.</description>

      <title>SPARC: Prediction-Based Safe Control for Coupled Controllable and Uncontrollable Agents with Conformal Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of safe control synthesis for systems operating in environments with uncontrollable agents whose dynamics are unknown but coupled with those of the controlled system. This scenario naturally arises in various applications, such as autonomous driving and human-robot collaboration, where the behavior of uncontrollable agents, like pedestrians, cannot be directly controlled but is influenced by the actions of the autonomous vehicle or robot. In this paper, we present SPARC (Safe Prediction-Based Robust Controller for Coupled Agents), a novel framework designed to ensure safe control in the presence of coupled uncontrollable agents. SPARC leverages conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in data-driven prediction of agent behavior. Particularly, we introduce a joint distribution-based approach to account for the coupled dynamics of the controlled system and uncontrollable agents. By integrating the control barrier function (CBF) technique, SPARC provides provable safety guarantees at a high confidence level. We illustrate our framework with a case study involving an autonomous driving scenario with walking pedestrians.</description>

      <title>Posterior Sampling-based Online Learning for Episodic POMDPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10107v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning in POMDPs is known to be significantly harder than in MDPs. In this paper, we consider the online learning problem for episodic POMDPs with unknown transition and observation models. We propose a Posterior Sampling-based reinforcement learning algorithm for POMDPs (PS4POMDPs), which is much simpler and more implementable compared to state-of-the-art optimism-based online learning algorithms for POMDPs. We show that the Bayesian regret of the proposed algorithm scales as the square root of the number of episodes and is polynomial in the other parameters. In a general setting, the regret scales exponentially in the horizon length $H$, and we show that this is inevitable by providing a lower bound. However, when the POMDP is undercomplete and weakly revealing (a common assumption in the recent literature), we establish a polynomial Bayesian regret bound. We finally propose a posterior sampling algorithm for multi-agent POMDPs, and show it too has sublinear regret.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Information Asymmetry in Two-Stage Contracts with Non-Myopic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Stackelberg game in which a principal (she) establishes a two-stage contract with a non-myopic agent (he) whose type is unknown. The contract takes the form of an incentive function mapping the agent's first-stage action to his second-stage incentive. While the first-stage action reveals the agent's type under truthful play, a non-myopic agent could benefit from portraying a false type in the first stage to obtain a larger incentive in the second stage. The challenge is thus for the principal to design the incentive function so as to induce truthful play. We show that this is only possible with a constant, non-reactive incentive functions when the type space is continuous, whereas it can be achieved with reactive functions for discrete types. Additionally, we show that introducing an adjustment mechanism that penalizes inconsistent behavior across both stages allows the principal to design more flexible incentive functions.</description>

      <title>Certifiably Robust Policies for Uncertain Parametric Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven approach for producing policies that are provably robust across unknown stochastic environments. Existing approaches can learn models of a single environment as an interval Markov decision processes (IMDP) and produce a robust policy with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee on its performance. However these are unable to reason about the impact of environmental parameters underlying the uncertainty. We propose a framework based on parametric Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unknown distributions over parameters. We learn and analyse IMDPs for a set of unknown sample environments induced by parameters. The key challenge is then to produce meaningful performance guarantees that combine the two layers of uncertainty: (1) multiple environments induced by parameters with an unknown distribution; (2) unknown induced environments which are approximated by IMDPs. We present a novel approach based on scenario optimisation that yields a single PAC guarantee quantifying the risk level for which a specified performance level can be assured in unseen environments, plus a means to trade-off risk and performance. We implement and evaluate our framework using multiple robust policy generation methods on a range of benchmarks. We show that our approach produces tight bounds on a policy's performance with high confidence.</description>

Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown that theoretical consistency with topological conjugacy can be maintained when restricting the search for optimal transformations between systems to the unitary group. Therefore the pseudometrics are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugacy Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible optimal solutions given just two Pareto points. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problem and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified mad-made (including bioinspired) approaches. The benefits of considering operator and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism is demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.</description>

      <title>Design Space Exploration of Embedded SoC Architectures for Real-Time Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empowering resource-limited robots to execute computationally intensive tasks such as locomotion and manipulation is challenging. This project provides a comprehensive design space exploration to determine optimal hardware computation architectures suitable for model-based control algorithms. We profile and optimize representative architectural designs across general-purpose scalar, vector processors, and specialized accelerators. Specifically, we compare CPUs, vector machines, and domain-specialized accelerators with kernel-level benchmarks and end-to-end representative robotic workloads. Our exploration provides a quantitative performance, area, and utilization comparison and analyzes the trade-offs between these representative distinct architectural designs. We demonstrate that architectural modifications, software, and system optimization can alleviate bottlenecks and enhance utilization. Finally, we propose a code generation flow to simplify the engineering work for mapping robotic workloads to specialized architectures.</description>
