      <title>A Short Introduction to Basic Principles of Quantum Navigation Based-on Rb Cold Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to advances in cold atom interferometry, laser spectroscopy it is possible to achieve more precise accelerometers and gyroscopes which never occurs in mechanical- and optical-based sensors. Because of the inherent and independent characteristics of atomic levels which are too sensitive respect to the external changes, a self-calibrated navigation system with no satellite can be achieved. Here, in this paper we very shortly review the basic principles of inertia cold atom navigation sensor.</description>

      <title>Slow measurement-only dynamics of entanglement in Pauli subsystem codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-unitary dynamics of a class of quantum circuits based on stochastically measuring check operators of subsystem quantum error-correcting codes, such as the Bacon-Shor code and its various generalizations. Our focus is on how properties of the underlying code are imprinted onto the measurement-only dynamics. We find that in a large class of codes with nonlocal stabilizer generators, at late times there is generically a nonlocal contribution to the subsystem entanglement entropy which scales with the subsystem size. The nonlocal stabilizer generators can also induce slow dynamics, since depending on the rate of competing measurements the associated degrees of freedom can take exponentially long (in system size) to purify (disentangle from the environment when starting from a mixed state) and to scramble (become entangled with the rest of the system when starting from a product state). Concretely, we consider circuits for which the nonlocal stabilizer generators of the underlying subsystem code take the form of subsystem symmetries. We present a systematic study of the phase diagrams and relevant time scales in two and three spatial dimensions for both Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) and non-CSS codes, focusing in particular on the link between slow measurement-only dynamics and the geometry of the subsystem symmetry. A key finding of our work is that slowly purifying or scrambling degrees of freedom appear to emerge only in codes whose subsystem symmetries are nonlocally {\it generated}, a strict subset of those whose symmetries are simply nonlocal. We comment on the link between our results on subsystem codes and the phenomenon of Hilbert-space fragmentation in light of their shared algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>Local and nonlocal stochastic control of quantum chaos: Measurement- and control-induced criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the topology of the phase diagram of a family of quantum models inspired by the classical Bernoulli map under stochastic control. The quantum models inherit a control-induced phase transition from the classical model and also manifest an entanglement phase transition intrinsic to the quantum setting. This measurement-induced phase transition has been shown in various settings to either coincide or split off from the control transition, but a systematic understanding of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the two transitions to coincide in this case has so far been lacking. In this work, we generalize the control map to allow for either local or global control action. While this does not affect the classical aspects of the control transition that is described by a random walk, it significantly influences the quantum dynamics, leading to the universality class of the measurement-induced transition being dependent on the locality of the control operation. In the presence of a global control map, the two transitions coincide and the control-induced phase transition dominates the measurement-induced phase transition. Contrarily, the two transitions split in the presence of the local control map or additional projective measurements and generically take on distinct universality classes. For local control, the measurement-induced phase transition recovers the Haar logarithmic conformal field theory universality class found in feedback-free models. However, for global control, a novel universality class with correlation length exponent $\nu \approx 0.7$ emerges from the interplay of control and projective measurements. This work provides a more refined understanding of the relationship between the control- and measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Operational Framework for a Quantum Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Databases are an essential component of modern computing infrastructures and allow efficient access to data stored persistently. Their structure depends on the type and relationships of the stored data elements and on the access pattern. Extending the concept of databases to the quantum domain is expected to increase both the storage efficiency and the access parallelism through quantum superposition. In addition, quantum databases may be seen as the result of a prior state preparation ready to be used by quantum algorithms when needed. On the other hand, limiting factors exist and include entanglement creation, the impossibility of perfect copying due to the no-cloning theorem, and the impossibility of coherently erasing a quantum state. In this work, we introduce quantum databases within the broader context of data structures using classical and quantum data and indexing. In particular, we are interested in quantum databases practical implementation and usability, focusing on the definition of the basic operations needed to create and manipulate data stored in a superposition state. Specifically, we address the case of quantum indexing in combination with classical data. For this scenario, we define the operations for database preparation, extension, removal of indices, writing, and read-out of data, as well as index permutation. We present their algorithmic implementation and highlight their advantages and limitations. Finally, we introduce steps toward defining the same operations in the more general context of quantum indexing and quantum data.</description>

      <title>Quantum-assisted Rendezvous on Graphs: Explicit Algorithms and Quantum Computer Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum advantage in one-step rendezvous games on simple graphs analytically, numerically, and using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors. Our protocols realise the recently discovered [arXiv:2207.14404] optimal bounds for small cycle graphs and cubic graphs. In the case of cycle graphs, we generalise the protocols to arbitrary graph size. The NISQ processor experiments realise the expected quantum advantage with high accuracy for rendezvous on the complete graph K3. In contrast, for the graph 2K4, formed by two disconnected 4-vertex complete graphs, the performance of the NISQ hardware is sub-classical, consistent with the deeper circuit and known qubit decoherence and gate error rates.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous quantum identity authentication scheme utilizing entanglement swapping with secret key preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconditional security in quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on authenticating the identities of users involved in key distribution. While classical identity authentication schemes were initially utilized in QKD implementations, concerns regarding their vulnerability have prompted the exploration of quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols. In this study, we introduce a new protocol for QIA, derived from the concept of controlled secure direct quantum communication. Our proposed scheme facilitates simultaneous authentication between two users, Alice and Bob, leveraging Bell states with the assistance of a third party, Charlie. Through rigorous security analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed protocol withstands various known attacks, including impersonation, intercept and resend and impersonated fraudulent attacks. Additionally, we establish the relevance of the proposed protocol by comparing it with the existing protocols of similar type.</description>

      <title>Evidence of the quantum-optical nature of high-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation is a light up-conversion process occurring in a strong laser field, leading to coherent bursts of extreme ultrashort broadband radiation [1]. As a new perspective, we propose that ultrafast strong-field electronic or photonic processes such as high-harmonic generation can potentially generate non-classical states of light well before the decoherence of the system occurs [2, 3]. This could address fundamental challenges in quantum technology such as scalability, decoherence or the generation of massively entangled states [4]. Here, we report experimental evidence of the non-classical nature of the harmonic emission in several semiconductors excited by a femtosecond infrared laser. By investigating single- and double beam intensity cross-correlation [5], we measure characteristic, non-classical features in the single photon statistics. We observe two-mode squeezing in the generated harmonic radiation, which depends on the laser intensity that governs the transition from Super-Poissonian to Poissonian photon statistics. The measured violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality realizes a direct test of multipartite entanglement in high-harmonic generation [6]. This result is supported by the theory of multimodal detection and the Hamiltonian from which the effective squeezing modes of the harmonics can be derived [7, 8]. With this work, we show experimentally that high-harmonic generation is a new quantum bosonic platform that intrinsically produces non-classical states of light with unique features such as multipartite broadband entanglement or multimode squeezing. The source operates at room temperature using standard semiconductors and a standard commercial fiber laser, opening new routes for the quantum industry, such as optical quantum computing, communication and imaging.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Nearly Self-Orthogonal Quasi-Twisted Codes and Related Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-twisted codes are used here as the classical ingredients in the so-called Construction X for quantum error-control codes. The construction utilizes nearly self-orthogonal codes to design quantum stabilizer codes. We expand the choices of the inner product to also cover the symplectic and trace-symplectic inner products, in addition to the original Hermitian one. A refined lower bound on the minimum distance of the resulting quantum codes is established and illustrated. We report numerous record breaking quantum codes from our randomized search for inclusion in the updated online database.</description>

      <title>Quantum Self-Propulsion of an Inhomogeneous Object out of Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, we explored how quantum vacuum torque can arise: a body or nanoparticle that is out of thermal equilibrium with its environment experiences a spontaneous torque. But this requires that the body be composed of nonreciprocal material, which seems to necessitate the presence of an external influence, such as a magnetic field. Then the electric polarizability of the particle has a real part that is nonsymmetric. This effect occurs to first order in the polarizability. To that order, no self-propulsive force can arise. Here, we consider second-order effects, and show that spontaneous forces can arise in vacuum, without requiring exotic electromagnetic properties. Thermal nonequilibrium is still necessary, but the electric susceptibility of the body need only be inhomogeneous. We investigate four examples of such a body: a needle composed of distinct halves; a sphere and a ball, each hemisphere being made of a different substance; and a thin slab, each face of which is different. The results found are consistent with previous numerical investigations. Here, we take into account the skin depth of metal surfaces. We also consider the frictional forces that would cause the body to acquire a terminal velocity, which might be observable. More likely to be important is relaxation to thermal equilibrium, which can still lead to a readily observable terminal velocity. A general treatment of such forces on a moving body, expressed in momentum space, is provided, which incorporates both propulsive and frictional forces. The source of the propulsive force is the nonsymmetric pattern of radiation from different parts of the body, the higher reflectivity of the metal portion playing a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Dynamic, Symmetry-Preserving, and Hardware-Adaptable Circuits for Quantum Computing Many-Body States and Correlators of the Anderson Impurity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hardware-reconfigurable ansatz on $N_q$-qubits for the variational preparation of many-body states of the Anderson impurity model (AIM) with $N_{\text{imp}}+N_{\text{bath}}=N_q/2$ sites, which conserves total charge and spin z-component within each variational search subspace. The many-body ground state of the AIM is determined as the minimum over all minima of $O(N_q^2)$ distinct charge-spin sectors. Hamiltonian expectation values are shown to require $\omega(N_q) &lt; N_{\text{meas.}} \leq O(N_{\text{imp}}N_{\text{bath}})$ symmetry-preserving, parallelizable measurement circuits, each amenable to post-selection. To obtain the one-particle impurity Green's function we show how initial Krylov vectors can be computed via mid-circuit measurement and how Lanczos iterations can be computed using the symmetry-preserving ansatz. For a single-impurity Anderson model with a number of bath sites increasing from one to six, we show using numerical emulation that the ease of variational ground-state preparation is suggestive of linear scaling in circuit depth and sub-quartic scaling in optimizer complexity. We therefore expect that, combined with time-dependent methods for Green's function computation, our ansatz provides a useful tool to account for electronic correlations on early fault-tolerant processors. Finally, with a view towards computing real materials properties of interest like magnetic susceptibilities and electron-hole propagators, we provide a straightforward method to compute many-body, time-dependent correlation functions using a combination of time evolution, mid-circuit measurement-conditioned operations, and the Hadamard test.</description>

      <title>Parametrically controlled chiral interface for superconducting quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal microwave routing plays a crucial role for measuring quantum circuits, and allows for realizing cascaded quantum systems for generating and stabilizing entanglement between non-interacting qubits. The most commonly used tools for implementing directionality are ferrite-based circulators. These devices are versatile, but suffer from excess loss, a large footprint, and fixed directionality. For utilizing nonreciprocity in scalable quantum circuits it is desirable to develop efficient integration of low-loss and in-situ controllable directional elements. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a controllable directional interface that may be integrated directly with superconducting qubits. In the presented device, nonreciprocity is realized through a combination of interference and phase-controlled parametric pumping. We have achieved a maximum directionality of around 30\,dB, and the performance of the device is predicted quantitatively from independent calibration measurements. Using the excellent agreement of model and experiment, we predict that the circuit will be useable as a chiral qubit interface with inefficiencies at the one-percent level or below. Our work provides a route toward isolator-free qubit readout schemes and high-fidelity entanglement generation in all-to-all connected networks of superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Ultra-sensitive solid-state organic molecular microwave quantum receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-accuracy microwave sensing is widely demanded in various fields, ranging from cosmology to microwave quantum technology. Quantum receivers based on inorganic solid-state spin systems are promising candidates for such purpose because of the stability and compatibility, but their best sensitivity is currently limited to a few pT/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$. Here, by utilising an enhanced readout scheme with the state-of-the-art solid-state maser technology, we develop a robust microwave quantum receiver functioned by organic molecular spins at ambient conditions. Owing to the maser amplification, the sensitivity of the receiver achieves 6.14 $\pm$ 0.17 fT/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ which exceeds three orders of magnitude than that of the inorganic solid-state quantum receivers. The heterodyne detection without additional local oscillators improves bandwidth of the receiver and allows frequency detection. The scheme can be extended to other solid-state spin systems without complicated control pulses and thus enables practical applications such as electron spin resonance spectroscopy, dark matter searches, and astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamically corrected gates in silicon singlet-triplet spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation requires low physical-qubit gate errors. Many approaches exist to reduce gate errors, including both hardware- and control-optimization strategies. Dynamically corrected gates are designed to cancel specific errors and offer the potential for high-fidelity gates, but they have yet to be implemented in singlet-triplet spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots, due in part to the stringent control constraints in these systems. In this work, we experimentally implement dynamically corrected gates designed to mitigate hyperfine noise in a singlet-triplet qubit realized in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot. The corrected gates reduce infidelities by about a factor of three, resulting in gate fidelities above 0.99 for both identity and Hadamard gates. The gate performances depend sensitively on pulse distortions, and their specific performance reveals an unexpected distortion in our experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Provably Quantum-Secure Microgrids through Enhanced Quantum Distributed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed control of multi-inverter microgrids has attracted considerable attention as it can achieve the combined goals of flexible plug-and-play architecture guaranteeing frequency and voltage regulation while preserving power sharing among nonidentical distributed energy resources (DERs). However, it turns out that cybersecurity has emerged as a serious concern in distributed control schemes. Inspired by quantum communication developments and their security advantages, this paper devises a scalable quantum distributed controller that can guarantee synchronization, and power sharing among DERs. The key innovation lies in the fact that the new quantum distributed scheme allows for exchanging secret information directly through quantum channels among the participating DERs, making microgrids inherently cybersecure. Case studies on two ac and dc microgrids verify the efficacy of the new quantum distributed control strategy.</description>

      <title>Parameterization and optimizability of pulse-level VQEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs), trial states are prepared by applying series of parameterized gates to a reference state, with the gate parameters being varied to minimize the energy of the target system. Recognizing that the gates are intermediates which are ultimately compiled into a set of control pulses to be applied to each qubit in the lab, the recently proposed ctrl-VQE algorithm takes the amplitudes, frequencies, and phases of the pulse as the variational parameters used to minimize the molecular energy. In this work, we explore how all three degrees of freedom interrelate with one another. To this end, we consider several distinct strategies to parameterize the control pulses, assessing each one through numerical simulations of a transmon-like device. For each parameterization, we contrast the pulse duration required to prepare a good ansatz, and the difficulty to optimize that ansatz from a well-defined initial state. We deduce several guiding heuristics to implement practical ctrl-VQE in hardware, which we anticipate will generalize for generic device architectures.</description>

      <title>Adaptive measurement strategy for noisy quantum amplitude estimation with variational quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum computation, amplitude estimation is a fundamental subroutine that is utilized in various quantum algorithms. A general important task of such estimation problems is to characterize the estimation lower bound, which is referred to as quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB), and to construct an optimal estimator that achieves QCRB. This paper studies the amplitude estimation in the presence of depolarizing noise with unknown intensity. The main difficulty in this problem is that the optimal measurement depends on both the unknown quantum state and the amplitude we aim to estimate. To deal with these issues, we utilize the variational quantum circuits to approximate the (unknown) optimal measurement basis combined with the 2-step adaptive estimation strategy which was proposed in the quantum estimation theory.We numerically show that the proposed method can nearly attain the QCRB.</description>

      <title>Detecting Errors in a Quantum Network with Pauli Checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the quantum error detection scheme Pauli check sandwiching (PCS) to quantum networks by turning it into a distributed multiparty protocol. PCS is a distance 1 code and requires less resource overhead than standard quantum error correction and detection methods. We provide analytical equations for the final fidelity and postselection rate. We also introduce a recursive version of PCS for entanglement purification that only scales polynomially in the resources required as a function of the number of recursions. The recursive PCS scheme generates a family of distance 2 quantum codes. Our analytical results are benchmarked against BBPSSW in comparable scenarios. We also perform simulations with noisy gates for entanglement swapping and attain substantial fidelity improvements. Lastly, we discuss various setups and graph state properties of PCS.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking bosonic modes for quantum information with randomized displacements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic modes are prevalent in all aspects of quantum information processing. However, existing tools for characterizing the quality, stability, and noise properties of bosonic modes are limited, especially in a driven setting. Here, we propose, demonstrate, and analyze a bosonic randomized benchmarking (BRB) protocol that uses randomized displacements of the bosonic modes in phase space to determine their quality. We investigate the impact of common analytic error models, such as heating and dephasing, on the distribution of outcomes over randomized displacement trajectories in phase space. We show that analyzing the distinctive behavior of the mean and variance of this distribution - describable as a gamma distribution - enables identification of error processes, and quantitative extraction of error rates and correlations using a minimal number of measurements. We experimentally validate the analytical models by injecting engineered noise into the motional mode of a trapped ion system and performing the bosonic randomized benchmarking protocol, showing good agreement between experiment and theory. Finally, we investigate the intrinsic error properties in our system, identifying the presence of highly correlated dephasing noise as the dominant process.</description>

      <title>Strongest nonlocal sets with minimum cardinality in tripartite systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong nonlocality, proposed by Halder {\it et al}. [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.040403}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{122}, 040403 (2019)}], is a stronger manifestation than quantum nonlocality. Subsequently, Shi {\it et al}. presented the concept of the strongest nonlocality [\href{https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2022-01-05-619}{Quantum \textbf{6}, 619 (2022)}].
  Recently, Li and Wang [\href{https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2023-09-07-1101}{Quantum \textbf{7}, 1101 (2023)}] posed the conjecture about a lower bound to the cardinality of the strongest nonlocal set $\mathcal{S}$ in $\otimes _{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{C}^{d_i}$, i.e., $|\mathcal{S}|\leq \max_{i}\{\prod_{j=1}^{n}d_j/d_i+1\}$. In this work, we construct the strongest nonlocal set of size $d^2+1$ in $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$. Furthermore, we obtain the strongest nonlocal set of size $d_{2}d_{3}+1$ in $\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_2}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_3}$. Our construction reaches the lower bound, which provides an affirmative solution to Li and Wang's conjecture. In particular, the strongest nonlocal sets we present here contain the least number of orthogonal states among the available results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral collocation method (SCM) exhibits a clear superiority in solving ordinary and partial differential equations compared to conventional techniques, such as finite difference and finite element methods. This makes SCM a powerful tool for addressing the Schr\"odinger-like equations with boundary conditions in physics. However, the Chebyshev differential matrix (CDM), commonly used in SCM to replace the differential operator, is not Hermitian but pseudo-Hermitian. This non-Hermiticity subtly affects the pseudospectra and leads to a loss of completeness in the eigenstates. Consequently, several issues arise with these eigenstates. In this paper, we revisit the non-Hermitian Liouville quantum mechanics by emphasizing the pseudo-Hermiticity of the CDM and explore its expanded models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spectral instability can be influenced by the compactification parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using topology optimization, we inverse-design nanophotonic cavities enabling the preparation of pure states of pairs and triples of quantum emitters. Our devices involve moderate values of the dielectric constant, operate under continuous laser driving, and yield fidelities to the target (Bell and W) states approaching unity for distant qubits (several natural wavelengths apart). In the fidelity optimization procedure, our algorithm generates entanglement by maximizing the dissipative coupling between the emitters, which allows the formation of multipartite pure steady states in the driven-dissipative dynamics of the system. Our findings open the way towards the efficient and fast preparation of multiqubit quantum states with engineered features, with potential applications for nonclassical light generation, quantum simulation, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a measurement-cost efficient implementation of Strongly-Contracted $N$-Electron Valence Perturbation Theory (SC-NEVPT2) for use on near-term quantum devices. At the heart of our algorithm we exploit the properties of adaptive Informationally Complete positive operator valued measures (IC-POVMs) to recycle the measurement outcomes from a ground state energy estimation on a quantum device to reconstruct the matrix elements of the three- and four-body reduced density matrices for use in a subsequent CPU-driven NEVPT2 calculation. The proposed scheme is capable of producing results in good agreement with corresponding conventional NEVPT2 simulations, while significantly reducing the cost of quantum measurements and allowing for embarrassingly parallel estimations of higher-order RDMs in classical post-processing. Our scheme shows favourable scaling of the total number of shots with respect to system size. This paves the way for routine inclusion of dynamic electron correlation effects in hybrid quantum-classical computing pipelines.</description>

      <title>Towards Relational Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a research program aimed at establishing relational foundations for relativistic quantum physics. Although the formalism is still under development, we believe it has matured enough to be shared with the broader scientific community. Our approach seeks to integrate Quantum Field Theory on curved backgrounds and scenarios with indefinite causality. Building on concepts from the operational approach to Quantum Reference Frames, we extend these ideas significantly. Specifically, we initiate the development of a general integration theory for operator-valued functions (quantum fields) with respect to positive operator-valued measures (quantum frames). This allows us to define quantum frames within the context of arbitrary principal bundles, replacing group structures. By considering Lorentz principal bundles, we enable a relational treatment of quantum fields on arbitrarily curved spacetimes. A~form of~indefinite spatiotemporality arises from quantum states in the context of frame bundles. This offers novel perspectives on the problem of reconciling principles of generally relativistic and quantum physics and on modelling gravitational fields sourced by quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversion between different types of entangled states is an interesting problem in quantum mechanics. But research on the conversion between Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) state in atomic system is absent. In this paper, we propose a scheme to realize the interconversion (one-step) between GHZ state and KLM state with Rydberg atoms. By utilizing Rydberg-mediated interactions, we simplify the system. By combining Lie-transform-based pulse design, the evolution path is built up to realize interconversion of GHZ state and KLM state. The numerical simulation result shows that the present scheme is robust against decoherence and operational imperfection, the analysis shows that the scheme is feasible with current experimental technology.</description>

      <title>Creation and manipulation of Schr\"odinger cat states of a nuclear spin qudit in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum systems are a valuable resource for quantum information processing. They can be used to encode error-correctable logical qubits, for instance in continuous-variable states of oscillators such as microwave cavities or the motional modes of trapped ions. Powerful encodings include 'Schr\"odinger cat' states, superpositions of widely displaced coherent states, which also embody the challenge of quantum effects at the large scale. Alternatively, recent proposals suggest encoding logical qubits in high-spin atomic nuclei, which can host hardware-efficient versions of continuous-variable codes on a finite-dimensional system. Here we demonstrate the creation and manipulation of Schr\"odinger cat states using the spin-7/2 nucleus of a single antimony ($^{123}$Sb) atom, embedded and operated within a silicon nanoelectronic device. We use a coherent multi-frequency control scheme to produce spin rotations that preserve the SU(2) symmetry of the qudit, and constitute logical Pauli operations for logical qubits encoded in the Schr\"odinger cat states. The Wigner function of the cat states exhibits parity oscillations with a contrast up to 0.982(5), and state fidelities up to 0.913(2). These results demonstrate high-fidelity preparation of nonclassical resource states and logical control in a single atomic-scale object, opening up applications in quantum information processing and quantum error correction within a scalable, manufacturable semiconductor platform.</description>

      <title>Error Crafting in Probabilistic Quantum Gate Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the early stage of fault-tolerant quantum computing, it is envisioned that the gate synthesis of a general unitary gate into universal gate sets yields error whose magnitude is comparable with the noise inherent in the gates themselves. While it is known that the use of probabilistic synthesis already suppresses such coherent errors quadratically, there is no clear understanding on its remnant error, which hinders us from designing a holistic error countermeasure that is effectively combined with error suppression and mitigation. In this work, we propose that, by exploiting the fact that synthesis error can be characterized completely and efficiently, we can craft the remnant error of probabilistic synthesis such that the error profile satisfies desirable properties. We prove for the case of single-qubit unitary synthesis that, there is a guaranteed way to perform probabilistic synthesis such that we can craft the remnant error to be described by Pauli and depolarizing errors, while the conventional twirling cannot be applied in principle. Furthermore, we show a numerical evidence for the synthesis of Pauli rotations based on Clifford+T formalism that, we can craft the remnant error so that it can be eliminated up to {\it cubic} order by combining logical measurement and feedback operations. As a result, Pauli rotation gates can be implemented with T counts of $\log_2(1/\varepsilon)$ on average up to accuracy of $\varepsilon=10^{-9}$, which can be applied to early fault-tolerant quantum computation beyond classical tractability. Our work opens a novel avenue in quantum circuit design and architecture that orchestrates error countermeasures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-squeezed states, also known as generalized squeezed states, are valuable quantum non-Gaussian resources, because they can feature non-classical properties such as large phase-space Wigner negativities. In this work, we introduce a novel shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) method for the fast preparation of multi-squeezed states. In contrast to previous STA methods, which rely on the use of counterdiabatic control to suppress unwanted non-adiabatic effects, our method simplifies the process and accelerates state preparation by selecting an appropriate sampling along a quantum evolution path. We demonstrate the high-fidelity and fast preparation of multi-squeezed states, as well as hybrid entangled states between a bosonic mode and a qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that combining ideas from the fields of quantum invariants and of optimal control can be used to design quantum control of quantum systems without explicit reference to quantum states. The scaling in numerical effort of the resultant approach is given by commutation relations of system operators, and it can be polynomial in the number of subsystems despite the general quantum mechanical exponential scaling of the Hilbert space. As explicit applications, we discuss state preparation and quantum simulation with Hamiltonians including three-body and many-body interactions with spin chains of up to 50 constituents, and the perspective of use for topologically protected quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our recent research on type-I quadrature parity-time (PT) symmetry, utilizing an open twin-beam system, not only enables observing genuine quantum photonic PT symmetry amid phase-sensitive amplification (PSA) and loss in the presence of Langevin noise but also reveals additional classical-to-quantum (C2Q) transitions in quadrature and relative-intensity noise fluctuations. In contrast to the previous setup, our exploration of an alternative system assuming no loss involves a type-II PSA-only scheme. This scheme facilitates dual opposing quadrature PT symmetry, offering a comprehensive and complementary comprehension of C2Q transitions and anti-Hermiticity-enhanced quantum sensing. Furthermore, our investigation into the correlation with the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criteria uncovers previously unexplored connections between PT symmetry and nonclassicality, as well as quantum entanglement within the continuous-variable framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement describes superposition states in multi-dimensional systems, at least two partite, which cannot be factorized and are thus non-separable. Non-separable states exist also in classical theories involving vector spaces. In both cases, it is possible to violate a Bell-like inequality. This has led to controversial discussions, which we resolve by identifying an operational distinction between the classical and quantum cases.</description>

      <title>Synthetic high angular momentum spin dynamics in a microwave oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spins and oscillators are foundational to much of physics and applied sciences. For quantum information, a spin 1/2 exemplifies the most basic unit, a qubit. High angular momentum spins and harmonic oscillators provide multi-level manifolds (e.g., qudits) which have the potential for hardware-efficient protected encodings of quantum information and simulation of many-body quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate a new quantum control protocol that conceptually merges these disparate hardware platforms. Namely, we show how to modify a harmonic oscillator on-demand to implement a continuous range of generators associated to resonant driving of a harmonic qudit, and then specifically design a harmonic multi-level spin degree of freedom. The synthetic spin is verified by demonstration of spin coherent (SU(2)) rotations and comparison to other manifolds like simply-truncated oscillators. Our scheme allows universal control of the qudit, and, for the first time, we use linear, harmonic operations to accomplish four logical gates on a harmonic qudit encoding. Our results show how motion on a closed Hilbert space can be useful for quantum information processing and opens the door to superconducting circuit simulations of higher angular momentum quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Metrological usefulness of entanglement and nonlinear Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central task in quantum metrology is to exploit quantum correlations to outperform classical sensitivity limits. Metrologically useful entanglement is identified when the quantum Fisher information (QFI) exceeds a separability bound for a given parameter-encoding Hamiltonian. However, so far, only results for linear Hamiltonians are well-established. Here, we characterize metrologically useful entanglement for nonlinear Hamiltonians, presenting separability bounds for collective angular momenta. Also, we provide a general expression for entangled states maximizing the QFI, showing that these are not always GHZ-like states. Finally, we compare the metrological usefulness of linear and nonlinear cases, in terms of entanglement detection and random symmetric states.</description>

      <title>Quantum nondemolition measurement operator with spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory for quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements of an atomic ensemble in the presence of spontaneous emission. We derive the master equation that governs the evolution of the ground state of the atoms and the quantum state of light. Solving the master equation exactly without invoking the Holstein-Primakoff approximation and projecting out the quantum state of light, we derive a positive operator-valued measure that describes the QND measurement. We show that at high spontaneous emission conditions, the QND measurement has a unique dominant state to which the measurement collapses. We additionally investigate the behavior of the QND measurement in the limiting case of strong atom-light interactions, where we show that the positive operator valued measure becomes a projection operator. We further analyze the effect of spontaneous emission noise on atomic state preparation. We find that it limits the width of the eigenvalue spectrum available to a quantum state in a linear superposition. This effect leads to state collapse on the dominant state. We generate various non-classical states of the atom by tuning the atom-light interaction strength. We find that non-classical states such as the Schr\"odinger-cat state, whose coherence spans the entire eigenvalue spectrum of the total spin operator $J_z$ for a given spin eigenvalue $J$, lose their coherence because spontaneous emission limits the accessibility of states farther away from the dominant state.</description>

      <title>Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithms for Logistics Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a job shop scheduling problem for an automatized robot in a high-throughput laboratory and a travelling salesperson problem with recently proposed digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO) algorithms. In DCQO, we find the solution of an optimization problem via an adiabatic quantum dynamics, which is accelerated with counterdiabatic protocols. Thereafter, we digitize the global unitary to encode it in a digital quantum computer. For the job-shop scheduling problem, we aim at finding the optimal schedule for a robot executing a number of tasks under specific constraints, such that the total execution time of the process is minimized. For the traveling salesperson problem, the goal is to find the path that covers all cities and is associated with the shortest traveling distance. We consider both hybrid and pure versions of DCQO algorithms and benchmark the performance against digitized quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In comparison to QAOA, the DCQO solution is improved by several orders of magnitude in success probability using the same number of two-qubit gates. Moreover, we experimentally implement our algorithms on superconducting and trapped-ion quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that circuit compression using counterdiabatic protocols is amenable to current NISQ hardware and can solve logistics scheduling problems, where other digital quantum algorithms show insufficient performance.</description>

      <title>Single-Round Proofs of Quantumness from Knowledge Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proof of quantumness is an efficiently verifiable interactive test that an efficient quantum computer can pass, but all efficient classical computers cannot (under some cryptographic assumption). Such protocols play a crucial role in the certification of quantum devices. Existing single-round protocols (like asking the quantum computer to factor a large number) require large quantum circuits, whereas multi-round ones use smaller circuits but require experimentally challenging mid-circuit measurements. As such, current proofs of quantumness are out of reach for near-term devices.
  In this work, we construct efficient single-round proofs of quantumness based on existing knowledge assumptions. While knowledge assumptions have not been previously considered in this context, we show that they provide a natural basis for separating classical and quantum computation. Specifically, we show that multi-round protocols based on Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) or Learning With Errors (LWE) can be "compiled" into single-round protocols using a knowledge-of-exponent assumption or knowledge-of-lattice-point assumption, respectively. We also prove an adaptive hardcore-bit statement for a family of claw-free functions based on DDH, which might be of independent interest.
  Previous approaches to constructing single-round protocols relied on the random oracle model and thus incurred the overhead associated with instantiating the oracle with a cryptographic hash function. In contrast, our protocols have the same resource requirements as their multi-round counterparts without necessitating mid-circuit measurements, making them, arguably, the most efficient single-round proofs of quantumness to date. Our work also helps in understanding the interplay between black-box/white-box reductions and cryptographic assumptions in the design of proofs of quantumness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Kramers-Wannier duality for the transverse-field Ising lattice on a ring. A careful consideration of the ring boundary conditions shows that the duality has to be implemented with a proper treatment of different charge sectors of both the twisted and untwisted Ising and the dual-Ising Hilbert spaces. We construct a superoperator that explicitly maps the Ising operators to the dual-Ising operators. The superoperator naturally acts on the tensor product of the Ising and the dual-Ising Hilbert space. We then show that the relation between our superoperator and the Kramers-Wannier duality operator that maps the Ising Hilbert space to the dual-Ising Hilbert space is naturally provided by quantum operations and the duality can be understood as a quantum operation that we construct. We provide the operator-sum representation for the Kramers-Wannier quantum operations and reproduce the well-known fusion rules. In addition to providing the quantum information perspective on the Kramers-Wannier duality, our explicit protocol will also be useful in implementing the Kramers-Wannier duality on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>The nuclear-spin dark state in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the formation of a nuclear-spin dark state in a gate-defined silicon double quantum dot. The dark state has been predicted to emerge during dynamic nuclear polarization when the electrons in the quantum dot drive the nuclei in the semiconductor into a decoupled state. We show that, as expected, the electron-nuclear coupling rapidly diminishes in the dark state, and that this state depends on the synchronized precession of the nuclear spins. Moreover, the dark state significantly increases the lifetimes of electronic spin states. This nuclear-spin dark state could be used as a quantum memory or as a resource for quantum sensing, and further studies of the dark state may point the way toward increased polarization of nuclear spin ensembles.</description>

      <title>Unbounded entropy production and violent fragmentation in long-range interacting super-Tonks-Girardeau systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas with long-range interactions that decay as $(\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}})$ $(0.5 &lt; \alpha &lt;4.0$). We investigate the system when the interactions are suddenly switched from the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) to the super-Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) limit. We find that relaxation is achieved through a complex intermediate dynamics demonstrated by violent fragmentation and chaotic delocalization. We establish that the sTG gas exhibits classical gaseous characteristics and an asymptotic state associated with unbounded entropy production. The phase diagram shows an exponential boundary between the nonthermal (quantum) gas and the thermal (classical) gas. We show the universality of the dynamics by also presenting results for spinless fermions. Weaker quench protocols give a certain degree of control over the relaxation process and induce some intermediate quasi-prethermal states. Our study showcases the complex relaxation behavior of tunable long-range interacting systems that could be engineered in state-of-the-art experiments, e.g. in trapped ions or Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems and generalizations in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a unified fashion, we establish Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorems and their generalizations in systems with long-range interactions. We show that, for a quantum spin chain, if the interactions decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these theorems hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Moreover, any pure state with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of the theorems through various examples.</description>

      <title>Realizing triality and $p$-ality by lattice twisted gauging in (1+1)d quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the twisted gauging on the (1+1)d lattice and construct various non-local mappings on the lattice operators. To be specific, we define the twisted Gauss law operator and implement the twisted gauging of the finite group on the lattice motivated by the orbifolding procedure in the conformal field theory, which involves the data of non-trivial element in the second cohomology group of the gauge group. We show the twisted gauging is equivalent to the two-step procedure of first applying the SPT entangler and then untwisted gauging. We use the twisted gauging to construct the triality (order 3) and $p$-ality (order $p$) mapping on the $\mathbb{Z}_p\times \mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetric Hamiltonians, where $p$ is a prime. Such novel non-local mappings generalize Kramers-Wannier duality and they preserve the locality of symmetric operators but map charged operators to non-local ones. We further construct quantum process to realize these non-local mappings and analyze the induced mappings on the phase diagrams. For theories that are invariant under these non-local mappings, they admit the corresponding non-invertible symmetries. The non-invertible symmetry will constrain the theory at the multicritical point between the gapped phases. We further give the condition when the non-invertible symmetry can have symmetric gapped phase with a unique ground state.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in $d$-dimensional spin systems exhibiting $SO(3)$ spin rotation and lattice translation symmetries in the presence of interactions decaying as $\sim 1/r^\alpha$ with distance $r$. Two types of Hamiltonians are considered: Type I comprises long-range spin-spin couplings, while Type II features long-range couplings between $SO(3)$ symmetric local operators. For spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems, it is shown that Type I cannot have a unique ground state with a nonzero excitation gap when the interaction decays sufficiently fast, i.e., when $\alpha&gt;\max(3d,4d-2)$. For Type II, the condition becomes $\alpha&gt;\max(3d-1,4d-3)$. In $1d$, this ingappability condition is improved to $\alpha&gt;2$ for Type I and $\alpha&gt;0$ for Type II by examining the energy of a state with a uniform $2\pi$ twist. Notably, in $2d$, a Type II Hamiltonian with van der Waals interaction is subject to the constraint of the theorem.</description>

      <title>Spectral radii for subsets of Hilbert $C^*$-modules and spectral properties of positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notions of joint and outer spectral radii are extended to the setting of Hilbert $C^*$-bimodules. A Rota-Strang type characterisation is proved for the joint spectral radius. In this general setting, an approximation result for the joint spectral radius in terms of the outer spectral radius has been established.
  This work leads to a new proof of the Wielandt-Friedland's formula for the spectral radius of positive maps. Following an idea of J. E. Pascoe, a positive map called the maximal part has been associated to any positive map with non-zero spectral radius, on finite dimensional $C^*$-algebras. This provides a constructive treatment of the Perron-Frobenius theorem. It is seen that the maximal part of a completely positive map has a very simple structure and it is irreducible if and only if the original map is irreducible.
  It is observed that algebras generated by tuples of matrices can be determined and their dimensions can be computed by realizing them as linear span of Choi-Kraus coefficients of some easily computable completely positive maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We ask the question of how angular momentum is conserved in weak interaction processes, beginning with inverse beta decay for massless neutrinos and electrons, in which both the incident neutrino and final electron are in helicity eigenstates with respect, however, to {\em different} directions. To elucidate the problem we recast the final electron state in terms of a spherical Dirac wave. We then generalize these results to massive neutrinos and electrons, and finally examine electron-positron annihilation processes through the same lens. In all these processes, the apparent non-conservation of angular momentum is a result of the quantum measurement process in which the measuring apparatus is not in an initially well-defined quantum state, but is coupled to the outside world; the measuring process, being outside the rules of elementary quantum mechanics, does not allow a satisfactory accounting of the angular momentum transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the process of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transfer from a twisted light beam to an electron in atomic ionization within the first Born approximation. The characteristics of the ejected electron are studied regardless of the detection scheme. We find that the outgoing electron possesses a definite projection of OAM when a single atom is located on the propagation axis of the photon, whereas the size of the electron wave packet is solely determined by the energy of the photon rather than by its transverse coherence length. Shifting the position of the atom yields a finite dispersion of the electron OAM. We also study a more experimentally feasible scenario -- a localized finite-sized atomic target -- and develop representative approaches to describing coherent and incoherent regimes of photoionization.</description>

      <title>Compilation for Dynamically Field-Programmable Qubit Arrays with Efficient and Provably Near-Optimal Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamically field-programmable qubit arrays based on neutral atoms have high fidelity and highly parallel gates for quantum computing. However, it is challenging for compilers to fully leverage the novel flexibility offered by such hardware while respecting its various constraints. In this study, we break down the compilation for this architecture into three tasks: scheduling, placement, and routing. We formulate these three problems and present efficient solutions to them. Notably, our scheduling based on graph edge coloring is provably near-optimal in terms of two-qubit gate stage count (at most one more than the optimum), the fidelity bottleneck of this platform. As a result, our compiler, Enola, produces higher fidelity results compared to existing works, e.g., 3.7X stage reduction and 5.9X fidelity improvement on the benchmark set used by OLSQ-DPQA, the current state of the art. Additionally, Enola is highly scalable, e.g., within 30 minutes, it can compile circuits with 10,000 qubits, a scale sufficient for the current era of quantum computing. Enola is open source at https://github.com/UCLA-VAST/Enola</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In practical measurements, it is widely recognized that reducing the measurement time leads to decreased accuracy. On the other hand, whether an inherent speed-accuracy trade-off exists as a fundamental physical constraint for quantum measurements is not obvious, and the answer remains unknown. Here, we establish a fundamental speed-accuracy trade-off relation as a consequence of the energy conservation law and the locality. Our trade-off works as a no-go theorem that the zero-error measurement for the operators that are non-commutative with the Hamiltonian cannot be implemented with finite time and applies universally to various existing errors and disturbances defined for quantum measurements. We furthermore apply our methods to quantum computations and provide another speed-accuracy trade-off relation for unitary gate implementations, which works as another no-go theorem that any error-less implementations of quantum computation gates changing energy cannot be implemented with finite time, and a speed-disturbance trade-off for general quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Faster and Better Quantum Software Testing through Specification Reduction and Projective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises polynomial and exponential speedups in many domains, such as unstructured search and prime number factoring. However, quantum programs yield probabilistic outputs from exponentially growing distributions and are vulnerable to quantum-specific faults. Existing quantum software testing (QST) approaches treat quantum superpositions as classical distributions. This leads to two major limitations when applied to quantum programs: (1) an exponentially growing sample space distribution and (2) failing to detect quantum-specific faults such as phase flips. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a QST approach, which applies a reduction algorithm to a quantum program specification. The reduced specification alleviates the limitations (1) by enabling faster sampling through quantum parallelism and (2) by performing projective measurements in the mixed Hadamard basis. Our evaluation of 143 quantum programs across four categories demonstrates significant improvements in test runtimes and fault detection with our reduction approach. Average test runtimes improved from 169.9s to 11.8s, with notable enhancements in programs with large circuit depths (383.1s to 33.4s) and large program specifications (464.8s to 7.7s). Furthermore, our approach increases mutation scores from 54.5% to 74.7%, effectively detecting phase flip faults that non-reduced specifications miss. These results underline our approach's importance to improve QST efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: Several approaches to quantum gravity lead to nonlocal modifications of fields' dynamics. This, in turn, can give rise to nonlocal modifications of quantum mechanics at non-relativistic energies. Here, we analyze the nonlocal Schr\"{o}dinger evolution of a quantum harmonic oscillator in one such scenario, where the problem can be addressed without the use of perturbation theory. We demonstrate that although deviations from standard quantum predictions occur at low occupation numbers, where they could potentially be detected or constrained by high-precision experiments, the classical limits of quantum probability densities and free energy remain unaffected up to energies comparable with the nonlocality scale. These results provide an example of nonlocal quantum dynamics compatible with classical predictions, suggesting massive quantum objects as a promising avenue for testing some phenomenological aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Super-diffusive transport in two-dimensional Fermionic wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional model of a Fermionic wire in contact with reservoirs along its two opposite edges. With the reservoirs biased around a Fermi level, $E$, we study the scaling of the conductance of the wire with its length, $L$ as the width of the wire $W\rightarrow\infty$. The wire is disordered along the direction of the transport so the conductance is expected to exponentially decay with the length of the wire. However, we show that our model shows a super-diffusive scaling ($1/L^{1/2}$) of the conductance within $|E|&lt;E_c$. This behavior is attributed to the presence of eigenstates of diverging localization length as $W\rightarrow\infty$. At $|E|=E_c$, the conductance behavior is sensitive to the disorder and scales sub-diffusively as $1/L^{3/2}$, and $1/L^{5/2}$ for zero and nonzero expectation value of the disorder. Furthermore, at this Fermi level and at certain points in the parameter space of the wire, the behavior of the conductance is also sensitive to the sign of the expectation value of the disorder. At these points we find $1/L^{7/4}$ for zero expectation value of the disorder and $1/L$, $1/L^{3}$ for different signs of the expectation value of the disorder.</description>

      <title>Electric-magnetic duality and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry enriched Abelian lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kitaev's quantum double model is a lattice gauge theoretic realization of Dijkgraaf-Witten topological quantum field theory (TQFT), its topologically protected ground state space has broad applications for topological quantum computation and topological quantum memory. We investigate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry enriched generalization of the model for the cyclic Abelian group in a categorical framework and present an explicit Hamiltonian construction. This model provides a lattice realization of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry enriched topological (SET) phase. We discuss in detail the categorical symmetry of the phase, for which the electric-magnetic (EM) duality symmetry is a special case. The aspects of symmetry defects are investigated using the $G$-crossed unitary braided fusion category (UBFC). By determining the corresponding anyon condensation, the gapped boundaries and boundary-bulk duality are also investigated. Then we carefully construct the explicit lattice realization of EM duality for these SET phases.</description>

      <title>Restoring metrological quantum advantage of measurement precision in noisy scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in presence of a local and uncorrelated dephasing noise, quantum advantage can be obtained in the Fisher information-based lower bound of the minimum uncertainty in estimating parameters of the system Hamiltonian. The quantum advantage refers here to the benefit of initiating with a maximally entangled state instead of a product one. This quantum advantage was known to vanish in the same noisy scenario for a frequency estimation protocol. Restoration of the better precision in frequency estimation with maximally entangled probes can be obtained by incorporating an interaction between the system particles. The interaction examined here is Ising in nature, and is considered with or without a transverse magnetic field. There are instances, e.g. where frequency estimation in presence of a transverse field is considered and quantum advantage is not restored. A quantum advantage can also be obtained while estimating the strength of the introduced magnetic field along the transverse direction, whereas for the instances considered, using uncorrelated probes is better in measuring the coupling parameter of the Ising interaction. We also investigate the dependence of measurement precision on the entanglement content, which is not necessarily maximal, of the initial state. The precision in estimation of coupling constant decreases monotonically with the increase of entanglement content of the initial state, while the same for frequency estimation is independent of the entanglement content of the inputs.</description>

      <title>End-to-end resource analysis for quantum interior point methods and portfolio optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum interior point methods (QIPMs) for second-order cone programming (SOCP), guided by the example use case of portfolio optimization (PO). We provide a complete quantum circuit-level description of the algorithm from problem input to problem output, making several improvements to the implementation of the QIPM. We report the number of logical qubits and the quantity/depth of non-Clifford T-gates needed to run the algorithm, including constant factors. The resource counts we find depend on instance-specific parameters, such as the condition number of certain linear systems within the problem. To determine the size of these parameters, we perform numerical simulations of small PO instances, which lead to concrete resource estimates for the PO use case. Our numerical results do not probe large enough instance sizes to make conclusive statements about the asymptotic scaling of the algorithm. However, already at small instance sizes, our analysis suggests that, due primarily to large constant pre-factors, poorly conditioned linear systems, and a fundamental reliance on costly quantum state tomography, fundamental improvements to the QIPM are required for it to lead to practical quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Quadrature-PT symmetry: Classical-to-quantum transition in noise fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While gain-loss-coupled photonic platforms have achieved significant success in studying classical parity-time (PT) symmetry, they encounter challenges in demonstrating pure quantum effects due to incompatible operator transformations and Langevin noise. Here, we present compelling evidence that a non-Hermitian (NH) twin-beam system, undergoing phase-sensitive amplification (PSA) and balanced loss, not only enables observing the usual eigenvalue-associated PT phase transition but also exhibits distinctive features absent in classical NH or Hermitian quantum scenarios, encompassing quadrature PT symmetry, anomalous loss-induced quadrature squeezing, and dynamical and stationary classical-to-quantum transitions in noise fluctuations. Furthermore, our proposed bipartite open system promises optimal sensing, showcasing an improved signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity, constrained by quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound or Fisher information. These findings deepen the comprehension of authentic quantum optical PT symmetry involving both gain and loss, addressing contentious issues and illuminating new facets of the subject.</description>

      <title>Quantum Public-Key Encryption with Tamper-Resilient Public Keys from One-Way Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct quantum public-key encryption from one-way functions. In our construction, public keys are quantum, but ciphertexts are classical. Quantum public-key encryption from one-way functions (or weaker primitives such as pseudorandom function-like states) are also proposed in some recent works [Morimae-Yamakawa, eprint:2022/1336; Coladangelo, eprint:2023/282; Barooti-Grilo-Malavolta-Sattath-Vu-Walter, eprint:2023/877]. However, they have a huge drawback: they are secure only when quantum public keys can be transmitted to the sender (who runs the encryption algorithm) without being tampered with by the adversary, which seems to require unsatisfactory physical setup assumptions such as secure quantum channels. Our construction is free from such a drawback: it guarantees the secrecy of the encrypted messages even if we assume only unauthenticated quantum channels. Thus, the encryption is done with adversarially tampered quantum public keys. Our construction is the first quantum public-key encryption that achieves the goal of classical public-key encryption, namely, to establish secure communication over insecure channels, based only on one-way functions. Moreover, we show a generic compiler to upgrade security against chosen plaintext attacks (CPA security) into security against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA security) only using one-way functions. As a result, we obtain CCA secure quantum public-key encryption based only on one-way functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single indistinguishable photons at telecom C-band wavelengths are essential for quantum networks and the future quantum internet. However, high-throughput technology for single-photon generation at 1550 nm remained a missing building block to overcome present limitations in quantum communication and information technologies. Here, we demonstrate the high-throughput fabrication of quantum-photonic integrated devices operating at C-band wavelengths based on epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots. Our technique enables the deterministic integration of single pre-selected quantum emitters into microcavities based on circular Bragg gratings. Respective devices feature the triggered generation of single photons with ultra-high purity and record-high photon indistinguishability. Further improvements in yield and coherence properties will pave the way for implementing single-photon non-linear devices and advanced quantum networks at telecom wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Clifford Group and Unitary Designs under Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have generalized the well-known statement that the Clifford group is a unitary 3-design into symmetric cases by extending the notion of unitary design. Concretely, we have proven that a symmetric Clifford group is a symmetric unitary 3-design if and only if the symmetry constraint is described by some Pauli subgroup. We have also found a complete and unique construction method of symmetric Clifford groups with simple quantum gates for Pauli symmetries. For the overall understanding, we have also considered physically relevant U(1) and SU(2) symmetry constraints, which cannot be described by a Pauli subgroup, and have proven that the symmetric Clifford group is a symmetric unitary 1-design but not a 2-design under those symmetries. Our findings are numerically verified by computing the frame potentials, which measure the difference in randomness between the uniform ensemble on the symmetric group of interest and the symmetric unitary group. This work will open a new perspective into quantum information processing such as randomized benchmarking, and give a deep understanding to many-body systems such as monitored random circuits.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Approximation Scheme for k-Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a quantum approximation scheme (i.e., $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$) for the classical $k$-means clustering problem in the QRAM model with a running time that has only polylogarithmic dependence on the number of data points. More specifically, given a dataset $V$ with $N$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ stored in QRAM data structure, our quantum algorithm runs in time $\tilde{O} \left( 2^{\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\varepsilon})} \eta^2 d\right)$ and with high probability outputs a set $C$ of $k$ centers such that $cost(V, C) \leq (1+\varepsilon) \cdot cost(V, C_{OPT})$. Here $C_{OPT}$ denotes the optimal $k$-centers, $cost(.)$ denotes the standard $k$-means cost function (i.e., the sum of the squared distance of points to the closest center), and $\eta$ is the aspect ratio (i.e., the ratio of maximum distance to minimum distance). This is the first quantum algorithm with a polylogarithmic running time that gives a provable approximation guarantee of $(1+\varepsilon)$ for the $k$-means problem. Also, unlike previous works on unsupervised learning, our quantum algorithm does not require quantum linear algebra subroutines and has a running time independent of parameters (e.g., condition number) that appear in such procedures.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviours of non-stabilizerness in quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness - commonly known as magic - measures the extent to which a quantum state deviates from stabilizer states and is a fundamental resource for achieving universal quantum computation. In this work, we investigate the behavior of non-stabilizerness around criticality in quantum spin chains. To quantify non-stabilizerness, we employ a monotone called mana, based on the negativity of the discrete Wigner function. This measure captures non-stabilizerness for both pure and mixed states. We introduce R\'enyi generalizations of mana, which are also measures of non-stabilizerness for pure states, and utilize it to compute mana in large quantum systems. We consider the three-state Potts model and its non-integrable extension and we provide strong evidence that the mutual mana exhibits universal logarithmic scaling with distance in conformal field theory, as is the case for entanglement.</description>

      <title>Device-independent quantum key distribution with arbitrarily small nonlocality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) allows two users to set up shared cryptographic key without the need to trust the quantum devices used. Doing so requires nonlocal correlations between the users. However, in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 050503 (2021)] it was shown that for known protocols nonlocality is not always sufficient, leading to the question of whether there is a fundamental lower bound on the minimum amount of nonlocality needed for any DIQKD implementation. Here we show that no such bound exists, giving schemes that achieve key with correlations arbitrarily close to the local set. Furthermore, some of our constructions achieve the maximum of 1 bit of key per pair of entangled qubits. We achieve this by studying a family of Bell-inequalities that constitute all self-tests of the maximally entangled state with a single linear Bell expression. Within this family there exist non-local correlations with the property that one pair of inputs yield outputs arbitrarily close to perfect key. Such correlations exist for a range of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) values, including those arbitrarily close to the classical bound. Finally, we show the existence of quantum correlations that can generate both perfect key and perfect randomness simultaneously, whilst also displaying arbitrarily small CHSH violation; this opens up the possibility of a new class of cryptographic protocol.</description>

      <title>Des-q: a quantum algorithm to provably speedup retraining of decision trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09976v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision trees are widely adopted machine learning models due to their simplicity and explainability. However, as training data size grows, standard methods become increasingly slow, scaling polynomially with the number of training examples. In this work, we introduce Des-q, a novel quantum algorithm to construct and retrain decision trees for regression and binary classification tasks. Assuming the data stream produces small, periodic increments of new training examples, Des-q significantly reduces the tree retraining time, achieving a logarithmic complexity in the combined total number of old and new examples, even accounting for the time needed to load the new samples into quantum-accessible memory. Our approach to grow the tree from any given node involves performing piecewise linear splits to generate multiple hyperplanes, thus partitioning the input feature space into distinct regions. To determine the suitable anchor points for these splits, we develop an efficient quantum-supervised clustering method, building upon the q-means algorithm introduced by Kerenidis \etal We benchmark the simulated version of Des-q against the state-of-the-art classical methods on multiple data sets and observe that our algorithm exhibits similar performance to the state-of-the-art decision trees while significantly speeding up the periodic tree retraining.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accessible source for the production of entangled x-rays is crucial for the field of high-energy quantum optics. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the entanglement and polarisation of the two photons emitted by an electron in an intense laser wave (nonlinear double Compton scattering), by working within the framework of strong-field QED. By identifying a contribution to the emission probability stemming from the electron being on-shell or off-shell between the two photons emissions, we show that the entangled photons are generated via the off-shell contribution, which can be distinguished from those emitted via the on-shell channel by a polarisation measurement. We also provide an intuitive picture to explain the entanglement and propose an experiment to produce and isolate entangled x-rays.</description>

      <title>Entanglement hierarchies in multipartite scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the hierarchical structure of the $n$-partite quantum states. We present a whole set of hierarchical quantifications as a method of characterizing quantum states, which go beyond genuine multipartite entanglement measures and allow for fine identification among distinct entanglement contributions. This kind of quantifications, termed $k$-GM concurrence, can unambiguously classify entangled states into $(n-1)$ distinct classes from the perspective of $k$-nonseparability with $k$ running from $n$ down to 2, and comply with the axiomatic conditions of an entanglement measure. Compared to $k$-ME concurrence [\href{https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.062323} {Phys. Rev. A \textbf{86}, 062323 (2012)}], the hierarchical measures proposed by us embody advantages in distinguishing same class entangled state and measuring continuity. In addition, we establish the relation between $k$-ME concurrence and $k$-GM concurrence, and further derive a strong lower bound on the $k$-GM concurrence by exploiting the permutationally invariant part of a quantum state. Furthermore, we parametrize $k$-GM concurrence to obtain two more general and complete categories of quantifications, $q$-$k$-GM concurrence $(q&gt;1)$ and $\alpha$-$k$-GM concurrence $(0\leq\alpha&lt;1)$, which obey the properties enjoyed by $k$-GM concurrence as well. In particular, $\alpha$-$2$-GM concurrence $(0&lt;\alpha&lt;1)$ determines that the GHZ state and the $W$ state belong to the same hierarchy, and it is proven in detail satisfying the requirement that the GHZ state is more entangled than the $W$ state in multiqubit systems.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity magnomechanics exploiting chiral cavity-magnon coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to achieve nonreciprocal quantum entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical system by exploiting the chiral cavity-magnon coupling. The system consists of a magnon mode, a mechanical vibration mode, and two degenerate counter-propagating microwave cavity modes in a torus-shaped cavity. We show that nonreciprocal stationary microwave-magnon and -phonon bipartite entanglements and photon-magnon-phonon tripartite entanglement can be achieved by respectively driving different circulating cavity modes that hold a chiral coupling to the magnon mode. The nonreciprocal entanglements are shown to be robust against various experimental imperfections. We specifically show how such nonreciprocal entanglement can realize the channel multiplexing quantum teleportation. The work may find promising applications of the cavity magnomechanical systems in noise-tolerant quantum processing, channel multiplexing quantum teleportation, and chiral magnonic quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithms for the Allocation of Resources in a Cloud/Edge Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern Cloud/Edge architectures need to orchestrate multiple layers of heterogeneous computing nodes, including pervasive sensors/actuators, distributed Edge/Fog nodes, centralized data centers and quantum devices. The optimal assignment and scheduling of computation on the different nodes is a very difficult problem, with NP-hard complexity. In this paper, we explore the possibility of solving this problem with Variational Quantum Algorithms, which can become a viable alternative to classical algorithms in the near future. In particular, we compare the performances, in terms of success probability, of two algorithms, i.e., Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). The simulation experiments, performed for a set of simple problems, %CM230124 that involve a Cloud and two Edge nodes, show that the VQE algorithm ensures better performances when it is equipped with appropriate circuit \textit{ansatzes} that are able to restrict the search space. Moreover, experiments executed on real quantum hardware show that the execution time, when increasing the size of the problem, grows much more slowly than the trend obtained with classical computation, which is known to be exponential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the state of an unknown quantum sequence without error. The elements of the given sequence are drawn with equal probability from a known set of linearly independent pure quantum states with the property that their mutual inner products are all real and equal. This problem can be posed as an instance of unambiguous state discrimination where the states correspond to that of all possible sequences having the same length as the given one. We calculate the optimum probability by solving the optimality conditions of a semidefinite program. The optimum value is achievable by measuring individual members of the sequence, and no collective measurement is necessary.</description>

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently gained attention as a solid state host of quantum emitters. However, hBN emitters reported to date lack the properties needed for their deployment in scalable quantum technologies. Here we employ spectral hole burning spectroscopy and resonant polarization measurements to observe nearly-coherent hBN quantum emitters, both as singles and in ensembles, with three discrete polarization axes indicative of a C2v symmetry defect. Our results constitute an important milestone towards the implementation of hBN quantum emitters in integrated quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Two-mode Squeezing in Floquet Engineered Power-law Interacting Spin Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum spin 1/2 XXZ model confined in a two-dimensional bi-layer system, with couplings mediated by inverse power-law interactions, falling off with distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$, and spatio-temporal control of the spins enabled via local fields. An initial state of spins with opposite magnetization in the two layers is dynamically unstable resulting in exponential generation of correlated pairs of excitations. We find that scalable generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing between the layers can generically be achieved in powerlaw models. We further demonstrate that spatially-temporally engineered interactions allow to significantly increase the generated entanglement and in fact achieve Heisenberg limited scaling. This work is relevant to a wide variety of experimental atomic, molecular, and optical platforms, which realize powerlaw spin models, and demonstrates the advantage of spatio-temporal control to maximize the generation of metrologically useful entanglement, with potential applications in quantum-enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Efficient Joint Measurement Strategy for Estimating Fermionic Observables and Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple scheme to estimate fermionic observables and Hamiltonians relevant in quantum chemistry and correlated fermionic systems. Our approach is based on implementing a measurement that jointly measures noisy versions of any product of two or four Majorana operators in an $N$ mode fermionic system. To realize our measurement we use: (i) a randomization over a set of unitaries that realize products of Majorana fermion operators; (ii) a unitary, sampled at random from a constant-size set of suitably chosen fermionic Gaussian unitaries; (iii) a measurement of fermionic occupation numbers; (iv) suitable post-processing. Our scheme can estimate expectation values of all quadratic and quartic Majorana monomials to $\epsilon$ precision using $\mathcal{O}(N \log(N)/\epsilon^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log(N)/\epsilon^2)$ measurement rounds respectively, matching the performance offered by fermionic shadow tomography. In certain settings, such as a rectangular lattice of qubits which encode an $N$ mode fermionic system via the Jordan-Wigner transformation, our scheme can be implemented in circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(N^{1/2})$ with $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ two-qubit gates, offering an improvement over fermionic and matchgate classical shadows that require depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ two-qubit gates. By benchmarking our method on exemplary molecular Hamiltonians and observing performances comparable to fermionic classical shadows, we demonstrate a novel, competitive alternative to existing strategies.</description>

      <title>Performance Upper Bound of Grover-Mixer Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) represents a branch of quantum algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems. A specific variant, the Grover-Mixer Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (GM-QAOA), ensures uniform amplitude across states that share equivalent objective values. This property makes the algorithm independent of the problem structure, focusing instead on the distribution of objective values within the problem. In this work, we prove the probability upper bound for measuring a computational basis state from a GM-QAOA circuit with a given depth, which is a critical factor in QAOA cost. Using this, we derive the upper bounds for the probability of sampling an optimal solution, and for the approximation ratio of maximum optimization problems, both dependent on the objective value distribution. Through numerical analysis, we link the distribution to the problem size and build the regression models that relate the problem size, QAOA depth, and performance upper bound. Our results suggest that the GM-QAOA provides a quadratic enhancement in sampling probability and requires circuit depth that scales exponentially with problem size to maintain consistent performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropic dynamics of a multiqubit cavity quantum electrodynamics system is simulated and various aspects of entropy are explored. In the modified version of the Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard model, atoms are held in optical cavities through optical tweezers and can jump between different cavities through the tunneling effect. The interaction of atom with the cavity results in different electronic transitions and the creation and annihilation of corresponding types of photon. Electron spin and the Pauli exclusion principle are considered. Formation and break of covalent bond and creation and annihilation of phonon are also introduced into the model. The system is bipartite. The effect of all kinds of interactions on entropy is studied. And the von Neumann entropy of different subsystems is compared. The results show that the entropic dynamics can be controlled by selectively choosing system parameters, and the entropy values of different subsystems satisfy certain inequality relationships.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing long-range entangled states poses significant challenges for near-term quantum devices. It is known that measurement and feedback (MF) can aid this task by allowing the preparation of certain paradigmatic long-range entangled states with only constant circuit depth. Here we systematically explore the structure of states that can be prepared using constant-depth local circuits and a single MF round. Using the framework of tensor networks, the preparability under MF translates to tensor symmetries. We detail the structure of matrix-product states (MPS) and projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) that can be prepared using MF, revealing the coexistence of Clifford-like properties and magic. Furthermore, we fully parameterize states exhibiting MF symmetries akin to the symmetry-protected topological order in one dimension and the topological order in two dimensions, and we discuss their characteristics. Finally, we discuss the analogous implementation of operators via MF, providing a structural theorem that connects to the well-known Clifford teleportation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of inertial quantities is essential in geophysics, geodesy, fundamental physics and navigation. For instance, inertial navigation systems require stable inertial sensors to compute the position and attitude of the carrier. Here, we present the first hybridized cold-atom inertial sensor based on matter wave interferometry where the atomic measurements are used to correct the drift and bias of both an accelerometer and a gyroscope at the same time. We achieve respective bias stabilities of $7 \times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ rad/s after two days of integration, corresponding to a 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the force-balanced accelerometer and Coriolis vibrating gyroscope operated alone. The instrument has been operated under up to 100-times the Earth rotation rate. Compared to state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our architecture make it easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway towards autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the radiative processes involving two entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors that are moving on circular trajectories in $(2+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. We assume that the detectors are coupled to a massless, quantum scalar field, and calculate the transition probability rates of the detectors in the Minkowski vacuum as well as in a thermal bath. We also evaluate the transition probability rates of the detectors when they are switched on for a finite time interval with the aid of a Gaussian switching function. We begin by examining the response of a single detector before we go on to consider the case of two entangled detectors. As we shall see, working in $(2+1)$ spacetime dimensions makes the computations of the transition probability rates of the detectors relatively simpler. We find that the cross transition probability rates of the two entangled detectors can be comparable to the auto transition probability rates of the individual detectors. We discuss specific characteristics of the response of the entangled detectors for different values of the parameters involved and highlight the effects of the thermal bath as well as switching on the detector for a finite time interval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling of ground state entanglement entropy of various free fermionic models on one dimensional lattices, where the hopping and pairing terms decay as a power law. We seek to understand the scaling of entanglement entropy in generic models as the exponent of the power law $\alpha$ is varied. We ask if there exists a common $\alpha_{c}$ across different systems governing the transition to area law scaling found in local systems. We explore several examples numerically and argue that when applicable, the scaling of entanglement entropy in long-range models is constrained by predictions from the low-energy theory. In contrast, disordered models and models without a continuum limit show fractal scaling of entanglement approaching volume-law behavior as $\alpha$ approaches zero. These general features are expected to persist on turning on interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising field with the potential to revolutionize various domains by harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics. As quantum hardware and algorithms continue to advance, developing high-quality quantum software has become crucial. However, testing quantum programs poses unique challenges due to the distinctive characteristics of quantum systems and the complexity of multi-subroutine programs. This paper addresses the specific testing requirements of multi-subroutine quantum programs. We begin by investigating critical properties by surveying existing quantum libraries and providing insights into the challenges of testing these programs. Building upon this understanding, we focus on testing criteria and techniques based on the whole testing process perspective, spanning from unit testing to integration testing. We delve into various aspects, including IO analysis, quantum relation checking, structural testing, behavior testing, integration of subroutine pairs, and test case generation. We also introduce novel testing principles and criteria to guide the testing process. We conduct comprehensive testing on typical quantum subroutines, including diverse mutants and randomized inputs, to evaluate our proposed approach. The analysis of failures provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of our testing methodology. Additionally, we present case studies on representative multi-subroutine quantum programs, demonstrating the practical application and effectiveness of our proposed testing principles and criteria.</description>

Abstract: Quantum programs exhibit inherent non-deterministic behavior, which poses more significant challenges for error discovery compared to classical programs. While several testing methods have been proposed for quantum programs, they often overlook fundamental questions in black-box testing. In this paper, we bridge this gap by presenting three novel algorithms specifically designed to address the challenges of equivalence, identity, and unitarity checking in black-box testing of quantum programs. We also explore optimization techniques for these algorithms, including specialized versions for equivalence and unitarity checking, and provide valuable insights into parameter selection to maximize performance and effectiveness. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conducted comprehensive experimental evaluations, which demonstrate that our methods can rigorously perform equivalence, identity, and unitarity checking, offering robust support for black-box testing of quantum programs.</description>

Using contact-type potentials as those appeared in pionless effective field theory, I show that it is possible to obtain negative-energy states by sandwiching a next-to-leading order (NLO) interaction with the leading-order (LO) wavefunctions, under the presence of LO resonances or virtual states. However, at least under the framework of time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and Hermitian Hamiltonian, there is an inability to create bound-states with structure similar to those formed by the non-perturbative treatments.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity in saddle-dominated scrambling</title>

Abstract: Recently, the concept of spread complexity, Krylov complexity for states, has been introduced as a measure of the complexity and chaoticity of quantum systems. In this paper, we study the spread complexity of the thermofield double state within \emph{integrable} systems that exhibit saddle-dominated scrambling. Specifically, we focus on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the inverted harmonic oscillator as representative examples of quantum mechanical systems featuring saddle-dominated scrambling. Applying the Lanczos algorithm, our numerical investigation reveals that the spread complexity in these systems exhibits features reminiscent of \emph{chaotic} systems, displaying a distinctive ramp-peak-slope-plateau pattern. Our results indicate that, although spread complexity serves as a valuable probe, accurately diagnosing true quantum chaos generally necessitates additional physical input. We also explore the relationship between spread complexity, the spectral form factor, and the transition probability within the Krylov space. We provide analytical confirmation of our numerical results, validating the Ehrenfest theorem of complexity and identifying a distinct quadratic behavior in the early-time regime of spread complexity.</description>

      <title>Hermitian stochastic methodology for X-ray superfluorescence</title>

Abstract: A recently introduced theoretical framework for modeling the dynamics of X-ray amplified spontaneous emission is based on stochastic sampling of the density matrix of quantum emitters and the radiation field, similarly to other phase-space sampling techniques. While based on first principles and providing valuable theoretical insights, the original stochastic differential equations exhibit divergences and numerical instabilities. Here, we resolve this issue by accounting the stochastic components perturbatively. The refined formalism accurately reproduces the properties of spontaneous emission and proves universally applicable for describing all stages of collective X-ray emission in paraxial geometry, including spontaneous emission, amplified spontaneous emission, and the non-linear regime. Through numerical examples, we analyze key features of superfluorescence in one-dimensional approximation. Importantly, single realizations of the underlying stochastic equations can be fully interpreted as individual experimental observations of superfluorescence.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</description>
