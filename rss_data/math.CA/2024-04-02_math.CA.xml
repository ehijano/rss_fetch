      <title>A system of hypergeometric differential equations in $m$ variables of rank $p^m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a hypergeometric series in $m$ variables with $p+(p-1)m$ parameters, which reduces to the generalized hypergeometric series $_pF_{p-1}$ when $m=1$, and to Lauricella's hypergeometric series $F_C$ in $m$ variables when $p=2$. We give a system of hypergeometric differential equations annihilating the series. Under some non-integral conditions on parameters, we give an Euler type integral representation of the series, and linearly independent $p^m$ solutions to this system around a point near to the origin. We show that this system is of rank $p^m$, and determine its singular locus.</description>

      <title>Schatten classes and commutators in the two weight setting, II. Riesz transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the Schatten class $S^p$ of the commutator of Riesz transforms $[b,R_j]$ in $\mathbb R^n$ ($j=1,\ldots, n$) in the two weight setting for $n&lt; p&lt;\infty$, by introducing the condition that the symbol $b$ being in Besov spaces associated with the given two weights. At the critical index $p=n$, the commutator being in the weak Schatten class $S^{n,\infty}$ is characterized by the symbol $b$ being in an oscillation sequence space associated with the given two weights. As a direct application, we have the Schatten class estimate for A. Connes' quantised derivative in the two weight setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$-boundedness of the variation operator for generalized spherical means, and we also show the necessary conditions for the $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$-boundedness of the variation operator for generalized spherical means.

      <title>Landau's converse to H\" older's inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By H\" older's inequality, if $\mathbf{x} \in \ell^p$, then $\mathbf{x}\mathbf{y} \in \ell^1$ for all $\mathbf{y} \in \ell^q$. Landau proved the converse result: If $\mathbf{x}\mathbf{y} \in \ell^1$ for all $\mathbf{y} \in \ell^q$, then $\mathbf{x} \in \ell^p$. This paper proves Landau's theorem and considers a related problem for Hilbert's inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a connection formula for the Jackson integral of Riemann-Papperitz type. This includes a solution of the connection problem for the variant of $q$-hypergeometric equation of degree three introduced by Hatano-Matsunawa-Sato-Takemura. Using this formula we show a linear relation for the Kajihara's $q$-hypergeometric series $W^{M,2}$, whose $q$-difference equation is recently obtained by one of the author.</description>

      <title>Mountain pass frozen planet orbits in the helium atom model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We seek frozen planet orbits for the helium atom through an application of the Mountain Pass Lemma to the Lagrangian action functional. Our method applies to a wide class of gravitational-like interaction potentials thus generalising the results in [7] (Cieliebak, Frauenfelder and Volkov - 2023). We also let the charge of the two electrons tend to zero and perform the asymptotic analysis to prove convergence to a limit trajectory having a collision-reflection singularity between the electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a kind of shallow water wave model called the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (KP-BBM) equation. We firstly consider the unperturbed KP-BBM equation. Then by using the geometric singular perturbation (GSP) theory, especially the invariant manifold theory, method of dynamical system and Melnikov function, the existence of solitary wave solutions of perturbed KP-BBM equation is proved. In other words, we dissuss the equation under different nonlinear terms. Finally, we validate our results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Gelation in input-driven aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate irreversible aggregation processes driven by a source of small mass clusters. In the spatially homogeneous situation, a well-mixed system is consists of clusters of various masses whose concentrations evolve according to an infinite system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We focus on the cluster mass distribution in the long time limit. An input-driven aggregation with rates proportional to the product of merging partners undergoes a percolation transition. We examine this process analytically and numerically. There are two theoretical schemes and two natural ways of numerical integration on the level of a truncated system with a finite number of equations. After the percolation transition, the behavior depends on the adopted approach: The giant component quickly engulfs the entire system (Flory approach), or a non-trivial stationary mass distribution emerges (Stockmayer approach). We also outline generalization to ternary aggregation.</description>

      <title>Mass independent shapes for relative equilibria in the two dimensional constant positive curved three body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the planar three-body problem under Newtonian potential, it is well known that any masses, located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle generates a relative equilibrium, known as the Lagrange relative equilibrium. In fact, the equilateral triangle is the unique mass independent shape for a relative equilibrium in this problem.
  The two dimensional positive curved three-body problem, is a natural extension of the Newtonian three-body problem to the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, where the masses are moving under the influence of the cotangent potential. S.~Zhu showed that in this problem, equilateral triangle on a rotating meridian can form a relative equilibria for any masses. This was the first report of mass independent shape on $\mathbb{S}^2$ which can form a relative equilibrium. %
  In this paper, we show that, in addition to the equilateral triangle, there exists one isosceles triangle on a rotating meridian, with two equal angles seen from the centre of $\mathbb{S}^2$ given by $2^{-1}\arccos((\sqrt{2}-1)/2)$, which always form a relative equilibrium for any choice of the masses. Additionally we prove that, the equilateral and the above isosceles relative equilibrium are unique with this characteristic. We also prove that each relative equilibrium generated by a mass independent shape is not isolated from the other relative equilibria.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in the Transition Region: The Incomplete Gamma Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the resurgence properties of the coefficients $C_n(\tau)$ appearing in the asymptotic expansion of the incomplete gamma function within the transition region. Our findings reveal that the asymptotic behaviour of $C_n(\tau)$ as $n\to +\infty$ depends on the parity of $n$. Both $C_{2n-1}(\tau)$ and $C_{2n}(\tau)$ exhibit behaviours characterised by a leading term accompanied by an inverse factorial series, where the coefficients are once again $C_{2k-1}(\tau)$ and $C_{2k}(\tau)$, respectively. Our derivation employs elementary tools and relies on the known resurgence properties of the asymptotic expansion of the gamma function and the uniform asymptotic expansion of the incomplete gamma function. To the best of our knowledge, prior to this paper, there has been no investigation in the existing literature regarding the resurgence properties of asymptotic expansions in transition regions.</description>

Abstract: Resolving an open question of J. A. Carillo and G. Toscani, M. Stawiska recently proved that certain metric spaces of probability measures equipped with Fourier-based metrics are complete. In this note, we extend such Fourier-based metrics to the class of complex Borel measures and consider the question of completeness in this broader setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a well-known paper by Bruna, Nagel and Wainger [BNW], Fourier transform decay estimates were proved for smooth hypersurfaces of finite line type bounding a convex domain. In this paper, we generalize their results in the following ways. First, for a surface that is locally the graph of a convex real analytic function, we show that a natural analogue holds even when the surface in question is not of finite line type. Secondly, we show a result for a general surface that is locally the graph of a convex $C^2$ function, or a piece of such a surface defined through real analytic equations, that implies an analogous Fourier transform decay theorem in situations where the oscillatory index is less than $1$. This result has implications for lattice point discrepancy problems, which we describe.</description>

Abstract: Euler's elastica is defined by a critical point of the total squared curvature under the fixed length constraint, and its $L^p$-counterpart is called $p$-elastica. In this paper we completely classify all $p$-elasticae in the plane and obtain their explicit formulae as well as optimal regularity. To this end we introduce new types of $p$-elliptic functions which streamline the whole argument and result. As an application we also classify all closed planar $p$-elasticae.</description>

Abstract: Consider a non-negative, self-adjoint, maximally subelliptic operator on a compact manifold. We show that the spectral multiplier is a singular integral operator under an appropriate Mihlin-H\"ormander type condition. We establish the equivalence between non-isotropic Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces adapted to the operator and those adapted to a Carnot-Carath\'eodory geometry on the manifold. We also give a Mihlin-H\"ormander type condition for the boundedness of the spectral multiplier on non-isotropic $L^p$ Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>An expansion formula for elliptic hypergeometric series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an expansion formula for elliptic hypergeometric series. In the $q$-case, when the nome $p=0$, it generalizes $q$-hypergeometric transformation formulas due to Liu, and Wang and Ma, results that are used to derive identities for Hecke-type series and transformations for false and mock-theta functions. Our formula contains an arbitrary sequence as an argument, and is thus flexible in the number of parameters it contains. As a result, we are able to derive several transformation formulas for elliptic hypergeometric series, as well as double summation formulas.</description>

      <title>Accumulated spectrograms for hyperuniform determinantal point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the accumulated spectrogram associated to a locally trace class orthogonal projection operator and to a bounded set using the polar decomposition of its restriction on that set and prove a convergence theorem for accumulated spectrograms along an exhaustion in the case when the corresponding determinantal point process is hyperuniform. We prove that a radial determinantal point process on Rd is always hyperuniform along the exhaustion formed by the dilations of a bounded open set, and as a consequence, we obtain that dilations of the corresponding accumulated spectrogram converge to the indicator function of the considered set, establishing thus a universal phenomenon. Our result is a generalisation of a theorem by Abreu-Gr\"ochenig-Romero in [1] concerning time-frequency localization operators.</description>
