      <title>Heterogeneous Dynamic Logic: Provability Modulo Program Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formally specifying, let alone verifying, properties of systems involving multiple programming languages is inherently challenging. We introduce Heterogeneous Dynamic Logic (HDL), a framework for combining reasoning principles from distinct (dynamic) program logics in a modular and compositional way. HDL mirrors the architecture of satisfiability modulo theories (SMT): Individual dynamic logics, along with their calculi, are treated as dynamic theories that can be flexibly combined to reason about heterogeneous systems whose components are verified using different program logics. HDL provides two key operations: Lifting extends an individual dynamic theory with new program constructs (e.g., the havoc operation or regular programs) and automatically augments its calculus with sound reasoning principles for the new constructs; and Combination enables cross-language reasoning in a single modality via Heterogeneous Dynamic Theories, facilitating the reuse of existing proof infrastructure. We formalize dynamic theories, their lifting and combination in Isabelle, and prove the soundness of all proof rules. We also prove relative completeness theorems for lifting and combination: Under common assumptions, reasoning about lifted or combined theories is no harder than reasoning about the constituent dynamic theories and their common first-order structure (i.e., the "data theory"). We demonstrate HDL's utility by verifying an automotive case study in which a Java controller (formalized in Java dynamic logic) steers a plant model (formalized in differential dynamic logic).</description>

      <title>A Personalised Formal Verification Framework for Monitoring Activities of Daily Living of Older Adults Living Independently in Their Homes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an imperative need to provide quality of life to a growing population of older adults living independently. Personalised solutions that focus on the person and take into consideration their preferences and context are key. In this work, we introduce a framework for representing and reasoning about the Activities of Daily Living of older adults living independently at home. The framework integrates data from sensors and contextual information that aggregates semi-structured interviews, home layouts and sociological observations from the participants. We use these data to create formal models, personalised for each participant according to their preferences and context. We formulate requirements that are specific to each individual as properties encoded in Linear Temporal Logic and use a model checker to verify whether each property is satisfied by the model. When a property is violated, a counterexample is generated giving the cause of the violation. We demonstrate the framework's generalisability by applying it to different participants, highlighting its potential to enhance the safety and well-being of older adults ageing in place.</description>

      <title>Why this and not that? A Logic-based Framework for Contrastive Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define several canonical problems related to contrastive explanations, each answering a question of the form ''Why P but not Q?''. The problems compute causes for both P and Q, explicitly comparing their differences. We investigate the basic properties of our definitions in the setting of propositional logic. We show, inter alia, that our framework captures a cardinality-minimal version of existing contrastive explanations in the literature. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis of the computational complexities of the problems. We also implement the problems for CNF-formulas using answer set programming and present several examples demonstrating how they work in practice.</description>

      <title>Dependent Multiplicities in Dependent Linear Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel dependent linear type theory in which the multiplicity of some variable - i.e., the number of times the variable can be used in a program - can depend on other variables. This allows us to give precise resource annotations to many higher-order functions that cannot be adequately typed in any other system. Inspired by the Dialectica translation, our typing discipline is obtained by embedding linear logic into dependent type theory and specifying how the embedded logic interacts with the host theory. We can then use a standard natural numbers type to obtain a quantitative typing system with dependent multiplicities. We characterise the semantics for our theory as a combination of standard models of dependent type theory and linear logic. Our system can be added to any dependently typed language, which we demonstrate with an implementation in Agda.</description>

      <title>Tractable and Intractable Entailment Problems in Separation Logic with Inductively Defined Predicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish various complexity results for the entailment problem between formulas in Separation Logic with user-defined predicates denoting recursive data structures. The considered fragments are characterized by syntactic conditions on the inductive rules that define the semantics of the predicates. We focus on so-called P-rules, which are similar to (but simpler than) the PCE rules introduced by Iosif et al. in 2013. In particular, for a specific fragment where predicates are defined by so-called loc-deterministic inductive rules, we devise a sound and complete cyclic proof procedure running in polynomial time. Several complexity lower bounds are provided, showing that any relaxing of the provided conditions makes the problem intractable.</description>

      <title>ASP Chef grows Mustache to look better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ASP Chef Mustache, an extension of ASP Chef that enhances template-based rendering of ASP solutions using a logic-less templating system inspired by Mustache. Our approach integrates data visualization frameworks such as Tabulator, Chart.js, and vis.js, enabling interactive representations of ASP interpretations as tables, charts, and graphs. Mustache queries in templates support advanced constructs for formatting, sorting, and multi-stage expansion, facilitating the generation of rich, structured outputs. We demonstrate the power of this framework through a series of use cases, including data analysis for the Italian VQR, visualization of blocking sets in graphs, and scheduling problems. The result is a versatile tool for bridging declarative problem solving and modern web-based visual analytics.</description>

      <title>Big Steps in Higher-Order Mathematical Operational Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small-step and big-step operational semantics are two fundamental styles of structural operational semantics (SOS), extensively used in practice. The former one is more fine-grained and is usually regarded as primitive, as it only defines a one-step reduction relation between a given program and its direct descendant under an ambient evaluation strategy. The latter one implements, in a self-contained manner, such a strategy directly by relating a program to the net result of the evaluation process. The agreement between these two styles of semantics is one of the key pillars in operational reasoning on programs; however, such agreement is typically proven from scratch every time on a case-by-case basis. A general, abstract mathematical argument behind this agreement is up till now missing. We cope with this issue within the framework of higher-order mathematical operational semantics by providing an abstract categorical notion of big-step SOS, complementing the existing notion of abstract higher-order GSOS. Moreover, we introduce a general construction for deriving the former from the latter, and prove an abstract equivalence result between the two.</description>

      <title>Dualformer: Controllable Fast and Slow Thinking by Learning with Randomized Reasoning Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cognition theory, human thinking is governed by two systems: the fast and intuitive System 1 and the slower but more deliberative System 2. Analogously, Large Language Models (LLMs) can operate in two reasoning modes: outputting only the solutions (\emph{fast mode}) or both the reasoning chain and the final solution (\emph{slow mode}). We present \dualformer, a single Transformer model that seamlessly integrates both the fast and slow reasoning modes by training on randomized reasoning traces, where different parts of the traces are strategically dropped during training. At inference time, \dualformer can be easily configured to execute in either fast or slow mode, or automatically decide which mode to engage (\emph{auto mode}). It outperforms baselines in both performance and computational efficiency across all three modes: (1) in slow mode, \dualformer achieves $97.6\%$ optimal rate on unseen $30 \times 30$ maze tasks, surpassing the \searchformer baseline ($93.3\%$) trained on data with complete reasoning traces, with $45.5\%$ fewer reasoning steps; (2) in fast mode, \dualformer achieves $80\%$ optimal rate, significantly outperforming the Solution-Only model trained on solution-only data, which has an optimal rate of only $30\%$; (3) in auto mode, \dualformer achieves $96.6\%$ optimal rate with $59.9\%$ fewer steps than \searchformer. Moreover, \dualformer produces more diverse reasoning traces than \searchformer{}. For math reasoning problems, our techniques have also achieved improved performance with LLM fine-tuning, demonstrating its generalization beyond task-specific models. We open source our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/dualformer.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid SMT-NRA Solver: Integrating 2D Cell-Jump-Based Local Search, MCSAT and OpenCAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search away from conflicting states. Finally, we present a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA integrating MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>
