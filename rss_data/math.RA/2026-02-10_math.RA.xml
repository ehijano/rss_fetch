      <title>Further results for the dual Hartwig-Spindelb{\"o}ck decomposition and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two new forms of the dual Hartwig-Spindelb{\"o}ck decomposition and employ them to derive explicit representations for several classes of dual generalized inverses. Building on these representations, we further explore and characterize the relationships and properties of these inverses, investigate the dual composite generalized inverses, and verify the applicability of dual partial orders. The proposed decomposition provides a systematic and convenient framework for the study of dual matrices.</description>

      <title>Zeta functions of solvable Lie algebras over finite fields -- with calculations in detail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a solvable Lie algebra of dimension less than or equal to 4 over finite fields. We compute and record, in explicit symbolic form, the zeta functions enumerating subalgebras or ideals of $L$, and study their properties. We also discuss the implications of our data, in particular in relation to the general theory of Lie algebras over finite fields and zeta functions of Lie algebras over commutative rings.</description>

      <title>Hom-unitality and hom-associative structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study hom-associative structures on general, possibly non-associative algebras, focusing on one-sided and two-sided unital algebras. New characterizations and aspects of these structures, along with some important subclasses, are explored for non-associative algebras. By exploiting the observation that the twisting linear map in the hom-associativity axiom of one-sided unital hom-associative algebras is a left or right multiplication operator by an element of the algebra (obtained by the action of the twisting map on a corresponding one-sided unity), a new characterization of the multiplicative twisting operators (or, in other words, the multiplicative hom-associative algebras) is established for one-sided unital algebras. This demonstrates a strong connection between multiplicativity in hom-associative structures and the idempotents of the algebra, thereby further enhancing our understanding of the structure and special nature of multiplicative hom-associative algebra structures as a special subclass of arbitrary hom-associative structures with arbitrary linear twisting maps. Furthermore, new insights into subspaces and a subalgebra of hom-unities, algebra elements that induce hom-associativity by multiplication, are obtained. Moreover, since non-unital hom-associative algebras need not be twisted by a multiplication operator, a unitalization process is employed to describe a subalgebra of two-sided hom-unities that induce hom-associative structures on such algebras. This is formulated in terms of eigenspaces of multiplication operators within the algebra. Additionally, the obtained insights and general results about the structure and characterization of hom-algebra structures are applied to some important known general classes of non-associative algebras, such as commutative, possibly non-associative algebras, Cayley-Dickson algebras, Leibniz algebras, and hom-Leibniz algebras.</description>

      <title>Unital compressed commuting graph of $3 \times 3$ matrices over a finite prime field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we completely describe the unital compressed commuting graph of the ring $\mathcal{M}_3(\mathrm{GF}(p))$ of $3 \times 3$ matrices over the finite prime field $\mathrm{GF}(p)$. To achieve this we combine methods from linear algebra, field theory, projective geometry and combinatorics. We first partition the set of vertices into types based on the Jordan form and describe the neighborhood of each vertex. The key part of the graph, i.e., the subgraph that corresponds to non-scalar derogatory matrices, is then determined using a bijective correspondence between its vertices and point-line pairs in the projective plane over $\mathrm{GF}(p)$. At the end we explain how the remaining vertices are attached to the key part. We also give an algorithm to construct the whole graph. As a consequence, we describe the usual commuting graph $\Gamma(\mathcal{M}_3(\mathrm{GF}(p)))$, whose structure was an open problem for several years.</description>

      <title>Full automorphism groups of the axial algebra for $M_{11}$ and related algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, in continuation of arXiv:2311.18538, we compute the full automorphism groups of the 286-dimensional algebra for $M_{11}$, its subalgebras and other related algebras. This includes, in particular, the 101-dimensional algebra for $L_2(11)$ and the 76-dimensional algebra for $A_6$. While smaller algebras can be handled by the fully automatic nuanced method from arXiv:2311.18538, the larger algebras, mentioned above, require a hybrid method combining computation with hand-made proofs.</description>

      <title>Kronecker differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the real numbers, the Kronecker sum is the unique operation on matrices which exponentiates to the Kronecker product. Kronecker quotients provide an algebraic view of decompositions of matrices in terms of Kronecker products. This article explores families of operations, Kronecker differences, which are a kind of "inverse" for Kronecker sums. The correspondence between Kronecker differences and Kronecker quotients is explored. Furthermore, we show that a certain class of Kronecker differences may be characterized by families of matrices with these families again being expressed as Kronecker products. This approach provides a different "nonlinear" view towards tensor decomposition.</description>

      <title>A Structural Criterion for the Applicability of Algebraic Phase Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) exhibits a striking asymmetry. In certain mathematical and physical domains it enforces rigidity, uniqueness of representation, and collapse of apparent degrees of freedom, while in most analytic or dynamical settings it is provably inapplicable. This paper identifies the structural origin of this selectivity.
  We formulate a necessary and sufficient structural criterion characterising exactly when a nondegenerate Algebraic Phase Theory structure exists. The criterion isolates three conditions: the presence of nondegenerate phase duality, compatibility of admissible dynamics with phase interaction, and finite or terminating defect propagation. These conditions are jointly necessary and sufficient. When they are satisfied, phase theoretic rigidity is forced. When any one fails, no non-artificial phase structure can persist.
  As a consequence, phenomena often regarded as exceptional, including Fourier decomposition, Bethe type exact solvability, rigidity of stabiliser codes, and uniqueness of canonical representations, are revealed to be structural necessities rather than contingent constructions.
  This work positions Algebraic Phase Theory not as a universal modelling framework, but as a theory of structural inevitability. It clarifies both the explanatory power of APT and the precise boundaries of its applicability.</description>

      <title>Quantitative fixed-point theorems with verifiable hypotheses: rates and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,\dist)$ be a complete metric space and let $C\subseteq X$ be a closed invariant set. We study fixed points of maps $T\colon C\to C$ governed by a \emph{verifiable} contractive modulus. The modulus is encoded by a contractive gauge $\omega$ and a certified constant $\kappa=\sup_{0&lt;r\le R}\omega(r)/r&lt;1$ on a computable working radius $R$. From this datum we derive explicit a priori bounds $\dist(x_n,x^\ast)\le \Phi(n;\kappa,\delta_0)$ for Picard iterates, a residual-to-error estimate, and a quantitative data dependence bound $\dist(x^\ast,y^\ast)\le (1-\kappa)^{-1}\sup_{x\in C}\dist(Tx,Sx)$. We further treat inexact evaluations $\dist(\tilde x_{n+1},T\tilde x_n)\le \eta_n$ and obtain certified resilience bounds with the same stability factor. The framework applies to Hammerstein--Volterra integral equations and to boundary value problems via Green operators, where kernel bounds yield certified convergence rates.</description>

      <title>LCM decomposition of linear differential operators in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to compute $\mathrm{LCLM}$-decompositions for linear differentials operators with coefficients in the rational function field of characteristic $p$, $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}(t)$. We show that for an operator $L$ of order $r$ with coefficients of degree $d$, it finishes in polynomial time in $r$, $d$ and $p$. This algorithm proceeds in three steps. We begin by showing that the ''shape'' of the factorisation of $L$ can be easily obtained from the Frobenius normal form of its $p$-curvature, which can be efficiently computed an algorithm from Bostan, Caruso and Schost. Using results from the thesis of the author, we are then able to construct an operator $L^*$ in the same equivalence class as $L$ for which an $\mathrm{LCLM}$-decomposition is known. Finally, by computing an isomorphism between the quotient modules $\mathbb{F}_q(t)\langle\partial\rangle/\mathbb{F}_q(t)\langle\partial\rangle L^*$ and $\mathbb{F}_q(t)\langle\partial\rangle/\mathbb{F}_q(t)\langle\partial\rangle L$, we find a corresponding $\mathrm{LCLM}$-decomposition of $L$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate bi-periodic Padovan and bi-periodic Perrin quaternions over the quaternion algebra Q_Zp. We introduce the bi-periodic Perrin sequence and clarify its structural relationship with the bi-periodic Padovan sequence. By extending these sequences to the quaternion setting, we analyze their norm properties in the modular framework. For suitable choices of twin prime coefficients, we derive explicit criteria characterizing zero divisors and invertible elements in Q_Zp.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we show that the category of Latin (resp. commutative) medial quandles is equivalent to the category of affine modules over a certain Laurent polynomial ring (resp. the dyadic rationals). As applications, we describe free objects in these categories and obtain a structure theorem for finitely generated medial commutative quandles. We also characterize racks whose duals are commutative. Collectively, this solves two open problems of Bardakov and Elhamdadi (arXiv:2601.07057v2).</description>

Abstract: This paper is primarily devoted to the study of Hopf heaps and Hopf heap modules. We redefine the structure of Hopf trusses by means of Hopf heaps, establish the connection between Hopf trusses and Hopf braces, and provide a series of examples of Hopf truss structures from the perspective of Hopf heaps. Most importantly, we introduce the conception of Hopf heap modules, and present its structure theorem. Finally, we introduce the notions of Rota-Baxter operators on Hopf heaps and Hopf heap modules, and present the structure theorem for Rota-Baxter Hopf heap modules.</description>

      <title>Tensor products of Leibniz bimodules and Grothendieck rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we define three different notions of tensor products for Leibniz bimodules. The ``natural" tensor product of Leibniz bimodules is not always a Leibniz bimodule. In order to fix this, we introduce the notion of a weak Leibniz bimodule and show that the ``natural" tensor product of weak bimodules is again a weak bimodule. Moreover, it turns out that weak Leibniz bimodules are modules over a cocommutative Hopf algebra canonically associated to the Leibniz algebra. Therefore, the category of all weak Leibniz bimodules is symmetric monoidal and the full subcategory of finite-dimensional weak Leibniz bimodules is rigid and pivotal. On the other hand, we introduce two truncated tensor products of Leibniz bimodules which are again Leibniz bimodules. These tensor products induce a non-associative multiplication on the Grothendieck group of the category of finite-dimensional Leibniz bimodules. In particular, we prove that in characteristic zero for a finite-dimensional solvable Leibniz algebra this Grothendieck ring is an alternative power-associative commutative Jordan ring, but for a finite-dimensional non-zero semi-simple Leibniz algebra it is neither alternative nor a Jordan ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the central open problems to classify the computational complexity of finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems within P is to prove better algorithmic results for CSPs with a Maltsev polymorphism; we do not even know whether these CSPs are in NC. Relatedly, the descriptive complexity of these problems is open as well. An important special case, previously studied by Carbonell from the perspective of uniform polynomial time-algorithms, are CSPs with a conservative Maltsev polymorphism. We show that for every finite structure B with a conservative Maltsev polymorphism, the CSP for B can be solved by a symmetric linear Z2-Datalog program, and in particular is in the complexity class parity-L. Previously, the best known algorithms just showed containment in P. In our proof we develop a structure theory for conservative Maltsev algebras which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Structure of the Cayley-Dickson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viewing the Cayley-Dickson process as a graded construction provides a rigorous definition of associativity consisting of three classes and the non-associative parts dividing into four types. These simplify the Moufang loop identities and Mal'cev's identity, which identifies the non-associative Lie algebra structure. Analysing the non-associativity structure uncovers 3-cycles that distinguish between the Moufang identities and are used to identify three power-associative subalgebras of sedenions and higher level Cayley-Dickson algebras.
  Power-associativity introduces zero divisors into Cayley-Dickson algebras in a systematic way and it is convenient to replace the terminology hypercomplex numbers with {\it ultracomplex numbers} for the power-associative algebras. The non-associative types show that zero divisors in these algebras occur in multiples of 84 and cycles and modes are uncovered that reduce these down to factors of seven primary zero divisor pairs. It is shown that this is due to the power-associative subalgebras being embedded into ultracomplex numbers in multiples of seven. The graded notation allows the eight octonion and seven power-associative subalgebras of sedenions to be uniquely derived, up to representation.
  The zero divisors for split sedenion algebras are analysed and mappings between three of these are provided. These split algebras are shown to involve the same power-associative subalgebras as sedenions.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Jordan Algebras via the Jordan Defect: An Explicit Low--Degree Deformation Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over a field of characteristic $0$ we give a concrete, computation--ready description of Jordan algebra structures and their low--order deformation theory. The Jordan identity is quartic in the elements and cubic in the multiplication, and in characteristic $0$ it is equivalent to its standard four--variable polarization. We encode this polarization as a cubic map in the product~$\mu$, called the \emph{Jordan defect} $J(\mu)$. Linearizing this defect yields an explicit low--degree deformation complex \[ C^1(J)\xrightarrow{\;\delta_\mu\;} C^2(J)\xrightarrow{\;d_\mu\;} C^3(J), \] whose second cohomology classifies infinitesimal deformations modulo equivalence and whose obstruction space \[ \mathrm{Obs}^3_\mu := C^3(J)/\operatorname{im}(d_\mu) \] contains the primary obstruction to extending such deformations. We emphasize that this construction captures only the low--degree part of the operadic deformation theory and does not claim to produce the full governing $L_\infty$ structure.</description>

      <title>Linear sofic approximations of amenable algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of linear sofic approximations for algebras, analogous to the concept of sofic approximations for groups. We prove that for a finitely generated amenable $K$-algebra with no zero divisors, all linear sofic approximations are conjugate. This provides an algebraic analogue to Elek and Szab\'o's theorem for amenable groups. The proof relies on a "linear monotiling" technique, constructed using a theorem by Bre\v{s}ar, Meshulam and \v{S}emrl on locally linearly dependent operators. Finally, we apply this uniqueness result to the problem of weak stability in the rank metric, showing that the group algebra of an amenable group is weakly stable if and only if the group is residually finite.</description>

      <title>Duality properties for induced and coinduced representations in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of positive characteristic $p&gt;2$. We prove a duality property concerning the kernel of coinduced representations of Lie superalgebras. This property was already proved by M. Duflo for Lie algebras in any characteristic under more restrictive finiteness conditions. It was then generalized to Lie superalgebras in characteristic 0 in previous works of the author. In a second part of the article, we study the links between coinduced representations and induced representations in the case of restricted Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Double of Hopf Algebras Realized via Partial Dualization and the Tensor Category of Its Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the (generalized) quantum double $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H$ determined by a (skew) pairing between finite-dimensional Hopf algebras $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}$ and $H$, especially the tensor category $\mathsf{Rep}(K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H)$ of its finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we show that $K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H$ is a left partially dualized (quasi-)Hopf algebra of $K^\mathrm{op}\otimes H$, and use this formulation to establish tensor equivalences from $\mathsf{Rep}(K^{\ast\mathrm{cop}}\bowtie_\sigma H)$ to the categories ${}^K_K\mathcal{M}^K_H$ and ${}^{K^\ast}_{K^\ast}\mathcal{M}^{H^\ast}_{K^\ast}$ of two-sided two-cosided relative Hopf modules, as well as the category ${}_H\mathfrak{YD}^K$ of relative Yetter-Drinfeld modules.</description>

      <title>p-adic Cherednik algebras on rigid analytic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth rigid space with an action of a finite group $G$ satisfying that $X/G$ is represented by a rigid space. We construct sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras on the small \'etale site of the quotient $X/G$, and study some of their properties. The sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras are sheaves of Fr\'echet-Stein $K$-algebras on $X/G$, which can be regarded as $p$-adic analytic versions of the sheaves of Cherednik algebras associated to the action of a finite group on a smooth algebraic variety defined by P. Etingof.</description>

      <title>Hochschild (Co)homology of D-modules on rigid analytic spaces I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism of Hochschild (co)-homology for $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules on smooth rigid analytic spaces based on the homological tools of Ind-Banach $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules. We introduce several categories of $\mathcal{D}$-cap bimodules for which this theory is well-behaved. Among these, the most important example is the category of diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes. We give an explicit calculation of the Hochschild complex for diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes, and show that the Hochschild complex of $\mathcal{D}$-cap is canonically isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. In particular, we obtain a Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence converging to the Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathcal{D}$-cap. We obtain explicit formulas relating the Hochschild cohomology and homology of a given diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new basis of the group algebra of the symmetric group, built using the left-to-right minima sets of permutations. We show that on this basis, the descent algebra acts by triangular operators, thus making it an analogue of a cellular basis. The proof involves Dynkin elements (nested commutators) of the free algebra and their interactions with the $\mathbf B$-basis.</description>

      <title>On the number of generalized cospectral mates of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an upper bound on the number of generalized cospectral mates of simple graphs, where the generalized spectrum consists of the spectrum of a graph and its complement. Moving beyond the classical problem of identifying graphs determined by their generalized spectrum, we address the more quantitative question of how many non-isomorphic graphs can share the same generalized spectrum. Our approach is based on arithmetic constraints derived from the Smith Normal Form (SNF) of the walk matrix, which leads to a tight upper bound on the number of generalized cospectral mates of a graph. Our upper bound applies to a much broader class of graphs than those previously shown to have no generalized cospectral mates (graphs determined by generalized spectrum). Consequently, this work extends the family of graphs for which strong and informative spectral uniqueness results are available.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity and unimodality of cluster monomials of type $A_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The log-concavity of cluster variables of type $A_n$ and cluster monomials of type $A_2$ was established by Chen-Huang-Sun. It is still a conjecture for the cluster monomials of higher rank. In this paper, we prove the log-concavity and unimodality of the cluster monomials of type $A_3$, a substantially more intricate case. Moreover, we refine and extend this conjecture by considering the unimodality and the strongly isomorphism of cluster algebras.</description>
