      <title>On the Onsager-Machlup functional of the $\Phi^4$-measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of generalised densities for the $\Phi^4_d$ $(d=1,2,3)$ measures, in finite volume, through the lens of Onsager-Machlup (OM) functionals. The latter are rigorously defined for measures on metric spaces as limiting ratios of small ball probabilities. In one dimension, we show that the standard OM functional of the $\Phi^4_1$ measure coincides with the $\Phi^4$ action as expected. In two dimensions, we show that OM functionals of the $P(\Phi)_2$ measures agree with the corresponding actions, by considering ``enhanced" distances, defined with respect to Wick powers of the Gaussian Free Field, which are analogous to rough path metrics. In dimension $3$, two natural generalisations of the OM functional are proved to be degenerate. Finally, we recover the $\Phi^4_3$ action, under appropriate regularity conditions, by considering joint small radius-large frequency limits.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit for Brownian motions on the $l$-level Sierpinski gaskets: The fractal to Euclidean crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two dimensions, the $l$-level Sierpinski gasket $\mathrm{SG}(l)$ is obtained by splitting an equilateral triangle into a collection of $l^2$ equilateral triangles of equal size and with the same total area, retaining only the $l(l+1)/2$ triangles with the same orientation as the original triangle, and then iterating this procedure indefinitely. We show that the canonical diffusions on the spaces $\mathrm{SG}(l)$, $l\geq2$, can be rescaled to yield Brownian motion on the initial triangle. Our argument also applies to the analogous higher-dimensional Sierpinski gaskets. Moreover, we prove a local central limit theorem for the associated transition densities. Key to this is the derivation of a Poincar\'{e} inequality, in the proof of which we exploit the Euclidean-type mixing that occurs between the bottlenecks present at each scale of the fractal.</description>

      <title>The LLN and CLT for the statistical ensembles of discrete integrable Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of statistical ensembles under iteration map induced by discrete integrable Hamiltonian systems in deterministic case and stochastic case, addressing the problem from two perspectives: the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem. In deterministic case, the Law of Large Numbers simplifies the convergence conditions to the extent that the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma is no longer required. In the stochastic setting, we extend the results to general stochastic processes, beginning with the perturbation term represented by standard Brownian motion. Moreover, we establish a Central Limit Theorem for the statistical ensemble. A numerical example is also included.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Scaling limit of stochastic Box-Ball systems and PushTASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Stochastic Box-Ball System (SBBS), a probabilistic cellular automaton that generalizes the classic Takahashi-Satsuma Box-Ball System. In SBBS, particles are transported by a carrier with a fixed capacity that may fail to pick up any given particle with a fixed probability $\epsilon$. This model interpolates between two known integrable systems: the Box-Ball System (as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$) and the PushTASEP (as $\epsilon\rightarrow 1$). We show that the long-term behavior of SBBS is governed by isolated particles and the occasional emergence of short solitons, which can form longer solitons but are more likely to fall apart. More precisely, we first show that all particles are isolated except for a $1/\sqrt{n}$-fraction of times in any given $n$ steps and solitons keep forming for this fraction of times. We then establish the diffusive scaling limit of the associated "gap process," which tracks the distances between consecutive particles. Namely, under diffusive scaling, the gap processes for both SBBS (for any carrier capacity) and PushTASEP converge weakly to Semimartingale Reflecting Brownian Motions (SRBMs) on the non-negative orthant with explicit covariance and reflection matrices consistent with the microscale relations between these systems. Moreover, the reflection matrix for SBBS is determined by how 2-solitons behave. Our proof relies on a new, extended SRBM invariance principle that we develop in this work. This principle can handle processes with complex boundary behavior that can be written as "overdetermined" Skorokhod decompositions involving rectangular reflection matrices, which is crucial for analyzing the complex solitonic boundary behavior of SBBS. We believe this tool may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Relaxation to equilibrium of conservative dynamics II: non-gradient exclusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the speed-change exclusion process on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ reversible with respect to the product Bernoulli measure, we prove that its semigroup $P_t$ satisfies a variance decay $\operatorname{Var}[P_t u] = C_u t^{-\frac{d}{2}} + o(t^{-\frac{d+\delta}{2}})$ for every local function $u$, with the constant $C_u$ explicitly characterized. This extends the result of Janvresse, Landim, Quastel and Yau in [Ann. Probab. 27(1) 325--360, 1999] to a non-gradient model. The proof combines the regularization argument in the previous work, and the chaos expansion in [Markov Process. Related Fields, 5(2) 125--162, 1999] by Bertini and Zegarlinski, via a new input from the homogenization theory.</description>

      <title>Absolute continuity of finite-dimensional distributions of Hermite processes via Malliavin calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of densities for finite-dimensional distributions of Hermite processes of order \(q \ge 1\) and self-similarity parameter \(H\in(\frac12,1)\). Whereas the Gaussian case \(q=1\) (fractional Brownian motion) is well understood, the non-Gaussian situation has not yet been settled. In this work, we extend the classical three-step approach used in the Gaussian case: factorization of the determinant into conditional terms, strong local nondeterminism, and non-degeneracy. We transport this strategy to the Hermite setting using Malliavin calculus. Specifically, we establish a determinant identity for the Malliavin matrix, prove strong local nondeterminism at the level of Malliavin derivatives, and apply the Bouleau-Hirsch criterion. Consequently, for any distinct times \(t_1,\dots,t_n\), the vector \((Z^{H,q}_{t_1},\dots,Z^{H,q}_{t_n})\) of a Hermite process admits a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Beyond the result itself, the main contribution is the methodology, which could extend to other non-Gaussian models.</description>

      <title>Capacity in high dimensional percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of capacity for high dimensional critical percolation by showing that for any finite set $A$, the suitably rescaled probability that the cluster of $z$ intersects $A$ converges as $\|z\|\to\infty$. This can be viewed as a generalisation of the asymptotic of the two point function and we call the limit the p-capacity of $A$. We next show that the probability that the Incipient Infinite Cluster of $z$ intersects the set $A$ appropriately normalised is also of order the p-capacity of $A$ as $\|z\|\to\infty$. We conjecture that the p-capacity is of the same order as the $(d-4)$-Bessel-Riesz capacity and in support of this we estimate the p-capacity of balls. As a byproduct of our techniques we give a simpler proof of the one-arm exponent of Kozma and Nachmias for dimensions 8 and higher and as long as the two point function asymptotic holds. Our proofs make use of a new large deviations bound on the pioneers, that is the number of points on the boundary of a box which are part of the cluster of the origin restricted to this box.</description>

      <title>Kernel Radon-Nikodym Derivatives for Random Matrix Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study random operator tuples and random matrix ensembles through positive definite kernels, conditional expectations, and dilation theory. A Radon-Nikodym theorem for kernels is established, showing how domination can be expressed by explicit density operators. For shifted kernels this reduces to simple moment-ratio tests. In bi-unitarily invariant and block-invariant ensembles, these criteria align with classical asymptotics such as the Marchenko-Pastur law, offering a clear and efficient way to detect threshold phenomena.</description>

      <title>State-Constrained Chemical Reactions: Discrete-to-Continuous Hamilton--Jacobi Equations and Large Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the macroscopic behavior of chemical reactions modeled as random time-changed Poisson processes on discrete state spaces. Using the WKB reformulation, the backward equation of the rescaled process leads to a discrete Hamilton--Jacobi equation with state constraints. As the grid size tends to zero, the limiting solution and its associated variational representation are closely connected to the good rate function of the large deviation principle for state-constrained chemical reactions in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we focus on the limiting behavior of discrete Hamilton--Jacobi equations defined on bounded domains with state-constraint boundary conditions. For a single chemical reaction, we show that, under a suitable reparametrization, the solution of the discrete Hamilton--Jacobi equation converges to the solution of a continuous Hamilton--Jacobi equation with a Neumann boundary condition. Building on this convergence result and the associated variational representation, we establish the large deviation principle for the rescaled chemical reaction process in bounded domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study systematically cross sections of probability preserving actions of unimodular groups and their associated transverse measures, and introduce the invariant \emph{intersection covolume} to quantify their periodicity. Our main theorem, derived from a higher order version of Kac's lemma, shows that the intersection covolume is bounded below by the intensity, with equality precisely when the action is induced by a lattice (in the sense of Mackey). We further prove that the natural cross sections of cut--and--project actions have finite intersection covolume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intersection covolume of cross sections for probability preserving actions of a class of abelian groups without lattices, including $p$-adic groups and the group of finite adeles. We show that for cross sections with a uniformly discrete return time set, the intersection covolume is bounded below by twice the intensity, revealing a strict gap compared to the lattice case. Our main theorem asserts that cut-and-project systems uniquely attain the minimal intersection covolume. As an application, we characterize the generalized Farey fractions in the finite adeles via their Banach density.</description>

      <title>Two Decades of Probabilistic Approach to Liouville Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past twenty years, the probabilistic approach to Liouville Conformal Field Theory (LCFT) has undergone remarkable developments, transforming a collection of ideas at the interface of probability, geometry, complex analysis and physics into a coherent mathematical theory. Building on Gaussian Free Fields and Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos, rigorous definitions of correlation functions and partition functions have been established, culminating in the probabilistic derivation of the DOZZ formula and a mathematically complete formulation of the conformal bootstrap for LCFT on Riemann surfaces. This survey aims to provide a synthetic account of these advances, emphasizing both the main achievements and the open problems that continue to drive the field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $U^N$ be a family of $N\times N$ independent Haar unitary random matrices and their adjoints, $Z^N$ a family of deterministic matrices, and $P$ a self-adjoint noncommutative polynomial, i.e. for any $N$, $P(U^N,Z^N)$ is self-adjoint, $f$ a smooth function. We prove that for any $k$, if $f$ is smooth enough, there exist deterministic constants $\alpha_i^P(f,Z^N)$ such that $$ \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{N}\text{Tr}\left( f(P(U^N,Z^N)) \right)\right]\ =\ \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{\alpha_i^P(f,Z^N)}{N^{2i}}\ +\ \mathcal{O}(N^{-2k-2}) .$$ Besides, the constants $\alpha_i^P(f,Z^N)$ are built explicitly with the help of free probability. As a corollary, we prove that given $\alpha&lt;1/2$, for $N$ large enough, every eigenvalue of $P(U^N,Z^N)$ is $N^{-\alpha}$-close to the spectrum of $P(u,Z^N)$ where $u$ is a $d$-tuple of free Haar unitaries. We also prove the convergence of the norm of any polynomial $P(U^N\otimes I_M, I_N\otimes Y^M)$ as long as the family $Y^M$ converges strongly and that $M\ll N \ln^{-3}(N)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish novel concentration inequalities for additive functionals of geometrically ergodic Markov chains similar to Rosenthal inequalities for sums of independent random variables. We pay special attention to the dependence of our bounds on the mixing time of the corresponding chain. Precisely, we establish explicit bounds that are linked to the constants from the martingale version of the Rosenthal inequality, as well as the constants that characterize the mixing properties of the underlying Markov kernel. Finally, our proof technique is, up to our knowledge, new and is based on a recurrent application of the Poisson decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first consider a family of constraints given by straight lines. For a uniform probability distribution, we determine the constrained optimal sets of $n$-points and the corresponding $n$th constrained quantization errors for all positive integers $n$. In addition, we calculate the constrained quantization dimension and the constrained quantization coefficient with respect to this family of constraints. Next, we turn to another family of constraints, consisting of concentric circles. For the same probability distribution, we present a methodology to compute the constrained optimal sets of $n$-points and the corresponding $n$th constrained quantization errors for all positive integers $n$. Finally, we conclude the paper with a summary of the results and a discussion of future research directions.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for a strongly irreducible product of independent random matrices under optimal moment assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\nu$ be a probability distribution over the semi-group of square matrices of size $d\ge2$. We assume that $\nu$ is proximal, strongly irreducible and that $\nu^{*n}\{0\}=0$ for all $n$. We consider the sequence $\overline\gamma_n:=\gamma_0\cdots\gamma_{n-1}$ for $(\gamma_k)_{k}$ independent of distribution law $\nu$. Let $s_1\ge s_2\ge\dots s_d$ be the singular values given by the Cartan projection. We show that $(\log\frac{s_1}{s_2}(\overline{\gamma}_n))_{n}$, escapes to infinity linearly and satisfies exponential large deviations inequalities below its escape rate. This is an extension the simplicity of the top Lyapunov exponent result, proven by Guivarc'h and Raugi under a first moment assumption. We also show that the image of a generic line by $\overline{\gamma}_n$ as well as its eigenspace of maximal eigenvalue both converge to the same random line $l^\infty$ at an exponential speed.
  If we moreover assume that $\nu$ is supported on the group of invertible matrices and that the push-forward distribution $N_*\nu$ is $\mathrm{L}^p$ for $N:g\mapsto\log\|g\|\|g^{-1}\|$ and for some $p&gt;0$, then we show that $-\log d(l^\infty,H)$ is uniformly $\mathrm{L}^p$ for all proper subspace $H\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. For $p=1$, we moreover show that the rescaled logarithm of each coefficient of $\overline{\gamma}_n$ almost surely converges to the top Lyapunov exponent. This is an extension of results by Benoist and Quint which were themselves improvements of historic results by Guivarc'h, Lepage and Raugi, first proven under exponential moment assumptions.
  To prove these results, we do not rely on the existence of the stationary measure nor on the existence of the Lyapunov exponent. Instead we describe an effective way to group the i.i.d. factors into i.i.d. random words that are aligned in the Cartan decomposition. We moreover have an explicit control over the moments.</description>

      <title>Comparison principles for stochastic Volterra equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a comparison principle for stochastic Volterra equations with respect to the initial condition and the drift $b$ applicable to a wide class of Volterra kernels and input curves $g$ that may be singular at zero. The latter appear, e.g., in the study of Markovian lifts for such Volterra equations. For completely monotone kernels, our result holds without any further restrictions, while for not completely monotone kernels, it is shown that such a principle fails unless the drift is additionally monotone. As a side-product of our results, we also complement the literature on the weak existence of continuous nonnegative solutions, which covers the rough Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process with singular initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains with applications to MCMC acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As concrete algorithmic applications in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we provide two illustrations based on lifted MCMC and swapping algorithm respectively to demonstrate projection samplers improve mixing over the original samplers. The projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step, and we prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm. Through simple numerical experiments on a bimodal target distribution, we show that the projection samplers mix effectively, in contrast to lifted MCMC and the swapping algorithm, which mix less well.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Connecting G-Expectations and Rough Paths via Parameterized Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a framework for exploring the profound connection between G-expectation and Rough Paths Theory. We initiate this program by constructing a parameterized control representation and establishing an injective homomorphism between the space of G-random variables and families of classical random variables. Building on this, we outline a promising path-space formulation inspired by Rough Paths Theory, suggesting that G-expectations can ultimately be represented as deterministic functionals. This synthesis provides a new perspective and a clear roadmap for future research in model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Radon-Nikodym derivative of inhomogeneous Brownian last passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the law of the spatial increments (with endpoints away from the origin) of inhomogeneous Brownian last passage percolation (LPP) with non-decreasing initial data against the Wiener measure $\mu$ on compacts is in $L^{\infty-}(\mu)$; and for any fixed $p&gt;1$, the $L^p$ norm is at most of the order $O_p(\mathrm{e}^{d_pm^2\log m})$ for some $p$-dependent constant $d_p&gt;0$.
  Furthermore, when the initial data is homogeneous, we establish optimal growth on $L^p$ norms ($\asymp O(\exp(dm^2))$) of the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the Brownian LPP (i.e. top line of an $m$-level Dyson Brownian motion) away from the origin, as the number of curves $m$ tends to infinity, for all $p&gt;1$ sufficiently large.
  As an application of our framework, we show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of certain toy models for the KPZ fixed point lies in $L^{\infty-}(\mu)$, inspired by its variational characterisation in terms of the directed landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the spatial increments of the KPZ fixed point starting from initial data that is locally bounded and whose support admits $\epsilon$-coverings with moderate growth, exhibit strong quantitative comparison against rate two Brownian motion on compacts. The above estimates are uniform on the $L^p$ norms, the compact set containing the support of the initial data and the length of the interval considered.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved anomalous diffusion: deciphering the joint distribution of anomalous exponent and diffusion coefficient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</description>

      <title>The Aldous$\unicode{x2013}$Hoover Theorem in Categorical Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Aldous-Hoover Theorem concerns an infinite matrix of random variables whose distribution is invariant under finite permutations of rows and columns. It states that, up to equality in distribution, each random variable in the matrix can be expressed as a function only depending on four key variables: one common to the entire matrix, one that encodes information about its row, one that encodes information about its column, and a fourth one specific to the matrix entry.
  We state and prove the theorem within a category-theoretic approach to probability, namely the theory of Markov categories. This makes the proof more transparent and intuitive when compared to measure-theoretic ones. A key role is played by a newly identified categorical property, the Cauchy--Schwarz axiom, which also facilitates a new synthetic de Finetti Theorem.
  We further provide a variant of our proof using the ordered Markov property and the d-separation criterion, both generalized from Bayesian networks to Markov categories. We expect that this approach will facilitate a systematic development of more complex results in the future, such as categorical approaches to hierarchical exchangeability.</description>

      <title>Revenue Maximization Under Sequential Price Competition Via The Estimation Of s-Concave Demand Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Kac-Rice inspired approach to non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a method of analyzing the joint probability density (JPD) ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ of an eigenvalue $z$ and the associated right eigenvector ${\bf v}$ (normalized with ${\bf v}^*{\bf v}=1$) for non-Hermitian random matrices of a given size $N\times N$. The approach is essentially based on the Kac-Rice counting formula applied to the associated characteristic polynomial combined with a certain integral identity for the Dirac delta function of such a polynomial. To illustrate utility of the general method we derive ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ in the two particular cases: (i) one-parameter family of matrices interpolating between complex Ginibre and real Ginibre ensembles and (ii) a complex Ginibre matrix additively perturbed by a general fixed matrix. In particular, in the former case we analyze the formation of an excess of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the real axis on approaching the real Ginibre limit, which eventually gives rise to the existence of a new scaling regime of "weak non-reality" as $N\to \infty$. In the second case we further analyze non-Hermitian Rosenzweig-Porter model which recently attracted considerable interest in physics literature. In addition, we provide new insights into eigenvalue and eigenvector distribution for a general rank one perturbation of complex Ginibre matrices of finite size $N$, and in the structure of an outlier emerging as $N\gg 1$. Finally we discuss a generalization of the proposed method which is expected to be suitable for analysis of JPD involving both left- and right eigenvectors.</description>
