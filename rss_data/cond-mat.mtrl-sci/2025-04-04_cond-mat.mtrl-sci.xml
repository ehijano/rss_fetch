      <title>Investigation of electronic energy levels in a weak ferromagnetic oxygen-deficient BiFeO2.85 thick film using absorption and X ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We grew a 2 micron thick film of single-phase BiFeO3 on a Si (100) substrate by pulsed laser deposition with a substrate temperature of 575 oC and an oxygen partial pressure of 0.06 mbar. X ray diffraction analysis indicated that the film exhibits textured growth along the (110) plane and possesses a rhombohedral R3c structure. Investigations using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed an average grain size of about 300 nm and a surface roughness of 18 nm for the film. Energy dispersive X ray analysis estimated the composition of the film to be BiFeO2.85. Temperature- and magnetic field dependent magnetization measurements demonstrated weak ferromagnetic properties in the BiFeO2.85 film, with a non-zero spontaneous magnetization at H = 0 Oe across the temperature range of 2 to 300 K. Furthermore, the exchange bias field (HEB) of the film changed from the positive exchange bias field (+HEB = +6.45 Oe) at 200 K to a negative field (-HEB = -8.12 Oe) at 100 K, indicating a shift in macroscopic magnetism from antiferromagnetic to weak ferromagnetic order below 200 K. Elemental analysis via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the Fe ions in the BiFeO2.85 film are in a 3+ valence state, and a peak feature at 532.1 eV confirmed the presence of induced oxygen vacancies. UV visible NIR and valence band spectroscopic studies showed that the direct band-gap energy, and the separation between the valence band maximum and Fermi energy were approximately 2.27 eV and 0.9 eV, respectively, which are red-shifted when compared to its bulk form.</description>

      <title>Grotthuss-type oxygen hole polaron transport in desodiated Na$_{2}$Mn$_3$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons are quasiparticles that arise from the coupling of electrons or holes with ionic vibrations in polarizable materials. Typically, they are either localized at a single atomic site or delocalized over multiple sites. However, after the desodiation of Na$_{2}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$, we identify a rare split-hole polaron, where a single hole is shared between two adjacent oxygen atoms rather than fully localized or delocalized. We present a density functional theory (DFT) study on the migration and transport properties of these oxygen hole polarons in NaMn$_{3}$O$_{7}$ and Na$_{1.5}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$. Our calculations reveal that the split polaron configuration near a sodium vacancy is the ground state, while the localized polaron acts as the transition state. Migration occurs via a stepwise charge transfer mechanism along the $b$-axis, where the split-hole polaron transitions through a localized hole state. This transport behavior closely resembles the Grotthuss mechanism, which describes proton transport in H$_{2}$O. We compute the polaron mobility as $\mu$ = 1.37 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^2$/(V$\cdot$s) with an energy barrier of 242 meV. Using the Mulliken-Hush theory, we determine the electronic coupling parameter $V_{AB}$ = 0.87 eV. A similar migration mechanism is observed in Na$_{1.5}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$, where the split polaron remains more stable than in the localized state. This study provides the first theoretical investigation of split-hole polaron migration, offering new insights into the charge transport of exotic polaronic species in materials with implications for a wide range of functional materials including battery cathodes, thermoelectrics, photocatalysts, and next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Engineering 2D Surface Patterns with the VicCa Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employed the VicCA model to investigate the influence of step-edge potential on nucleation and pattern formation, aiming to gain deeper insights into island formation and growth. Our study explores fractal structures governed by general cellular automaton (CA) rules, as well as compact structures shaped by density-dependent attachment mechanisms. We demonstrate that modifications to the CA framework have a significant impact on surface patterning, emphasizing the critical role of adatom attachment rules and the substantial effect of potential well depth on the resulting surface morphology.</description>

      <title>Exploring non-collinear magnetic ground states in tetragonal Mn$_2$-based Heusler compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heusler compounds constitute a large family of intermetallic materials notable for their wide variety of properties such as magnetism, multi-ferroicity, nontrivial band topology, superconductivity and so on. Among their magnetic properties one finds a tremendous variety of states from simple ferromagnetism to skyrmion crystals. In most Mn$_2$-based Heuslers the magnetism is typically collinear. An exception is Mn$_2$RhSn in which an unusual ground state with magnetic canting and a temperature-induced spin re-orientation into the collinear ferrimagnetic phase has been reported from experiments. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations and mean field theory to provide a simple account of the unusual phase diagram in this magnet. We also highlight Weyl points in the computed band structure of \mrs\ and the resulting Fermi arcs.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Coherent and Particle-like Phonon Transport through Bonding Hierarchy in Soft Superionic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the unified theory thermal transport model, the competing contributions of coherent and incoherent terms create a trade-off relationship, posing substantial challenges to achieving a reduction in overall $\rm \kappa_L$. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that the superionic crystals X$_6$Re$_6$S$_8$I$_8$ (X = Rb, Cs) exhibit ultralow glass-like and particle-like thermal conductivities. The weak interactions between free alkali metal ions X$^+$ (X = Rb, Cs) and I$^-$ anions induce pronounced lattice anharmonicity, which enhances phonon scattering and suppresses group velocities, thereby reducing the particle-like thermal conductivity ($\rm \kappa_p$). Concurrently, the significant bonding heterogeneity within the [Re$_6$S$_8$I$_6$]$^{4-}$ clusters promotes phonon dispersion flattening and low-frequency phonon localization. The resulting discretized phonon flat bands substantially diminish the glass-like thermal conductivity ($\rm \kappa_c$). At room temperature, the total $\rm \kappa_L$ of X$_6$Re$_6$S$_8$I$_8$ (X = Rb, Cs) falls below 0.2 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. Furthermore, the bonding characteristics between X$^+$ and I$^{-1}$ anions induce an anomalous cation mass-independent stiffening of low-frequency phonon branches in this system, resulting in counterintuitive thermal transport behavior. This work elucidates fundamental mechanisms governing heat transfer in ultralow $\rm \kappa_L$ materials and establishes novel pathways for transcending conventional thermal conductivity limitations.</description>

      <title>CrystalFormer-RL: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning has instrumental enhanced the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we explore the applications of reinforcement fine-tuning to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer (arXiv:2403.15734) using discriminative machine learning models such as interatomic potentials and property prediction models. By optimizing reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material property figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning enables not only the property-guided novel material design ability of generative pre-trained model but also unlocks property-driven material retrieval from the unsupervised pre-training dataset. Leveraging rewards from discriminative models to fine-tune materials generative models opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity: stability and attractors in slip rate driven processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructral changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. Interestingly, we demonstrate that even size-independent models can exhibit size-dependent effects through variations in initial dislocation density. Notably, the initial dislocation density significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of micro-pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>A complimentary impedance spectroscopy biosensing method with graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method where a bioactive functional layer on an electrically conductive thin film with high sheet resistance can be effectively used for complementary electrochemical impedance spectroscopy biosensing. The functional layer's properties, such as double-layer capacitance and charge-transfer resistance, influence the complex impedance of the thin film in direct contact with the layer. These measurements can be performed using a simple low-frequency setup with a lock-in amplifier. When graphene is used as the resistive thin film, the signal may also include contributions from graphene's quantum capacitance, which is sensitive to charge transfer to and from the graphene. Unlike in traditional graphene biosensors, changes in electrolyte properties over time, such as those caused by the dissolution of ambient gases, do not significantly affect AC measurements. This technique supports biosensor miniaturization, ensures stable operation, and provides reliable biomarker detection with a high signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>RAFFLE: Active learning accelerated interface structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfaces between materials play a crucial role in the performance of most devices. However, predicting the structure of a material interface is computationally demanding due to the vast configuration space, which requires evaluating an unfeasibly large number of highly complex structures. We introduce RAFFLE, a software package designed to efficiently explore low-energy interface configurations between any two crystals. RAFFLE leverages physical insights and genetic algorithms to intelligently sample the configuration space, using dynamically evolving 2-, 3-, and 4-body distribution functions as generalised structural descriptors. These descriptors are iteratively updated through active learning, which inform atom placement strategies. RAFFLE's effectiveness is demonstrated across a diverse set of systems, including bulk materials, intercalation structures, and interfaces. When tested on bulk aluminium and MoS$_2$, it successfully identifies known ground-state and high-pressure phases. Applied to intercalation systems, it predicts stable intercalant phases. For Si|Ge interfaces, RAFFLE identifies intermixing as a strain compensation mechanism, generating reconstructions that are more stable than abrupt interfaces. By accelerating interface structure prediction, RAFFLE offers a powerful tool for materials discovery, enabling efficient exploration of complex configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Native defects, hydrogen impurities, and metal dopants in CeO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ceria (CeO$_2$) is a material of significant technological importance. A detailed understanding of the material's defect physics and chemistry is key to understanding and optimizing its properties. Here, we report a hybrid density-functional study of native point defects, hydrogen impurities, and metal dopants in CeO$_2$. We find that electron polarons ($\eta_{\rm Ce}^-$) and oxygen vacancies ($V_{\rm O}^{2+}$) are the dominant native defects under conditions ranging from extreme oxidizing to highly reducing. Hydrogen is stable either in the hydroxyl (H$_i^+$) or hydride (H$_{\rm O}^+$) structure but the substitutional H$_{\rm O}^+$ is energetically more favorable than H$_i^+$ only under highly reducing conditions. The interstitial H$_i^+$ is highly mobile in the bulk. Yttrium (Y) is energetically most favorable at the substitutional Ce site. Copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) can be incorporated at the substitutional site and/or an interstitial site, depending on actual conditions during preparation, and the dopants can exist in different charge and spin states. In light of the results, we discuss electronic and ionic conduction and the effects of metal doping on the formation of electron polarons and oxygen vacancies.</description>

      <title>Negative and positive anisotropic thermal expansion in 2D fullerene networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular double bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>

      <title>Extended Hybridization Expansion Solver for Impurity Models with Retarded Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the continuous-time hybridization expansion solver to a general form, where the hybridization function and retarded interaction are treated on equal footing. Correlation functions can now be directly obtained via functional derivatives with respect to the bosonic propagators, similar to the measurement of Green's functions. We devise a combinatorial scheme of measuring the correlation function, whose efficiency partially emulates that of the Green's function measurement. The algorithm and numerical methods are validated through application to an impurity model involving both electron-phonon coupling and exchange interactions, a case where the previous hybridization expansion algorithm is not applicable. Our improvement of the hybridization expansion solver promotes its applicability in studies of electron-phonon coupling, the extended dynamical mean field theory, and the dual boson method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing two synchronized mode-locked femtosecond lasers and interferometric detection of the pump-probe spectra -- referred to as asynchronous and interferometric transient absorption (AI-TA) -- we have developed a method for broad dynamic range and rapid data acquisition. Using AI-TA, we examined photochemical changes during femtosecond pump-probe experiments on all-inorganic cesium lead halide nanomaterials, including perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) and nanoplatelets (PeNPLs). The laser pulse train facilitates photoreactions while allowing real-time observation of charge carrier dynamics. In PeNCs undergoing halide anion photo-substitution, transient absorption spectra showed increasing bandgap energy and faster relaxation dynamics as the Cl/Br ratio increased. For colloidal PeNPLs, continuous observation revealed both spectral and kinetic changes during the light-induced coalescence of nanoplatelets, by analyzing temporal segments. This integrated technique not only deepens understanding of exciton dynamics and environmental influences in perovskite nanomaterials but also establishes AI-TA as a transformative tool for real-time observation of photochemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching characteristics of Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the study of resistive switching devices, researchers have found that the influence of the insertion layer cannot be ignored. Many reports have confirmed that the appropriate insertion layer can significantly improve the performance of the resistive switching devices. Therefore, in this work, we use magnetron sputtering to fabricate three devices: Cu/MgO/Cu, Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu and Cu/MoS2/MgO/Cu. Through the characterization test of each device and the measurement of the I-V curve, it is found that the resistive switching characteristics of the Cu/MgO/Cu device will change greatly after adding an MoS2 insertion layer. The analysis results show that the inserted MoS2 layer does not change the main transmission mechanism (space charge limited conduction) of the device, but affects the regulating function of interfacial potential barrier, the effect also is related to the location of MoS2 inserted into the layer. Among the Cu/MgO/Cu, Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu and Cu/MoS2/MgO/Cu devices, the Cu/MgO/MoS2/Cu device exhibits a larger switching ratio (about 103) and a lower reset voltage (about 0.21 V), which can be attributed to the regulation of the interface barrier between MgO and MoS2. In addition, when the MoS2 layer is inserted between the bottom electrodes Cu and MgO, the leakage current of the device is significantly reduced. Therefore, Cu/MoS2/MgO/Cu device has the highest commercial value from the point of view of practical applications. Finally, according to the XPS results and XRD results, we establish the conductive filament models for the three devices, and analyze the reasons for the different resistive switching characteristics of the three devices.</description>

      <title>High Chern numbers and topological flat bands in high-field polarized Kitaev magnets on the star lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometrically frustrated Kitaev magnets are demonstrated to be fertile playgrounds that allow for the occurrence of exotic phenomena, including topological phases and the thermal Hall effect. Notwithstanding the established consensus that the field-polarized phase in the honeycomb-lattice Kitaev magnet hosts topological magnons exhibiting Chern numbers $C = \pm1$, the nature of magnon excitations in Kitaev magnets on the star lattice, a triangle-decorated honeycomb lattice, has rarely been explored primarily due to its complicated geometry. To this end, we study the band topology of magnons on the star lattice in the presence of a strong out-of-plane magnetic field using linear spin-wave theory. By calculating the Chern numbers of magnon bands, we find that topological phase diagrams are predominantly composed of two distinct topological phases whose Chern numbers are different by a sign in inverse order. Remarkably, each phase is characterized by a high Chern number of either $+2$ or $-2$. In addition, several topological flat bands with large flatness are identified. The two phases are separated by a dozen narrow topological high-Chern-number segments, whose region shrinks as the magnetic field increases and vanishes eventually. We also find that the thermal Hall conductivity approaches zero at certain parameters, and it changes (keeps) its sign when crossing the topological phase-transition points (flat-band points).</description>

      <title>Anomalous vortex Hall effect in a ferromagnet/superconductor heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is a fascinating and complex phenomenon in condensed matter physics, as these two states are typically mutually exclusive due to their competing spin configurations. However, the interplay between these two orders through the proximity effect has been a subject of intense research as it opens up possibilities for novel technological applications. Here, we report the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in superconducting {\delta}-TaN/ferromagnetic CoFeB heterostructures grown by facing-target sputtering. Superconducting states are comprehensively investigated, with evidence of strong correlation between the superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters. In particular, we observed an anomalous Hall signal without the presence of the magnetic field in the mixed state of the superconducting transition near the critical temperature. Systematic characterizations of the Hall resistance under varying temperatures and magnetic fields attribute this behavior to the vortex Hall effect (VHE), whereby superconducting vortices in the mixed state undergo transverse motions near the critical temperature. Unlike previously reported VHEs in conventional type-II superconductors, the anomalous VHE in TaN is induced by the stray field in the underlying CoFeB layers. The concurrency of strong spin-orbit coupling, the superconductivity in the TaN layer, and the highly spin-polarized ferromagnetic ordering in the CoFeB layer offers new insights into proximity-induced vortex dynamics and the design of novel superconducting spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>A general and modular approach to solid-state integration and readout of zero-dimensional quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we present an all-electrical readout mechanism for quasi-0D quantum states (0D-QS) such as point defects, adatoms and molecules, that is modular and general, providing an approach that is amenable to scaling and integration with other solid-state quantum technologies. Our approach relies on the crea-tion of high-quality tunnel junctions via the mechanical exfoliation and stacking of multi-layer gra-phene (MLG) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to encapsulate the target system in an MLG/hBN/0D-QS/hBN/MLG heterostructure. This structure allows for all-electronic spectroscopy and readout of candidate systems through a combination of coulomb and spin-blockade. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate electronic tunneling spectroscopy of point defects in hBN and the molecular qubit vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc). Our approach demonstrates a new pathway for the incorporation of molecules and atomic defects into solid-state quantum devices and circuits along with a readout scheme that does not rely on highly-constrained optical processes for photonic readout.</description>

      <title>Structural and Magnetic Properties of Co-rich bct CoMn Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02812v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths.</description>

      <title>Imaging Ultrafast Dynamical Diffraction wavefronts of femtosecond laser-induced lattice distortions inside crystalline semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industry applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films. Gracing incident x-ray geometry has been also used to look to distortion dynamics, but this technique is only sensitive to the surface of bulk materials with a limited temporal resolution. However, 'real-world' processing applications deal mostly with bulk materials, which prevent the use of such techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon single-pulse excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of the temporal evolution of ultrafast distortion depth profiles. Our measurements were obtained in a thin crystalline Si wafer upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation revealing that even below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions appear on ps time scales due to the formation and propagation of high-amplitude strain waves into the bulk.</description>

      <title>Coupling between small polarons and ferroelectricity in BaTiO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional DFT and DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate voltage prediction of battery materials plays a pivotal role in advancing energy storage technologies and in the rational design of high-performance cathode materials. In this work, we present a deep neural network (DNN) model, built using PyTorch, to estimate the average voltage of cathode materials across Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. The model is trained on an extensive dataset from the Materials Project, incorporating a wide range of descriptors-structural, physical, chemical, electronic, thermodynamic, and battery-specific-ensuring a comprehensive representation of material properties. Our model exhibits strong predictive performance, as corroborated by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The close alignment between the DNN predictions and DFT outcomes highlights the robustness and accuracy of our machine learning framework in effectively screening and identifying viable battery materials. Utilizing this validated model, we successfully propose novel Na-ion battery compositions, with their predicted behavior confirmed through rigorous computational assessment. By seamlessly integrating data-driven prediction with first-principles validation, this study presents an effective framework that significantly accelerates the discovery and optimization of advanced battery materials, contributing to the development of more reliable and efficient energy storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Structural stability, elemental ordering, and transport properties in layered ScTaN2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some ternary TM nitrides are predicted to adopt layered structures that make them interesting for thermoelectric conversion and quantum materials applications. Synthesis of TM ternary nitride films by physical vapor deposition often favors disordered 3D structures rather than the predicted 2D-like layered structure. In this study, we investigate the structural interplay in the Sc-Ta-N material system, focusing on ScTaN2. We use a two-step combinatorial approach to deposit Sc-Ta-N films by RF co-sputtering and then process the resulting 3D-structured precursor with RTA. Synchrotron GIWAXS on films annealed at 1200 {\deg}C for 20 min reveals the nucleation of the layered structure (P63/mmc) within a composition window of Sc/(Sc+Ta) = 0.2-0.5. We estimate the long-range order parameter in stoichiometric ScTaN2 films to be 0.86. Interestingly, we find that the structure can accommodate large off-stoichiometry in the Ta-rich region (x &lt; 0.5), facilitated by making an alloy with the nearly isostructural Ta5N6 compound that exists on a composition tie-line. Transport measurements on ScTaN2 reveal a nearly temperature-independent high carrier density (1021 cm-3), suggesting a heavily doped semiconductor or semimetallic character. The carrier mobility is relatively small (9.5 cm2V-1s-1 at 2 K) and the residual-resistivity ratio is small, suggesting that electrical conduction is dominated by defects or disorder. Measured magnetoresistance is indicative of weak antilocalization at low temperatures. We highlight the interplay between ScTaN2 and Ta5N6 in stabilizing layered structures, emphasizes the importance of cation order/disorder for potential tunable alloys, and suggests that ScTaN2 is promising platform for exploring electronic properties in a tie line of stoichiometry.</description>

      <title>Surface and sub-surface modifications of copper electrodes exposed to high-field conditioning at cryogenic temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to investigate the dependence of conditioning and field-holding on temperature, three pairs of copper electrodes underwent high voltage conditioning with direct current (DC) pulses while kept at a single temperature, unique for each set (300~K, 30~K and 10~K), until saturation field for each set was found. The sets conditioned at cold showed a significant increase in the field holding capability, reaching fields up to 147 MV/m after tens of millions of pulses and very few breakdowns (BDs). We interpret this as an indication of the conditioning effect being due to high field pulsing rather than exposure to BDs. The effect of the warm and cold conditioning was investigated with high-resolution microscopy, characterizing the BD spots on the anode and cathode according to their morphology and with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyzing the changes in the sub-surface regions. Atypical BD spot features were found on the cryogenically conditioned cathode surfaces, with very shallow craters of a star-like shape. The number of atypical spots increased with decreased temperatures, reaching 26 and 53 percent of the total number of spots at 30~K and 10~K, respectively. A hypothesis explaining the formation of these features is also presented. The very different morphology of the anode and cathode BD spots is presented in detail that suggesting an unknown shielding mechanism that prevents the center of the anode spot from melting. These results provide important experimental input for the development of quantitative theories and models for BD initiation and inter-electrode plasma formation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and nematic order of Bose-Fermi mixtures in moir\'e superlattices of 2D semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic orders in a mixture of Boson (exciton) and Fermion (electron or hole) trapped in transition-metal dichalcogenides moir\'e superlattices. A sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is found between a carrier and an interlayer exciton trapped at different high symmetry points of the moir\'e supercell. This interaction at a distance much shorter than the carrier-carrier separation dominates the magnetic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, where the carrier sublattice develops ferromagnetism opposite to that in the exciton sublattice. We demonstrate the possibility of increasing the Curie temperature of moir\'e carriers through electrical tuning of the exciton density in the ground state. In a trilayer moir\'e system with a p-n-p type band alignment, the exciton-carrier interplay can establish a layered antiferromagnetism for holes confined in the two outer layers. We further reveal a spontaneous nematic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, arising from the interference between the Coulomb interaction and p-wave interlayer tunneling dictated by the stacking registry.</description>

      <title>Harnessing On-Machine Metrology Data for Prints with a Surrogate Model for Laser Powder Directed Energy Deposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we leverage the massive amount of multi-modal on-machine metrology data generated from Laser Powder Directed Energy Deposition (LP-DED) to construct a comprehensive surrogate model of the 3D printing process. By employing Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc), a data-driven technique, we capture the complex physics inherent in this extensive dataset. This physics-based surrogate model emphasizes thermodynamically significant quantities, enabling us to accurately predict key process outcomes. The model ingests 21 process parameters, including laser power, scan rate, and position, while providing outputs such as melt pool temperature, melt pool size, and other essential observables. Furthermore, it incorporates uncertainty quantification to provide bounds on these predictions, enhancing reliability and confidence in the results. We then deploy the surrogate model on a new, unseen part and monitor the printing process as validation of the method. Our experimental results demonstrate that the predictions align with actual measurements with high accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of our approach. This methodology not only facilitates real-time predictions but also operates at process-relevant speeds, establishing a basis for implementing feedback control in LP-DED.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning Guided Search for Phonon-mediated Superconductivity in Boron and Carbon Compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a workflow that iteratively combines \textit{ab-initio} calculations with a machine-learning (ML) guided search for superconducting compounds with both dynamical stability and instability from imaginary phonon modes, the latter of which have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties and critical temperature (T$_c$) of 417 boron, carbon, and borocarbide compounds have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and isotropic Eliashberg approximation. Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.</description>

Abstract: Phonons are essential quasi-particles of all crystals and play a key role in fundamental properties such as thermal transport and superconductivity. In particular, acoustic phonons can be interpreted as Goldstone modes that emerge due to the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry.In this article, we investigate the quantum geometric contribution to the phonon spectrum in the absence of Holstein phonons. Using graphene as a case study, we decompose the dynamical matrix into distinct terms that exhibit different dependencies on the electron energy and wavefunction. We then examine the role of quantum geometry in shaping the material's phonon spectrum.</description>

Abstract: In-plane semiconductor nanowires with complex branched geometries, prepared via selective area growth (SAG), offer a versatile platform for advanced electronics, optoelectronics, and quantum devices. However, defects and disorder at the interfaces and top surfaces of the nanowires can significantly degrade their electrical properties. One effective method to mitigate these issues is the incorporation of buffer and capping layers. In this work, we achieved a wider growth selectivity window of InGaAs in the presence of atomic hydrogen (H) and employed it as buffer and capping layers for SAG InAs nanowires to enhance their electrical properties. Hall measurements on InAs nanowires, with and without InGaAs buffer and/or capping layers, revealed that incorporating closely lattice-matched InGaAs buffer and capping layers to InAs nanowires nearly tripled the electron mobility and doubled the phase coherence length compared to nanowires without these layers. These findings demonstrate that the use of InGaAs buffer and capping layers is a crucial strategy for significantly enhancing the quality of InAs nanowires, unlocking their full potential for high performance electronics and quantum devices.</description>
