      <title>Are accelerated detectors sensitive to Planck scale changes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the foremost concern in the analysis of quantum gravity is whether the locations of classical horizons are stable under a full quantum analysis. In principle, any classical description, when interpolated to the microscopic level, can become prone to fluctuations. The curious question in that case is if there indeed are such fluctuations at the Planck scale, do they have any significance for physics taking place at scales much away from the Planck scale? In this work, we try to attempt the question of small scales and address whether there are definitive signatures of Planck scale shifts in the horizon structure. In a recent work (arXiv:2107.03406), it was suggested that in a nested sequence of Rindler causal wedges, the vacua of preceding Rindler frames appear thermally populated to a shifted Rindler frame. The Bogoliubov analysis used relies on the global notion of the quantum field theory and might be unable to see the local character of such horizon shifts. We investigate this system by means of the Unruh-DeWitt detector and see if this local probe of the quantum field theory is sensitive enough to the shift parameters to reveal any microscopic effects. For the case of infinite-time response, we recover the thermal spectrum, thus reaffirming that the infinite-time response probes the global properties of the field. On the other hand, the finite-time response turns out to be sensitive to the shift parameter in a peculiar way that any detector with energy gap $\Omega c/a \sim 1$ and is operational for time scale $T a/c \sim 1$ has a measurably different response for a macroscopic and microscopic shift of the horizon, giving us direct probe to the tiniest separation between the causal domains of such Rindler wedges. Thus, this study provides an operational method to identify Planck scale effects which can be generalized to various other interesting gravitational settings.</description>

      <title>Embedded Hypersurface Data and Ambient Vector Fields: Abstract Killing Horizons of order zero/one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study hypersurfaces that admit a privileged vector field $\mathfrak{y}$. For hypersurfaces of arbitrary causal character, we derive a set of identities involving the deformation tensor of $\mathfrak{y}$ and tensor fields codifying the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the hypersurface. This is done without imposing restrictions either on the topology of the hypersurface or on the (possibly empty) subset of points where $\mathfrak{y}$ vanishes. In the case when the hypersurface is null and $\mathfrak{y}$ is null and tangent, we introduce a generalized notion of surface gravity $\kappa$ that extends smoothly the usual one to the fixed points. Also for the null case, we analyze the properties of the Lie derivative of the Levi-Civita connection along $\mathfrak{y}$. This analysis allows us to introduce three new non-embedded notions of horizons that we then compare with the standard concepts of non-expanding, weakly isolated and isolated horizons. The former generalize the latter to completely general topologies and to horizons admitting fixed points. Finally, we study the structure of fixed points on these new horizons.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. When applied to curvature perturbations during inflation this observation closes a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine relativistic diffusion through the frame and observer bundles associated with a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$. Our focus is on spacetimes with a non-trivial isometry group, and we detail the conditions required to find symmetric solutions of the relativistic diffusion equation. Additionally, we analyze the conservation laws associated with the presence of Killing vector fields on $(M,g)$ and their implications for the expressions of the geodesic spray and the vertical Laplacian on both the frame and the observer bundles. Finally, we present several relevant examples of symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the photon mass via the Shapiro effect in the solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of a finite mass for the photon on its propagation in a weak gravitational field. In particular, we analyse the gravitational time delay, also known as the Shapiro effect. We work in isotropic coordinates in the weak-field limit and find that the mass-dependent corrections enhance the gravitational time delay. Doppler-tracking data from the Cassini mission allow us to set upper bounds on the photon mass at the level of $m_\gamma \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-7} \, {\rm eV/c^2}$. We also discuss next-generation solar-system tests of general relativity that could improve this upper limit, potentially reaching $m_\gamma \lesssim 8 \times 10^{-8} \, {\rm eV/c^2}$. Though not competitive with the currently best limits, our projected bounds are at the ballpark of earlier ones based on the gravitational deflection angle.</description>

      <title>Slowly decaying ringdown of a rapidly spinning black hole II: Inferring the masses and spins of supermassive black holes with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic observations reveal that almost all galaxies have supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at their centers, but their properties, especially their spins, are not fully understood. Some of the authors have recently shown [Oshita and Tsuna (2023)] that rapid spins of $&gt;0.9$, inferred for masses around $10^7\ M_\odot$ from observations of local SMBHs and cosmological simulations, source {\it long-lived} ringdowns that enhance the precision of black hole spectroscopy to test gravity in the near-extreme Kerr spacetime. In this work, we estimate the statistical errors in the SMBH mass-spin inference in anticipation of the LISA's detection of extreme mass-ratio mergers. We show that for rapidly spinning SMBHs, more precise mass and spin measurements are expected due to the excitations of higher angular modes. For a near-extremal SMBH of mass $10^7M_\odot$ merging with a smaller BH with mass ratio $10^{-3}$ at a luminosity distance of $\lesssim 10\:\mathrm{Gpc}$ (redshift $z \lesssim 1.37$), the measurement errors in the mass and spin of the SMBH would be $\sim 1\:\mathrm{\%}$ and $\sim 10^{-1}\:\mathrm{\%}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of Rotating compact objects in Plasma space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the characteristics of shadows cast by the Kerr black hole in the presence of plasma and compared them to those of a rotating wormhole in a uniform plasma space-time for an observer at infinity. Interestingly, for the same uniform plasma density, the apparent shadow size of the rotating wormhole is always greater than that of the Kerr black hole. To further distinguish the two compact objects we studied the deflection angle and did a comparative study in the presence of the uniform and non-uniform plasma profiles. The goal of this whole exercise is to deepen our understanding of the observational phenomena of these astrophysical objects. The analysis reveals the importance of specific plasma distribution profiles, the impact of plasma on the shadow diameter, and the behavior of deflection angles in different plasma scenarios. We have calculated constraints on the plasma parameters by considering observational data and employing analytical formulations, we have calculated constraints on the plasma parameters. Our work therefore provides valuable insights into the behavior of light rays near compact objects in plasma space-time.</description>

      <title>Bosonic KG-oscillators in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: Wu-Yang magnetic monopole and Ricci scalar curvature effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the bosonic Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators in a global monopole (GM) spacetime in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity and a Wu-Yang magnetic monopole (WYMM). We discuss the gravitational effects in the presence of Ricci scalar curvature $R=R_{\upsilon }^{\upsilon }$. It is observed that the presence of the Ricci scalar curvature, effectively and manifestly, introduces a force field that makes the corresponding quantum mechanical repulsive core more repulsive. Similar effect is also observed for the EiBI-gravitational field. We reiterate and report that the corresponding bosonic KG-oscillator quantum mechanical system admits a solution in the form of confluent Heun functions, the truncation of which into a physically admissible polynomial is shown to be associated with some parametric correlations/conditions. The use of such conditions/correlations is mandatory and yields a set of allowed/restricted quantum mechanical orbital $\ell $-excitations, for all radial quantum numbers $n_{r}\geq 0$. Our procedure is shown to be quite handy, in the since that it allows one to retrieve results for KG-oscillators in GM-spacetime in different EiBI-gravity and Ricci scalar curvature settings.</description>

      <title>Hybrid star within $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to investigate some interesting features of a static anisotropic relativistic stellar object composed of two different types of fluid distributions typically termed as quark matter (QM) and ordinary baryonic matter (OBM) together with Krori-Barua type (KB) {\em ansatz} in the regime of modified $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity, where $\mathcal{G}$ being the Gauss-Bonnet invariant term. In order to explain the correlation between pressure and matter density for the quark matter distribution within the compact object, we have taken into consideration the well-known MIT bag equation of state (EoS) whereas there is a simple linear correlation between pressure and matter density for ordinary baryonic matter. Furthermore, using graphical representations for varying parameters, the physical credibility of our obtained solutions has been intensively examined by regularity checking of the metric coefficients and matter variables, energy conditions, mass function, and causality conditions. For these analyses, we consider a particular compact stellar candidate 4U 1538-52. Finally, we found that the resulting outcome depicts the viability of the considered hybrid stellar model.</description>

      <title>Impact of non-zero strange quark mass $(m_{s}\neq0)$ in $f(R,T)$ gravity admitting observational results of strange stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we propose a new class of isotropic strange star using Buchdahl-I metric ansatz and MIT bag model equation of state in presence of non-zero strange quark mass $(m_{s})$ in the framework of modified $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity. The barotropic form of MIT bag model equation of state and a specific class of $f(R,T)$ model {\it viz.}, $f(R,T)=R+2\alpha_{c}T$ where $\alpha_{c}$ is termed as the gravity-matter coupling constant, produces a tractable set of solutions of Einstein field equations. From the numerical limit of the coupling constant $(\alpha_{c})$, we have considered a range of $\alpha_{c}$ from -2.0 to 2.0. Maximum mass and radius in this model is found by numerically solving the TOV equations and we note that within the stability window imposed by energy per baryon calculation, for a particular bag constant $B=70~MeV/fm^{3}$, $m_{s}$ and $\alpha_{c}$ act as a constraining factor. Interestingly, the increment of $m_{s}$ and $\alpha_{c}$ results in a softer equation of state which leads to the decrease in the maximum mass and radius while negative values of $\alpha_{c}$ leads to a stiffer equation of state thereby increasing the maximum mass and radius in the present model. For physical application, we consider EXO 1745-248 and tabulate the effects of $m_{s}$ and $\alpha_{c}$ on its radius. Using the formalism, we have analysed the characteristic properties of EXO 1745-248. Apart from that, we have predicted the radii of a wide range of strange star candidates in the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity and the results agree well with the observed properties. We note that our model satisfies all the necessary energy conditions and stability criteria to emerge as a viable stellar configuration.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition and Thermodynamic Stability in an Entropy-driven Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the notion that the mathematics of gravity can be reproduced from a statistical requirement of maximal entropy, we study the consequence of introducing an entropic source term in the Einstein-Hilbert action. For a spatially homogeneous cosmological system driven by this entropic source and enveloped by a time evolving apparent horizon, we formulate a modified version of the second law of thermodynamics. An explicit differential equation governing the internal entropy profile is found. Using a Hessian matrix analysis of the internal entropy we check the thermodynamic stability for a {\Lambda}CDM cosmology, a unified cosmic expanson and a non-singular ekpyrotic bounce. We find the mathematical condition for a second order phase transition during these evolutions from the divergence of specific heat at constant volume. The condition is purely kinematic and quadratic in nature, relating the deceleration parameter and the jerk parameter that chalks out an interesting curve on the parameter space. This condition is valid even without the entropic source term and may be a general property of any phase transition.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a GHZ-Teukolsky puncture scheme for gravitational self-force calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-adiabatic models of extreme- and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals will require calculations of second-order gravitational self-force effects in the spacetime of a spinning, Kerr black hole. We take a step toward such calculations by implementing the recently formulated Teukolsky puncture scheme with Green-Hollands-Zimmerman metric reconstruction [CQG 39, 015019 (2022)]. This scheme eliminates the critical obstacle of gauge singularities that arise in the standard no-string metric reconstruction. Our first proof-of-principle implementation is limited to the simple case of circular orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime, but the method also applies to generic orbits on a Kerr background. We conclude with a discussion of various approaches to the second-order self-force problem in Kerr.</description>

      <title>Time delay in the gravitational field of an axisymmetric body at rest with full mass and spin multipole structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time delay of a light signal which propagates in the gravitational field of an isolated body is considered. The body can be of arbitrary but time-independent shape and inner structure and can be in uniform rotational motion, while the center of mass of the body is assumed to be at rest. The gravitational field is given in the post-Newtonian scheme and in terms of the full set of mass-multipoles and spin-multipoles of the body. The asymptotic configuration is considered, where source and observer are located at spatial infinity from the massive body. It is found that in this asymptotic limit the higher multipole terms of time delay are related to the higher multipole terms of total light deflection. Furthermore, it is shown that the gauge terms vanish in this asymptotic configuration. In case of an axisymmetric body in uniform rotational motion, the higher multipole terms of time delay can be expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. This fact allows one to determine the upper limits of the time delay for higher multipoles. These upper limits represent a criterion to identify those multipoles which contribute significantly to the time delay for a given accuracy of time measurements. It is found that the first mass-multipoles with $l \le 8$ and the first spin-multipoles with $l \le 3$ are sufficient for an accuracy on the femto-second scale of accuracy in time measurements.</description>

      <title>Effective Metric Descriptions of Quantum Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work [arXiv:2307.13489 [gr-qc]], we have described spherically symmetric and static quantum black holes as deformations of the classical Schwarzschild metric that depend on the physical distance to the horizon. We have developed a framework that allows to compute the latter in a self-consistent fashion from the deformed geometry, in the vicinity of the horizon. However, in this formalism, the distance can be replaced by other physical quantities, e.g. curvature invariants such as the Ricci- or Kretschmann scalar. Here, we therefore define a more general framework, which we call an "effective metric description" (EMD), that captures the deformed geometry based on a generic physical quantity. We develop in detail the Ricci- and Kretschmann scalar EMD, in particular demonstrating how to compute the geometry in a self-consistent manner. Moreover, we provide explicit relations that allow to express one EMD in terms of the others, thus demonstrating their equivalence.</description>

      <title>Extension of the characterization method for non-Gaussianity in gravitational wave detector with statistical hypothesis test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gravitational wave astronomy, non-Gaussian noise, such as scattered light noise disturbs stable interferometer operation, limiting the interferometer's sensitivity, and reducing the reliability of the analyses. In scattered light noise, the non-Gaussian noise dominates the sensitivity in a low frequency range of less than a few hundred Hz, which is sensitive to gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence. This non-Gaussian noise prevents reliable parameter estimation, since several analysis methods are optimized only for Gaussian noise. Therefore, identifying data contaminated by non-Gaussian noise is important. In this work, we extended the conventional method to evaluate non-Gaussian noise, Rayleigh statistic, by using a statistical hypothesis test to determine a threshold for non-Gaussian noise. First, we estimated the distribution of the Rayleigh statistic against Gaussian noise, called the background distribution, and validated that our extension serves as the hypothetical test. Moreover, we investigated the detection efficiency by assuming two non-Gaussian noise models. For example, for the model with strong scattered light noise, the true positive rate was always above 0.7 when the significance level was 0.05. The results showed that our extension can contribute to an initial detection of non-Gaussian noise and lead to further investigation of the origin of the non-Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>A critical discussion on the $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical discussion on the $H_0$ Hubble constant tension is presented by considering both early and late-type observations. From recent precise measurements, discrepancies emerge when comparing results for some cosmological quantities obtained at different redshifts. We highlight the most relevant measurements of $H_0$ and propose potential ideas to solve its tension. These solutions concern the exploration of new physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model or the evaluation of $H_0$ by other methods. In particular, we focus on the role of the look-back time.</description>

      <title>Optical properties of Euler-Heisenberg black hole in the Cold Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical properties of Euler-Heisenberg (EH) black hole (BH) surrounded by Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halo are investigated. By changing BH's parameters, we found that the radius of horizon r_{h} and radius of photon sphere r_{ph} will transparently increase as CDM halo parameters R and \rho increase. To show the influence of CDM halo on the BH's optical characteristics, we took two sets of R and \rho with prominent differences and plot the first four orders of images for thin accretion disk with different angle of inclination \theta of observer. The images with light intensity distributions using Novikov-Thorne (N-T) model are also derived, as well as the effective potential, photon orbits. Especially, analysis of intersection behaviors between photon trajectories with different impact parameters and circular time-like orbits in accretion disk will help better understand the image of thin accretion disk. Our results showed that CDM halo will make BH become more larger and dimmer distinctly.</description>

      <title>General properties of the electric Penrose process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Penrose process with the charged particles in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m background. Let parent particle 0 decay to particles 1 and 2. With the assumption that all three particles move in the same plane, the exact formulas for characteristics of particles 1 and 2 in terms of those of particle 0 are derived. We concentrate on scenarios in which particle 1 and 2 are ejected along the trajectory of particle 0. It is shown that such scenarios correspond to the extrema of energies $E_{1}$ or $E_{2}$ of daughter particles with respect to the angular momentum $L_{1}$ or $L_{2}$ of one of them. We derive bounds on the values of angular momenta $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$. We give classification of these scenarios and discuss their properties including decay in the near-horizon region. The results are reformulated in terms of velocities of daughter particles in the center of mass frame. The approach is applicable also to collisional Penrose process, in which a combination of particles 1 and 2 is considered as one effective particle. If the mass of particle 0 $m_{0}\rightarrow \infty $, the situation corresponds to the Ba\~{n}ados-Silk-West effect, the results agree with the ones known in literature before. In addition, we consider special cases when decay occurs in the turning point for one or all three particles.</description>

      <title>On black bounce spacetimes in non-linear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main issues in gravitation is the presence of singularities in the most common spacetime solutions of General Relativity, as the case of black holes. A way of constructing regular solutions that remove space-like singularities consist on implement a bounce on such spacetime, leading what is usually known as black bounce spacetimes. Such spacetimes are known to describe regular black holes or traversable wormholes. However, one of the main issues lies on reconstructing the appropriate source that leads to such a solution. In this paper, a reconstruction method is implemented to show that such types of metrics can be well accommodated in non-linear electrodynamics with the presence of a scalar field. Some of the most important black bounces solutions are reconstructed in this framework, both in 3+1 as in 2+1 dimensions. For the first time in the literature, these solutions have an electrically charged source of matter from non-linear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Surface growth approach for bulk reconstruction in AdS/BCFT correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the surface growth scheme in AdS spacetime with a boundary in the AdS/BCFT correspondence. We show that the entanglement wedge with a boundary can be constructed from the direct growth of bulk extremal surfaces layer by layer. In addition, we find that the surface growth configuration in BCFT can be connected with the defect multi scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) tensor network. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement of purification within the surface growth process, which reveals more refined structure of entanglement entropy and indicates a selection rule for surface growth in the bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Mono- and oligochromatic extreme-mass ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational capture of a stellar-mass object by a supermassive black hole represents a unique probe of warped spacetime. The small object, typically a stellar-mass black hole, describes a very large number of cycles before crossing the event horizon. Because of the mass difference, we call these captures extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Their merger event rate at the Galactic Centre is negligible, but the amount of time spent in the early inspiral is not. Early EMRIs (E-EMRIs) spend hundreds of thousands of years in band during this phase. At very early stages, the peak of the frequency will not change during an observational time. At later stages, it will change a bit and finally the EMRI explores a wide range of them when it is close to merger. We distinguish between ``monocromatic'' E-EMRIs, which do not change their (peak) frequency, oligochromatic E-EMRIs, which explore a short range and polychromatic ones, the EMRIs which have been discussed so far in the literature. We derive the number of E-EMRIs at the Galactic Centre, and their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and perform a study of parameter extraction. We show that parameters such as the spin and the mass can be extracted with an error which can be as small as $10^{-11}$ and $10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$. There are between hundreds and thousands of E-EMRIs in their monochromatic stage at the GC, and tens in their oligochromatic phase. The SNR ranges from a minimum of $10$ (larger likelihood) to a maximum of $10^6$ (smaller likelihood). Moreover, we derive the contribution signal corresponding to the incoherent sum of continuous with two representatives masses; $10\,M_{\odot}$ and $40\,M_{\odot}$ and show that their curves will cover a significant part of LISA's sensitivity curve. Depending on their level of circularisation, they might be detected as individual sources or form a foreground population.</description>

      <title>The Inflationary Butterfly Effect: Non-Perturbative Dynamics From Small-Scale Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we investigate the non-perturbative dynamics of single field inflation with a departure from slow-roll. Using simulations, we find that oscillatory features in the potential can drastically alter the course of inflation, with major phenomenological implications. In certain cases, the entire Universe gets trapped in a forever inflating de Sitter state. In others, only some regions get stuck in a false vacuum, offering an alternative channel for primordial black hole formation. Analogous to the flap of a butterfly, these results show that small-scale phenomena can have profound consequences on the evolution of the entire Universe. This demonstrates the necessity of a non-perturbative approach in the exploration of the small-scale physics of inflation, particularly in the regime relevant for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Comments Concerning a Hypothetical Mesoscopic Dark Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by string-theoretic swampland conjectures, the existence of a dark fifth dimension, whose size is roughly 1 -- 10 microns, has been proposed. A great deal of supporting evidence has been presented, and definitive experimental tests are likely to be carried out. The basic idea is that the four-dimensional spacetime that we observe lives on a brane that is localized in the dark dimension. This short note points out that there are two distinct ways to realize such a scenario in string theory/M-theory. In the one considered previously the dark dimension is topologically a circle and our observable 4d spacetime is confined to a brane that is localized in a GUT-scale region of the circle. An alternative possibility is that the dark dimension is a line interval with branes attached at each end. This option would imply the existence of a parallel 4d spacetime microns away from us!</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have performed the dynamical system analysis of $f(T)$ gravity cosmological models at both background and perturbation levels. We have presented three models pertaining to three distinct functional forms of $f(T)$. The first form is that of the logarithmic form of the torsion scalar $T$, the second one is in the power law form, and the third one is the combination of the first two forms. For all these three forms of $f(T)$, we have derived the corresponding cosmological parameters in terms of the dynamical variables. Subsequently, the critical points are obtained and the condition(s) of its existence has been derived. Critical points of each model have been analysed individually and the corresponding cosmology are derived. The stability behaviour of these critical points are discussed from the behaviour of the eigenvalues and the phase portraits. At least one stable node has been obtained in each of these models. Further from the evolution plots of the cosmological parameters, the accelerating behaviour of the cosmological models are also verified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15689v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct new black-to-white hole solutions which connect the geometry of spacetime at some gluing surface inside the horizon. The continuity of the metric can be guaranteed up to the arbitrary order which is controlled by the power factor $n$. This sort of black-to-white holes is characterized by the sub-Planckian scalar curvature, independent of the mass of black-to-white holes. More importantly, we show that the energy condition is only violated within a small region near the gluing surface. The geodesics of particles within the region from black hole to white hole is also analyzed. It turns out that the matter falling into the black hole may pass through the center without singularity and come out from the white hole. This scenario provides novel ideas for understanding the information loss paradox in traditional black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Scalaron dynamics from UV to IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a scenario where the scalaron of $f({\cal R})$ models is related to the volume modulus of string compactifications leaving only one scalar degree of freedom at low energy. The coefficient of the leading curvature squared contribution to the low energy effective action of gravity determines the mass of the scalaron. We impose that this mass is small enough to allow for the scalaron to drive Starobinski's inflation. After inflation, the renormalisation group evolution of the couplings of the $f({\cal R})$ theory, viewed as a scalar-tensor theory, provides the link with the Infra-Red regime. We consider a scenario where the corrections to the mass of the scalaron are large and reduce it below the electron mass in the Infra-Red, so that the scalaron plays a central role in the low energy dynamics of the Universe. In particular this leads to a connection between the scalaron mass and the measured vacuum energy provided its renormalisation group running at energies higher than the electron mass never drops below the present day value of the dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We highlight some universal features concerning the role of spacetime curvature in the entanglement induced between quantum probes coupled to a quantum field in a suitable vacuum state. The probes are initially causally disconnected and non-entangled. We explore the parameter space $\{{\omega}, d_0, \boldsymbol{v}_0\}$ spanned by the energy gap $\omega$ of the detectors, and the initial values of separation distance $d_0$ and relative velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0$, both covariantly defined in arbitrary curved spacetime. We also obtain numerical results in de Sitter spacetimes and use these to explore strong curvature regime, while also corroborating our perturbative results in arbitrary curved spacetime. Our analysis shows that curvature can induce entanglement features in certain regions of the above parameter space, in a manner which facilitates using entanglement as a probe of spacetime curvature.</description>

Abstract: The Gotay-Nester-Hinds method is used in this paper to study the Hamiltonian formulation of the Euclidean self-dual action. This action can be used to arrive at the complex Ashtekar formulation of General Relativity or a real connection formulation for Euclidean General Relativity. The main result of the paper is a derivation of the Ashtekar formulation for Euclidean gravity without using any gauge fixing. It is interesting to compare this derivation with the one corresponding to the Holst action. In particular it is worth noting that no ``tertiary'' constraints appear in the case considered in the present paper.</description>

      <title>Quantum loop corrections in the modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation with primordial black hole production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation and primordial black hole production was proposed in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with current measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The model is an extension of the singularity-free Appleby-Battye-Starobinsky model by the $R^4$-term with different values of the parameters whose fine-tuning leads to efficient production of primordial black holes on smaller scales with the asteroid-size masses between $10^{16}$ g and $10^{20}$ g. Those primordial black holes may be part (or the whole) of the current dark matter, while the proposed model can be confirmed or falsified by detection or absence of the induced gravitational waves with the frequencies about $10^{-2}$ Hz. The main purpose of this paper was to estimate the size of quantum (loop) corrections in the model. It was found their relative contribution to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations is about $10^{-3}$ or less, so that the model is not ruled out by the quantum corrections.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we offer the dynamical system analysis of the DBI (Dirac-Born-Infeld) scalar field in a modified $f(Q)$ gravity context. We have taken a polynomial form of modified gravity and used two different kinds of scalar potential, i.e., polynomial and exponential, and found a closed autonomous dynamical system of equations. We have analyzed the fixed points of such a system and commented on the conditions under which deceleration to late-time acceleration happens in this model. We have noted the similarity of the two models and have also shown that our result is indeed consistent with the previous work done on Einstein's gravity. We have also investigated the phenomenological implications of our models by plotting the EoS ($\omega$), Energy density ($\Omega$), and deceleration parameter ($q$) w.r.t. to e-fold time and comparing with the present value. Finally, we conclude the paper by observing how the dynamical system analysis differs in modified $f(Q)$ gravity, and we also provide some of the future scope of our work.</description>

Abstract: Elaborating on Einstein-Weyl geometries, we write a simple Weyl invariant equation for Gravity (with the metric and a vector field as geometrical data). The equation is linear in the curvature and a natural generalization of Einstein equations to Weyl geometry. The system has 5 physical polarizations, the graviton and a massive photon. An exact black hole solution is found. We study the dynamics on Friedman backgrounds and the evolution of cosmological perturbations. It is shown that cosmological vector modes do not decay in this theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show via an explicit construction how an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections generically leads to a resolution of the Schwarzschild singularity in any spacetime dimension $D \ge 5$. The theories we consider have two key properties that ensure the results are general and robust: (1) they provide a basis for (vacuum) gravitational effective field theory in five and higher-dimensions, (2) for each value of the mass, they have a unique static spherically symmetric solution. We present several exact solutions of the theories that include the Hayward black hole and metrics similar to the Bardeen and Dymnikova ones. Unlike previous constructions, these regular black holes arise as vacuum solutions, as we include no matter fields whatsoever in our analysis. We show how the black hole thermodynamics can be studied in a completely universal and unambiguous way for all solutions.</description>

      <title>Infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections: Quasinormal modes and late-time behavior of D-dimensional regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Bueno, Cano, and Hennigar [arXiv: 2403.04827] proposed a generic approach for incorporating an infinite tower of higher curvature corrections into the Einstein theory. In this study, we compute quasinormal modes for certain regular D-dimensional black holes resulting from this infinite series of higher curvature corrections, specifically focusing on the D-dimensional extensions of the Bardeen and Hayward black holes. We demonstrate that while the fundamental mode is minimally affected by moderate coupling constants, the higher overtones exhibit significant sensitivity even to small coupling values, yielding unconventional modes characterized by vanishing real oscillation frequencies. When comparing the frequencies derived from the metric truncated at several orders of higher curvature corrections with those resulting from the infinite series of terms, we observe a rapid convergence of the frequencies to their limit for the complete regular black hole. This validates the extensive research conducted on specific theories with a finite number of higher curvature corrections, such as the Lovelock theory.</description>

      <title>Can nonlocal gravity really explain dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In view to scrutinise the idea that nonlocal modifications of General Relativity could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an Infinite Derivative Gravity model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is explained and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant.</description>

      <title>Canonical and Non-canonical Inflation in the light of the recent BICEP/Keck results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.03467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss implications of the latest BICEP/Keck data release for inflationary models, with particular emphasis on scalar fields with non-canonical Lagrangians of the type ${\cal L} = X^\alpha - V(\phi)$. The observational upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r \leq 0.036$, implies that the whole family of monomial power law potentials $V(\phi) \sim \phi^p$ are now ruled out in the canonical framework at $95\%$ confidence, which includes the simplest classic inflationary potentials such as $\frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2$ and $\lambda \phi^4$. Instead, current observations strongly favour asymptotically flat plateau potentials. However, working in the non-canonical framework, we demonstrate that monomial potentials, as well as the Higgs potential with its Standard Model self-coupling, can easily be accommodated by current CMB data. We find striking similarities between the $\lbrace n_{_S}, r\rbrace$ flow lines of monomial potentials in the non-canonical framework and the T-model $\alpha$-attractors in the canonical framework. Significantly, $V(\phi)$ can originate from Planck scale initial values $V(\phi) \simeq m_p^4$ in non-canonical models while in plateau-like canonical inflation the initial value of the potential is strongly suppressed $V_{\rm plat}(\phi) \leq 10^{-10} m_p^4$. This has bearing on the issue of initial conditions for inflation and allows for the equipartition of the kinetic and potential terms in non-canonical models.</description>

      <title>Eccentric black hole mergers via three-body interactions in young, globular, and nuclear star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eccentric mergers are a signature of the dynamical formation channel of binary black holes (BBHs) in dense stellar environments and hierarchical triple systems. Here, we investigate the formation of eccentric mergers via binary-single interactions by means of $2.5\times10^{5}$ direct $\textit{N}$-body simulations. Our simulations include post-Newtonian terms up to the 2.5th order and model the typical environment of young (YSCs), globular (GCs), and nuclear star clusters (NSCs). Around $0.6\%$ ($1\%$) of our mergers in NSCs (GCs) have an eccentricity ${&gt;0.1}$ when the emitted gravitational wave frequency is 10 Hz in the source frame, while in YSCs this fraction rises to $1.6\%$. Approximately $\sim63\%$ of these mergers are produced by chaotic, resonant interactions where temporary binaries are continuously formed and destroyed, while $\sim31\%$ arise from an almost direct collision of two black holes (BHs). Lastly, $\sim 6\%$ of these eccentric mergers occur in temporary hierarchical triples. We find that binaries undergoing a flyby generally develop smaller tilt angles with respect to exchanges. This result challenges the idea that perfectly isotropic spin orientations are produced by dynamics. The environment dramatically affects BH retention: $0\%$, $3.1\%$, and $19.9\%$ of all the remnant BHs remain in YSCs, GCs, and NSCs, respectively. The fraction of massive BHs also depends on the host cluster properties, with pair-instability ($60\leq\,$M$_{\rm BH}$/M$_{\odot}\leq$100) and intermediate-mass (M$_{\rm BH}\geq$100$\,$M$_{\odot}$) BHs accounting for approximately $\sim44\%$ and $1.6\%$ of the mergers in YSCs, $\sim33\%$ and $0.7\%$ in GCs, and $\sim28\%$ and $0.4\%$ in NSCs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Hubble tension on the $r$-$n_s$ contour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The injection of early dark energy (EDE) before the recombination, a possible resolution of the Hubble tension, will not only shift the scalar spectral index $n_s$ towards $n_s=1$, but also be likely to tighten the current upper limit on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. In this work, with the latest CMB datasets (Planck PR4, ACT, SPT and BICEP/Keck), as well as BAO and SN, we confirm this result, and discuss its implication on inflation. We also show that if we happen to live with EDE, how the different inflation models currently allowed would be distinguished by planned CMB observations, such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Graviton Mass Bounds through Analysis of 2023 Pulsar Timing Array Data Releases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04680v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong evidence for the Helling-Downs correlation curves have been reported by multiple pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations in middle 2023. In this work, we investigate the graviton mass bounds by analyzing the observational data of the overlap ruduction functions from the NANOGrav 15-year data release and CPTA first data release. The results from our data analysis display the state-of-the-art upper limits on the graviton mass at 90\% confidence level, namely, $m_{g}\lesssim8.6\times10^{-24}\mathrm{eV}$ from NANOGrav and $m_{g}\lesssim3.8\times10^{-23}\mathrm{eV}$ from CPTA. We also study the cosmic-variance limit on the graviton mass bounds, i.e., $\sigma_{m_{g}}^{\mathrm{CV}}=4.8\times10^{-24}\mathrm{eV}\times f/(10~\mathrm{year})^{-1}$, with $f$ being a typical frequency band of PTA observations. This is equivalent to the cosmic-variance limit on the speed of gravitational waves, i.e., $\sigma_{v_{g}}^{\mathrm{CV}}=0.07c$, with $c$ being the speed of light. Moreover, we discuss potential implications of these results for scenarios of ultralight tensor dark matter.</description>

      <title>Testing Parity Symmetry with the Polarized Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New physics in the early Universe could lead to parity-violation in the late Universe, sourcing statistics whose sign changes under point reflection. The best constraints on such phenomena have come from the Planck temperature fluctuations; however, this is already cosmic-variance-limited down to relatively small scales, thus only small improvements are expected in the future. Here, we search for signatures of parity-violation in the polarized CMB, using the Planck PR4 $T$- and $E$-mode data. We perform both a simulation-based blind test for any parity-violating signal at $\ell&lt;518$, and a targeted search for primordial $U(1)$ gauge fields (and the amplitudes of a generic collapsed model) at $\ell&lt;2000$. In all cases, we find no evidence for new physics, with the model-independent test finding consistency with the FFP10/NPIPE simulation suite at $(-)0.4\sigma$, and the gauge field test constraining the fractional amplitude of gauge fields during inflation to be below $6\times 10^{-19}$ at $95\%$ confidence level for a fiducial model. The addition of polarization data can significantly improve the constraints, depending on the particular model of primordial physics, and the bounds will tighten significantly with the inclusion of smaller-scale information.</description>

      <title>A Cosmological Bootstrap for Resonant Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress has revealed a number of constraints that cosmological correlators and the closely related field-theoretic wavefunction must obey as a consequence of unitarity, locality, causality and the choice of initial state. When combined with symmetries, namely homogeneity, isotropy and scale invariance, these constraints enable one to compute large classes of simple observables, an approach known as (boostless) cosmological bootstrap. Here we show that it is possible to relax the restriction of scale invariance, if one retains a discrete scaling subgroup. We find an infinite class of solutions to the weaker bootstrap constraints and show that they reproduce and extend resonant non-Gaussianity, which arises in well-motivated models such as axion monodromy inflation. We find no evidence of the new non-Gaussian shapes in the Planck data. Intriguingly, our results can be re-interpreted as a deformation of the scale-invariant case to include a complex order of the total energy pole, or more evocatively interactions with a complex number of derivatives. We also discuss for the first time IR-divergent resonant contributions and highlight an inconsequential inconsistency in the previous literature.</description>

      <title>Subregion Independence in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gravity, spacelike separated regions can be dependent on each other due to the constraint equations. In this paper, we give a natural definition of subsystem independence and gravitational dressing of perturbations in classical gravity. We find that extremal surfaces, non-perturbative lumps of matter, and generic trapped surfaces are structures that enable dressing and subregion independence. This leads to a simple intuitive picture for why extremal surfaces tend to separate independent subsystems. The underlying reason is that localized perturbations on one side of an extremal surface contribute negatively to the mass on the other side, making the gravitational constraints behave as if there exist both negative and positive charges. Our results support the consistency of islands in massless gravity, shed light on the Python's lunch, and provide hints on the nature of the split property in perturbatively quantized general relativity. We also prove a theorem bounding the area of certain surfaces in spherically symmetric asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes from above and below in terms of the horizon areas of de Sitter and Nariai. This theorem implies that it is impossible to deform a single static patch without also deforming the opposite patch, provided we assume spherical symmetry and an energy condition.</description>

      <title>Analytical Gaussian Process Cosmography: Unveiling Insights into Matter-Energy Density Parameter at Present</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel analytical Gaussian Process (GP) cosmography methodology, leveraging the differentiable properties of GPs to derive key cosmological quantities analytically. Our approach combines cosmic chronometer (CC) Hubble parameter data with growth rate (f) observations to constrain the $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ parameter, offering insights into the underlying dynamics of the Universe. By formulating a consistency relation independent of specific cosmological models, we analyze under a flat FLRW metric and first-order Newtonian perturbation theory framework. Our analytical approach simplifies the process of Gaussian Process regression (GPR), providing a more efficient means of handling large datasets while offering deeper interpretability of results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology by deriving precise constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m0}h^2$, revealing $\Omega_{\rm m0}h^2=0.139\pm0.017$. Moreover, leveraging $H_0$ observations, we further constrain $\Omega_{\rm m0}$, uncovering an inverse correlation between mean $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm m0}$. Our investigation offers a proof of concept for analytical GP cosmography, highlighting the advantages of analytical methods in cosmological parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Evidence that the Rate of Evolution of a Black Hole Interior Has a Holographic Dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A ``large'' AdS black hole can attain equilibrium with its own Hawking radiation, and in that condition it is thought to be dual to a strongly coupled field theory, also at equilibrium. But the interior of the black hole is by no means static: the geometry of spatial sections lying inside the event horizon evolves at some rate. This prompts the obvious question: can this rate possibly have a holographic dual? We present circumstantial evidence that such a dual does exist. We do this by making concrete proposals for two objects: first, a rough measure (already suggested in the literature) of the rate at which the unitary evolution of the state vector describing equilibrated strongly coupled matter evolves; and, second, a rough measure of the rate at which the interior (just under the horizon) evolves (in the case of the AdS$_5$-Kerr black hole). We then study how these two very different objects change as two physical parameters describing the exterior of the bulk black hole (the specific angular momentum and the temperature) are varied. We find that they change in remarkably similar ways, as holographic duals should.</description>

      <title>Analytic Formulae for Inflationary Correlators with Dynamical Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive fields can imprint unique oscillatory features on primordial correlation functions or inflationary correlators, which is dubbed the cosmological collider signal. In this work, we analytically investigate the effects of a time-dependent mass of a scalar field on inflationary correlators, extending previous numerical studies and implementing techniques developed in the cosmological bootstrap program. The time-dependent mass is in general induced by couplings to the slow-roll inflaton background, with particularly significant effects in the case of non-derivative couplings. By linearly approximating the time dependence, the mode function of the massive scalar is computed analytically, on which we derive analytic formulae for two-, three-, and four-point correlators with the tree-level exchange of the massive scalar. The obtained formulae are utilized to discuss the phenomenological impacts on the power spectrum and bispectrum, and it is found that the scaling behavior of the bispectrum in the squeezed configuration, i.e., the cosmological collider signal, is modified from a time-dependent Boltzmann suppression. By investigating the scaling behavior in detail, we are in principle able to determine the non-derivative couplings between the inflaton and the massive particle.</description>

      <title>From Cavitation to Astrophysics: Explicit Solution of the Spherical Collapse Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations of the form $\ddot R=-kR^\gamma$, with a positive constant $k$ and real parameter $\gamma$, are fundamental in describing phenomena such as the spherical gravitational collapse ($\gamma=-2$), the implosion of cavitation bubbles ($\gamma=-4$) and the orbital decay in binary black holes ($\gamma=-7$). While explicit elemental solutions exist for select integer values of $\gamma$, more comprehensive solutions encompassing larger subsets of $\gamma$ have been independently developed in hydrostatics (see Lane-Emden equation) and hydrodynamics (see Rayleigh-Plesset equation). I here present a universal explicit solution for all real $\gamma$, invoking the beta distribution. Although standard numerical ODE solvers can readily evaluate more general second order differential equations, this explicit solution reveals a hidden connection between collapse motions and probability theory that enables further analytical manipulations, it conceptually unifies distinct fields, and it offers insights into symmetry properties, thereby enhancing our understanding of these pervasive differential equations.</description>
