      <title>Diffusion and turbulence in phase-space and formation of phase-space vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the recently introduced fluid-like treatment of the phase-space has been further extended and some interesting outcomes have been presented. A modified form of the Vlasov equation has been presented which describes the diffusion of the phase-space density. This anisotropic diffusion is analysed and the flow of the phase-space probability field is shown. Growth of phase-space vortices is then shown due to increased turbulent-like flow, which is marked by the dominating inertial flow above the diffusive flow. The nature of this flow is judged by using a parameter for the phase-space. It is then shown that the formation of phase-space vortices is due to growth of turbulent-like flow in the phase-space. On the bases of the diffusion parameters, the vorticity field transport of the hydrodynamic phase-space is studied and a Schamel-KdV form of the vorticity transport equation is derived, suggesting solitary modes of the phase-space vorticity waves.</description>

      <title>On the density-density correlations of the non-interacting finite temperature electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density-density correlations of the non-interacting finite temperature electron gas are discussed in detail. Starting from the ideal linear density response function and utilizing general relations from linear response theory, known and novel expressions are derived for the pair correlation function, static structure factor, dynamic structure factor, thermal structure factor and imaginary time correlation function. Applications of these expressions in the classical mapping approach, self-consistent dielectric formalism and equation-of-state construction are analyzed in depth.</description>

      <title>An anisotropic plasma model of the heliospheric interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pioneering model of the interaction between the solar wind and the surrounding interstellar medium that includes the possibility of different pressures in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. The outer heliosheath region is characterized by a low rate of turbulent scattering that would permit a development of pressure anisotropy. The effect is best seen on the interstellar side of the heliopause, where a narrow region is developed with an excessive perpendicular pressure resembling a plasma depletion layer typical of planetary magnetspheres. The magnitude of this effect is relatively small owing to the fact that proton-proton collisions don't permit the anisotropy to approach a stability threshold. We also show that if turbulence in the interstellar medium is weak, a much broader anisotropic boundary layer can exist, with a dominant perpendicular pressure in the southern hemisphere and a dominant parallel pressure in the north.</description>

      <title>A "Galactic Disk"-Model for Three-Dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal Modes in a Finite Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new model, inspired by the structure of galactic disks, for three-dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes in a plasma with a uniform finite background magnetic field is presented. These modes are exact nonlinear solutions of the steady-state Vlasov equation, with an electric potential and a magnetic potential perturbation localized in all three spatial dimensions that satisfies the Poisson equation, and the Ampere Law, self-consistently. The existence of solutions is shown analytically in the limit of small electric and magnetic field perturbations associated with the disk species, and numerically using an iterative method that converges up to moderately strong field perturbations.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under XFEL illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) captures the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The ultrashort pulse produced by an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) 'outruns' much of the radiation damage that impairs conventional crystallography. However, the rapid onset of 'electronic damage' due to electron ionization limits this benefit. Here, we distinguish the influence of different atomic species on the electronic damage to protein crystals in SFX by employing a plasma code that tracks the unbound electrons as a continuous energy distribution. The simulations show that trace quantities of heavy atoms ($Z &gt; 10$) contribute a substantial proportion of global radiation damage by inducing electron ionization processes that are highly damaging on the XFEL pulse timescale. Native sulfur atoms have a considerable effect on damage-induced noise. Likewise, proteins suffer less damage when the crystal solvent contains lower concentrations of heavy elements. The proximity of the X-ray energy to a heavy-element absorption edge has a strong and non-trivial influence on the damage induced in these models. In one representative protein (lysozyme substituted with selenomethionine), adjusting the X-ray energy from 14 keV to 12 keV is as effective at reducing the ionization of light atoms as compressing the pulse width from 50 fs to 5 fs. These results indicate that relatively small quantities of heavy elements can substantially affect global radiation damage in the XFEL regime.</description>

      <title>Collisionless zonal-flow dynamics in quasisymmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear collisionless plasma response to a zonal-density perturbation in quasisymmetric stellarators is studied, including the geodesic-acoustic-mode oscillations and the Rosenbluth--Hinton residual flow. While the geodesic-acoustic-mode oscillations in quasiaxisymmetric configurations are similar to tokamaks, they become non-existent in quasi-helically symmetric configurations when the effective safety factor in helical-angle coorindates is small. Compared with concentric circular tokamaks, the Rosenbluth--Hinton residual is also found to be multiplied by a geometric factor $\mathcal{C}$ that arises from the flux-surface averaged classical polarization. Using the near-axis-expansion framework, we derive an analytic expression for $\mathcal{C}$, which varies significantly among different configurations. These analytic results are compared with numerical simulation results from the global gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code GTC, and good agreement with the theoretical Rosenbluth--Hinton residual level is achieved only when the quasisymmetry error is small enough. Since zonal flows can be important for regulating turbulent transport, these results suggest a possible relation between the transport level and the stellarator geometric parameters via nonlinear interactions with zonal flows.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of beam heated plasmas by beam modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A constant intensity beam that propagates into a stationary plasma results in a bump-on-tail feature in velocity space. This results in an instability that transfers kinetic energy from the plasma to the electric field. We show that there are intensity profiles for the beam (found by numerical optimization) that can largely suppress this instability and drive the system into a state that, after the beam has been switched off, remains stable over long times. The modulated beam intensity requires no feedback, i.e. no knowledge of the physical system during time evolution is required, and the frequency of the modulation scales approximately inversely with system size, which is particularly favorable for large plasma systems. We also show that the results obtained are robust in the sense that perturbations, e.g. deviation from the optimized beam profiles, can be tolerated without losing the ability to suppress the instability.</description>
