      <title>Enduring mechanical memory from the constitutive response of elastically recoverable nanostructured materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical memory and computing are gaining significant traction as means to augment traditional electronics for robust and energy efficient performance in extreme environments. However, progress has largely focused on bistable metamaterials, while traditional constitutive memory effects have been largely overlooked, primarily due to the absence of compelling experimental demonstrations in elastically recoverable materials. Here, we report constitutive return point memory (RPM) in elastically recoverable, vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, analogous to magnetic hysteresis-based RPM utilized in hard drives. Unlike viscoelastic fading memory, VACNTs exhibit non-volatile memory arising from rate-independent nanoscale friction. We find that the interplay between RPM and frictional dissipation enables independent tunability of the VACNT dynamic modulus, allowing for both on-demand softening and stiffening. We leverage this property to experimentally demonstrate tunable wave speed in a VACNT array with rigid interlayers, paving the way for novel shock limiters, elastodynamic lensing, and wave-based analog mechanical computing.</description>

      <title>Direct Comparison of Static and Dynamic Measurements of Spin Generation in a Topological Insulator Thin Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition between intrinsic spin-orbit physics, magnetic phenomena, and the quality of materials and interfaces governs the charge-to-spin conversion processes that are essential to the implementation of spintronic devices. Direct comparisons of spin parameters, which serve as metrics of device quality, obtained by different measurement techniques are scarce, leading to uncertainty regarding discrepancies and the reliability of the methods. Here, we directly compare the spin Hall coefficient (${\theta}_{SH}$) in molecular beam epitaxy grown films of $(Bi_{1-x}Sb_{x})_{2}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}$ (BSTS, x = 0.58, y = 1) at room temperature using two complementary techniques: a static method using non-local voltage (NLV) measurements in BSTS Hall bars with DC charge current, and a dynamic method using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurement in $BSTS/Ni_{80}Fe_{20}$ heterostructures at GHz frequencies. We obtain comparable spin Hall coefficients in angular-dependent ST-FMR (${\theta}_{SH}$=$4.7\pm1.1$) and in NLV (${\theta}_{SH}$=$2.8\pm0.6$). The complex effects of ferromagnetic interfaces while determining spin Hall coefficients using static or dynamic techniques becomes evident by contrasting our results to literature.</description>

      <title>Stability and Structure of Binary Metal Hydrides under Pressure, Electrochemical Potential and Combined Pressure-Electrochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal hydrides can be tuned to have a diverse range of properties and find applications in hydrogen storage and superconductivity. Finding methods to control the synthesis of hydrides can open up new pathways to unlock novel hydride compounds with desired properties. We introduced the idea of utilizing electrochemistry as an additional tuning knob and in this work, we study the synthesis of binary metal hydrides using high pressure, electrochemistry and combined pressure-electrochemistry. Using density functional theory calculations, we predict the phase diagrams of selected transition metal hydrides under combined pressure and electrochemical conditions and demonstrate that the approach agrees well with experimental observations for most phases. We use the phase diagrams to determine trends in the stability of binary metal hydrides of scandium, yttrium and lanthanum as well as discuss the hydrogen-metal charge transfer at different pressures. Furthermore, we predict a diverse range of vanadium and chromium hydrides that could potentially be synthesized using pressure electrochemistry. These predictions highlight the value of exploring pressure-electrochemistry as a pathway to novel hydride synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the role of disorder in the electronic structure of high entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder in high entropy alloys, arising from the random distribution of multiple elements, plays a crucial role in their novel properties desirable for various advanced engineering applications. We investigate the role of compositional and structural disorder on the electronic structure of osmium-based superconducting high entropy alloys, (Ru/Re)$_{0.35}$Os$_{0.35}$Mo$_{0.10}$W$_{0.10}$Zr$_{0.10}$, using photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Elemental and cumulative core level shifts are found to be commensurate with elemental electronegativities and valence electron counts (VEC), respectively. Valence band spectra together with DFT results indicate that the crystal structure plays an important role in deciding the electronic structure of these high entropy alloys. Through temperature dependent high-resolution spectra, we unveil strongly suppressed spectral density of states (SDOS) in the close vicinity of Fermi level. Energy and temperature dependence of the SDOS in accordance with Altshuler-Aronov theory confirms localization of charge carriers in the presence of strong intrinsic disorder. Computed electron-phonon coupling strength and superconducting transition temperature aligning reasonably well with experiments further shed light on phonon-mediated pairing mechanism and role of disorder in these systems. Our results provide a way forward to the understanding of superconducting high entropy alloys through strategic control of disorder, VEC and crystal structure.</description>

      <title>Stacking-Controlled Magnetic Exchange and Magnetoelectric Coupling in Bilayer CrI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a first-principles calculations approach to reveal the electronic and magnetic properties of chromium diiodide (CrI$_2$) bilayers and establish a hierarchy of magnetic interactions across stable registries. The monolayer presents a x-stripe antiferromagnetic ground state, while in bilayers the BA$^\prime$ stacking is the global minimum with antiparallel interlayer magnetic alignment. Bilayer configurations strengthen the exchange in the plane by 6 % to 10 %, while the exchange between layers is registry-dependent. The symmetry of each stacking configuration allows for anisotropic interactions. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms appear in structures without inversion symmetry, which in this case also generates in-plane polarizations of up to $\sim$ 10 $\mu$C/cm$^2$, resulting in direct magnetoelectric coupling that is absent in centrosymmetric monolayers. Thus, stacking acts both as a selector of exchange anisotropy and as a driver of magnetoelectricity. Our results show that bilayer CrI$_2$ can be mechanically reconfigured through interlayer sliding, with energy differences between stacking orders (25-50 meV/f.u.) that are compatible with experimental actuation. Tunable magnetism and register-dependent polarization offer promising opportunities for novel spintronic devices, where structural transitions can affect both magnetic states and electric dipoles.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation on the formation of ethylene on a gold surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The targeted and efficient CO2 reduction remains an appealing option to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and transform it into value-added chemicals. The formation of methylene and subsequent dimerization to ethylene is one possible step in the rather complex pathway. These reactions typically occur on (catalytic) surfaces. It is therefore critical to gain a deeper understanding of the role of the surface. We study the reaction pathway of the dimerization on gold surfaces with varying layer thickness. The presence of support layers has a significant influence on the reaction coordinate, the energetic profile and finally on the adsorption energy of the product on the surface with interesting consequences for the role of nanostructured gold surfaces for CO2 upconversion.</description>

      <title>Non-Altermagnetic Origin of Exchange Bias Behaviors in Incoherent RuO$_2$/Fe Bilayer Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initially identified as a promising altermagnetic (AM) candidate, rutile RuO$_2$ has since become embroiled in controversy due to contradictory findings of modeling and measurements of the magnetic properties of bulk crystals and thin films. For example, despite observations of a bulk non-magnetic state using density functional theory, neutron scattering, and muon spin resonance measurements, patterned RuO$_2$ Hall bars and film heterostructures display magnetotransport signatures of magnetic ordering. Among the characteristics routinely cited as evidence for AM is the observation of exchange bias (EB) in an intimately contacted Fe-based ferromagnetic (FM) layer, which can arise due to interfacial coupling with a compensated antiferromagnet. Within this work, the origins of this EB coupling in Ru-capped RuO$_2$/Fe bilayers are investigated using polarized neutron diffraction, polarized neutron reflectometry, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, and super conducting quantum interference device measurements. These experiments reveal that the EB behavior is driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer containing Fe$_3$O$_4$ that undergoes a magnetic transition and pins interfacial moments within Fe at low temperature. These findings are confirmed by comparable measurements of Ni-based heterostructures, which do not display EB coupling, as well as magnetometry of additional Fe/Ru bilayers that display oxide-driven EB coupling despite the absence of the epitaxial RuO$_2$ layer. While these results do not directly refute the possibility of AM ordering in RuO$_2$ thin films, they reveal that EB, and related magnetotransport phenomena, cannot alone be considered evidence of this characteristic in the rutile structure due to interfacial chemical disorder.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Optical Thermometry Using Photoluminescence and Raman Spectra of Diamonds Containing SiV Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro- and nanothermometry enable precise temperature monitoring and control at the micro- and nanoscale, and have become essential diagnostic tools in applications ranging from high-power microelectronics to biosensing and nanomedicine. Most existing techniques rely on secondary micro- and nanothermometers that require individual calibration of each sensor, ideally both off- and in-situ, before use. We present an alternative approach that overcomes this limitation by employing fluorescent diamonds containing silicon-vacancy centers, where the thermo-sensitive physical quantities are the centers' photoluminescence and the diamond host's Raman signals. The photoluminescence and Raman data are analyzed using two multi-feature regression algorithms that leverage a minimal number of calibration diamonds and temperature set points to predict the temperature of previously unseen diamonds. Using this approach, the models achieve accuracies as low as 0.7 K, resolutions down to 0.6 K Hz$^{-1/2}$, and sensitivity as high as 0.04 K$^{-1}$. These correspond to improvements of roughly 70 percent (over threefold) in accuracy, 50 percent (twofold) in resolution, and 567 percent (sevenfold) in sensitivity compared with traditional single-feature models. Our approach is particularly suited to applications where pre-deployment calibration of every thermosensor is impractical, and it is generalizable to any thermometry platform with two or more simultaneously measurable temperature-dependent observables.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum Many-Body GW Calculations on Exascale Supercomputing Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced ab initio materials simulations face growing challenges as increasing systems and phenomena complexity requires higher accuracy, driving up computational demands. Quantum many-body GW methods are state-of-the-art for treating electronic excited states and couplings but often hindered due to the costly numerical complexity. Here, we present innovative implementations of advanced GW methods within the BerkeleyGW package, enabling large-scale simulations on Frontier and Aurora exascale platforms. Our approach demonstrates exceptional versatility for complex heterogeneous systems with up to 17,574 atoms, along with achieving true performance portability across GPU architectures. We demonstrate excellent strong and weak scaling to thousands of nodes, reaching double-precision core-kernel performance of 1.069 ExaFLOP/s on Frontier (9,408 nodes) and 707.52 PetaFLOP/s on Aurora (9,600 nodes), corresponding to 59.45% and 48.79% of peak, respectively. Our work demonstrates a breakthrough in utilizing exascale computing for quantum materials simulations, delivering unprecedented predictive capabilities for rational designs of future quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Correlative 3D Mapping of Structure, Composition, and Valence State Dynamics in Battery Cathodes via Simultaneous ADF-EDS-EELS Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding degradation in battery cathodes and other functional materials requires simultaneous knowledge of structural, chemical, and electronic changes in three dimensions (3D). Here, we present a simultaneous ADF-EDS-EELS tomography method that enables 3D mapping of atomic structure, composition, valence states, and transition metal inhomogeneity within a single, low-dose STEM tilt series acquisition. Applied to LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111) particles at different electrochemical cycling stages, this method reveals nanoscale degradation processes with full spatial correlation. We observe that while chemical composition evolves uniformly throughout the entire primary particle, valence state changes and transition metal segregation are strongly depth-dependent and concentrated near the surface. This coexistence of bulk and surface-driven degradation dynamics reveals distinct mechanisms acting at different spatial scales. The evolution of inhomogeneity and valence states deviates from simple phase transition models, highlighting the roles of ion migration and dissolution-driven segregation. Our findings establish valence state gradients and nanoscale inhomogeneity as active contributors to cathode failure. More broadly, this correlative 3D platform opens new opportunities for studying redox-driven transformations in fields such as neuromorphic computing and heterogeneous catalysis, where composition-structure-function coupling is inherently three-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear Magnetic Multipoles in Collinear Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets host an array of magnetic multipoles, which are often visualized and studied in the reciprocal space. In the real space, the relative phase of the multipoles of the spin-density around atoms determines whether a system is an altermagnet or a conventional antiferromagnet. In this study, we approach these real space multipoles in altermagnets using a combination of first principles calculations and group theory. We show that even in collinear magnets, the local spin density is necessarily noncollinear due to spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, the noncollinear contributions often provide a more direct illustration of the magnetic multipolar character of altermagnetism than the collinear contribution, which is dominated by the dipolar term. Our first principles calculations also show that 32-poles, in addition to the octupoles, can be visible in spin-density of d-wave altermagnets, and they must be taken into account in discussions of the macroscopic response. Finally, we elucidate the interplay between magnetism and subtle crystal structural distortions in perovskite altermagnets, which provide a fertile playground for studying phase transitions between antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Thermally Activated Plasticity in Single-Crystal Titanium: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Nanoscale Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal close-packed (hcp) titanium exhibits a complex temperature-dependent mechanical response that is central to its use in structural applications. We employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the nanoindentation behavior of single-crystalline a-Ti along the [0001], [10-10], and [2-110] orientations at 10, 300, and 600 K. The simulations reveal how temperature modifies the onset of plasticity and the subsequent evolution of dislocation activity, including nucleation, glide, and the competition between basal and pyramidal &lt;c+a&gt; slip. Schmid factor mapping establishes a direct correlation between the orientation-dependent activation of slip systems and the resolved shear stress fields beneath the indenter. The results demonstrate a pronounced increase in thermally assisted dislocation motion with temperature, which manifests as diffuse slip traces and less localized pile-up patterns. Surface morphologies obtained at 300 K are consistent with atomic force microscopy observations, validating the atomistic modeling approach. At elevated temperatures, enhanced dislocation recovery and redistribution of slip pathways dominate the indentation response, highlighting the role of thermal activation in controlling plasticity in hcp titanium.</description>

      <title>Selective nonthermal melting in phlogopite under ultrafast energy deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phlogopite is a complex magnesium-rich mineral from the dark mica group, KMg$_3$(AlSi$_3$O$_{10}$)(OH)$_2$. Its response to ultrafast excitation of its electronic system is studied using a hybrid model that combines tight-binding molecular dynamics with transport Monte Carlo and the Boltzmann equation. Simulations predict that at the deposited dose of ~0.17 eV/atom (electronic temperature $T_e$~11,000 K), the first hydrogens start to migrate in the otherwise preserved lattice, transiently turning mica into a superionic state. At the dose of ~0.4 eV/atom ($T_e$~13,000 K), Mg atoms start to diffuse like a liquid within stable sublattices of other elements, suggesting a superionic-superionic phase transition. At a dose of approximately 0.5 eV/atom ($T_e$~14,000 K), the entire atomic lattice destabilizes, disordering on picosecond timescale. It is accompanied by the formation of defect energy levels inside the bandgap. At the doses ~0.9 eV/atom ($T_e$~16,000 K), the bandgap completely collapses, turning the material metallic (electronically conducting). At even higher doses, nonthermal acceleration of atoms heats the atomic system at ultrafast timescales; K and O elements are most affected, accelerating within a few tens of femtoseconds.</description>

      <title>Evidence of electronic instability driven structural distortion in the nodal line semimetal CoSn$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms that drive spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in correlated electron systems is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Although such symmetry breaking phases have been studied in low-dimensional and strongly correlated materials, its emergence in structurally simpler compounds remains less explored. Here, we investigate non-magnetic CoSn$_2$ that is a centrosymmetric intermetallic compound crystallizing in a tetragonal structure at ambient conditions, and discover an electronically driven symmetry breaking instability. Electrical resistivity reveals a distinct change in the slope below 25 K, deviating from the expected Bloch-Gr\"uneisen behavior. This anomaly is attributed towards a structural change as at 22 K single crystal X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation uncovers weak superlattice reflections that leads to a doubling of $\textbf{a}$ and $\textbf{c}$, resulting in a 4-fold superstructure. The symmetry of the lattice reduces from tetragonal to acentric monoclinic but without any discernible monoclinic distortion down to 10 K. This structural transition is accompanied by a twofold symmetry in angular magnetoresistance, contrasting the fourfold symmetry observed at higher temperatures. First-principles calculations show no phonon softening but reveal enhanced electronic susceptibility, suggesting an electronic instability. Polarization-dependent ARPES measurements further identify a strong orbital anisotropy dominated by the in-plane Co-$d_{xy}$ states. Collectively, our results point to an electronic instability driven structural distortion in CoSn$_2$, offering a rare platform to study symmetry breaking in a non-magnetic metallic system.</description>

      <title>Trace Element Behavior during Shock Transformation of Zircon to Reidite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large single crystals of natural zircon were shock-loaded at 13.6 and 51.3 GPa in planar geometry. No structural changes were observed after loading at 13.6 GPa. Loading to 51.3 GPa resulted in zircon transformation to a denser scheelite-structured phase, reidite. The investigation of reidite samples by X-ray diffraction, Raman, photo- and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies revealed segregation of some trace cations (such as REE) on planar defects during the transformation. The segregation has occurred in a laboratory experiment without long-term annealing after the shock loading. A possible mechanism of the segregation of trivalent trace cations assumes local violation of charge balance during the zircon-reidite reconstructive transformation, which is accompanied by changes in the topology of polyhedra and second coordination spheres (Si-Zr). This results in expulsion of a fraction of the trace elements into energetically expensive interstitial positions with high diffusivity even at relatively low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Crystal Structure Prediction Using Data-Derived Potentials: High-Pressure Binary Hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structures can be predicted from first-principles using ab initio random structure searching AIRSS and density functional theory (DFT). AIRSS provides a method to sample the potential energy landscape and DFT provides a robust and accurate description of that landscape. Classical interatomic potentials can describe energy landscapes at a significantly lower computational cost, typically at the expense of robustness and accuracy. Modern machine-learning interatomic potentials offer a compromise, with greater robustness and accuracy than classical potentials at a fraction of the computational cost of DFT. In this work, we use Ephemeral Data-Derived Potentials EDDPs to perform accelerated AIRSS calculations for the binary hydrides at 100 GPa. Since the training data is generated iteratively using AIRSS, the searches can be performed with no prior knowledge of hydrides. These potentials allow for more diverse searches, sampling a wider range of compositions, larger unit cells, and orders-of-magnitude more structures. In addition to recovering many of the known structures, the searches reveal structures such as the hydrogen-rich phases of H$_{22}$(BrH), H$_{23}$Pb, and H$_{32}$Mg, supermolecular phases of H$_{25}$Cs and H$_{26}$Rn, and many substoichiometric variants of known hydrides. Our results indicate that using the current generation of pretrained universal MLIPs to search for novel high-pressure hydrides is less effective due to model instabilities or markedly slower inference speeds and highlight the necessity of generating new, targeted data to drive further discoveries.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and polarization switching in quasi-one-dimensional organic ferroelectrics of phenyltetrazole family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudospin models are proposed for description of the phase transitions, dielectric characteristics, and polarization switching in two crystals of the phenyltetrazole family. One of them, APHTZ, is a canted ferroelectric, whereas the other, MPHTZ is a simple antiferroelectric. In APHTZ the electric field, applied perpendicularly to the axis of spontaneous polarization, flips the polarization in one of the two sublattices, effectively rotating the non-zero net polarization by 90$^\circ$ and switching the system between two different ferroelectric configurations. The temperature-electric field phase diagrams are constructed. The diagram topology appears to be typical for the Ising-like antiferroelectric systems.</description>

Abstract: The incorporation of o-MAX phases, characterized by out-of-plane atomic arrangements, provides valuable extensions to the MAX phase family, driven by their superior thermomechanical properties, which are suitable for high-temperature applications. In this research, three novel o-MAX phases, Mo2A2AlC3 (A = Zr, Nb, Ta), have been newly explored, and their structural geometry, electronic properties, mechanical behavior, thermodynamic characters, and optical response have been comprehensively investigated employing density functional theory (DFT) for the first time.</description>

      <title>Field-free superconducting diode effect of NbSe2 induced by strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting diodes, similar to semiconductor diodes, possess unidirectional superconducting properties and are the fundamental units for constructing superconducting quantum computing, thus attracting widespread attention. At present, most of superconducting diodes require an external magnetic field or proximity effect to break time reversal symmetry (TRS). The cases of intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) under zero magnetic field are relatively scarce, and there are still some puzzles especially regarding the reasons for the TRS breaking. Here, we not only report field free SDE in NbSe2 induced by strain, but also large values of the difference of Ic+ and |Ic-| ({\Delta}Ic) of 286 {\mu}A and the superconducting diode efficiency ({\eta}) of 6.76 % are achieved. Interestingly, {\Delta}Ic varies with the magnetic field and exhibits two distinct evolutionary behaviors with B-odd or B-even symmetry in various devices. We attribute this to the selective activation of two independent, spatially-orthogonal mechanisms: a stress-induced real-space polarity and a field-induced reciprocal-space asymmetric energy bands. In general, we propose an extremely effectively method to produce field free SDE, even when the material itself does not possess field free SDE, and provide new perspectives to understand the SDE which build new avenues for superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Domain Boundaries in a Metallic Distortive Polar Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23831v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar metals are an underexplored material class combining two properties that are typically incompatible, namely a polar crystal structure and reasonable electrical conductivity. While intriguing given that metals favor centrosymmetry, these materials also exhibit potential functional properties relevant to memory, optoelectronic, catalytic, and other applications. The distortive polar metal (DPM) subclass forms through a centrosymmetry-lifting phase transformation into a polar crystal structure. In the process, domains with uniform geometric polar directions form, oftentimes separated by domain boundaries with polarity discontinuities arranged in "charged" head-to-head (H-H) or tail-to-tail (T-T) morphologies. To date, only metallic oxide DPM microstructures have been studied. Here we reveal in the intermetallic DPM Mn5Al8 different chemical reactivity and surface interactions at domain boundaries depending on their H-H or T-T character. Variable surface electron-transfer reactivity suggests localized changes in electronic work functions due to an increase (H-H) or depletion (T-T) in the electronic density of states. This behavior is unintuitive in a metal where electrostatic de-polarizing fields should not account for fluctuations in carrier densities. These findings suggest that metallic DPMs may offer functionalizable domain boundary behavior and deserve increased attention. Metallic DPMs allow highly tunable chemistries that can undergo various thermomechanical processing and transformation protocols. Ultimately, this study marks a milestone in metal physics and uncovers novel intermetallic properties, propelling the discovery and design of advanced electronic materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Twinning Relationships in Coexisting Cubic and Tetragonal Phases of Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many ferroelectric materials undergo thermally driven transitions between cubic and tetragonal phases. Despite being well-known for decades, such transitions still pose unresolved questions, particularly about the role of domains in shaping the transition pathway. It is understood that tetragonal domain assemblages are crucial for mismatch-free coexistence of both tetragonal and cubic phases, as described by the Weschler-Lieberman-Read (WLR) crystallographic theory. However, direct experimental characterization of domain patterns during the phase transition remains challenging. Here, we enhance the single-crystal X-ray diffraction to investigate domain microstructures during cubic-tetragonal phase transition, leveraging the bulk-penetrating and non-destructive character of this method. We extend the WLR model by the analytical expressions for the orientation relationships between the real and reciprocal bases of the cubic phase and tetragonal domains. We systematically catalogue the Bragg peak separations for 24 possible coexistence variants and validate these predictions using 3D reciprocal space maps from a piezo-/ferroelectric PMN-35PT crystal at phase coexistence temperatures. Our results provide a framework for interpreting domain configurations during the phase transition and offer insights applicable to other systems involving orientation relationships in coexisting phases.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced Dynamic Spin-Phonon Coupling in Epitaxial RuO2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic order parameters in altermagnets can couple to quantized lattice vibration via both piezomagnetic and magnetoelastic effects, leading to the renormalization of phonon dispersion. Here, we demonstrate photo-induced dynamic frequency modulation of THz phonons excited in anisotropically-strained epitaxial RuO2 thin films using ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy and time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect measurement. A coherent oscillation of a transverse acoustic phonon appears in the sub-THz range with increasing film thickness above 4 nm due to local dislocation arising from the anisotropic strain relaxation, which hosts large non-zero shear strain. Interestingly, this phonon mode exhibits a time-varying mode hardening below ~ 500 K. Furthermore, an optical phonon oscillation emerges in magnetization dynamics of the photo-induced non-equilibrium state, and it becomes significantly softened near the critical temperature, while there is no observable magneto-optic signal in fully-strain-relaxed films. Such notable dynamic frequency modulations in acoustic and optical phonons offer an opportunity to manipulate phonons in the THz range through the spin-phonon coupling controlled by epitaxial design, which can inspire the new class of altermagnetic applications in the ultrafast quantum opto-spintronics.</description>

      <title>C-BerryTrans: A C++ code for first-principles calculation of Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present C-BerryTrans, a C++ code designed for first-principles calculations of Berry-curvature-driven transverse transport properties, namely the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) i.e., $\sigma_{\mu \nu}^{AHC}$ and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) i.e., $\alpha_{\mu \nu}^{ANC}$. The code directly extracts eigenvalues and momentum-matrix elements from WIEN2k calculations and evaluates the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) using a Kubo-like formalism. For computational efficiency, C-BerryTrans parallelizes $\boldsymbol\Omega$ evaluation over k-points using OpenMP and stores band-resolved curvature in binary format. This design enables rapid post-processing of AHC and ANC over a wide range of temperatures and chemical potentials ($\mu$) in a single run. The code has been benchmarked on well-studied ferromagnetic materials (Fe, Fe$_3$Ge, Pd, Fe$_3$Al, and Co$_2$FeAl). For Fe, the $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$775 ($\sim$744) $S/cm$ at 0 (300) K. In case of Fe$_3$Ge, the calculated value of $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is found to be 311 $S/cm$ at the room temperature. Nextly, for Co$_2$FeAl, the magnitude of computed value of $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ at 2 K is found to be $\sim$56 $S/cm$. Next, magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for Pd is obtained to be $\sim$0.97 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K. For Fe$_3$Al, the maximum magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for $T\leq$500 K is computed as $\sim$2.83 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$. Lastly, for Co$_2$FeAl, the value of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$0.10 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K. These results show good agreement with previously reported data. With its accuracy, scalability, and user-friendly workflow, C-BerryTrans provides a powerful tool for exploring $\boldsymbol\Omega$-driven transport phenomena and is well suited for high-throughput materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Effect of Tube Radius on the Adsorption of Chlorothalonil on Single-Walled Carbon and Boron Nitride Nanotube Surfaces: A Theoretical Study for Environmental Remediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the interaction of the pesticide chlorothalonil (CLT) with single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) using density functional theory (DFT) with the SIESTA code. Structural, energetic, and electronic analyses were used to characterize adsorption on nanotube surfaces. The adsorption energy becomes more favorable as the tube radius increases, consistent with enhanced pi-pi stacking on less curved surfaces. Both CNTs and BNNTs physisorb CLT; however, BNNTs appear more promising for CLT detection and removal in contaminated environments. The tube radius strongly affects the computed electronic and energetic descriptors. Complementary molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS confirm the stability of CLT adsorbed on CNT and BNNT surfaces in aqueous solution.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cu-doped NiO thin films were deposited on ITO substrates via spray pyrolysis at 450 {\deg}C for 1.5 minutes. XRD confirmed a cubic NiO structure, with Cu incorporation reducing crystallite size, increasing interplanar spacing, and expanding the lattice parameter, indicating successful substitution of Cu ions. Optical analysis showed a slight bandgap reduction from 3.70 to 3.65 eV, while PL revealed lower emission intensity, suggesting enhanced defect states and suppressed carrier recombination. Raman spectroscopy exhibited redshifts in LO, 2TO, and 2LO modes and the disappearance of the TO mode, confirming lattice distortion from Cu doping. Gas sensing tests under ambient and LPG conditions demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity and voltage-dependent response for doped films. These results establish that Cu incorporation enhances charge transport and gas interaction mechanisms, making Cu-doped NiO films highly promising for efficient and reliable gas sensors.</description>

      <title>Demagnetization-Driven Nanoscale Chirality-Selective Thermal Switch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral-lattice degrees of freedom can offer novel chirality-selective functionalities for thermotronic applications. Chiral phonons, carrying both heat and angular momentum, can emerge through a breaking of chiral degeneracy in the phonon bands, either via an intrinsic chiral crystal structure or by angular momentum transfer from photons or spins. This chiral controllability of the lattice dynamics enables a design of chiral thermo-devices by integrating ferromagnets with chiral materials. Here, we present a nanoscale chirality-selective thermal switch realized using a simple heterostructure composed of ferromagnetic [Co/Pt] multilayers and insulating chiral $\alpha$-SiO2, where an external magnetic field can control thermal transport properties. Our experimental results based on the magneto-optic thermometry reveal that the thermal conductivity of $\alpha$-SiO2 exhibits a clear dependence on both the magnetization direction of [Co/Pt] multilayers and the structural chirality of $\alpha$-SiO2, which is supported well by the first-principles-based molecular dynamic simulations. The magnetization-dependent thermal on/off ratio amounts to 1.07 at room temperature and increases to about 1.2 as temperature decreases to 50 K, due to a reduction of Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering rate in $\alpha$-SiO2. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration of the nanoscale chirality-selective thermal switch based on the ferromagnetic/chiral material heterostructure, highlighting its potential as a key technology for addressing heat dissipation challenges in nanoscale electronic devices.</description>

      <title>The role of the solid-melt interface in accelerating the self-catalyzed growth kinetics of III-V semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-melt interfaces play a pivotal role in governing crystal growth and metal-mediated epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) and other semiconductor materials. Using atomistic simulations based on machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we uncover that multiple layers of Ga atoms at the GaN-Ga melt interface form structurally ordered and electronically charged configurations that are critical for the growth kinetics of GaN. These ordered layers modulate the free energy landscape (FEL) for N adsorption and substantially reduce the migration barriers for N at the interface compared to a clean GaN surface. Leveraging these interfacial energetics, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations reveal that GaN growth follows a diffusion-controlled, layer-by-layer mechanism, with the FEL for N adsorption emerging as the rate-limiting factor. By incorporating facet-specific FELs and the diffusivity/solubility of N in Ga melt, we develop a predictive, fitting-free transport model that estimates facet-dependent growth rates in the range of ~0.01 to 0.04 nm/s, in agreement with experimental growth rates observed in GaN nanoparticles synthesized by Ga-mediated molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). This multiscale framework offers a generalizable and quantitative approach to link atomic-scale ordering and interfacial energetics to macroscopic phenomena, providing actionable insights for the rational design of metal-mediated epitaxial processes.</description>

      <title>Bromine-methanol etching of semiconductor crystals $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ with different selenium concentrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of the selenium concentration in the composition of the $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ semiconductor crystals on their etching with a bromine-methanol solution was studied. A thermodynamic model is proposed to describe the degree of etching of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ and $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals. A thermodynamic law is obtained for the first time to describe the change in the etching rate of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals with different selenium concentrations. Experimental dependencies are constructed for etching trajectories and etching rates with 5% bromine-methanol solutions of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystal samples with nominal $x\sim 0.1$ and selenium concentrations of $y=0$, $y=0.02$, $y=0.06$, and $y=0.1$. The average etching rates were 24${\mu }$m/min, 18${\mu }$m/min, 15${\mu }$m/min, and 13${\mu }$m/min. The threshold effect of a strong decrease in the etching rate upon transition from ternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ to quaternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals, associated with hardening of the crystal structure, is identify and theoretically explained. The obtained experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates and will be useful for choosing the optimal regimes of crystal treatment.</description>

      <title>Detection of magnetic monopole in image potential states of topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles, hypothetical particles behaving as isolated magnetic charges, have long been predicted by theories beyond the standard model but remain elusive in experimental detection. In this study, we demonstrate a novel method to induce and detect magnetic monopoles on the surface of three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By applying a radially distributed electric field via the STM tip to induce an image magnetic monopole using the topological magnetoelectric (TME) effect, we observe electric field-dependent intrinsic splitting peaks of image potential states (IPS) on the surface of a 3D high-order TI Bi(111). These IPS splitting phenomena originate from the Zeeman effect of the orbital magnetic moments interacting with the magnetic field generated by the magnetic monopoles. Our experimental results, supported by theoretical modeling, successfully demonstrate the detection of magnetic monopole. This work not only deepens our understanding of topological field theory and axion insulators but also opens new avenues for detecting and manipulating magnetic monopoles. The findings suggest that similar studies can be extended to other topological insulator systems, offering potential applications in quantum computing and novel electronic devices.</description>

      <title>The influence of solute induced memory on interface migration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interface migration governs microstructural evolution during phase transformations and grain growth thereby dictating those material properties that depend on microstructure. Recent work continues to highlight the rich range of behaviors exhibited by migrating interfaces and the complex connection between these behaviors and the underlying atomistic processes that determine coarse-grained interfacial mobility. For interfaces moving at low homologous temperatures and small driving forces, we show that significant non-Markovian effects can arise that invalidate commonly used analysis methods. Specifically, we demonstrate that solute can act as a source of such non-Markovian motion. In turn, we introduce a time-local (TCL) propagator approach to account for memory-dominated short and intermediate time interface dynamics. This approach extrapolates to the long time diffusive limit, enabling robust mobility estimates from simulation windows far shorter than those required to observe linear scaling directly. Comparison with solute-free boundaries validates the method and quantifies solute drag in the Cahn-Hillert sense, providing a route to extract drag coefficients and effective mobilities across a range of solute concentrations. Our results demonstrate that analysis including memory is essential for connecting atomistic simulations to continuum models and offer a practical framework for studying interface kinetics in systems with slow internal processes.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of hydrogen-bonded metal inorganic-organic complex glasses by ligand-tuning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal inorganic-organic complex (MIOC) crystals are a new category of hybrid glass formers. However, the glass-forming compositions of MIOC crystals are limited due to lack of both a general design principle for such compositions and a deep understanding of the structure and formation mechanism for MIOC glasses. This work reports a general approach for synthesizing glass-forming MIOC crystals. In detail, the principle of this approach is based on the creation of hydrogen-bonded structural network by substituting acid anions for imidazole or benzimidazole ligands in the tetrahedral units of zeolitic imidazolate framework crystals. By tuning the metal centers, anions, and organic ligands of MIOCs, supramolecular unit structures can be designed to construct supramolecular networks and thereby enable property modulation. Furthermore, mixed-ligand synthesis yielded a mixed-crystal system in which the glass-transition temperature (Tg) can be linearly tuned from 282 K to 360 K through gradual substitution of benzimidazole for imidazole. Interestingly, upon vitrification, MIOCs were observed to undergo reorganization of hydrogen-bonded networks, with retention of tetrahedral units, short-range disorder, and the freezing of multiple conformations. This work offers a new strategy to systematically expand the glass-forming compositional range of MIOCs and to develop functional MIOC glasses.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Polar Landscapes in Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrTiO3 is a textbook quantum paraelectric, with ferroelectricity purportedly suppressed by quantum fluctuations of ionic positions down to the lowest temperatures. The precise real space structure of SrTiO3 at low temperature, however, has remained undefined despite decades of study. Here we directly image the low-temperature polar structure of quantum parelectric SrTiO3, using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy down to 20 K. High resolution imaging reveals a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains of finite polarization. The short-range polar domains first grow and self-organize into a periodic structure over tens of nanometers. However, the process reverses when entering the quantum paraelectric regime below 40 K and the periodically ordered polar nanodomains fragment into small clusters.</description>

      <title>Electrical resistivity of microstructural components in Al-Mg-Si alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Al-Mg-Si alloys are utilized in large scale electrical conduction applications thanks to their low density, high strength, and low electrical resistivity. The alloying elements, Mg and Si, are introduced to improve the mechanical strength; however, the formed defects also suppress electrical conductivity, adversely affecting the material performance. Here, we investigate the impact of alloying, heat treatment, and the corresponding microstructure, on the electrical resistivity of overaged alloys having 0.5-9.5 at. % solute. The crystal structure, composition, and microstructure are characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The electrical resistivity of the microstructural components, i.e., the Al solid solution matrix and the Si and Mg2Si precipitates, are directly measured using a microscale four-point probe setup inside a scanning electron microscope. We find that the Al solid solution matrix is up to 15 % more resistive than pure Al, depending on the heat treatment rather than the composition, and that regions including Si or Mg2Si precipitates are equally resistive. Additionally, the bulk alloy resistivity, measured conventionally on a macroscopic length scale, increases linearly up to 60 % with increasing total solute concentration up to ~ 10 at. %. This study relates the electrical resistivity of Al-Mg-Si alloys, measured at microscopic and macroscopic length scales, with their microstructure and composition.</description>

      <title>Light in Slices: How to Enable Precise Laser Processing?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.</description>

      <title>Universal Numerical Simulation Model for Laser Material Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High power lasers are used for a variety of manufacturing processes on time and length scales that cover many orders of magnitude and on different materials. The variety of processes achievable through laser-material interaction results from numerous coupled, nonlinear physical phenomena. Simulation models can be used to gain process understanding, explain experimentally observed phenomena, and optimize or design processes. However, the inherent complexity and diversity of the phenomena make modeling a challenging task.
  Within this chapter, a universal model is presented that accurately simulates a broad spectrum of processes, including welding, additive manufacturing, cutting, ablation, drilling, and surface structuring, encompassing both continuous wave and ultrashort pulsed lasers and their interaction with various materials. Starting from the fundamental principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, a continuum mechanical framework is introduced that captures the main multiphysical effects. A numerical solution using the Finite Volume Method is presented and validated against benchmark problems where detailed experimental data are available. Macroscopic examples with continuous wave lasers include keyhole drilling and collapse under stationary illumination as well as melt pool dynamics and pore formation in copper welding. At the microscopic level, copper ablation with femtosecond pulses is simulated.
  Finally, a set of real-world applications is shown, where the model helps to explain and optimize industrial phenomena and defects. Examples include deep penetration welding of steel with dynamic beam shaping, multilayer additive manufacturing via powder bed fusion, and ultrashort pulsed drilling of micro vias in dielectric materials.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Surrogate Constitutive Models for Viscoplastic Creep Simulation of HT-9 Steel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic microstructure-informed constitutive models for the mechanical response of polycrystals are a cornerstone of computational materials science. However, as these models become increasingly more complex - often involving coupled differential equations describing the effect of specific deformation modes - their associated computational costs can become prohibitive, particularly in optimization or uncertainty quantification tasks that require numerous model evaluations. To address this challenge, surrogate constitutive models that balance accuracy and computational efficiency are highly desirable. Data-driven surrogate models, that learn the constitutive relation directly from data, have emerged as a promising solution. In this work, we develop two local surrogate models for the viscoplastic response of a steel: a piecewise response surface method and a mixture of experts model. These surrogates are designed to adapt to complex material behavior, which may vary with material parameters or operating conditions. The surrogate constitutive models are applied to creep simulations of HT-9 steel, an alloy of considerable interest to the nuclear energy sector due to its high tolerance to radiation damage, using training data generated from viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) simulations. We define a set of test metrics to numerically assess the accuracy of our surrogate models for predicting viscoplastic material behavior, and show that the mixture of experts model outperforms the piecewise response surface method in terms of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We study experimentally and theoretically optical absorption spectra of neodymium ferroborate in the temperature range $6-32$ K. We show that the temperature dependences of integral intensities of absorption lines demonstrate qualitatively different behavior for $\sigma$- and $\pi$-polarizations of the light. We suggest that this behavior may be caused by the appearance of a spiral magnetic structure in the compound under study. To describe the temperature dependences of lines intensities we propose a theoretical model which takes into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction between Nd$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ ions.</description>

      <title>A modular framework for collaborative human-AI, multi-modal and multi-beamline synchrotron experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-throughput materials discovery and studies of complex functional materials increasingly rely on multi-modal characterization performed at synchrotron light sources. However, measurements are typically done with no use of data until after an experiment, neglecting opportunities for data-driven insights to guide measurements. We developed a modular, open-source framework that incorporates artificial intelligence within the Bluesky control and data streaming infrastructure at NSLS-II, enabling real-time orchestration of multi-beamline, multi-modal experiments. AI agents perform on-the-fly reduction, clustering, Gaussian process modelling, and Bayesian optimization driven data acquisition, while users monitor agent behavior and visualize results live. Combinatorial libraries of the ternary Al-Ni-Pt system were spatially mapped by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at the PDF and BMM beamlines, respectively. Dynamic switching between AI-driven and conventional grid mapping strategies was achieved, demonstrating the flexible workflows possible through this framework. A digital twin constructed from a simulated Al-Li-Fe oxide dataset shows that AI-driven mapping strategies outperform conventional mapping as well as random sampling by prioritizing measurements that better resolve both phase boundaries and localized minority phases. This framework supports plug-and-play capabilities, and establishes a foundation for routine multi-modal, AI-assisted large-scale user-facility operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple 'shift-and-add' based improvement in the angular resolution of single electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns. Sub-pixel image registration is used to measure the (sub-pixel) difference in projection parameters for patterns collected within a map, and then the pattern is shifted and added together. The resultant EBSD-pattern is shown to contain more angular information than a long-exposure single pattern, via 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based analysis. In particular, this method has the potential to enhance the scope of small compact direct electron detectors (DEDs).</description>

      <title>Geometric Frustration Directs the Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles with Crystallized Ligand Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer-grafted nanoparticles are versatile building blocks that self-assemble into a rich diversity of mesostructures. Coarse-grained molecular simulations have commonly accompanied experiments by resolving structure formation pathways and predicting phase behavior. Past simulations represented nanoparticles as spheres and the ligands as flexible chains of beads, isotropically tethered to the nanoparticles. Here, we investigate a different minimal coarse-grained model. The model consists of an attractive rod tethered to a repulsive sphere. The motivation of this rod-sphere model is to describe nanospheres with a partially crystallized, stretched polymeric bundle, as well as other complex building blocks such as rigid surfactants and end-tethered nanorods. Varying the ratio of sphere size to rod radius stabilizes self-limited clusters and other mesostructures of reduced dimensionality. The complex phase behavior we observe is a consequence of geometric frustration.</description>

Abstract: We study self-energy effects, induced by strong magnetic fluctuations in paramagnetic phase of strongly-correlated itinerant magnets within the density functional theory combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT approach) and its non-local extension. As concrete examples, we consider $\alpha$-iron, half metal CrO$_2$, van der Waals material CrTe$_2$, and altermagnet CrSb. We show that both local and non-local magnetic correlations yield splitting of the electronic spectrum in the paramagnetic phase, such that it closely resembles the DFT band structure in the ordered phase. The relative importance of non-local vs. local correlations depends on the proximity to half filling of $d$ states: closer to half filling, the role of local correlations increases. Although the obtained split bands do not possess a certain spin projection, their splitting suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The obtained electronic states are also expected to be easily spin polarized by a weak external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Twist-Free Enhancement of Strength and Modulus in Electrospun Yarns via Liquid-Assisted Capillary Densification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrospun yarns often fall short of the strength and stiffness of their constituent nanofibers because of loose packing and inter-fiber slip. We report a simple, twist-free route to close this gap by liquid-assisted rolling: yarns are briefly wetted (water or ethanol) and subjected to gentle rolling action (mechanical strokes perpendicular and parallel to the yarn axis), then dried under controlled conditions so that meniscus forces compact the assembly into tightly bound bundles. The treatment yields large gains in tensile strength and modulus, and as yarn diameter decreases the properties of liquid-treated yarns approach single-fiber limits, indicating more efficient load transfer. Dry-rolling controls produce negligible changes compared to as-spun yarns, confirming that capillarity-driven consolidation, rather than mechanical pressing, dominates the improvement. Water consistently outperforms ethanol, reflecting its larger elastocapillary driving term gamma*(1 + cos theta) on PAN and thus stronger capillary compaction; a short post-treatment anneal near Tg further increases stiffness with a corresponding reduction in ductility. To rationalize these trends, we quantify microstructure via SEM-derived alignment and packing density and show that these complementary descriptors jointly explain variability in mechanical response. A compact constitutive framework, grounded in distributed fiber recruitment and adhesion/frictional contact, captures the observed strengthening-ductility trade-off across processing routes. The results establish capillarity-driven consolidation as a scalable pathway to engineer processing-structure-property relationships in hierarchical polymer fiber assemblies and provide practical guidance for upgrading electrospun yarns, alone or as precursors to twisted and composite architectures.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Proximate to Non-Abelian Fractional Spin Hall Insulator in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ near two-degree twists has emerged as a platform for exotic correlated topological phases, including ferromagnetism and a non-Abelian fractional spin Hall insulator. Here we reveal the unexpected emergence of an intervalley superconducting phase that intervenes between these two states in the half-filled second moir\'{e} bands. Using a continuum model and exact diagonalization, we identify superconductivity through multiple signatures: negative binding energy, a dominant pair-density eigenvalue, finite superfluid stiffness, and pairing symmetry consistent with a time-reversal-symmetric nodal extended $s$-wave state. Remarkably, our numerical calculation suggests a continuous transition between superconductivity and the non-Abelian fractional spin Hall insulator, in which topology and symmetry evolve simultaneously, supported by an effective field-theory description. Our results establish higher moir\'{e} bands as fertile ground for intertwined superconductivity and topological order, and point to experimentally accessible routes for realizing superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin of the electron has been a key enabler to realize spintronics devices that harness the spin degree of freedom beyond conventional charge-based electronics. In addition to spin, electrons have another degree of freedom associated with the angular momentum: orbital angular momentum. While spintronics has evolved fast and spintronics concepts are now used in magnetic sensors and nonvolatile memories, exploiting orbital angular momentum has just started to be studied. Phenomena mediated by orbital angular momentum have led to a new branch of spintronics called orbitronics. This Perspective discusses how orbitronics can constitute the next step in the evolution of spintronics by reviewing the current understandings and experimental results of orbital effects and summarizing the open questions. Prospects and challenges for devices in particular in non-volatile memory are discussed as an applications perspective.</description>

      <title>ADAPT: Lightweight, Long-Range Machine Learning Force Fields Without Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials. First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However, these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Non-epitaxial perovskite polariton laser diode operating under direct current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaching lasing in electrically pumped microdevices based on solution-processed semiconductors poses a major scientific and technological challenge. Halide perovskites offer a promising platform for electrical injection, since their optically excited single-crystal cavities and predesigned or postprocessed microstructures have exhibited low lasing threshold. Indirect electrical pumping of a dual-cavity perovskite laser was recently obtained, utilizing a well-established technological concept of embedding a high-luminosity light-emitting diode (LED) with a high-gain medium into an integrated device. Direct charge-carrier injection into a perovskite LED excited by auxiliary short-, optical-pulses resulted into amplified spontaneous emission. Other efforts for rational engineering of architectures that allow for high charge-carrier density are still to demonstrate lasing. Here, we develop a novel strategy for achieving direct electrical pumping of a perovskite laser. We integrate a solution-grown CsPbBr3 microplate with chemically inert single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes and embed them into an optical microcavity. By cooling the microdevice down to 8 K at a constant current, a perovskite p-i-n diode is formed that facilitates a balanced carrier injection at high current densities. The perovskite microcavity diode operates in the strong coupling regime, exhibiting polariton lasing under a direct current of 65 uA.</description>

      <title>High-energy electron-beam induced defect engineering of monolayer MoS2 for tunable optical properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural defects in 2D-transition metal dichalcogenides are critical in modulating their optical and electrical behavior. Nevertheless, precise defect control within the monolayer regime poses a significant challenge. Herein, a high-energy (1MeV) electron beam irradiation strategy is harnessed to induce defects in monolayer MoS2. Controlled variation of electron-beam irradiation time tunes the defect density, as reflected by the evolution of defect-mediated photoluminescence characteristics. The optically active defect emission appearing at approx. 200-300meV below the A exciton at 85K exhibits a systematic increase in intensity with prolonged exposure and saturates at higher laser excitation power. Circular polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals strong suppression of valley polarization of the A exciton after irradiation. Complementary x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identifies enhanced Mo-O bonding signatures in MoS2 following irradiation. Kelvin probe force microscopy indicates the transition to p-type doping behaviour. A detailed temperature and power-dependent photoluminescence measurements further elucidate the optical behaviour of these defect states. Density functional theory calculations using these configurations establish that the transition between the conduction band and acceptor states within the bandgap accounts for the defect emission. This work presents a tunable route for defect engineering in monolayer TMDs, enabling controlled tailoring of their structural and optical properties for optoelectronic, electronic and valleytronic applications.</description>

Abstract: We develop a numerical approach based on the sinc basis set for first-principles electronic structure calculations in one-dimensional systems. The method exploits the inherent accuracy and non-local character of the sinc functions to handle long-range couplings effectively. As a proof of principle, we provide a computational study of a molecule in an optical cavity, with our code directly calculating the emergence of the energy level splitting in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy by design in superconducting Nb thin films via ultrashort pulse laser irradiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to fabricate anisotropic superconducting layers a la carte is desired in technologies such as fluxon screening or removal in field-resilient devices, flux lensing in ultra-sensitive sensors, or in templates for imprinting magnetic structures in hybrid magnetic/superconducting multilayers. In this work, we demonstrate tailored superconductivity in polycrystalline niobium thin films exposed to femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulses. The samples exhibit significant changes in their superconducting properties, directly connected with the observed topography, crystallite geometry, and lattice parameter modifications. On the mesoscopic scale, quasi-parallel periodic ripple structures (about 260 nm of spatial period) gradually form on the film surface by progressively increasing the laser energy per pulse, Ep. This gives way to a stepwise increase of the critical current anisotropy and magnetic flux channeling effects along the ripples. As demonstrated in our resistive and inductive measurements, these superstructures determine the electromagnetic response of the sample within the regime dominated by flux-pinning. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations corroborate the topographical origin of the customized anisotropy. Concurrently, intrinsic superconducting parameters (critical field and temperature) are moderately and isotropically depressed upon increasing Ep, as is the lattice parameter of Nb. These findings promote pulsed laser processing as a flexible, one-step, and scalable lithography-free technique for versatile surface functionalization in microelectronic superconducting technology.</description>

Abstract: The inverse design of materials with specific desired properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, represents a formidable challenge in materials science due to the vastness of chemical and structural space. We present a guided diffusion framework to accelerate the discovery of novel superconductors. A DiffCSP foundation model is pretrained on the Alexandria Database and fine-tuned on 7,183 superconductors with first principles derived labels. Employing classifier-free guidance, we sample 200,000 structures, which lead to 34,027 unique candidates. A multistage screening process that combines machine learning and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess stability and electronic properties, identifies 773 candidates with DFT-calculated $T_\mathrm{c}&gt;5$ K. Notably, our generative model demonstrates effective property-driven design. Our computational findings were validated against experimental synthesis and characterization performed as part of this work, which highlighted challenges in sparsely charted chemistries. This end-to-end workflow accelerates superconductor discovery while underscoring the challenge of predicting and synthesizing experimentally realizable materials.</description>

Abstract: Effectively tuning magnetic state by using current is essential for novel spintronic devices. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have shown superior properties for the applications of magnetic information storage based on the efficient spin torque effect. However, for most of known vdW ferromagnets, the ferromagnetic transition temperatures lower than room temperature strongly impede their applications and the room-temperature vdW spintronic device with low energy consumption is still a long-sought goal. Here, we realize the highly efficient room-temperature nonvolatile magnetic switching by current in a single-material device based on vdW ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. Moreover, the switching current density and power dissipation are about 300 and 60000 times smaller than conventional spin-orbit-torque devices of magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures. These findings make an important progress on the applications of magnetic vdW materials in the fields of spintronics and magnetic information storage.</description>

      <title>A defect-chemistry-informed phase-field model of grain growth in oxide ceramics: application to Fe-doped SrTiO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dopants can significantly affect the properties of oxide ceramics through their impact on the property-determined microstructure characteristics such as grain boundary (GB) segregation, space charge layer formation in the GB vicinity, and the grain growth deviating from normal patterns. To support the rational design of oxide ceramics, we propose a defect-chemistry-informed phase-field grain growth model to simulate the microstructure evolution of oxide ceramics. It fully respects the defect-chemistry theory by accounting for the distinct segregation energies and available site densities of charged point defects (oxygen vacancies and acceptor dopants) in both the grain interior and boundaries, and it considers the competing kinetics of defect diffusion and GB movement. The proposed phase-field model is benchmarked against well-known bicrystal models, including the Mott-Schottky and Gouy-Chapman models. Various simulation results are presented to reveal the effect of different defect-chemistry parameters on the space charge layer formation and key microstructural aspects. In particular, simulation results confirm that the solute drag effect alone can lead to skewed grain size distribution that do not follow the log-normal distribution, without any contribution from grain misorientation and other anisotropy. Interestingly, simulations also demonstrate that grain boundary potentials can vary substantially: GBs of larger grains tend to have lower potentials than those of smaller grains. Such heterogeneous GB potential distribution may inspire a new material optimization strategy through microstructure design. This study provides a comprehensive framework for defect-chemistry-consistent investigations of microstructure evolution in polycrystalline oxide ceramics, offering fundamental insights into microscopic processes during critical manufacturing stages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed time- and polarization-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy on topological Dirac semimetal candidate 1T-ZrTe$_2$. Excited states band mapping uncovers the previously inaccessible linear dispersion of the Dirac cone above the Fermi level. We study the orbital texture of bands using linear dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions. These observations provide hints on the topological character of 1T-ZrTe$_2$. Time-, energy- and momentum-resolved nonequilibrium carrier dynamics reveal that intra- and inter-band scattering processes play a capital role in the relaxation mechanism, leading to multivalley electron-hole accumulation near the Fermi level. We also show that electrons' inverse lifetime has a linear dependence on their binding energy. Our time- and polarization-resolved XUV photoemission results shed light on the excited state electronic structure of 1T-ZrTe$_2$ and provide valuable insights into the relatively unexplored field of quantum-state-resolved ultrafast dynamics in 3D topological Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>Quantitative study on anomalous Nernst effect in Co thin films by laser irradiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generates electromotive forces transverse to temperature gradients and has attracted much attention for potential applications into novel thermoelectric power generators. ANE efficiency is generally characterized by uniform temperature gradients in a steady state prepared by heaters. However, although focusing laser beams on a magnetic film can form much larger temperature gradients, the laser irradiation method has not been sufficiently considered for quantifying the ANE coefficient due to the difficulty in estimating the localized in-homogeneous temperature gradients. In this study, we present a quantitative study of ANE in Ru(5 nm)/Co($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$) ($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$ = 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, and 60 nm) bilayers on sapphire (0001) substrates by combining a laser irradiation approach with finite element analysis of temperature gradients under laser excitation. We find that the estimated ANE coefficients are consistent with previously reported values and one independently characterized using a heater. Our results also reveal the advantages of the laser irradiation method over the conventional method using heaters. Intensity-modulated laser beams can create ac temperature gradients as large as approximately 10$^3$ K/mm at a frequency of tens of kilohertz in a micrometer-scale region.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Softer Lattice Dynamics in Defect Engineered GeTe Crystals</title>

Abstract: The impact of Ge vacancies on the low-temperature lattice dynamics of single-crystalline GeTe was investigated through a comparative study of two off-stoichiometric samples: Ge$_{0.8}$Te (S$_1$) and Ge$_{0.88}$Te (S$_2$). X-ray diffraction confirms their highly oriented crystalline nature mainly along the $h0l$ plane, while temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals pronounced anharmonicity in S$_1$, indicated by stronger three-phonon scattering in the in-plane E-mode. A suppressed Raman feature at $~$ 239 $cm^{-1}$ in S$_2$ suggests fewer disordered GeTe$_{4-n}$Ge$_n$ tetrahedra, correlating with reduced Ge-Ge bonding signatures. Machine-Learned Molecular Dynamics (MLMD) simulations show dominant Te contributions below 100 $cm^{-1}$, while Ge dominates above, particularly influencing the 120 $cm^{-1}$ mode affected by defects at the Ge-site. Complementary calculation of phonon linewidth via MLMD and Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) methods affirm the predominance of three-phonon scattering below 300 K. Specific heat measurements, modeled using Debye-Einstein formalism, show lower Debye temperatures ($\theta_D$) of 172.3 $\pm$ 1.5 K in Ge$_{0.8}$Te and 176.6 $\pm$ 1.7 K for Ge$_{0.88}$Te respectively, confirming defect-induced lattice softening. Electrical resistivity analysis further corroborates this, indicating reduced effective phonon frequencies in $S_1$. Thus, our results establish that higher Ge vacancies lead to softer, and hence more anharmonic lattice dynamics in GeTe, with its relevance in designing superior thermoelectric and phase-change memory applications.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal lattice distortions inside crystalline Si upon sub-threshold femtosecond laser-induced excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industrial applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films or surface layers. However, real-world processing applications mostly are concerned with bulk materials, which prevents the use of x-ray surface based techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast x-ray dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon laser excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of thetemporal evolution of ultrafast distorted lattice depth profiles. We demonstrate the potential of UDD by studying a thin Si single crystal upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation. Our study reveals that below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions not only longitudinal, but also transversal to the propagation of the strain wave appear on picosecond time scales along the single crystal. The observation of this transversal deformation after laser excitation contradicts previous work that were not able to observed it, what could be related to the high sensitivity of dynamical diffraction with respect to the lattice distortions. The speed of propagation of this ultrafast transversal strain deformation is observed to be slower to the longitudinal sound speed for Si as described in the bibliography.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques is revolutionizing materials discovery, property prediction, and material design by minimizing human intervention and accelerating scientific progress. This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies in this field include deep learning, graph neural networks, Bayesian optimization, and automated generative models (GANs, VAEs). These approaches enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (AutoGluon, TPOT, and H2O.ai), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, combining AI with automated experimentation and computational modeling is transforming the way materials are discovered and optimized. This synergy paves the way for new innovations in energy, electronics, and nanotechnology.</description>

Abstract: LiGa$_5$O$_8$ with a cubic spinel type structure was recently reported to be a ultra-wide-band-gap semiconductor with unintentional p-type conduction. While the origin of p-type doping is still unclear, the fundamental properties of this material are of interest. Here we present a first-principles study of the phonons using density functional perturbation theory. The phonon band structures show no unstable modes verifying the stability of the structure. We focus mainly on the phonons at the Brillouin zone center for which a full symmetry analysis is presented. We present the dielectric function contributions from the infrared active modes as well as the Raman spectra and their polarization dependence. The phonon density of states integrated over the Brillouin zone is also presented as this may related to disordered Raman spectra.</description>

      <title>Cubic BeB$_2$: A metastable $p$-type conductive material from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boron forms a wide variety of compounds with alkaline earth elements due to its unique bonding characteristics. Among these, binary compounds of Be and B display particularly rich structural diversity, attributed to the small atomic size of Be. Cubic BeB$_2$ is a particularly interesting phase, where Be donates electrons to stabilize a diamond-like boron network under high pressure. In this work, we employ \textit{ab initio} methods to conduct a detailed investigation of cubic BeB$_2$ and its functional properties. We show that this metastable phase is dynamically stable under ambient conditions, and its lattice match to existing substrate materials suggests possible epitaxial stabilization via thin-film growth routes. Through a comprehensive characterization of its electronic, transport, and superconductivity properties, we demonstrate that cubic BeB$_2$ exhibits high hole concentrations and high hole mobility, making it a potential candidate for efficient $p$-type transport. In addition, cubic BeB$_2$ is found to exhibit low-temperature superconductivity at degenerate doping levels, similar to several other doped covalent semiconductors such as diamond, Si, and SiC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transverse thermoelectric effects interconvert charge and heat currents in orthogonal directions due to the breaking of either time-reversal symmetry or structural symmetry, enabling simple and versatile thermal energy harvesting and solid-state cooling/heating within single materials. In comparison to the complex module structures required for the conventional Seebeck and Peltier effects, the transverse thermoelectric effects provide the complete device structures, potentially resolving the fundamental issue of multi-module degradation of thermoelectric conversion performance. This review article provides an overview of all currently known transverse thermoelectric conversion phenomena and principles, as well as their characteristics, and reclassifies them in a unified manner. The performance of the transverse thermoelectric generator, refrigerator, and active cooler is formulated, showing that thermal boundary conditions play an essential role in discussion on their behaviors. Examples of recent application research and material development in transverse thermoelectrics are also introduced, followed by a discussion of future prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a theory that describes the time evolution of quantum mechanical many-electron systems under the influence of external time-dependent electric and magnetic fields. INQ is a specially designed software to efficiently solve the real-time TDDFT equations on graphics processing units (GPUs), which aim to overcome the computational limitation of time and size scales of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. In this work we will present an implementation of non-collinear TDDFT for the INQ code to simulate spin dynamics in real time and discuss the implementation of non-collinear magnetic effects into the code. We will discuss the implementation of exchange-correlation magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling, and the interaction between the electronic system and external magnetic fields. We will then consider several prototypical examples of spin dynamics in magnetic clusters and solids after light excitation. Potential applications range from the study of real-time dynamics of magnons to ultrafast spin dynamics under linear and circularly polarized laser excitation, as well as spectroscopic signatures such as magnetic circular dichroism and pump-probe Kerr rotation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the development of an instrument combining an ultrafast, high-repetition-rate, polarization-tunable monochromatic extreme ultraviolet (XUV, 21.6 eV) beamline and a next-generation momentum microscope endstation. This setup enables time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of quantum materials, offering multimodal photoemission dichroism capabilities. The momentum microscope simultaneously detects the full surface Brillouin zone over an extended binding energy range. It is equipped with advanced electron optics, including a new type of front lens that supports multiple operational modes. Enhanced spatial resolution is achieved by combining the small XUV beam footprint (33 $\mu$m by 45 $\mu$m) with the selection of small regions of interest using apertures positioned in the Gaussian plane of the momentum microscope. This instrument achieves an energy resolution of 44 meV and a temporal resolution of 144 fs. We demonstrate the capability to perform linear, Fourier, and circular dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions from photoexcited 2D materials. This functionality paves the way for time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved investigations of orbital and quantum geometrical properties underlying electronic structures of quantum materials driven out of equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the relationship between electric polarization modulation $\Delta P$ in ferroelectrics induced by a low-frequency pulsed electric field and the corresponding second harmonic intensity modulation $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Using nonlinear response theory, we derive their time-domain expressions linear in the pulse amplitude, revealing that not only the electric field but also its time derivative contributes to $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Furthermore, even when the time-derivative component is negligible, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can be in antiphase with the pulsed field and thus with $\Delta P$. These theoretical predictions are further supported by real-time simulations of a model for electronic ferroelectrics. Our results demonstrate that the commonly assumed relation $\Delta P \propto \Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can break down under certain conditions, reflecting the complex-valued and frequency-dependent nature of nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have become an indispensable tool for materials science, enabling the study of larger systems and longer timescales. State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge density is central to density functional theory (DFT), as it fully defines the ground-state properties of a material system. Obtaining it with high accuracy is a computational bottleneck. Existing machine learning models are constrained by trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Here, we introduce the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), which couples atoms and grids to integrate the strengths of grid-based and basis-function frameworks. EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1% error), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems. Building on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model covering the periodic table. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot performance across diverse systems, and generalizes beyond the training distribution, supporting downstream applications such as band structure calculations. By linking local chemical environments to charge densities, EAC-Net provides a scalable framework for accelerating electronic structure prediction and enabling high-throughput materials discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental objective of materials modeling is identifying atomic structures that align with experimental observables. Conventional approaches for disordered materials involve sampling from thermodynamic ensembles and hoping for an experimental match. This process is inefficient and offers no guarantee of success. We present a method based on modified molecular dynamics, that we call molecular augmented dynamics (MAD), which identifies structures that simultaneously match multiple experimental observables and exhibit low energies as described by a machine learning interatomic potential (MLP) trained from ab-initio data. We demonstrate its feasibility by finding representative structures of glassy carbon, nanoporous carbon, ta-C, a-C:D and a-CO$_x$ that match their respective experimental observables -- X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, pair distribution function and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data -- using the same initial structure and underlying MLP. The method is general, accepting any experimental observable whose simulated counterpart can be cast as a function of differentiable atomic descriptors. This method enables a computational "microscope" into experimental structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The L1_2-phase non-collinear antiferromagnet (AFM) Mn_3Ir has emerged as a pioneering platform for realizing the zero-field anomalous Hall effect (AHE), thereby catalyzing rapid advances in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Despite its significant potential, experimental investigations of the intrinsic magnetic and electronic properties of Mn_3Ir have been greatly hindered by the formidable challenges in growing bulk single crystals. Here, we report the growth of stoichiometric Mn_3Ir bulk single crystals and their characterization in terms of magnetization and the AHE. Using a high-throughput flux method, we obtained (111)-oriented hexagonal Mn_3Ir single crystals. A small AHE signal was detected, which we attribute to the coexistence of A- and B-type antiferromagnetic domains that mutually cancel the net AHE response. Our results reveal key aspects of the intrinsic magnetic properties and AHE in bulk Mn_3Ir, providing a critical material platform for the development of advanced spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>A basis-free, octonionic criterion for Weyl points in solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard ways of locating and characterizing Weyl points--Berry-flux integrals on small spheres and local $k\cdot p$ fits--are topologically sound but depend on user choices (sphere center/radius, gauge smoothing, surface charting, and Pauli-frame transport) that complicate high-throughput workflows. We introduce a local, basis-free criterion that avoids these knobs by using the octonionic geometry of $\operatorname{Im}\mathbb{O}\cong\mathbb{R}^7$. From a smooth two-band projector we build a unit octonion field $u(\mathbf{k})$ and its octonionic connection $\mathcal{A}_i=\operatorname{Im}(\bar u\,\partial_{k_i}u)$. Contracting the three directional derivatives with the $\mathrm{G}_2$-invariant three-form produces a pseudoscalar density whose sign gives the node's chirality. A companion quantity--the octonionic associator--vanishes at leading order precisely when the local three directions close inside an associative (quaternionic) three-plane; its smallness thus provides an intrinsic, pointwise self-consistency check that the two-band reduction is valid. The construction is invariant under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge changes of the two-band subspace and under $\mathrm{G}_2$ rotations of its completion, and it eliminates enclosing surfaces and gauge seams. In the linear regime the density reduces to the oriented volume set by the velocity matrix, thereby agreeing with the Chern number on a small sphere and with the chirality obtained from a $k\cdot p$ linearization. We outline a practical stencil-based algorithm compatible with Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians and demonstrate robustness to benign numerical choices, while providing an intrinsic warning signal near band entanglement or multi-fold touchings.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic defect intolerance in the ultra-pure metal PtSn$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-pure materials are highly valued as model systems for the study of intrinsic physics. Frequently, however, the crystal growth of such pristine samples requires significant optimization. PtSn$_4$ is a rare example of a material that naturally forms with a very low concentration of crystalline defects. Here, we investigate the origin of its low defect levels using a combination of electrical resistivity measurements, computational modeling, and scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. While typical flux-grown crystals of PtSn$_4$ can have residual resistivity ratios (RRRs) that exceed 1000, we show that even at the most extreme formation speeds, the RRR cannot be suppressed below 100. This aversion to defect formation extends to both the Pt and Sn sublattices, which contribute with equal weight to the conduction properties. Direct local imaging with scanning tunneling microscopy further substantiates the rarity of point defects, while the prohibitive energetic cost of forming a defect is demonstrated through density functional theory calculations. Taken together, our results establish PtSn$_4$ as an intrinsically defect-intolerant material, making it an ideal platform to study other properties of interest, including extreme magnetoresistance and topology.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Insights into Cu/amorphous-Ta$_x$N Interfacial Adhesion via Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: Effects of Stoichiometry and Interface Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate understanding and control of interfacial adhesion between Cu and Ta$_x$N diffusion barriers are essential for ensuring the mechanical reliability and integrity of Cu interconnect systems in semiconductor devices. Amorphous tantalum nitride (a-Ta$_x$N) barriers are particularly attractive due to their superior barrier performance, attributed to the absence of grain boundaries. However, a systematic atomistic investigation of how varying Ta stoichiometries influences adhesion strength at Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces remains lacking, hindering a comprehensive understanding of interface optimization strategies. In this study, we employ machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to perform steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces. We simultaneously evaluate three distinct interface construction approaches--static relaxation, high-temperature annealing, and simulated Cu deposition--to comprehensively investigate their influence on adhesion strength across varying Ta compositions ($x=1, 2, 4$). Peak force and work of adhesion values from SMD simulations quantitatively characterize interface strength, while atomic stress and strain analyses elucidate detailed deformation behavior, highlighting the critical role of interfacial morphologies. Additionally, we explore the atomistic mechanisms underlying cohesive failure, revealing how targeted incorporation of Ta atoms into Cu layers enhances the cohesive strength of the interface. This study demonstrates how MLIP-driven simulations can elucidate atomic-scale relationships between interface morphology and adhesion behavior, providing insights that can guide future atomistic engineering strategies toward enhancing intrinsic barrier adhesion, potentially enabling liner-free interconnect technologies.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Controlled Planar Guided Crystallization of Low-Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar guided crystallization, a novel method for programming the growth of optically homogeneous low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure optically uniform crystalline properties across devices is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>FeTaX2: A ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the van der Waals layered ternary transition metal chalcogenides FeTa$X_2$ ($X=$ S, Se, Te) as a new family of ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulators with a sizable bulk gap and high Chern number $C=-2$. The magnetic order arises primarily from Fe atoms, whose strong ferromagnetic exchange induces moments on neighboring Ta sites. The large topological gap originates from a \emph{deep} $s$-$d$-type band inversion between spin-down Ta $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xy}$ orbitals near the Fermi level-a mechanism unique to $d$-orbital systems. Remarkably, the Curie temperature of monolayer FeTa$X_2$ is predicted to significantly exceed that of monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Furthermore, both the Curie temperature and topological gap scale positively with the spin-orbit coupling strength of the $d$ electrons, suggesting a common physical origin. Owing to its structural similarity to Fe$X$ superconductors and reduced net magnetization, FeTa$X_2$ further offers a promising platform for realizing chiral topological superconductivity. These findings, if realized experimentally, could open new avenues for the research and application of topological quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Insights into Ionic Diffusion in C-S-H Gel Pore from Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Spatial Distributions, Energy Barriers, and Structural Descriptor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to many natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its molecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate Na, Cl, and water diffusion inside a 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging from 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of diffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the pore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of activation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel, showing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural analysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to hydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the pore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was introduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and molecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond approximately 1 nm, suppressed diffusivities were well captured by an empirical model inspired by the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of transport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena and suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry of cementitious gels, for example surface coordination environments, pore size distributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress ionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.</description>

      <title>Fully quantum perturbative description of correlated Stokes--anti-Stokes scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes--anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that a four-wave mixing-like correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation and completely characterizes the non-resonant SaS photon pair production. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.</description>

      <title>Multiple Topological Phases Controlled via Strain in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22474v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) are an emergent class of magnetic materials that combine properties of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, exhibiting spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and zero net magnetic moment due to combined time-reversal and crystal symmetry. Here, we construct a Kondo-lattice model on a two-dimensional square Lieb lattice to investigate the topological properties of AMs. We identify a type-II quantum spin Hall state characterized by spin-polarized counterpropagating edge states. Breaking the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, which connects magnetic sublattices, induces a transition to a quantum anomalous Hall state. We further establish a strain-induced mechanism to control these topological phase transitions and present the corresponding phase diagram. Finally, we demonstrate the predicted transitions in monolayer CrO, a realistic altermagnetic candidate, using first-principles calculations. Our findings highlight the potential of 2D AMs as a versatile platform for topological spintronics, enabling strain-tunable helical and chiral edge states within a single system.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>
