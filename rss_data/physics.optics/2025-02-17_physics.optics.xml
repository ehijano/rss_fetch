      <title>Coherent lidar for ride-hailing autonomous vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent lidars promise a number of advantages over traditional time-of-flight lidars for autonomous vehicles. These include the direct measurement of target approach velocities via the Doppler effect, and near-immunity to interference from other lidars and sunlight. Furthermore, coherent lidars are compatible with a variety of solid-state beam steering technologies such as optical phased arrays, which may enable low-cost and compact lidars. In this manuscript, we discuss the headwinds facing the adoption of coherent lidar for autonomous ride-hailing vehicles and how they can be addressed. On the optics side, we explore how one can achieve the points per second and fields of view required for autonomous vehicles, and the resulting laser power requirements. We then discuss how these power levels could be achieved by co-packaging high-power semiconductor lasers and amplifiers with photonic integrated circuits, the preferred approach for low-cost coherent lidars. On the signal processing side, we discuss how to robustly disambiguate multiple returns in realistic environments and affordably meet the compute requirements.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares Bounds on Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a critical tool for chemical sensing and spectroscopy, and a key question is how to optimally design nanostructures for maximizing SERS. We present fundamental limits on spatially-averaged SERS via periodic metasurfaces, derived using sum-of-squares (SOS) programming. This work represents the first use of SOS techniques to optics, overcoming difficulties that prior bounding techniques have with regards to non-linear photonic processes with higher order figures of merit. Our bounds on the $\int \lVert \mathbf{E} \rVert^4 \text{d} \mathbf{r}$ SERS enhancement factor for 2D examples demonstrate remarkable tightness when compared with inverse-designed dielectric and metallic structures for both electrical field out-of-plane ($E_z$) and in-plane ($H_z$) polarizations. We show that delocalized high-Q guided modes can achieve significant, theoretically diverging SERS enhancement even in the presence of material loss. For metallic structures, we demonstrate a fundamental performance limitation for $E_z$ polarized drive fields due to surface plasmon excitation restrictions. By varying the separation between Raman-active molecules and the metasurface design region, we also find material-dependent bounds on the maximum strength of field singularities. Our results offer insights into optimal metasurface design strategies for enhancing light-matter interactions, and our methodology may be adapted to the study of other nonlinear photonics design problems.</description>

      <title>A Van der Waals Moir\'e Bilayer Photonic Crystal Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interactions with photonic structures is critical in classical and quantum nanophotonics. Recently, Moir\'e twisted bilayer optical materials have been proposed as a promising means towards a tunable and controllable platform for nanophotonic devices, with proof of principle realisations in the near infrared spectral range. However, the realisation of Moir\'e photonic crystal (PhC) cavities has been challenging, due to a lack of advanced nanofabrication techniques and availability of standalone transparent membranes. Here, we leverage the properties of the van der Waals material hexagonal Boron Nitride to realize Moir\'e bilayer PhC cavities. We design and fabricate a range of devices with controllable twist angles, with flatband modes in the visible spectral range (~ 450 nm). Optical characterization confirms the presence of spatially periodic cavity modes originating from the engineered dispersion relation (flatband). Our findings present a major step towards harnessing a two-dimensional van der Waals material for the next-generation of on chip, twisted nanophotonic systems.</description>

      <title>Ultraconfined THz Phonon Polaritons in Hafnium Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation to subwavelength scales relies on strong light-matter interactions. In the infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) spectral ranges, phonon polaritons are commonly employed to achieve extremely subdiffractional light confinement, with much lower losses as compared to plasmon polaritons. Among these, hyperbolic phonon polaritons in anisotropic materials offer a highly promising platform for light confinement, which, however, typically plateaus at values of {\lambda}0/100, with {\lambda}0 being the free-space incident wavelength. In this study, we report on ultraconfined phonon polaritons in hafnium-based dichalcogenides with confinement factors exceeding {\lambda}0/250 in the terahertz spectral range. This extreme light compression within deeply sub-wavelength thin films is enabled by the unprecedented magnitude of the light-matter coupling strength in these compounds, and the natural hyperbolicity of HfSe2 in particular. Our findings emphasize the critical role of light-matter coupling for polariton confinement, which for phonon polaritons in polar dielectrics is dictated by the transverse-longitudinal optic phonon energy splitting. Our results demonstrate transition metal dichalcogenides as an enabling platform for THz nanophotonic applications that push the limits of light control.</description>

      <title>TE optical isolator based on TMOKE coupled-waveguide system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) increasingly require more advanced integrated functionalities and devices to meet the key application challenges. This evolution with the serial integration of optical functions in the same photonic circuit often results in internal reflections and optical feedback, which can specifically destabilize lasers. One solution to overcome this issue is to integrate an optical isolator at the output of the lasers. Among various proposed designs, magneto-optical-based isolators have significantly improved over the past decades in terms of compactness, insertion loss, isolation ratio, and spectral isolation bandwidth. Despite these improvements, the TE optical isolator still lacks in performance. This paper introduces a new operational principle for a TE optical isolator based on modal beating in a transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) coupled-waveguide system. This approach combines evanescent-coupled silicon waveguides and the magneto-optical effect, resulting in a nonreciprocal propagation that can be optimized for optical isolation. This new concept shows promise in achieving a high-performing TE optical isolator, as it does not depend on resonance and is free from constraints associated with interferometers. Based on data from magneto-optical garnet materials, the simulated device has a length of 500 $\mu$m and its 20 dB-isolation bandwidth is as high as 35 nm.</description>

      <title>Efficient cavity-mediated energy transfer between photosynthetic light harvesting complexes from strong to weak coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitation energy transfer between photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes is vital for highly efficient primary photosynthesis. Controlling this process is the key for advancing the emerging artificial photosynthetic systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the enhanced excitation energy transfer between photosynthetic light-harvesting 2 complexes (LH2) mediated through the Fabry-Perot optical microcavity. Using intensity-dependent pump-probe spectroscopy, we analyse the exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) due to inter-LH2 energy transfer. Comparing EEA in LH2 within cavity samples and the bare LH2 films, we observe enhanced EEA in cavities indicating improved excitation energy transfer via coupling to a common cavity mode. Surprisingly, the effect remains even in the weak coupling regime. The enhancement is attributed to the additional connectivity between LH2s introduced by the resonant optical microcavity. Our results suggest that optical microcavities can be a strategic tool for modifying excitation energy transfer between molecular complexes, offering a promising approach towards efficient artificial light harvesting.</description>

      <title>Strong field physics in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dephasing is the loss of phase coherence due to the interaction of an electron with the environment. The most common approach to model dephasing in light-matter interaction is the relaxation time approximation. Surprisingly, its use in intense laser physics results in a pronounced failure, because ionization {is highly overestimated.} Here, this shortcoming is corrected by developing a strong field model in which the many-body environment is represented by a heat bath. Our model reveals that ionization enhancement and suppression by several orders of magnitude are still possible, however only in more extreme parameter regimes. Our approach allows the integration of many-body physics into intense laser dynamics with minimal computational and mathematical complexity, thus facilitating the identification of novel effects in strong-field physics and attosecond {science}.</description>

      <title>A Physiologically-based simulation model of color appearance for red-green color vision deficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various simulation methods of color appearance for dichromats or anomalous trichromats have been proposed over the years. To further improve the performance of the simulation model and extend the application range to both dichromats or anomalous trichromats, we have proposed a simulation model of cone fundamentals specifically designed for individuals with red-green type color vision deficiency (CVD) based on the CIE 2006 physiological observer model. By utilizing the simulated cone fundamentals, it becomes possible to predict the color appearance of real scenes and digital images for CVD. The fundamental premise of the new model is rooted in the hypothesis that CVD arises from a shift in the peak wavelength of the photopigment absorption spectrum of the L or M cone. Instead of simply maintaining the waveform without alteration as observed in prior studies, we altered waveforms of the absorption spectra of anomalous L/M cone photopigments when adjusting their peak wavelengths. Regarding different shapes in the absorption spectrum between the L and M cone, the absorption spectrum of the anomalous L/M cone was obtained by combining the peak wavenumber shift and linear interpolation of spectral quantal absorption curves between L- and M-photopigments in the wavenumber domain. The performance of the proposed model was substantiated through experimental validation by the pseudoisochromatic plates and Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue test (FM-100). The findings revealed a high level of consistency between the model prediction and the actual perception reported by individuals with CVD.</description>

      <title>Maximizing orientation of a three-state molecule in a cavity with analytically designed pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the precise control of a molecular polariton by strongly coupling the lowest three rotational states of a single molecule with a single-mode cavity. We examine two distinct cavity resonance configurations: a fundamental frequency cavity ($\omega_c = 2B$ with the rotational constant $B$) resonating with the lowest two rotational states, and a second harmonic cavity ($\omega_c = 4B$) coupling with the first and second excited rotational states. We propose two control schemes based on the two polariton configurations and derive the corresponding pulse-area theorems to achieve a theoretical maximum orientation of 0.7746, identical to the molecule in the absence of the cavity. The control schemes are analyzed in Carbonyl Sulfide (OCS) molecules in their ground rotational state. Our numerical simulation results demonstrate the theoretical control schemes and analyze the sensitivity of the molecular polariton orientation degree to the control field bandwidth and phases. This work provides a valuable reference for achieving maximum field-free orientation of ultracold three-state molecules in a cavity using analytically designed pulses.</description>

      <title>A Renewable Double Plasma Mirror For Petawatt-class Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional pulse contrast can be critical for ultraintense laser experiments, particularly when using solid density targets, and their use is becoming widespread. However, current plasma mirror technology is becoming inadequate for the new generation of high repetition rate, high power lasers now available. We describe a novel double plasma mirror configuration based on renewable, free standing, ultrathin liquid crystal films tested at the BELLA Petawatt Laser Center. Although operating at a repetition rate of several shots per minute, this system can be scaled to a high repetition rate exceeding 1 Hz and represents an important step towards enabling sustained, continuous operation of plasma mirrors. We demonstrate an improvement of two to three orders of magnitude in contrast and a total throughput of 80%. We present the first measurements of a beam reflected from a single or double plasma mirror system using a wavefront sensor, showing a well preserved wavefront and spatial mode. Finally, we introduce a model that predicts the total throughput through this double plasma mirror. This is the first model that accurately predicts the peak reflectivity of a plasma mirror when given the laser temporal profile.</description>

      <title>Determining angle of arrival of radio frequency fields using subwavelength, amplitude-only measurements of standing waves in a Rydberg atom sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep subwavelength RF imaging with atomic Rydberg sensors has overcome fundamental limitations of traditional antennas and enabled ultra-wideband detection of omni-directional time varying fields all in a compact form factor. However, in most applications, Rydberg sensors require the use of a secondary strong RF reference field to serve as a phase reference. Here, we demonstrate a new type of Rydberg sensor for angle-of-arrival (AoA) sensing which utilizes subwavelength imaging of standing wave fields. By placing a metallic plate within the Rydberg cell, we can determine the AoA independent of the strength of incoming RF field and without requiring a secondary strong RF phase reference field. We perform precision AoA measurements with a robotic antenna positioning system for 4.2, 5.0, and 5.7 GHz signals and demonstrate a 1.7 deg polar angular resolution from 0 deg to 60 deg AoA and 4.1 deg over all possible angles.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Photon Blockade with Weak Optical Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conventional photon blockade, the occupation of a cavity mode by more than one photon is suppressed via strong optical nonlinearity. An alternative, called unconventional photon blockade, can occur under weak nonlinearity by relying on quantum interference between fine-tuned cavities. A serious limitation is the very short antibunching time window, orders of magnitude less than the cavity lifetime. We present a method to achieve photon blockade over a large time window of several cavity lifetimes, even exceeding that of conventional photon blockade, while still requiring only weak nonlinearity. This ``long-lived photon blockade'' (LLPB) occurs when the single-photon Green's function exhibits a zero at a large cavity loss rate, which is satisfied by an exemplary configuration of four coupled cavities under weak driving. Our analytical results agree well with wavefunction Monte Carlo simulations. The LLPB phenomenon may aid the development of single-photon sources utilizing materials with weak optical nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Fast Image Simulation Technique with Spatially Variable Point Spread Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulated images are essential in algorithm development and instrument testing for optical telescopes. During real observations, images obtained by optical telescopes are affected by spatially variable point spread functions (PSFs), a crucial effect requiring accurate simulation. Traditional methods segment images into patches, convolve patches with individual PSFs, and reassemble them as a whole image. Although widely used, these approaches suffer from slow convolution processes and reduced image fidelity due to abrupt PSF transitions between different patches. This paper introduces a novel method for generating simulated images with spatial continuously varying PSFs. Our approach firstly decomposes original images into PSF bases derived with the principal component analysis method. The entire image is then convolved with these PSF bases to create image bases. Finally, we multiply the coefficients of image bases with these image bases for each pixels and add the multiplication results along each pixel to obtain the final simulated image. Our method could generate high-fidelity simulated images with spatially variable PSFs without boundary artifacts. The method proposed in this paper significantly improves the speed of astronomical image simulation, potentially advancing observational astronomy and instrumental development.</description>

Abstract: Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films are widely used in flexible electronics and optoelectronics, where their mechanical durability and optical performance under strain are essential for device reliability. This study investigates the impact of applied mechanical strain on the optical and molecular properties of PET at room temperature,using UV-Vis absorption and Raman spectroscopy. The work explores how varying strain levels, from 0% (unstretched) to 30%, affect the transparency, vibrational modes, and molecular reorganization within PET films. UV-Vis absorbance measurements reveal that strain induces significant changes in the light transmission properties of PET, particularly in the visible range, and increases absorption in the UVA and visible region by up to 100%. Raman spectra indicate that strain levels higher than 5% lead to irreversible shifts of vibrational lines, accompanied by an increase of their full width at half maximum (FWHM), suggesting molecular reorientation and crystallinity changes. The phonon mode coupled with C-O stretching [O-CH2] shows the strongest response to applied mechanical stress. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of strain-induced optical and structural alterations in PET, with implications for improving the mechanical and optical performance of PET-based devices in strainsensitive applications, such as organic solar cells (OSCs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and flexible sensors.</description>

      <title>Precise Quantum Control of Molecular Rotation Toward a Desired Orientation</title>

Abstract: The lack of a direct map between control fields and desired control objectives poses a significant challenge in applying quantum control theory to quantum technologies. Here, we propose an analytical framework to precisely control a limited set of quantum states and construct desired coherent superpositions using a well-designed laser pulse sequence with optimal amplitudes, phases, and delays. This theoretical framework that corresponds to a multi-level pulse-area theorem establishes a straightforward mapping between the control parameters of the pulse sequence and the amplitudes and phases of rotational states within a specific subspace. As an example, we utilize this approach to generate 15 distinct and desired rotational superpositions of ultracold polar molecules, leading to 15 desired field-free molecular orientations. By optimizing the superposition of the lowest 16 rotational states, we demonstrate that this approach can achieve a maximum orientation value of $|\langle\cos\theta\rangle|_{\rm{max}}$ above 0.99, which is very close to the global optimal value of 1 that could be achieved in an infinite-dimensional state space. This work marks a significant advancement in achieving precise control over multi-level subsystems within molecules. It holds potential applications in molecular alignment and orientation, as well as in various interdisciplinary fields related to the precise quantum control of ultracold polar molecules, opening up considerable opportunities in molecular-based quantum techniques.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Inner-Shell Lasing at Angstrom Wavelengths</title>

Abstract: Since the invention of the laser nonlinear effects such as filamentation, Rabi-cycling and collective emission have been explored in the optical regime leading to a wide range of scientific and industrial applications. X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have led to the extension of many optical techniques to X-rays for their advantages of angstrom scale spatial resolution and elemental specificity. One such example is XFEL driven population inversion of 1s core hole states resulting in inner-shell K${\alpha}$ (2p to 1s) X-ray lasing in elements ranging from neon to copper, which has been utilized for nonlinear spectroscopy and development of next generation X-ray laser sources. Here we show that strong lasing effects, similar to those observed in the optical regime, can occur at 1.5 to 2.1 angstrom wavelengths during high intensity (&gt; ${10^{19}}$ W/cm${^{2}}$) XFEL driven inner-shell lasing and superfluorescence of copper and manganese. Depending on the temporal substructure of the XFEL pump pulses(containing ${~10^{6}}$ - ${10^{8}}$ photons) i, the resulting inner-shell X-ray laser pulses can exhibit strong spatial inhomogeneities as well as spectral splitting, inhomogeneities and broadening. Through 3D Maxwell Bloch theory we show that the observed spatial inhomogeneities result from X-ray filamentation, and that the spectral splitting and broadening is driven by Rabi cycling with sub-femtosecond periods. Our simulations indicate that these X-ray pulses can have pulse lengths of less than 100 attoseconds and coherence properties that open the door for quantum X-ray optics applications.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared group-IV nanowire laser</title>

Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires have shown great potential for enabling ultra-compact lasers for integrated photonics platforms. Despite the impressive progress in developing nanowire lasers, their integration into Si photonics platforms remains challenging largely due to the use of III-V and II-VI semiconductors as gain media. These materials not only have high material costs, but also require inherently complex integration with Si-based fabrication processing, increasing overall costs and thereby limiting their large-scale adoption. Furthermore, these material-based nanowire lasers rarely emit above 2 um, which is a technologically important wavelength regime for various applications in imaging and quantum sensing. Recently, group-IV nanowires, particularly direct bandgap GeSn nanowires capable of emitting above 2 um, have emerged as promising cost-effective gain media for Si-compatible nanowire lasers, but there has been no successful demonstration of lasing from this seemingly promising nanowire platform. Herein, we report the experimental observation of lasing above 2 um from a single bottom-up grown GeSn nanowire. By harnessing strain engineering and optimized cavity designs simultaneously, the single GeSn nanowire achieves an amplified material gain that can sufficiently overcome minimized optical losses, resulting in a single-mode lasing with an ultra-low threshold of ~5.3 kW cm-2. Our finding paves the way for all-group IV mid-infrared photonic-integrated circuits with compact Si-compatible lasers for on-chip classical and quantum sensing and free-space communication.</description>

      <title>High peak-power 2.1-{\mu}m femtosecond Holmium amplifier at 100 kHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-power ultrafast laser sources in the short-wave infrared region are of great interest for numerous applications, including secondary sources of radiation and processing of materials commonly opaque in the near-infrared region. In this wavelength region, direct laser amplification around 2.1-{\mu}m wavelength within the atmospheric transparency window is particularly attractive for realizing compact and efficient high-power lasers. However, this wavelength region was widely underrepresented in femtosecond laser technology so far. Here, we report on a 2.1-{\mu}m laser system delivering 97-fs pulses with an unprecedented combination of high peak power of 525 MW and high repetition rate of 100 kHz. The amplifier system consists of a mode-locked oscillator seeding a regenerative amplifier (RA) using the novel broadband material Holmium (Ho)-doped CaAlGdO4 (CALGO), operating in the chirped pulse amplification (CPA) scheme and a nonlinear compression stage based on a Herriott-type multi-pass cell (MPC) with bulk material. We demonstrate the potential of this unique laser system by generating a micro plasma in ambient air, demonstrating its high intensity for future plasma-driven secondary sources. This system bridges the gap between conventional 1-to-10 kHz amplifiers and high-power MHz laser oscillators in this attractive wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable liquid-crystal metasurfaces with patterned birefringence and dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light propagation through artificially patterned anisotropic materials, such as dielectric metasurfaces, enables precise control of the spatio-vectorial properties of optical fields using highly transparent, thin, and flat optical elements. Liquid-crystal cells are a common realization of such devices. Optical losses are typically assumed to be polarization-independent and are therefore often overlooked in modeling these systems. In this work, we introduce electrically tunable liquid-crystal metasurfaces with patterned birefringence and dichroism, achieved by incorporating dichroic dye molecules into the liquid-crystal mixture. These dye molecules align with the liquid crystal, effectively coupling birefringence and dichroism effects. The behavior of these metasurfaces is described using non-unitary Jones matrices, validated through polarimetric measurements. In the case of devices that are patterned to form polarization gratings, we also characterize the diffraction efficiency as a function of the dichroism and birefringence parameters, which can be tuned jointly by applying an electric field across the cell. This study not only introduces a new class of optical components but also deepens our understanding of light propagation through anisotropic materials, where dichroism can naturally arise from bulk material properties or from reflection and transmission laws at their interfaces.</description>

      <title>High Contrast Nulling in Photonic Meshes Through Architectural Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a silicon photonic architecture comprised of Double Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (DMZIs) designed for high-contrast photonic applications. This configuration significantly enhances the achievable extinction ratio of photonic integrated circuits (PICs), reaching levels exceeding 80 dB. By leveraging the tunable properties of DMZIs and implementing a systematic configuration algorithm, the proposed mesh effectively compensates for fabrication imperfections and mitigates non-idealities such as back reflections. Experimental validation on a silicon-on-insulator platform demonstrates the potential of this approach for applications requiring high contrast nulling such as astronomical sensing.</description>

      <title>Ising Hamiltonian Minimization: Gain-Based Computing with Manifold Reduction of Soft-Spins vs Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the minimization of Ising Hamiltonians, comparing the performance of gain-based computing paradigms based on the dynamics of semi-classical soft-spin models with quantum annealing. We systematically analyze how the energy landscape for the circulant couplings of a Mobius graph evolves with increased annealing parameters. Our findings indicate that these semi-classical models face challenges due to a widening dimensionality landscape. To counteract this issue, we introduce the `manifold reduction' method, which restricts the soft-spin amplitudes to a defined phase space region. Concurrently, quantum annealing demonstrates a natural capability to navigate the Ising Hamiltonian's energy landscape due to its operation within the comprehensive Hilbert space. Our study indicates that physics-inspired or physics-enhanced optimizers will likely benefit from combining classical and quantum annealing techniques.</description>

      <title>Fiber optics in curved space-times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23048v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-mode fibers are used in fiber-optic gyroscopes to measure the Sagnac effect and are planned to be used in forthcoming experiments on the gravitationally induced phase shift in single photons. However, current theoretical models of such experiments are limited to ray-optics approximations or, if based on wave optics, to a restricted class of fiber alignments. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper develops a comprehensive perturbative scheme to solve for electromagnetic modes, i.e., monochromatic solutions to Maxwell's equations, of arbitrarily bent step-index fibers in general stationary space-times. This leads to transport equations for the electromagnetic phase and polarization that include the gravitational redshift, the Sagnac effect, a generalization of Rytov's law to curved space, a gravitational Faraday effect in the form of shift-induced gyrotropy, as well as inverse spin Hall effects caused by fiber bending, gravitational acceleration, and space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Control of Third-order Nonlinear Optical Properties of Gold Nanoparticle/Liquid Crystal Composites under External Electric Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamic control of third-order nonlinear optical absorption properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) dispersed in nematic liquid crystals (LC). By leveraging the reconfigurable nature of liquid crystals under external electric fields, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate AuNP alignment, dimer formation, and subsequently the plasmon coupling effects. Planar oriented and degenerate LC cells were prepared, and their optical responses under varying electric fields were characterized using polarization microscopy, UV-VIS spectroscopy, and Z-scan techniques. In planar cells, the applied electric field reorients LC molecules and AuNPs, influencing plasmon coupling and the nonlinear absorption. Conversely, degenerate cells exhibit more complex behaviors due to multiple LC alignment directions. These findings illustrate the potential of AuNP/nematic LC systems for creating tunable photonic devices responsive to external stimuli.</description>
