      <title>Drug discovery guided by maximum drug likeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome the high attrition rate and limited clinical translatability in drug discovery, we introduce the concept of Maximum Drug-Likeness (MDL) and develop an applicable Fivefold MDL strategy (5F-MDL) to reshape the screening paradigm. The 5F-MDL strategy integrates an ensemble of 33 deep learning sub-models to construct a 33-dimensional property spectrum that quantifies the global phenotypic alignment of candidate molecules with clinically approved drugs along five axes: physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and stability. Using drug-likeness scores derived from this 33-dimensional profile, we prioritized 15 high-potential molecules from a 16-million-molecule library. Experimental validation demonstrated that the lead compound M2 not only exhibits potent antibacterial activity, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 25.6 ug/mL, but also achieves binding stability superior to cefuroxime, as indicated by Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations of -38.54 kcal/mol and a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.8 A. This strategy could overcome scaffold constraints and offers an efficient route for discovering lead compounds with favorable prospects against drug-resistant bacteria.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Fungal Infections in the All of Us Research Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fungal infections, such as Coccidioidomycosis, Aspergillosis, and Histoplasmosis, represent a growing public health concern in the United States. The rising incidence of these mycoses is linked to climate shifts, demographic changes, and social determinants of health. However, the actual burden of these infections is often underestimated by traditional surveillance methods. Therefore, this study aims to characterize these infections within the All of Us Research Program and evaluate the quality of clinical and health data related to fungal infections. We constructed three fungi cohorts of Coccidioidomycosis (n=1,173), Aspergillosis (n=687), and Histoplasmosis (n=345) among over 400,000 participants using electronic health record data. We analyzed geographic and sociodemographic distributions and performed a data quality assessment on ten key laboratory biomarkers to evaluate data completeness, unit conformance, and measurement concordance within a 90-day window of diagnosis. Our analysis confirmed known epidemiological patterns, including the geographic distributions of Coccidioidomycosis in the Southwest and Histoplasmosis in the Midwest. Fungal infections disproportionately affected older adults, males, and White non-Hispanic individuals. The data quality assessment revealed high completeness for general hematology markers (e.g., Hemoglobin &gt; 70%) but limited availability for biomarkers, such as Beta 1,3 Glucan (&lt; 15%). While measurement concordance was strong (e.g., hemoglobin-hematocrit correlation, r = 0.94), unit conformance was poor for key inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In conclusion, the All of Us dataset is a valuable resource for characterizing fungal infections. However, significant data quality issues related to completeness and conformance for specialized biomarkers must be addressed to enhance their applicability for robust clinical research.</description>

      <title>Sample volume as a key design parameter in affinity-based biosensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affinity-based biosensors have become indispensable in modern diagnostics and health monitoring. While considerable research has focused on optimizing analyte transport and binding kinetics, a fundamental parameter - sample volume - remains largely underexplored in biosensor design. This is critical because biosensor performance depends on the absolute number of target molecules present, not solely their concentration, making volume a key consideration where sample availability is limited. To address this gap, we developed a tractable two-compartment mathematical model integrating simplified mass transport, Langmuir binding kinetics, and mass conservation under finite volume constraints. Validated against experimental measurements and numerical simulations, the model accurately predicts critical performance metrics including assay time and minimum required sample volume while achieving more than a 10,000-fold reduction in computational time compared to commercial simulation packages. Through systematic analysis, we derived quantitative design rules for biosensor optimization that explicitly account for measurement time and sample volume as primary decision variables. We validated this framework experimentally by optimizing flow rate parameters for a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensor and retrospectively applied it to enhance sensitivity of published biosensor designs. Released as open-source software, our model enables researchers to gain mechanistic insights, optimize device performance, and make informed design decisions tailored to specific healthcare contexts, including point-of-care testing and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Democratizing Drug Discovery with an Orchestrated, Knowledge-Driven Multi-Agent Team for User-Guided Therapeutic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Therapeutic discovery remains a formidable challenge, impeded by the fragmentation of specialized domains and the execution gap between computational design and physiological validation. Although generative AI offers promise, current models often function as passive assistants rather than as autonomous executors. Here, we introduce OrchestRA, a human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform that unifies biology, chemistry, and pharmacology into an autonomous discovery engine. Unlike static code generators, our agents actively execute simulations and reason the results to drive iterative optimization. Governed by an Orchestrator, a Biologist Agent leverages deep reasoning over a massive knowledge graph (&gt;10 million associations) to pinpoint high-confidence targets; a Chemist Agent autonomously detects structural pockets for de novo design or drug repositioning; and a Pharmacologist Agent evaluates candidates via rigorous physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations. This architecture establishes a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization. By seamlessly integrating autonomous execution with human guidance, OrchestRA democratizes therapeutic design, transforming drug discovery from a stochastic search to a programmable evidence-based engineering discipline.</description>

      <title>The Color-Clinical Decoupling: Why Perceptual Calibration Fails Clinical Biomarkers in Smartphone Dermatology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smartphone-based tele-dermatology assumes that colorimetric calibration ensures clinical reliability, yet this remains untested for underrepresented skin phototypes. We investigated whether standard calibration translates to reliable clinical biomarkers using 43,425 images from 965 Korean subjects (Fitzpatrick III-IV) across DSLR, tablet, and smartphone devices. While Linear Color Correction Matrix (CCM) normalization reduced color error by 67-77% -- achieving near-clinical accuracy (Delta E &lt; 2.3) -- this success did not translate to biomarker reliability.
  We identify a phenomenon termed "color-clinical decoupling": despite perceptual accuracy, the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) showed poor inter-device agreement (ICC = 0.40), while the Melanin Index achieved good agreement (ICC = 0.77). This decoupling is driven by the ITA formula's sensitivity to b* channel noise and is further compounded by anatomical variance. Facial region accounts for 25.2% of color variance -- 3.6x greater than device effects (7.0%) -- challenging the efficacy of single-patch calibration. Our results demonstrate that current colorimetric standards are insufficient for clinical-grade biomarker extraction, necessitating region-aware protocols for mobile dermatology.</description>

      <title>Enhancing TCR-Peptide Interaction Prediction with Pretrained Language Models and Molecular Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the binding specificity between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) is central to immunotherapy and vaccine development. However, current predictive models struggle with generalization, especially in data-scarce settings and when faced with novel epitopes. We present LANTERN (Large lAnguage model-powered TCR-Enhanced Recognition Network), a deep learning framework that combines large-scale protein language models with chemical representations of peptides. By encoding TCR \b{eta}-chain sequences using ESM-1b and transforming peptide sequences into SMILES strings processed by MolFormer, LANTERN captures rich biological and chemical features critical for TCR-peptide recognition. Through extensive benchmarking against existing models such as ChemBERTa, TITAN, and NetTCR, LANTERN demonstrates superior performance, particularly in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Our model also benefits from a robust negative sampling strategy and shows significant clustering improvements via embedding analysis. These results highlight the potential of LANTERN to advance TCR-pMHC binding prediction and support the development of personalized immunotherapies.</description>

      <title>Modeling Microenvironment Trajectories on Spatial Transcriptomics with NicheFlow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of cellular microenvironments in spatiotemporal data is essential for deciphering tissue development and disease progression. While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.</description>

      <title>The Probabilistic Foundations of Surveillance Failure: From False Alerts to Structural Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For decades, forensic statisticians have debated whether searching large DNA databases undermines the evidential value of a match. Modern surveillance faces an exponentially harder problem: screening populations across thousands of attributes using threshold rules rather than exact matching. Intuition suggests that requiring many coincidental matches should make false alerts astronomically unlikely. This intuition fails.
  Consider a system that monitors 1,000 attributes, each with a 0.5 percent innocent match rate. Matching 15 pre-specified attributes has probability \(10^{-35}\), one in 30 decillion, effectively impossible. But operational systems require no such specificity. They might flag anyone who matches \emph{any} 15 of the 1,000. In a city of one million innocent people, this produces about 226 false alerts. A seemingly impossible event becomes all but guaranteed. This is not an implementation flaw but a mathematical consequence of high-dimensional screening.
  We identify fundamental probabilistic limits on screening reliability. Systems undergo sharp transitions from reliable to unreliable with small increases in data scale, a fragility worsened by data growth and correlations. As data accumulate and correlation collapses effective dimensionality, systems enter regimes where alerts lose evidential value even when individual coincidences remain vanishingly rare. This framework reframes the DNA database controversy as a shift between operational regimes. Unequal surveillance exposures magnify failure, making ``structural bias'' mathematically inevitable. These limits are structural: beyond a critical scale, failure cannot be prevented through threshold adjustment or algorithmic refinement.</description>
