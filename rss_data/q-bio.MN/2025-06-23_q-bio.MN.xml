      <title>Central Dogma Cycle and Network: A Model for Cell Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an extension of the traditional Central Dogma of molecular biology to a more dynamic model termed the Central Dogma Cycle (CDC) and a broader network called the Central Dogma Cyclic Network (CDCN). While the Central Dogma is necessary for genetic information flow, it is not sufficient to fully explain cellular memory and information management. The CDC incorporates additional well-established steps, including protein folding and protein networking, highlighting the cyclical nature of information flow in cells. This cyclic architecture is proposed as a key mechanism for cellular memory, drawing analogies to memory functions in computers, such as input, read, write, execute, and erase. The interconnected cycles within the CDCN, including metabolic cycles and signaling pathways, are suggested to function akin to latches in computer memory, contributing to the storage and processing of cellular information beyond nucleic acid sequences. Understanding cellular memory through this cyclic network model offers a new perspective on heredity, cell processes, and the potential disruptions in disease pathology.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of SDEs for reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biochemical reaction networks are widely applied across scientific disciplines to model complex dynamic systems. We investigate the diffusion approximation of reaction networks with mass-action kinetics, focusing on the identifiability of the generator of the associated stochastic differential equations. We derive conditions under which the law of the diffusion approximation is identifiable and provide theorems for verifying identifiability in practice. Notably, our results show that some reaction networks have non-identifiable reaction rates, even when the law of the corresponding stochastic process is completely known. Moreover, we show that reaction networks with distinct graphical structures can generate the same diffusion law under specific choices of reaction rates. Finally, we compare our framework with identifiability results in the deterministic ODE setting and the discrete continuous-time Markov chain models for reaction networks.</description>
