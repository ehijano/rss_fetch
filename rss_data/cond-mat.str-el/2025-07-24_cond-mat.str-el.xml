      <title>Exact downfolding and its perturbative approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.</description>

      <title>Dopant-induced stabilization of three-dimensional charge order in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the microscopic mechanisms behind the stabilization of three-dimensional (3D) charge order by Pr doping in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO7). Density-functional-theory calculations locate the lowest-energy Pr superlattices for both Ba- and Y-site substitution. In the Ba-site case, the smaller Pr ion pulls the surrounding atoms inward. This breathing-mode distortion pins charge-stripe walls to the Pr columns and forces them to align along the $c$ axis. Y-site Pr is larger than the host ion, produces an outward distortion, and fails to pin the stripes. Coarse-grained Monte-Carlo simulations show that the stripe correlation length rises in step with the structural correlation length of the Pr dopant as observed in prior experiments. We thus identify dopant-induced lattice pinning as the key mechanism behind 3D charge order in Pr-doped YBCO7. This approach provides quantitative guidelines for engineering electronic orders through targeted ionic substitution.</description>

      <title>Successive orthorhombic distortions in kagome metals by molecular orbital formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice, with its inherent frustration, hosts a plethora of exotic phenomena, including the emergence of $3\mathbf{q}$ charge density wave order. The high rotational symmetry, required to realize such an unconventional charge order, is broken in many kagome materials by orthorhombic distortions at high temperature, the origin of which is much less discussed despite their ubiquity. In this study, synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals a structural phase transition from a parent hexagonal phase to an orthorhombic ground state, mediated by a critical regime of diffuse scattering in the prototypical kagome metals $R$Ru$_3$Si$_2$ ($R$=rare-earth). Structural analysis uncovers an interlayer dimerization of kagome atoms in the low-temperature phase. Accordingly, a dimer model with one-dimensional disorder on kagome layers successfully reproduces the diffuse scattering. The observations point to molecular orbital formation between kagome $4d_{z^2}$ orbitals as the driving force behind the transition, consistent with \textit{ab initio} calculations. A framework based on electronegativity and atomic radii is proposed to evaluate the stability of the hexagonal phase in kagome metals, guiding the design of highly symmetric materials.</description>

      <title>Time-hidden magnetic order in a multi-orbital Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo-excited quantum materials can be driven into thermally inaccessible metastable states that exhibit structural, charge, spin, topological and superconducting orders. Metastable states typically emerge on timescales set by the intrinsic electronic and phononic energy scales, ranging from femtoseconds to picoseconds, and can persist for weeks. Therefore, studies have primarily focused on ultrafast or quasi-static limits, leaving the intermediate time window less explored. Here we reveal a metastable state with broken glide-plane symmetry in photo-doped Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ using time-resolved optical second-harmonic generation and birefringence measurements. We find that the metastable state appears long after intralayer antiferromagnetic order has melted and photo-carriers have recombined. Its properties are distinct from all known states in the equilibrium phase diagram and are consistent with intralayer ferromagnetic order. Furthermore, model Hamiltonian calculations reveal that a non-thermal trajectory to this state can be accessed via photo-doping. Our results expand the search space for out-of-equilibrium electronic matter to metastable states emerging at intermediate timescales.</description>

      <title>Mott Criticality as the Confinement Transition of a Pseudogap-Mott Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Mott insulation involves the localization of itinerant electrons due to strong local repulsion. Upon doping, a pseudogap (PG) phase emerges - marked by selective gapping of the Fermi surface without conventional symmetry breaking in spin or charge channels. A key challenge is understanding how quasiparticle breakdown in the Fermi liquid gives rise to this enigmatic state, and how it connects to both the Mott insulating and superconducting phases. Here, we develop a renormalization-based construction of strongly correlated lattice models that captures the emergence of the pseudogap phase and its transition to a Mott insulator. Applying a many-body tiling scheme to the fixed-point impurity model uncovers a lattice model with electron interactions and Kondo physics. At half-filling, the interplay between Kondo screening and bath charge fluctuations in the impurity model leads to Fermi liquid breakdown. This reveals a pseudogap phase characterized by a non-Fermi liquid (the Mott metal) residing on nodal arcs, gapped antinodal regions of the Fermi surface, and an anomalous scaling of the electronic scattering rate with frequency. The eventual confinement of holon-doublon excitations of this exotic metal obtains a continuous transition into the Mott insulator. Our results identify the pseudogap as a distinct long-range entangled quantum phase, and offer a new route to Mott criticality beyond the paradigm of local quantum criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17203v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thesis presents a comprehensive Raman spectroscopic and first-principle density functional theory based investigation of V_(1-x)PS_(3) ; PbTaSe_(2) and 1T-TaS_(2). In V_(1-x)PS_(3),the detection of fractionalized excitations (Majorana fermions) suggests a potential Kitaev spin liquid phase, which becomes more pronounced as dimensionality decreases. Evidence of temperature-driven structural phase transition and topological surface phonons has been detected in PbTaSe_(2). TaS_(2) in 1T-phase reveals the presence of a hidden quantum state, a Mott-insulating phase, and a quantum spin liquid state. The observed phenomenon in these quantum systems makes them a promising candidate for advanced technologies such as quantum computing and communication.</description>

      <title>Coupling of magnetic and lattice collective excitations in the 2D van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive magneto-optical investigation of FePS$_3$ single crystals using temperature-dependent polarized transmission spectroscopy and Faraday rotation measurements. Our data reveal pronounced in-plane anisotropy in both phonon and magnon excitations, emerging distinctly below the N\'eel temperature ($T_N \approx 118$ K). A prominent magnon mode at 122 cm$^{-1}$ exhibits characteristic redshifting with increasing temperature and field-induced splitting, confirming its magnetic origin. The optical conductivity, extracted via Drude-Lorentz modeling, shows polarization-sensitive spectral changes across the magnetic transition. The appearance of Raman-active modes in the infrared spectra, along with the observation of multiple phonons contributing to Faraday rotation, provides compelling evidence for spin-phonon coupling and inversion symmetry breaking in the magnetically ordered state. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between spin and lattice degrees of freedom in FePS$_3$, positioning it as a model system for exploring spin-lattice interactions in two-dimensional antiferromagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-flip inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy allows magnetic materials to be probed at the single-atom level via scanning tunneling microscopy. Previously, the local spectral weight of spin excitations of small systems has been deduced from discrete steps in the differential conductance. However, this is not viable for large systems. We show that the local spin density of states can be measured via the double differential conductance. This contrasts with elastic measurements where the local density of electronic states is deduced from the differential conductance. We study the tunneling currents of the spin-1/2 and -1 Heisenberg chains and propose a method to probe zero-frequency modes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo simulation of light and superlight bipolarons in extended Hubbard-Holstein models on face- and body-centered-cubic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superlight pairing of bipolarons driven by electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) in face-center-cubic (FCC) and body-center-cubic (BCC) lattices is investigated using a continuous-time path-integral quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm. The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a Hubbard interaction is also included. The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass it is determined that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at large phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. The transition temperature of Bose--Einstein condensates of these pairs is estimated. It is determined that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures.</description>

      <title>Coincidence double-tip scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of new experimental techniques for direct measurement of many-body correlations is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we propose a coincidence double-tip scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) that enables direct probing of spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations of sample electrons. Unlike conventional single-tip scanning tunneling microscopy, the double-tip STS employs a double-tip scanning tunneling microscope (STM) equipped with two independently controlled tips, each biased at distinct voltages ($V_1$ and $V_2$). By simultaneously measuring the quantum tunneling currents $I_1(t)$ and $I_2(t)$ at locations $j_1$ and $j_2$, we obtain a coincidence tunneling current correlation $\overline{\langle I_1(t) I_2(t)\rangle}$. Differentiating this coincidence tunneling current correlation with respect to the two bias voltages yields a coincidence dynamical conductance. Through the development of a nonequilibrium theory, we demonstrate that this coincidence dynamical conductance is proportional to a contour-ordered second-order current correlation function. For the sample electrons in a nearly free Fermi liquid state, the coincidence dynamical conductance captures two correlated dynamical electron propagation processes: (i) from $j_1$ to $j_2$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_1$, and (ii) from $j_2$ to $j_1$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_2$. For the sample electrons in a superconducting state, additional propagation channels emerge from the superconducting condensate, coexisting with the above normal electron propagation processes. Thus, the coincidence double-tip STS provides direct access to spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations, offering a powerful tool for investigating strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Fragility of Topology under Electronic Correlations in Iron Chalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between electronic correlations and topology is a central topic in the study of quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the impact of the orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP) on the topological properties of FeTe1-xSex (FTS), an iron chalcogenide superconductor known to host both non-trivial Z2 topology and strong electronic correlations. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we track the evolution of topological surface states across various doping levels and temperatures. We identify a topological phase transition between trivial and non-trivial topology as a function of selenium content, with critical behavior observed between x = 0.04 and x = 0.09. Additionally, we find that at elevated temperatures, the coherence of the topological surface state deteriorates due to the emergence of OSMP, despite the topological invariant remaining intact. Our results demonstrate that the non-trivial topology in iron chalcogenide is fragile under strong electronic correlations.</description>

      <title>Perturbative renormalization group approach to magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene using topological heavy fermion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a perturbative renormalization group (RG) theory for the topological heavy fermion (THF) model, describing magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) as an emergent Anderson lattice. The realistic parameters place MATBG near an intermediate regime where the Hubbard interaction $U$ and the hybridization energy $\gamma$ are comparable, motivating the need for RG analysis. Our approach analytically tracks the flow of single-particle parameters and Coulomb interactions within an energy window below $0.1$ eV, providing implications for distinguishing between Kondo-like ($U\gg \gamma$) and projected-limit/Mott-semimetal ($U\ll \gamma$) scenarios at low energies. We show that the RG flows generically lower the ratio $U/\gamma$ and drive MATBG toward the chiral limit, consistent with the previous numerical study based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald model. The framework presented here also applies to other moir\'e systems and stoichiometric materials that admit a THF description, including magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, twisted checkerboard model, and Lieb lattice, among others, providing a foundation for developing low-energy effective theories relevant to a broad class of topological flat-band materials.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in kagome metals due to soft loop-current fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that soft fluctuations of translation symmetry-breaking loop currents provide a mechanism for unconventional superconductivity in kagome metals that naturally addresses the multiple superconducting phases observed under pressure. Focusing on the rich multi-orbital character of these systems, we show that loop currents involving both vanadium and antimony orbitals generate low-energy collective modes that couple efficiently to electrons near the Fermi surface and mediate attractive interactions in two distinct unconventional pairing channels. While loop-current fluctuations confined to vanadium orbitals favor chiral $d+id$ superconductivity, which spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry, the inclusion of antimony orbitals stabilizes an $s^{\pm}$ state that is robust against disorder. We argue that these two states are realized experimentally as pressure increases and the antimony-dominated Fermi surface sheet undergoes a Lifshitz transition.</description>

      <title>The sphere free energy of the vector models to order $1/N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the large-$N$ expansion of the sphere free energy $F=-\log Z_{S^d}$ of the O(N) $\phi^4$ and the Gross-Neveu $(\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ CFTs to order $1/N$. Analytical regularization of these theories requires consistently shifting the UV scaling dimension of the auxiliary field: this can only be done by modifying its kinetic term. This modification combines with the counterterms to give the result that matches the $\epsilon$-expansion, resolving a puzzle raised by Tarnopolsky in arXiv:1609.09113. These $F$s can be written compactly in terms of the anomalous dimensions, for both the short-range and the long-range versions of these CFTs. We also provide various technical results including a computation of the counterterms on the sphere and a neat derivation of the sphere free energy of a free conformal field. Finally, we observe that the long-range CFT becomes the short-range CFT at exactly the point where its $\tilde{F} =-\sin \tfrac{\pi d}{2} F$ is maximized as a function of the vector's scaling dimension.</description>

      <title>Superfluid stiffness of superconductors with delicate topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider superconductivity in two-dimensional delicate topological bands, where the total Chern number vanishes but the Brillouin zone can be divided into subregions with a quantized nontrivial Chern number. We formulate a lower bound on the geometric contribution to the superfluid weight in terms of the sum of the absolute values of these sub-Brillouin zone Chern numbers. We verify this bound in Chern dartboard insulators, where the delicate topology is protected by mirror symmetry. In iso-orbital models, where the mirror representation is the same along all high-symmetry lines, the lower bound increases linearly with the number of mirror planes. This work points to delicate bands as promising candidates for particularly stable superconductivity, especially in narrow bands where the kinetic energy is suppressed due to lattice effects.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetries, anomalies, and crossed squares in lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine higher-form symmetries of quantum lattice gauge theories through the lens of homotopy theory and operator algebras. We show that in the operator-algebraic approach both higher-form symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies arise from considering restrictions of symmetry transformations to spatial regions. The data of these restrictions are naturally packaged into a higher group. For example, for gauge theories in two spatial dimensions, this information is encoded in a crossed square of groups, which is an algebraic model of a 3-group. In general, we propose that higher groups appear in lattice models and QFT as crossed n-cubes of groups via a nonabelian version of the Cech construction.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and Weak Magnetism in the Insulating Distorted Perovskite Antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GdFeO$_3$-type perovskite antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$, calculated here to be altermagnetic for all three typical collinear antiferromagnetic orders, was suggested early on to be a Slater-type insulator, due in large part to its continuous metal-insulator transition and its small energy gap. Below the N\'eel temperature, the gap opens along with ``weak magnetism'', accompanied by a discontinuity in the magnetic susceptibility. Most other properties remain continuous. Without explicit correlation in the band structure calculation, and neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC), already a gap opens. Inclusion of a modest on-site Coulomb repulsion ($U\sim$ 1 eV) is sufficient to eliminate a SOC-induced small band overlap, reproducing the experimentally observed gap of several tens meV as reported earlier. This evidence supports the viewpoint that NaOsO$_3$ lies in an unusual crossover region between Slater and Mott insulator. The unreported altermagnetism in NaOsO$_3$ is demonstrated and its consequences are considered. The origin of the very weak magnetism has been investigated using a combination of {\it ab initio} calculations and symmetry analysis of the magnetic space group, confirming the origin lying in the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbit coupling buttressed by altermagnetic order. After determining the easy axis, our calculation leads to an Os spin canting angle of about 3$^{\circ}$, accounting for the observed weak magnetism and the resulting discontinuity in the susceptibility. The altermagnetism spin-split bands (up to $\sim$100 meV) result in a chiral-split magnon spectrum in both acoustic and optical modes in the THz range, and lead to significant anomalous Hall conductivity upon hole doping.</description>

      <title>Sliding multiferrocity in van der Waals layered CrI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding magnetoelectric coupling in emerging van der Waals multiferroics is crucial for developing atomically thin spintronic devices. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of magnetoelectric coupling in orthorhombic CrI$_2$. Monte Carlo simulations based on DFT-calculated magnetic exchange interactions suggest a proper-screw helimagnetic ground state with a N\'{e}el temperature consistent with experimental observations. A ferroelectric switching pathway driven by interlayer sliding is predicted, featuring a low switching energy barrier and out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization. To quantitatively characterize the magnetoelectric effect in orthorhombic CrI$_2$ and its microscopic origin, we evaluate the spin-driven polarization using the paramagnetic phase as a reference alongside the magnetoelectric tensor method. The extracted spin-driven polarization aligns along the $z$-axis, with its origin dominated by the exchange-striction mechanism. Although in-plane components of the total polarization in the bulk vanish due to global symmetry constraints, each CrI$_2$ single layer exhibits local electric polarization along the $x$ direction, arising from the generalized spin-current mechanism, which couples spin chirality to the electric polarization. As a result, we further predict that a proper-screw helimagnetic state may persist in monolayer CrI$_2$, with its charity reversable by switching the in-plane electric polarization through applying external electric field, providing another promising candidate for electrical control of two-dimensional multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Simulating the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions in NMR by spin dynamic mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We highlight the relevance of local quantum effects by a comparison with the classical analogue system.</description>

      <title>Sequential Adiabatic Generation of Chiral Topological States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work, it was shown that non-trivial gapped states can be generated from a product state using a sequential quantum circuit. Explicit circuit constructions were given for a variety of gapped states at exactly solvable fixed points. In this paper, we show that a similar generation procedure can be established for chiral topological states as well, despite the fact that they lack a zero-correlation-length exactly solvable form. Instead of sequentially applying local unitary gates, we sequentially evolve the Hamiltonian by changing local terms in one subregion and then the next. The Hamiltonian remains gapped throughout the process, giving rise to an adiabatic evolution mapping the ground state from a product state to a chiral topological state. We demonstrate such a sequential adiabatic generation process for free fermion chiral states like the Chern Insulator and the $p+ip$ superconductor. Moreover, we show that coupling a quantum state to a discrete gauge group can be achieved through a sequential quantum circuit, thereby generating interacting chiral topological states from the free fermion ones.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Magnetic Fields with Spinons in a Fractionalized State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 4d-electron trimer lattice exhibits either a quantum spin liquid (QSL) or a heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM) phase, depending on Nb content. In the QSL state, itinerant spinons act as effective heat carriers, enhancing thermal conductivity. Strikingly, applying a magnetic field up to 14 T causes an abrupt increase in heat capacity by as much as 5000% below 150 mK, disrupting the linear temperature dependence characteristic of both phases. Meanwhile, AC magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity remain nearly unchanged, while thermal conductivity is suppressed by up to 40% below 4 K. These observations suggest that spinons, though charge-neutral, are highly sensitive to magnetic fields at low temperatures. We propose that the field induces Anderson localization of spinons, leading to emergent non-magnetic two-level systems that account for the rapid rise in heat capacity. These findings uncover a previously unexplored regime of spinon dynamics, governed by field-induced localization and distinct from conventional magnetic or transport signatures.

      <description>arXiv:2409.18600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nematicity plays an important role in strongly correlated electron systems. We explore the spin nematicity of a spin-1 kagome lattice antiferromagnet with the bilinear-biquadratic model and single-ion anisotropy using a generalized semiclassical approximation and Monte Carlo simulations. We reveal a rich ground state phase diagram, characterized by two main regions: a pure spin nematic phase and a region featuring the coexistence of a classical spin liquid and ferroicities for both dipolar and quadrupolar moments. The thermal fluctuation melts the spin nematic order into a critical phase with a quasi-long-range nematic order. Due to the fluctuating vortices of the spin nematic order, this critical phase further undergoes a nematic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to a paramagnetic phase, marked by an anomalous stiffness jump. Additionally, the single-ion anisotropy leads to weak ferromagnetism, resulting in spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at very low temperatures. Remarkably, both two types of ferroic ordering are accompanied by classical spin liquid behaviors. Our results provide an intriguing glimpse into the interplay between geometric frustration and intertwining spin orders with different ranks and are expected to stimulate further studies on spin-1 systems and relevant materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the ground state of van der Waals (vdW) magnets is crucial for designing devices leveraging these platforms. Here, we investigate the magnetic excitations and charge order in Fe$_{4.75}$GeTe$_2$, a vdW ferromagnet with $\approx$ 315 K Curie temperature. Using Fe $L_3 - $edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we observe a dual nature of magnetic excitations, comprising a coherent magnon and a broad non-dispersive continuum extending up to 150 meV, 50$\%$ higher than in Fe$_{2.72}$GeTe$_2$. The continuum intensity is sinusoidally modulated along the stacking direction $L$, with a period matching the inter-slab distance. Our results indicate that while the dual character of the magnetic excitations is generic to Fe-Ge-Te vdW magnets, Fe$_{4.75}$GeTe$_2$ exhibits a longer out-of-plane magnetic correlation length, suggesting enhanced 3D magnetic character. Furthermore, resonant x-ray diffraction reveals that previously reported $\pm$(1/3, 1/3, $L$) peaks originate from crystal structure rather than from charge order.</description>

Abstract: Shifting the Fermi level of the celebrated $AM_3X_5$ (135) compounds into proximity of flat bands strongly enhances electronic correlations and severely affects the formation of density waves and superconductivity. Our broadband infrared spectroscopy measurements of RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ combined with density-functional band-structure calculations reveal that the correlated Ti $d$-states are intricately coupled with the Bi $p$-states that form a tilted Dirac crossing. Electron-phonon coupling manifests itself in the strong damping of itinerant carriers and in the anomalous shape of the phonon line in RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$. An anomaly in these spectral features around 150 K can be paralleled to the onset of nematicity detected by low-temperature probes. Our findings show that the materials with low band filling open unexplored directions in the physics of kagome metals and involve electronic states of different nature strongly coupled with lattice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic splitting of magnons in hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the technologically important issue of the spin orientation on a correlated magnetic surface and how to manipulate it. We consider a prototypical strongly correlated system, NiO, and show that a single particle approach with anisotropic hoppings, or even a many-electron model with a scalar Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ fails to explain the strain driven spin reorientation transition (SRT). We set up a model treating both anisotropic single particle effects and orbital-dependent, full multipole electron-electron interaction effects at the same footing. Within this model, predictive power to explain the observed SRT is regained and the results indicate the novel possibility of using an electric field to control SRT in magnetic films grown on piezoelectric substrates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chaos is central to understanding quantum dynamics and is crucial for generating random quantum states, a key resource for quantum information tasks. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum many-body dynamics, termed pseudochaotic dynamics. Although distinct from chaotic dynamics, out-of-time-ordered correlators, the key indicators of quantum chaos, fail to distinguish them. Moreover, pseudochaotic dynamics generates pseudorandom states that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random states. We construct pseudochaotic dynamics by embedding a smaller $k$-qubit subsystem into a larger $n$-qubit system. We demonstrate that a subsystem of size $k=\omega(\log n)$ is sufficient to induce pseudochaotic behavior in the entire $n$-qubit system. Furthermore, we construct a quantum circuit exhibiting pseudochaotic dynamics and demonstrate that it generates pseudorandom states within $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ depth. In summary, our results constitute the discovery of new quantum dynamics that are computationally indistinguishable from genuine quantum chaos, which provides efficient routes to generate useful pseudorandom states.</description>

Abstract: The superconductor BaNi$_2$As$_2$ exhibits a soft-phonon-driven, incommensurate charge density wave (I-CDW) which is accompanied by a small orthorhombic structural phase transition. Upon further cooling, BaNi$_2$As$_2$ undergoes a first-order structural transition to a triclinic phase in which a commensurate CDW (C-CDW) appears. The relationship and interplay between the I-CDW, C-CDW and structural phase transitions has remained elusive. To investigate this issue, we present a complementary study of thermal diffuse X-Ray scattering and inelastic X-Ray scattering for phosphorus substituted BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ $(x\lessapprox0.12)$ and down to 2.2 K. We show that most of the diffuse scattering signal can be well described by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. Furthermore, we find that although phosphorus substitution rapidly suppresses the structural transition temperatures, the temperature dependence of the correlation length of the I-CDW fluctuations and the formation of Bragg-like superstructure peaks associated with long-range ordering of this order depends only weakly on the substitution level. Finally, we present the absence of signatures of the I-CDW to C-CDW or triclinic transition in the lattice dynamics, indicating that these instabilities are not (soft) phonon driven.</description>
