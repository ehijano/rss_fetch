      <title>Model-driven Heart Rate Estimation and Heart Murmur Detection based on Phonocardiogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic signals are crucial for health monitoring, particularly heart sounds which provide essential data like heart rate and detect cardiac anomalies such as murmurs. This study utilizes a publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset to estimate heart rate using model-driven methods and extends the best-performing model to a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous heart rate estimation and murmur detection. Heart rate estimates are derived using a sliding window technique on heart sound snippets, analyzed with a combination of acoustic features (Mel spectrogram, cepstral coefficients, power spectral density, root mean square energy). Our findings indicate that a 2D convolutional neural network (\textbf{\texttt{2dCNN}}) is most effective for heart rate estimation, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.312 bpm. We systematically investigate the impact of different feature combinations and find that utilizing all four features yields the best results. The MTL model (\textbf{\texttt{2dCNN-MTL}}) achieves accuracy over 95% in murmur detection, surpassing existing models, while maintaining an MAE of 1.636 bpm in heart rate estimation, satisfying the requirements stated by Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Dysarthric Speech Recognition for Unseen Speakers via Prototype-Based Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition (DSR) presents a formidable challenge due to inherent inter-speaker variability, leading to severe performance degradation when applying DSR models to new dysarthric speakers. Traditional speaker adaptation methodologies typically involve fine-tuning models for each speaker, but this strategy is cost-prohibitive and inconvenient for disabled users, requiring substantial data collection. To address this issue, we introduce a prototype-based approach that markedly improves DSR performance for unseen dysarthric speakers without additional fine-tuning. Our method employs a feature extractor trained with HuBERT to produce per-word prototypes that encapsulate the characteristics of previously unseen speakers. These prototypes serve as the basis for classification. Additionally, we incorporate supervised contrastive learning to refine feature extraction. By enhancing representation quality, we further improve DSR performance, enabling effective personalized DSR. We release our code at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/PB-DSR.</description>

      <title>SLIM: Style-Linguistics Mismatch Model for Generalized Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) is crucial to combat the misuse of speech synthesized from generative AI models. Existing ADD models suffer from generalization issues, with a large performance discrepancy between in-domain and out-of-domain data. Moreover, the black-box nature of existing models limits their use in real-world scenarios, where explanations are required for model decisions. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a new ADD model that explicitly uses the StyleLInguistics Mismatch (SLIM) in fake speech to separate them from real speech. SLIM first employs self-supervised pretraining on only real samples to learn the style-linguistics dependency in the real class. The learned features are then used in complement with standard pretrained acoustic features (e.g., Wav2vec) to learn a classifier on the real and fake classes. When the feature encoders are frozen, SLIM outperforms benchmark methods on out-of-domain datasets while achieving competitive results on in-domain data. The features learned by SLIM allow us to quantify the (mis)match between style and linguistic content in a sample, hence facilitating an explanation of the model decision.</description>

      <title>Towards Improving NAM-to-Speech Synthesis Intelligibility using Self-Supervised Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to significantly improve the intelligibility in the Non-Audible Murmur (NAM)-to-speech conversion task, leveraging self-supervision and sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning techniques. Unlike conventional methods that explicitly record ground-truth speech, our methodology relies on self-supervision and speech-to-speech synthesis to simulate ground-truth speech. Despite utilizing simulated speech, our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 29.08% improvement in the Mel-Cepstral Distortion (MCD) metric. Additionally, we present error rates and demonstrate our model's proficiency to synthesize speech in novel voices of interest. Moreover, we present a methodology for augmenting the existing CSTR NAM TIMIT Plus corpus, setting a benchmark with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 42.57% to gauge the intelligibility of the synthesized speech. Speech samples can be found at https://nam2speech.github.io/NAM2Speech/</description>

      <title>Speech Bandwidth Expansion Via High Fidelity Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech bandwidth expansion is crucial for expanding the frequency range of low-bandwidth speech signals, thereby improving audio quality, clarity and perceptibility in digital applications. Its applications span telephony, compression, text-to-speech synthesis, and speech recognition. This paper presents a novel approach using a high-fidelity generative adversarial network, unlike cascaded systems, our system is trained end-to-end on paired narrowband and wideband speech signals. Our method integrates various bandwidth upsampling ratios into a single unified model specifically designed for speech bandwidth expansion applications. Our approach exhibits robust performance across various bandwidth expansion factors, including those not encountered during training, demonstrating zero-shot capability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to showcase this capability. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous end-to-end approaches, as well as interpolation and traditional techniques, showcasing its effectiveness in practical speech enhancement applications.</description>

      <title>Utilizing TTS Synthesized Data for Efficient Development of Keyword Spotting Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of TTS synthesized training data for KWS (keyword spotting) task while minimizing development cost and time. Keyword spotting models require a huge amount of training data to be accurate, and obtaining such training data can be costly. In the current state of the art, TTS models can generate large amounts of natural-sounding data, which can help reducing cost and time for KWS model development. Still, TTS generated data can be lacking diversity compared to real data. To pursue maximizing KWS model accuracy under the constraint of limited resources and current TTS capability, we explored various strategies to mix TTS data and real human speech data, with a focus on minimizing real data use and maximizing diversity of TTS output. Our experimental results indicate that relatively small amounts of real audio data with speaker diversity (100 speakers, 2k utterances) and large amounts of TTS synthesized data can achieve reasonably high accuracy (within 3x error rate of baseline), compared to the baseline (trained with 3.8M real positive utterances).</description>

      <title>Analyzing Speech Unit Selection for Textless Speech-to-Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in textless speech-to-speech translation systems have been driven by the adoption of self-supervised learning techniques.     Although most state-of-the-art systems adopt a similar architecture to transform source language speech into sequences of discrete representations in the target language, the criteria for selecting these target speech units remains an open question.    This work explores the selection process through a study of downstream tasks such as automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speaker recognition, and emotion recognition.      Interestingly, our findings reveal a discrepancy in the optimization of discrete speech units: units that perform well in resynthesis performance do not necessarily correlate with those that enhance translation efficacy.      This discrepancy underscores the nuanced complexity of target feature selection and its impact on the overall performance of speech-to-speech translation systems.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Neural Responses to Classical Music Using Organoid Intelligence Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music is a complex auditory stimulus capable of eliciting significant changes in brain activity, influencing cognitive processes such as memory, attention, and emotional regulation. However, the underlying mechanisms of music-induced cognitive processes remain largely unknown. Organoid intelligence and deep learning models show promise for simulating and analyzing these neural responses to classical music, an area significantly unexplored in computational neuroscience. Hence, we present the PyOrganoid library, an innovative tool that facilitates the simulation of organoid learning models, integrating sophisticated machine learning techniques with biologically inspired organoid simulations. Our study features the development of the Pianoid model, a "deep organoid learning" model that utilizes a Bidirectional LSTM network to predict EEG responses based on audio features from classical music recordings. This model demonstrates the feasibility of using computational methods to replicate complex neural processes, providing valuable insights into music perception and cognition. Likewise, our findings emphasize the utility of synthetic models in neuroscience research and highlight the PyOrganoid library's potential as a versatile tool for advancing studies in neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>The formation of perceptual space in early phonetic acquisition: a cross-linguistic modeling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates how learners organize perceptual space in early phonetic acquisition by advancing previous studies in two key aspects. Firstly, it examines the shape of the learned hidden representation as well as its ability to categorize phonetic categories. Secondly, it explores the impact of training models on context-free acoustic information, without involving contextual cues, on phonetic acquisition, closely mimicking the early language learning stage. Using a cross-linguistic modeling approach, autoencoder models are trained on English and Mandarin and evaluated in both native and non-native conditions, following experimental conditions used in infant language perception studies. The results demonstrate that unsupervised bottom-up training on context-free acoustic information leads to comparable learned representations of perceptual space between native and non-native conditions for both English and Mandarin, resembling the early stage of universal listening in infants. These findings provide insights into the organization of perceptual space during early phonetic acquisition and contribute to our understanding of the formation and representation of phonetic categories.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding emotions is a fundamental aspect of human communication. Integrating audio and video signals offers a more comprehensive understanding of emotional states compared to traditional methods that rely on a single data source, such as speech or facial expressions. Despite its potential, multimodal emotion recognition faces significant challenges, particularly in synchronization, feature extraction, and fusion of diverse data sources. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel transformer-based model named Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention (AVT-CA). The AVT-CA model employs a transformer fusion approach to effectively capture and synchronize interlinked features from both audio and video inputs, thereby resolving synchronization problems. Additionally, the Cross Attention mechanism within AVT-CA selectively extracts and emphasizes critical features while discarding irrelevant ones from both modalities, addressing feature extraction and fusion challenges. Extensive experimental analysis conducted on the CMU-MOSEI, RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model. The results underscore the importance of AVT-CA in developing precise and reliable multimodal emotion recognition systems for practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Approach for the Spatial Upsampling of Spherical Microphone Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherical microphone arrays are convenient tools for capturing the spatial characteristics of a sound field. However, achieving superior spatial resolution requires arrays with numerous capsules, consequently leading to expensive devices. To address this issue, we present a method for spatially upsampling spherical microphone arrays with a limited number of capsules. Our approach exploits a physics-informed neural network with Rowdy activation functions, leveraging physical constraints to provide high-order microphone array signals, starting from low-order devices. Results show that, within its domain of application, our approach outperforms a state of the art method based on signal processing for spherical microphone arrays upsampling.</description>

      <title>Anticipatory Music Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce anticipation: a method for constructing a controllable generative model of a temporal point process (the event process) conditioned asynchronously on realizations of a second, correlated process (the control process). We achieve this by interleaving sequences of events and controls, such that controls appear following stopping times in the event sequence. This work is motivated by problems arising in the control of symbolic music generation. We focus on infilling control tasks, whereby the controls are a subset of the events themselves, and conditional generation completes a sequence of events given the fixed control events. We train anticipatory infilling models using the large and diverse Lakh MIDI music dataset. These models match the performance of autoregressive models for prompted music generation, with the additional capability to perform infilling control tasks, including accompaniment. Human evaluators report that an anticipatory model produces accompaniments with similar musicality to even music composed by humans over a 20-second clip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bioacoustic research, vital for understanding animal behavior, conservation, and ecology, faces a monumental challenge: analyzing vast datasets where animal vocalizations are rare. While deep learning techniques are becoming standard, adapting them to bioacoustics remains difficult. We address this with animal2vec, an interpretable large transformer model, and a self-supervised training scheme tailored for sparse and unbalanced bioacoustic data. It learns from unlabeled audio and then refines its understanding with labeled data. Furthermore, we introduce and publicly release MeerKAT: Meerkat Kalahari Audio Transcripts, a dataset of meerkat (Suricata suricatta) vocalizations with millisecond-resolution annotations, the largest labeled dataset on non-human terrestrial mammals currently available. Our model outperforms existing methods on MeerKAT and the publicly available NIPS4Bplus birdsong dataset. Moreover, animal2vec performs well even with limited labeled data (few-shot learning). animal2vec and MeerKAT provide a new reference point for bioacoustic research, enabling scientists to analyze large amounts of data even with scarce ground truth information.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Continual Learning Scenarios and Strategies for Audio Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio analysis is useful in many application scenarios. The state-of-the-art audio analysis approaches assume the data distribution at training and deployment time will be the same. However, due to various real-life challenges, the data may encounter drift in its distribution or can encounter new classes in the late future. Thus, a one-time trained model might not perform adequately. Continual learning (CL) approaches are devised to handle such changes in data distribution. There have been a few attempts to use CL approaches for audio analysis. Yet, there is a lack of a systematic evaluation framework. In this paper, we create a comprehensive CL dataset and characterize CL approaches for audio-based monitoring tasks. We have investigated the following CL and non-CL approaches: EWC, LwF, SI, GEM, A-GEM, GDumb, Replay, Naive, Cumulative, and Joint training. The study is very beneficial for researchers and practitioners working in the area of audio analysis for developing adaptive models. We observed that Replay achieved better results than other methods in the DCASE challenge data. It achieved an accuracy of 70.12% for the domain incremental scenario and an accuracy of 96.98% for the class incremental scenario.</description>

      <title>AIR-Bench: Benchmarking Large Audio-Language Models via Generative Comprehension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, instruction-following audio-language models have received broad attention for human-audio interaction. However, the absence of benchmarks capable of evaluating audio-centric interaction capabilities has impeded advancements in this field. Previous models primarily focus on assessing different fundamental tasks, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and lack an assessment of the open-ended generative capabilities centered around audio. Thus, it is challenging to track the progression in the Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) domain and to provide guidance for future improvement. In this paper, we introduce AIR-Bench (\textbf{A}udio \textbf{I}nst\textbf{R}uction \textbf{Bench}mark), the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LALMs to understand various types of audio signals (including human speech, natural sounds, and music), and furthermore, to interact with humans in the textual format. AIR-Bench encompasses two dimensions: \textit{foundation} and \textit{chat} benchmarks. The former consists of 19 tasks with approximately 19k single-choice questions, intending to inspect the basic single-task ability of LALMs. The latter one contains 2k instances of open-ended question-and-answer data, directly assessing the comprehension of the model on complex audio and its capacity to follow instructions. Both benchmarks require the model to generate hypotheses directly. We design a unified framework that leverages advanced language models, such as GPT-4, to evaluate the scores of generated hypotheses given the meta-information of the audio.
