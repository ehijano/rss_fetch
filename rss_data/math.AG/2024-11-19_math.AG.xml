      <title>A tropical framework for using Porteous formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a tropical cycle $X$, one can talk about a notion of tropical vector bundles on $X$ having real or tropical fibers. By restricting our attention to bounded rational sections of these bundles, one can develop a good notion of characteristic classes that behave as expected classically. We present further results on these characteristic classes and use it to notably prove the analogue of the splitting principle, which allows us to establish the foundations for Porteous' formula in this setting which provides a determinantal expression for the fundamental class of degeneracy loci in terms of Chern classes.</description>

      <title>Canonical blow-ups of Grassmannians I: How canonical is a Kausz compactification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a simple uniform picture incorporating the Kausz compactifications and the spaces of complete collineations by blowing up Grassmannians $G(p,n)$ according to a torus action $\mathbb G_m$. We show that each space of complete collineations is isomorphic to any maximal-dimensional connected component of the $\mathbb G_m$-fixed point scheme of a Kausz-type compactification. We prove that the Kausz-type compactification is the total family over the Hilbert quotient $G(p,n)/ \! \! / \mathbb G_m$ which is isomorphic to the space of complete collineations. In particular, the Kausz compactifications are toroidal embeddings of general linear groups in the sense of Brion-Kumar. We also show that the Kausz-type compactifications resolve the Landsberg-Manivel birational maps from projective spaces to Grassmannians, by comparing Kausz's construction with ours. As an application, by studying the foliation we derive resolutions of certain birational maps among projective bundles over Grassmannians. The results in this paper are partially taken from the first author's earlier arxiv post (Canonical blow-ups of grassmann manifolds, arxiv:2007.06200), which has been revised and expanded in collaboration with the second author.</description>

      <title>Wronski Pairs of Honeycomb Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study certain generic systems of real polynomial equations associated with triangulations of convex polytopes and investigate their number of real solutions. Our main focus is set on pairs of plane algebraic curves which form a so-called Wronski system. The computational tasks arising in the analysis of such Wronski pairs lead us to the frontiers of current computer algebra algorithms and their implementations, both via Gr\"obner bases and numerical algebraic geometry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study, for plane complex branches of genus one, the topological type of its generic polar curve, as a function of the semigroup of values and the Zariski invariant of the branch. We improve some results given by Casas-Alvero in 2023, since we filter the topological type fixed for the branch by the possible values of Zariski invariants.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric $\ell$-adic sheaves for reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the hypergeometric exponential sum associated to a finite family of representations of a reductive group over a finite field. We introduce the hypergeometric $\ell$-adic sheaf to describe the behavior of the hypergeometric exponential sum. It is a perverse sheaf, and it is the counterpart in characteristic $p$ of the $A$-hypergeometric $\mathcal D$-module introduced by Kapranov. Using the theory of the Fourier transform for vector bundles over a general base developed by Wang, we are able to study the hypergeometric $\ell$-adic sheaf via the hypergeometric $\mathcal D$-module. We apply our results to the estimation of the hypergeometric exponential sum.</description>

      <title>Computations of Stable Multiplicities in the Cohomology of Configuration Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm to compute the stable multiplicity of a family of irreducible representations in the cohomology of ordered configuration space of the plane. Using this algorithm, we compute the stable multiplicities of all families of irreducibles given by Young diagrams with $23$ boxes or less up to cohomological degree $50$. In particular, this determines the stable cohomology in cohomological degrees $0 \leq i \leq 11$. We prove related qualitative results and formulate some conjectures.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of the present note is to provide a new proof ot the well-known result due to Hartshorne and Hirschowitz to the effect that general lines in projective spaces have good postulation. Our approach uses specialization to a hyperplane and thus opens door to study postulation of general codimension 2 linear subspaces in projective spaces.</description>

      <title>The Kernel of the Gysin Homomorphism for Positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an uncountable algebraically closed filed of positive characteristic and let $S_0$ be a connected smooth projective surface over $k$. We extend the theorem on the Gysin kernel from [28, Theorem 5.1] to also be true over $k$, where it was proved over $\mathbb{C}$. This is done by showing that almost all results still hold true over $k$ via the same argument or by using \'{e}tale base arguments and then use a lift with the Comparison theorem [22, Theorems 21.1 &amp; 20.5] as needed.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Severi Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this appendix, we summarize known results on the geometry of Severi varieties on toric surfaces - the varieties parameterizing integral curves of a given geometric genus in a given linear system. Till the last decade, Severi varieties were studied exclusively in characteristic zero. In particular, in the 80-s, Zariski proved that a general plane curve of a given genus is necessarily nodal and gave a dimension-theoretic characterization of the Severi varieties. A few years later, Harris showed that the classical Severi varieties are irreducible. The geometry of Severi varieties is much subtler on general toric surfaces, especially in positive characteristic. In the appendix, we discuss in particular recent examples of reducible Severi varieties and of components of Severi varieties parameterizing non-nodal curves in positive characteristic. We explain the new tools coming from tropical geometry that allowed us to generalize the theorems of Zariski and Harris to arbitrary characteristic in the classical case of curves on the projective plane. Finally, we discuss the results about the adjacency of Severi varieties for different genera.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study on examples a notion of the Artin shape for a motive related to a projective homogenous variety. We apply it to the problem of finding the complete motivic decomposition of the variety. Our examples cover unitary involution varieties as well as some varieties given by a quadratic Weil transfer. Some of the decompositions obtained dispel prior expectations on how motivic decompositions of projective homogeneous varieties can look like.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Gelfand Duality: the algebraic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to define a notion of non-commutative Gelfand duality. Using techniques from derived algebraic geometry, we show that category of rings is anti-equivalent to a subcategory of pre-ringed spaces, inspired by Grothendieck's work on commutative rings. Our notion of spectrum, although formally reminiscent of the Grothendieck spectrum, is new; in particular, for commutative rings it does not always agree with the Grothendieck spectrum, but it always projects onto it. Remarkably, an appropriately defined relative version of our spectrum agrees with the Grothendieck spectrum for finitely generated commutative algebras over the complex numbers. This work aims to represent the starting point for a rigorous study of geometric properties of quantum spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Zero-one dual characters of flagged Weyl modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a criterion of when the dual character $\chi_{D}(x)$ of the flagged Weyl module associated to a diagram $D$ in the grid $[n]\times [n]$ is zero-one, that is, the coefficients of monomials in $\chi_{D}(x)$ are either 0 or 1. This settles a conjecture proposed by M{\'e}sz{\'a}ros--St. Dizier--Tanjaya. Since Schubert polynomials and key polynomials occur as special cases of dual flagged Weyl characters, our approach provides a new and unified proof of known criteria for zero-one Schubert/key polynomials due to Fink--M{\'e}sz{\'a}ros--St. Dizier and Hodges--Yong, respectively.</description>

Abstract: The Heisenberg curve is defined topologically as a cover of the Fermat curve and corresponds to an extension of the projective line minus three points by the non-abelian Heisenberg group modulo n. We compute its fundamental group and investigate an action from Artin's Braid group to the curve itself and its homology. We also provide a description of the homology in terms of irreducible representations of the Heisenberg group over a field of characteristic $0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and $k$ be an algebraically closed field with characteristic $p$. Booher and Cais showed that the $a$-number of a $\mathbb Z/p \mathbb Z$-Galois cover of curves $\phi: Y \to X$ must be greater than a lower bound determined by the ramification of $\phi$. In this paper, we provide evidence that the lower bound is optimal by finding examples of Artin-Schreier curves that have $a$-number equal to its lower bound for all $p$. Furthermore we use formal patching to generate infinite families of Artin-Schreier curves with $a$-number equal to the lower bound in any characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recall the lower-upper varieties from [Knutson '05] and give a formula for their equivariant cohomology classes, as a sum over generic pipe dreams. We recover as limits the classic and bumpless pipe dream formulae for double Schubert polynomials. As a byproduct, we obtain a formula for the degree of the $n$th commuting variety as a sum of powers of 2. Generic pipe dreams also appear in the Segre-Schwarz-MacPherson analogue of the AJS/Billey formula, and when computing the Chern-Schwarz-MacPherson class of the orbit $B_- w B_+ \subseteq Mat_{k\times n}$ or of a double Bruhat cell $B_-u B_+ \cap B_+ v B_-$.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of semiorthogonal decompositions in families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.03303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth projective family of schemes we prove that a semiorthogonal decomposition of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves of a fibre uniquely deforms over an \'etale neighbourhood of the point. We do this using a comparison theorem between semiorthogonal decompositions and decomposition triangles of the structure sheaf of the diagonal. We then apply to the latter a deformation theory for morphisms with a fixed lift of the target, which is developed in the appendix.
  Using this as a key ingredient we introduce a moduli space which classifies semiorthogonal decompositions of the category of perfect complexes of a smooth projective family. Using Artin's criterion, we show that this is an \'etale algebraic space over the base scheme of the family, which can be non-quasicompact and non-separated.
  We generalise this to families of geometric noncommutative schemes in the sense of Orlov. We also define a subfunctor classifying nontrivial semiorthogonal decompositions only, and conjecture it is an open and closed subspace.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-theory of flag varieties via non-abelian localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.06281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we reconstruct explicitly the generating function of genus-zero K-theoretic permutation-invariant Gromov-Witten invariants, known as the big $\mathcal{J}$-function, for any partial flag variety. The reconstruction may start with any Weyl-group-invariant value of the well-understood big $\mathcal{J}$-function of an associated toric variety. We generalize the recursive method \cite{Givental:perm2}, based on torus fixed point localization, to deal with non-isolated one-dimensional toric orbits, through incorporating ``balanced broken orbits'' into consideration and subsequently proving a vanishing result of their contribution. Furthermore, we extend the study to twisted generating functions of the flag variety, and demonstrate properties including a non-abelian quantum Lefschetz theorem and a duality between level structures. In the end, we construct a K-theoretic mirror in terms of Jackson-type integrals.</description>

      <title>The Tate Conjecture for even dimensional Gushel-Mukai varieties in characteristic $p\geq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Gushel-Mukai (GM) varieties of dimension 4 or 6 in characteristic $p$. Our main result is the Tate conjecture for all such varieties over finitely generated fields of characteristic $p\geq 5$. In the case of GM sixfolds, we follow the method used by Madapusi Pera in his proof of the Tate conjecture for K3 surfaces. As input for this, we prove a number of basic results about GM sixfolds, such as the fact that there are no nonzero global vector fields. For GM fourfolds, we prove the Tate conjecture by reducing it to the case of GM sixfolds by making use of the notion of generalised partners plus the fact that generalised partners in characteristic 0 have isomorphic Chow motives in the middle degree. Several steps in the proofs rely on results in characteristic 0 that are proven our paper "Algebraic cycles on Gushel-Mukai varieties", \'Epijournal G\'eom\'etrie Alg\'ebrique, Volume sp\'ecial en l'honneur de Claire Voisin, 2024.</description>

Abstract: We consider several systems of algebras of real- and complex-valued functions, which appear in o-minimal geometry and related geometrically tame contexts. For each such system, we prove its stability under parametric integration and we study the asymptotics of the functions as well as the nature of their parametric Mellin transforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a combinatorial theory of horospherical stacks which is motivated by the work of Geraschenko and Satriano on toric stacks. A horospherical stack corresponds to a combinatorial object called a stacky coloured fan. We give many concrete examples, including a class of easy-to-draw examples called coloured fantastacks. The main results in this paper are combinatorial descriptions of horospherical stacks, the morphisms between them, their decolourations, and their good moduli spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a geometrically integral smooth 3-fold $X$ with nef anti-canonical class and negative Kodaira dimension over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of characteristic $p&gt;5$ and cardinality $q=p^e &gt; 19$ has a rational point. Additionally, under the same assumptions on $p$ and $q$, we show that a 3-fold $X$ with trivial canonical class and non-zero first Betti number $b_1(X) \neq 0$ has a rational point. Our techniques rely on the Minimal Model Program to establish several structure results for generalized log Calabi--Yau 3-fold pairs over perfect fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the rationality of the characteristic form for a degree one character of the Galois group of an abelian extension of henselian discrete valuation fields. We prove the integrality of the characteristic form for a rank one sheaf on a regular excellent scheme. These properties are shown by reducing to the corresponding properties of the refined Swan conductor proved by Kato. We define the F-characteristic cycle of a rank one sheaf on an arithmetic surface as a cycle on the FW-cotangent bundle using the characteristic form on the basis of the computation of the characteristic cycle in the equal characteristic case by Yatagawa. The rationality and the integrality of the characteristic form are necessary for the definition of the F-characteristic cycle. We prove the intersection of the F-characteristic cycle with the 0-section computes the Swan conductor of cohomology of the generic fiber.</description>

Abstract: We are considering the commuting variety of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{pgl}_n$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p &gt;0$, namely the set of pairs $ \{ (A,B) \in \mathfrak{pgl}_n \times \mathfrak{pgl}_n \mid [A,B]=0 \} $. We prove that if $n=pr$, then there are precisely two irreducible components, of dimensions $n^2+r-1$ and $n^2+n-2$. We also prove that the variety $\{ (x,y) \in GL_n(k) \times GL_n(k) \mid [x,y]=\zeta I \}$ is irreducible of dimension $n^2 +n/d$, where $\zeta$ is a root of unity of order $d$ with $d$ dividing $n$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a relative of the Hermitian curve of degree $\sqrt{q}+1$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, which is a plane curve defined by \[(x^{\sqrt{q}}, y^{\sqrt{q}}, z^{\sqrt{q}})A {}^t \!(x,y,z) =0\] with $A \in GL(3, \mathbb{F}_q)$, and study their basic properties, one of which is that the number of $\mathbb{F}_q$-points of any relative of the Hermitian curve of degree $\sqrt{q}+1$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $\sqrt{q}$. In the latter part of this paper, we classify those curves having two or more rational inflexions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a minimal irregular surface of general type, whose Albanese map induces a fibration $f:\,S \to C$ of genus $g$.We prove a linear upper bound on the genus $g$ if $K_S^2\leq 4\chi(\mathcal{O}_S)$. Examples are constructed showing that the above linear upper bound is sharp. We also give a characterization of the Albanese fibrations reaching the above upper bound when $\chi(\mathcal{O}_S)\geq 5$.On the other hand, we will construct a sequence of surfaces $S_n$ of general type with $K_{S_n}^2/\chi(\mathcal{O}_{S_n})&gt;4$ and with an Albanese fibration $f_n$, such that the genus $g_n$ of a general fiber of $f_n$ increases quadratically with $\chi(\mathcal{O}_{S_n})$,and that $K_{S_n}^2/\chi(\mathcal{O}_{S_n})$ can be arbitrarily close to $4$.</description>

      <title>On moduli spaces of canonical threefolds with small genera and minimal volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the canonical model of a $3$-fold of general type with geometric genus $2$ and with minimal canonical volume $\frac{1}{3}$ must be a hypersurface of degree $16$ in $\mathbb{P}(1,1,2,3,8)$, which gives an explicit description of its canonical ring. This implies that the coarse moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{\frac{1}{3}, 2}$, parametrizing all canonical $3$-folds with canonical volume $\frac{1}{3}$ and geometric genus $2$, is an irreducible unirational variety of dimension $189$. Parallel studies show that $\mathcal{M}_{1, 3}$ is irreducible unirational as well and is of dimension $236$, and that $\mathcal{M}_{2, 4}$ is irreducible unirational and is of dimension $270$. As being conceived, every member in these 3 families is simply connected. Additionally, our method yields $\textrm{Vol}\geq \frac{4}{3}p_g-\frac{10}{3}$ for $3$-folds of general type with $5\leq p_g\leq 10$, which completely solves all remaining cases of the Noether inequality of $3$-folds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be either a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme, or a Noetherian scheme of finite Krull dimension. We show that the Grothendieck abelian category $X{-}\mathsf{Qcoh}$ of quasi-coherent sheaves on $X$ satisfies the Roos axiom $\mathrm{AB}4^*$-$n$: the derived functors of infinite direct product have finite homological dimension in $X{-}\mathsf{Qcoh}$. In each of the two settings, two proofs of the main result are given: a more elementary one, based on the Cech coresolution, and a more conceptual one, demonstrating existence of a generator of finite projective dimension in $X{-}\mathsf{Qcoh}$ in the semi-separated case and using the co-contra correspondence (with contraherent cosheaves) in the Noetherian case. The hereditary complete cotorsion pair (very flat quasi-coherent sheaves, contraadjusted quasi-coherent sheaves) in the abelian category $X{-}\mathsf{Qcoh}$ for a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme $X$ is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study ring of functions on the (classical and quantized) phase space of 2-dimensional BF theory with the gauge group $\mathrm{GL}_N$ coupled to a 1-dimensional quantum mechanics with global symmetry $\mathrm{GL}_K$. These functions are gauge-invariant local observables of the coupled system. We first construct the classical phase space of this system and describe its ring of functions and their large-$N$ limit. We next compute the Hilbert series of these algebras for finite-$N$ and also in the large-$N$ limit. We then study the quantization of this phase space and the deformation quantization of its ring of functions, elaborate its relation to the Yangian, and construct its coproduct. Finally, we identify these quantized algebras with the quantized Coulomb branch algebras of certain 3-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ quiver gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multivariate cryptograpic instance in practice is a multivariate polynomial system. So the security of a protocol rely on the complexity of solving a multivariate polynomial system. In this paper there is an overview on a general algorithm used to solve a multivariate system and the quantity to which the complexity of this algorithm depends on: the solving degree. Unfortunately, it is hard to compute. For this reason, it is introduced an invariant: the degree of regularity. This invariant, under certain condition, give us an upper bound on the solving degree. Then we speak about random polynomial systems and in particular what "random" means to us. Finally, we give an upper bound on both the degree of regularity and the solving degree of such random systems.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of eigencomputations for polynomial optimization on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a convergent hierarchy of lower bounds on the minimum value of a real form over the unit sphere. The main practical advantage of our hierarchy over the real sum-of-squares (RSOS) hierarchy is that the lower bound at each level of our hierarchy is obtained by a minimum eigenvalue computation, as opposed to the full semidefinite program (SDP) required at each level of RSOS. In practice, this allows us to compute bounds on much larger forms than are computationally feasible for RSOS. Our hierarchy outperforms previous alternatives to RSOS, both asymptotically and in numerical experiments. We obtain our hierarchy by proving a reduction from real optimization on the sphere to Hermitian optimization on the sphere, and invoking the Hermitian sum-of-squares (HSOS) hierarchy. This opens the door to using other Hermitian optimization techniques for real optimization, and gives a path towards developing spectral hierarchies for more general constrained real optimization problems. To this end, we use our techniques to develop a hierarchy of eigencomputations for computing the real tensor spectral norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a fundamental problem in statistics. Characteristics of the MLE problem for discrete algebraic statistical models are reflected in the geometry of the $\textit{likelihood correspondence}$, a variety that ties together data and their maximum likelihood estimators. We construct this ideal for the large class of toric models and find a Gr\"{o}bner basis in the case of complete and joint independence models arising from multi-way contingency tables. All of our constructions are implemented in $\textit{Macaulay2}$ in a package $\texttt{LikelihoodGeometry}$ along with other tools of use in algebraic statistics. We end with an experimental section using these implementations on several interesting examples.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds for the number of rational points on algebraic curves and dimension growth, over all global fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $C\subset{\mathbb P}_K^2$ be an algebraic curve over a number field $K$, and denote by $d_K$ the degree of $K$ over ${\mathbb Q}$. We prove that the number of $K$-rational points of height at most $H$ in $C$ is bounded by $c d^{2}H^{2d_K/d}(\log H)^\kappa$ where $c,\kappa$ are absolute constants. We also prove analogous results for global fields in positive characteristic, and, for higher dimensional varieties.
  The quadratic dependence on $d$ in the bound as well as the exponent of $H$ are optimal; the novel aspect is the quadratic dependence on $d$ which answers a question raised by Salberger. We derive new results on Heath-Brown's and Serre's dimension growth conjecture for global fields, which generalize in particular the results by the first two authors and Novikov from the case $K={\mathbb Q}$. The proofs however are of a completely different nature, replacing the real analytic approach previously used by the $p$-adic determinant method. The optimal dependence on $d$ is achieved using a technical improvement in the treatment of high multiplicity points on mod $p$ reductions of algebraic curves.</description>

      <title>Homological mirror symmetry for Batyrev mirror pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture for a large class of mirror pairs of Calabi--Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. These mirror pairs were constructed by Batyrev from dual reflexive polytopes. The theorem holds in characteristic zero and in all but finitely many positive characteristics.</description>

      <title>Isogeny relations in products of families of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E_{\lambda}$ be the Legendre family of elliptic curves with equation $Y^2=X(X-1)(X-\lambda)$. Given a curve $\mathcal{C}$, satisfying a condition on the degrees of some of its coordinates and parametrizing $m$ points $P_1, \ldots, P_m \in E_{\lambda}$ and $n$ points $Q_1, \ldots, Q_n \in E_{\mu}$ and assuming that those points are generically linearly independent over the generic endomorphism ring, we prove that there are at most finitely many points $\mathbf{c}_0$ on $\mathcal{C}$, such that there exists an isogeny $\phi: E_{\mu(\mathbf{c}_0)} \rightarrow E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)}$ and the $m+n$ points $P_1(\mathbf{c}_0), \ldots, P_m(\mathbf{c}_0), \phi(Q_1(\mathbf{c}_0)), \ldots, \phi(Q_n(\mathbf{c}_0)) \in E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)}$ are linearly dependent over $\mathrm{End}(E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)})$.</description>

      <title>X-arability of mixed quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of determining when entanglement is present in a quantum system is one of the most active areas of research in quantum physics. Depending on the setting at hand, different notions of entanglement (or lack thereof) become relevant. Examples include separability (of bosons, fermions, and distinguishable particles), Schmidt number, biseparability, entanglement depth, and bond dimension. In this work, we propose and study a unified notion of separability, which we call X-arability, that captures a wide range of applications including these. For a subset (more specifically, an algebraic variety) of pure states X, we say that a mixed quantum state is X-arable if it lies in the convex hull of X. We develop unified tools and provable guarantees for X-arability, which already give new results for the standard separability problem. Our results include:
  -- An X-tensions hierarchy of semidefinite programs for X-arability (generalizing the symmetric extensions hierarchy for separability), and a new de Finetti theorem for fermionic separability.
  -- A hierarchy of eigencomputations for optimizing a Hermitian operator over X, with applications to X-tanglement witnesses and polynomial optimization.
  -- A hierarchy of linear systems for the X-tangled subspace problem, with improved polynomial time guarantees even for the standard entangled subspace problem, in both the generic and worst case settings.</description>
