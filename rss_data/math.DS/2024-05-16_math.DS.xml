      <title>Is every triangle a trajectory of an elliptical billiard?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Marden's Theorem from geometric theory of polynomials, we show that for every triangle there is a unique ellipse such that the triangle is a billiard trajectory within that ellipse. Since $3$-periodic trajectories of billiards within ellipses are examples of the Poncelet polygons, our considerations provide a new insight into the relationship between Marden's Theorem and the Poncelet Porism, two gems of exceptional classical beauty. We also show that every parallelogram is a billiard trajectory within a unique ellipse. We prove a similar result for the self-intersecting polygonal lines consisting of two pairs of congruent sides, named ``Darboux butterflies". In each of three considered cases, we effectively calculate the foci of the boundary ellipses.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems and complex networks: A Koopman operator perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator has entered and transformed many research areas over the last years. Although the underlying concept$\unicode{x2013}$representing highly nonlinear dynamical systems by infinite-dimensional linear operators$\unicode{x2013}$has been known for a long time, the availability of large data sets and efficient machine learning algorithms for estimating the Koopman operator from data make this framework extremely powerful and popular. Koopman operator theory allows us to gain insights into the characteristic global properties of a system without requiring detailed mathematical models. We will show how these methods can also be used to analyze complex networks and highlight relationships between Koopman operators and graph Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity of renormalization of critical quasicircle maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a well developed renormalization theory of real analytic critical circle maps by de Faria, de Melo, and Yampolsky. In this paper, we extend Yampolsky's result on hyperbolicity of renormalization periodic points to a larger class of dynamical objects, namely critical quasicircle maps, i.e. analytic self homeomorphisms of a quasicircle with a single critical point. Unlike critical circle maps, the inner and outer criticalities of critical quasicircle maps can be distinct. We develop a compact analytic renormalization operator called Corona Renormalization with a hyperbolic fixed point whose stable manifold has codimension one and consists of critical quasicircle maps of the same criticality and periodic type rotation number. Our proof is an adaptation of Pacman Renormalization Theory for Siegel disks as well as rigidity results on the escaping dynamics of transcendental entire functions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Geometric Structure of Neural Networks and Neural ODEs via Morse Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides classical feed-forward neural networks, also neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) gained particular interest in recent years. Neural ODEs can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of feed-forward or residual neural networks. We study the input-output dynamics of finite and infinite depth neural networks with scalar output. In the finite depth case, the input is a state associated to a finite number of nodes, which maps under multiple non-linear transformations to the state of one output node. In analogy, a neural ODE maps a linear transformation of the input to a linear transformation of its time-$T$ map. We show that depending on the specific structure of the network, the input-output map has different properties regarding the existence and regularity of critical points. These properties can be characterized via Morse functions, which are scalar functions, where every critical point is non-degenerate. We prove that critical points cannot exist, if the dimension of the hidden layer is monotonically decreasing or the dimension of the phase space is smaller or equal to the input dimension. In the case that critical points exist, we classify their regularity depending on the specific architecture of the network. We show that each critical point is non-degenerate, if for finite depth neural networks the underlying graph has no bottleneck, and if for neural ODEs, the linear transformations used have full rank. For each type of architecture, the proven properties are comparable in the finite and in the infinite depth case. The established theorems allow us to formulate results on universal embedding, i.e.\ on the exact representation of maps by neural networks and neural ODEs. Our dynamical systems viewpoint on the geometric structure of the input-output map provides a fundamental understanding, why certain architectures perform better than others.</description>

      <title>Scenarios for the appearance of strange attractors in a model of three interacting microbubble contrast agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlinear dynamics in a model of three interacting encapsulated gas bubbles in a liquid. The model is a system of three coupled nonlinear oscillators with an external periodic force. Such bubbles have numerous applications, for instance, they are used as contrast agents in ultrasound visualization. Certain types of bubbles oscillations may be beneficial or undesirable depending on a given application and, hence, the dependence of the regimes of bubbles oscillations on the control parameters is worth studying. We demonstrate that there is a wide variety of types of dynamics in the model by constructing a chart of dynamical regimes in the control parameters space. Here we focus on hyperchaotic attractors characterized by three positive Lyapunov exponents and strange attractors with one or two positive Lyapunov exponents possessing an additional zero Lyapunov exponent, which have not been observed previously in the context of bubbles oscillations. We also believe that we provide a first example of a hyperchaotic attractor with additional zero Lyaponov exponent. Furthermore, the mechanisms of the onset of these types of attractors are still not well studied. We identify two-parametric regions in the control parameter space where these hyperchaotic and chaotic attractors appear and study one-parametric routes leading to them. We associate the appearance of hyperchaotic attractors with three positive Lyapunov exponents with the inclusion of a periodic orbit with a three-dimensional unstable manifold, while the onset of chaotic oscillations with an additional zero Lyapunov exponent is connected to the partial synchronization of bubbles oscillations. We propose several underlying bifurcation mechanisms that explain the emergence of these regimes. We believe that these bifurcation scenarios are universal and can be observed in other systems of coupled oscillators.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Systems Approach to Predicting Patient Outcome after Cardiac Arrest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aim: Approximately six million people suffer cardiac arrests worldwide per year with very low survival rates (&lt;1%). Thus, the aim of this study is to estimate the probability of a poor outcome after cardiac arrest. Accurate outcome predictions avoid removing care too soon for patients with potentially good outcomes or continuing care for patients with likely poor outcomes. Method: The method is based on dynamical systems embedding theorems that show that a reconstructed phase space (RPS) topologically equivalent to an underlying system can be constructed from measured signals. Here the underlying system is the human brain after a cardiac arrest, and the signals are the EEG channels. We model the RPS with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and ensemble the output of the RPS-GMM with clinical data via XGBoost. Results: As team Blue and Gold in the Predicting Neurological Recovery from Coma After Cardiac Arrest: The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2023, our RPS-GMM-XGBoost method obtained a test set competition score of 0.426 and rank of 24/36.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the growth of confined subgroups through boundary actions of groups with contracting elements. We establish that the growth rate of a confined subgroup is strictly greater than half of the ambient growth rate in groups with purely exponential growth. Along the way, several results are obtained on the Hopf decomposition for boundary actions of subgroups with respect to conformal measures. In particular, we prove that confined subgroups are conservative, and examples of subgroups with nontrivial Hopf decomposition are constructed. We show a connection between Hopf decomposition and quotient growth and provide a dichotomy on quotient growth of Schreier graphs for subgroups in hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>Roots in the semiring of finite deterministic dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite discrete-time dynamical systems (FDDS) model phenomena that evolve deterministically in discrete time. It is possible to define sum and product operations on these systems (disjoint union and direct product, respectively) giving a commutative semiring. This algebraic structure led to several works employing polynomial equations to model hypotheses on phenomena modelled using FDDS. To solve these equations, algorithms for performing the division and computing $k$-th roots are needed. In this paper, we propose two polynomial algorithms for these tasks, under the condition that the result is a connected FDDS. This ultimately leads to an efficient solution to equations of the type $AX^k=B$ for connected $X$. These results are some of the important final steps for solving more general polynomial equations on FDDS.</description>

      <title>On identifying the non-linear dynamics of a hovercraft using an end-to-end deep learning approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the identification of the non-linear dynamics of a novel hovercraft design, employing end-to-end deep learning techniques. Our experimental setup consists of a hovercraft propelled by racing drone propellers mounted on a lightweight foam base, allowing it to float and be controlled freely on an air hockey table. We learn parametrized physics-inspired non-linear models directly from data trajectories, leveraging gradient-based optimization techniques prevalent in machine learning research. The chosen model structure allows us to control the position of the hovercraft precisely on the air hockey table. We then analyze the prediction performance and demonstrate the closed-loop control performance on the real system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13065v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sierpinski tetrahedron has a remarkable property: It is projected to squares in three orthogonal directions, and moreover, to sets with positive Lebesgue measures in numerous directions. This paper proposes a method for characterizing directions along which the Sierpinski tetrahedron and other similar fractal 3D objects are projected to sets with positive measures. We apply this methodology to layered fractal imaginary cubes and achieve a comprehensive characterization for them. Layered fractal imaginary cubes are defined as attractors of iterated function systems with layered structures, and they are projected to squares in three orthogonal directions. Within this class, the Sierpinski tetrahedron, T-fractal, and H-fractal stand out as exemplary cases.</description>

      <title>Exact Linearization of Minimally Underactuated Configuration Flat Lagrangian Control Systems by Quasi-Static Feedback of Classical States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the exact linearization of configuration flat Lagrangian control systems with p degrees of freedom and p-1 inputs by quasi-static feedback of classical states. First, we present a detailed analysis of the structure of the parameterization of the system variables by the flat output. Based on that, we systematically construct a linearizing quasi-static feedback law of the classical state such that the closed-loop system shows the behavior of decoupled integrator chains. Our approach shows that the construction of a generalized Brunovsky state can be completely circumvented. Furthermore, we present a method for determining the lengths of the integrator chains achieved by quasi-static feedback laws that allow for rest-to-rest transitions.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we develop a novel functional analytic approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in establishing the existence, uniqueness, regularity of disintegration, and statistical properties of equilibrium states associated with a class of discontinuous dynamics. We apply this approach to a group of piecewise partially hyperbolic maps and a set of potentials. Furthermore, we prove several limit theorems, such as exponential decay of correlations, and propose certain conjectures. Additionally, we provide a set of examples where these results can be applied, including discontinuous dynamics semi-conjugated to the Manneville-Pomeau map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the discontinuity of codings for the Julia set of a quadratic map. To each parameter ray, we associate a natural coding for Julia sets on the ray. Given a hyperbolic component $H$ of the Mandelbrot set, we consider the codings along the two parameter rays landing on the root point of $H$. Our main result describes the discontinuity of these two codings in terms of the kneading sequences of the hyperbolic components which are conspicuous to $H$. This result can be interpreted as a solution to the degenerated case of Lipa's conjecture on the monodromy problem of the horseshoe locus for the complex H\'enon family.</description>

Abstract: A mathematical model featuring the motion of a multilink wheeled vehicle is developed using a nonholonomic model. A detailed analysis of the inertial motion is made. Fixed points of the reduced system are identified, their stability is analyzed, and invariant manifolds are found. For the case of three platforms (links), a phase portrait for motion on an invariant manifold is shown and trajectories of the attachment points of the wheel pairs of the three-link vehicle are presented. In addition, an analysis is made of motion in the case where the leading platform has a rotor whose angular velocity is a periodic function of time. The existence of trajectories for which one of the velocity components increases without bound is established, and the asymptotics for it is found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global existence, uniqueness and exponential stability of mild solutions to the Boussinesq systems on the framework of non-compact Riemannian manifolds. We work on some manifolds satisfying some bounded and negative conditions on curvature tensors. We consider a couple of Stokes and heat semigroups associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. By using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup we establish the existence and uniqueness of the bounded-in-time mild solution for linear system. Next, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear system to obtain the well-posedness by utilizing fixed point arguments. Moreover, we will prove the exponential stability of such solutions by using Gronwall's inequality. Finally, we give an application of stability to study periodic mild solutions. Our results extend the ones in \cite{Pi,HuyHa2022} in the aspect of global-in-time well-posedness and the existence of periodic mild solutions.</description>

      <title>On stability problem for the stationary Boussinesq system in Morrey-type spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish the asymptotic stability of steady solutions for the Boussinesq systems in the framework of Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n \geqslant 3$. In our strategy, we first establish the continuity for the long time of the bilinear terms associated with the mild solutions of the Boussinesq systems, i.e., the bilinear estimates by using only the norm of the present spaces. As a direct consequence, we obtain the existence of global small mild solutions and asymptotic stability of steady solutions of the Boussinesq systems in the class of continuous functions from $[0, \infty)$ to the Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces. Our techniques consist interpolation of operators, duality, heat semigroup estimates , Holder and Young inequalities in block spaces (based on Lorentz spaces) that are preduals of Morrey-Lorentz spaces. Our results are generalized the previous ones of the steady Boussinesq systems in weak-$L^p$ spaces obtained by Hishida [T. Hishida, {\it On a class of Stable Steady flow to the Exterior Convection Problem}, Journal of Differential Equations, Vol. 141, Iss. 1 (1997), pages 54-85] and Ferreira et al. [L.C.F.

Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a state-feedback controller for a linear system, based only on noisy input-state data. We focus on input-state data corrupted by measurement errors, which, albeit less investigated, are as relevant as process disturbances in applications. For energy and instantaneous bounds on these measurement errors, we derive linear matrix inequalities for controller design where the one for the energy bound is equivalent to robust stabilization of all systems consistent with the noisy data points via a common Lyapunov function.</description>

      <title>On the minimal memory set of cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a group $G$ and a finite set $A$, a cellular automaton (CA) is a transformation $\tau : A^G \to A^G$ defined via a finite memory set $S \subseteq G$ and a local map $\mu : A^S \to A$. Although memory sets are not unique, every CA admits a unique minimal memory set, which consists on all the essential elements of $S$ that affect the behavior of the local map. In this paper, we study the links between the minimal memory set and the generating patterns $\mathcal{P}$ of $\mu$; these are the patterns in $A^S$ that are not fixed when the cellular automaton is applied. In particular, we show that when $\vert S \vert \geq 2$ and $\vert \mathcal{P} \vert$ is not a multiple of $\vert A \vert$, then the minimal memory set must be $S$ itself. Moreover, when $\vert \mathcal{P} \vert = \vert A \vert$, $\vert S \vert \geq 3$, and the restriction of $\mu$ to these patterns is well-behaved, then the minimal memory set must be $S$ or $S \setminus \{s\}$, for some $s \in S \setminus \{e\}$. These are some of the first general theoretical results on the minimal memory set of a cellular automaton.</description>
