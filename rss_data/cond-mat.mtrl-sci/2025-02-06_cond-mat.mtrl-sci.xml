      <title>On the Convergence of Strong Cylindrical and Spherical Shock Waves in Solid Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a description of the behaviour of shock-compressed solid materials following the Geometrical Shock Dynamics (GSD) theory. GSD has been successfully applied to various gas dynamics problems, and here we have employed it to investigate the propagation of cylindrically and spherically symmetric converging shock waves in solid materials. The analytical solution of shock dynamics equations has been obtained in strong-shock limit, assuming the solid material to be homogeneous and isotropic and obeying the Mie-Gruneisen equation of state. The non-dimensional expressions are obtained for the velocity of shock, the pressure, the mass density, the particle velocity, the temperature, the speed of sound, the adiabatic bulk modulus, and the change-in-entropy behind the strong converging shock front. The influences as a result of changes in (i) the propagation distance r from the axis or centre (r=0) of convergence, (ii) the Gruneisen parameter, and (iii) the material parameter are explored on the shock velocity and the domain behind the converging shock front. The results show that as the shock focuses at the axis or origin, the shock velocity, the pressure, the temperature, and the change-in-entropy increase in the shock-compressed titanium Ti6Al4V, stainless steel 304, aluminum 6061-T6, etc.</description>

      <title>High performance vacuum annealed beta-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/Ga2O3 HFET with f_T/f_MAX of 32/65 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter reports high performance beta-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/Ga2O3 Heterostructure FET (HFET) with improved regrowth process. Highly scaled I shaped gate have been fabricated with degenerately doped (N++) source/drain contact regrown by ozone molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Aiming to address the limitations observed in previous generation devices, this work incorporates a low-power BCl3/Ar and SF6/Ar plasma etching process to remove the AlGaO barrier layer and Ga2O3 layer respectively before regrowth. Additionally, the surface was cleaned and vacuum annealing was carried out before MBE regrowth to reduce any interface resistance between highly doped regrowth N++ and 2DEG layer. These meticulously designed fabrication steps enabled us to achieve the high DC current 0.5 A/mm at 5V drain bias with 6.1 $\mathrm{\Omega}$.mm on resistance (R\textsubscript{ON}) at V_GS=3V, peak transconductance (g_m) of 110 mS/mm at room temperature (V_DS=15V) and around 0.8 A/mm (V_DS=5V) peak I_ON} at low temperature (100K). Current gain cut-off frequency (f_T) of 32 GHz and peak power gain cut-off frequency (f_MAX) of 65 GHz were extracted from RF measurements. f_T.L_G product was estimated to be 6.1 GHz-$\mu$m for 191 nm L_G and 32 GHz f_T, which is one of the highest reported among Ga2O3 devices. With thicker Al2O3, device shows no current collapse demonstrating first time successful traps passivation with Al2O3 for Ga2O3 devices.</description>

      <title>Electronic origin of stability of 2D 1H-phase Janus transition metal dichalcogenides and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (JTMDs) monolayers have emerged as a new paradigm to broaden the family of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Despite numerous theoretical predictions of JTMDs, their experimental realization remains scarce, most probably due to intrinsic structural fragility. We identify a dependence of the structural stability of 1H-phase JTMDs on the transition metal group, with Group-VIB-based monolayers exhibiting robust stability, as evidenced by the successful synthesized MoSSe and WSSe. The group-dependent stability arises from the competition between metal-ligand ionic bonding and ligand-ligand covalent bonding, as well as the high-energy d-electron orbital splitting. We propose an electron configuration that describes the interactions of electrons near the Fermi level to correlate the stability, and introduce an electron compensation strategy to stabilize certain unstable JTMDs systems. Guided by the electronic origin of stability, we predict a family of stable 2D Janus transition metal halides with intrinsic ferromagnetic valley properties. This work bridges the gap between electronic structure and stability predictions, and extends the design rules for synthesizing 2D Janus materials.</description>

      <title>Nudged elastic band calculations of stacking and dislocation pathways in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond, the hardest natural crystal, has attracted significant attention for its plasticity, which is reported to be determined by its stacking faults. Studies mainly focused on one-dimensional linear pathways in stacking transitions, neglecting its transverse freedom on the main slip plane. However, in an actual stacking procedure, stacking faults can follow curve line along the slip plane rather than constrained to straight lines. In this study, using ab initio calculations, we mapped the {\gamma}-surface, defined as the landscape of generalized stacking fault energies, along the weakest direction of the {111} orientation in diamond. We then applied the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method to determine the minimum energy paths, finding significantly reduced stacking energy barriers compared to previous reports (for the glide-set, our energy barrier is only one-third of that for the traditional direct path). Our calculations reveal that the glide-set can round its high-energy peak, with a lower energy barrier within the entire stacking plane than the shuffle-set. By employing the NEB method, we have constructed the minimum energy path (MEP) for both the stacking and dislocation procedures. Our results provide new insights into the plasticity and stacking faults of diamond, advancing the understanding of superhard carbon material transition, especially the diamond under shear stress.</description>

      <title>AI-driven materials design: a mini-review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials design is an important component of modern science and technology, yet traditional approaches rely heavily on trial-and-error and can be inefficient. Computational techniques, enhanced by modern artificial intelligence (AI), have greatly accelerated the design of new materials. Among these approaches, inverse design has shown great promise in designing materials that meet specific property requirements. In this mini-review, we summarize key computational advancements for materials design over the past few decades. We follow the evolution of relevant materials design techniques, from high-throughput forward machine learning (ML) methods and evolutionary algorithms, to advanced AI strategies like reinforcement learning (RL) and deep generative models. We highlight the paradigm shift from conventional screening approaches to inverse generation driven by deep generative models. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future perspectives of materials inverse design. This review may serve as a brief guide to the approaches, progress, and outlook of designing future functional materials with technological relevance.</description>

      <title>Exclusive Generation of Single-Atom Sulfur for Ultrahigh Quality Monolayer MoS$_2$ Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparation of high-quality two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is the precondition for realizing their applications. However, the synthesized 2D TMDCs (e.g., MoS$_2$) crystals suffer from low quality due to the massive defects formed during the growth. Here, we report the single-atom sulfur (S1) as a highly reactive sulfur species to grow ultrahigh-quality monolayer MoS$_2$. Derived from battery waste, the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is found to be exclusive and efficient in releasing S1. The monolayer MoS$_2$ prepared by SPAN exhibits an ultralow defect density of $~7\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and the narrowest photoluminescence (PL) emission peak with full-width at half-maximum of ~47.11 meV at room temperature. Moreover, the statistical resonance Raman and low-temperature PL results further verify the significantly lower defect density and higher optical quality of SPAN-grown MoS$_2$ than the conventional S-powder-grown samples. This work provides an effective approach for preparing ultrahigh-quality 2D single crystals, facilitating their industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Imprinting of skyrmions and bimerons in an antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic states in condensed matter physics, particularly antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions (Sks) and bimerons (Bms), offer promising prospects for terahertz dynamics and sustained current-induced motion, thanks to their compensating multiple sub-lattice structure. However, nucleating AFM Sks and Bms is challenging due to the lack of net magnetization. Previous attempts to imprint pre-defined Sks and Bms in a ferromagnet (FM) and transfer them to an AFM using interfacial exchange bias in FM/AFM heterostructures have been hindered by complex multilayers with discontinuities, polycrystallinity, or multipartite chiral AFMs. Employing atomistic spin simulations, we demonstrate the viability of texture imprinting for nucleating Sks and Bms in AFMs, using a prototypical bipartite AFM layer in a multilayer structure free from discontinuities. Such imprinting is a crucial step towards understanding the static and dynamic properties of natural antiferromagnetic textures and their unique properties.</description>

      <title>Optical Properties of Aluminium-Doped Zinc Oxide Thin Films Synthesized via AACVD Using Nitrogen as a Carrier Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study uses AACVD technology with nitrogen carrier gas to make AZO thin films through which it determines structural, optical, and morphological changes from 0 to 20 percent aluminum doping. The depositions took place at 400 degrees Celsius on soda-lime glass before the samples received an annealing process at 450 degrees Celsius inside a nitrogen chamber. The X-ray diffraction analysis identified superior crystalline structure in films processed with nitrogen gas through their strong signals at the 220, 311 and 222 peaks. The increasing levels of aluminum doping decreased the crystallite dimensions and elevated grain boundary concentrations because of intensified crystal tension and defective structural formation. The profilometry assessment determined film thickness increased mildly from 102 nanometers in undoped ZnO to 115 nanometers in 20 percent aluminum-doped ZnO. The presence of nitrogen annealing in the films led to increased absorbance while the strongest absorbance peaks occurred when the material contained 5 percent dopants. The bandgap energy expanded through the change from undoped ZnO with 3.21 electron volts to 3.33 electron volts at 20 percent aluminum doping which matched Burstein-Moss effect results. The optoelectronic devices gain enhanced optical characteristics from the doping levels exceeding 15 percent.</description>

      <title>Operando imaging of crystal structure and orientation in all components of all-solid-state-batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of interactions between cathode, electrolyte, anode, and packaging during battery operation is crucial for advancing performances but remains overlooked due to the lack of characterisation technics capable of measuring these components simultaneously. We perform a holistic investigation of a compact all-solid-state-battery using operando synchrotron X-ray micro-diffraction imaging. We image in real time and simultaneously the lattice parameter and crystal orientation of the dense LiCoO2 cathode, the Ti current collector and the electrodeposited Li metal anode. We reveal that reaction mechanism of LiCoO2 depends on the crystal orientation, and that, in dense electrodes as opposed to porous ones, the delithiation is limited by the formation of a Li-rich insulating interface. Li metal crystal orientation is found to be influenced initially by the Ti texture and to change within minutes during plating and stripping. These results demonstrate the power of X-ray imaging to link reaction mechanism and grain orientation during non-equilibrium processes.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic spin splitting and symmetry-enforced partial spin degeneracy in hexagonal MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides hosting several intriguing physical properties, the recently discovered time-reversal-asymmetric antiferromagnets, known as altermagnets, hold immense promise for technologies based on spintronics. Understanding the symmetry conditions leading to the spin-splitting becomes the key to further progress in the field. Hexagonal MnTe emerges as an even-parity magnet within the altermagnet family. In this work, using ab initio density functional theory (DFT) within a combination of an appropriate exchange-correlation functional and the relevant corrections, we uncover the spin-splitting features of MnTe. Our calculations reveal the spin degeneracy to be preserved in the $k_z = 0$ and $k_y = 0$ planes, while spin-splitting is observed everywhere else in the Brillouin zone, except the nodal lines identified here. To explain these findings, we provide a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on magnetic space group theory and introduce an insightful symmetry-adapted model Hamiltonian that qualitatively describes the spin-splitting behavior in different parts of the Brillouin zone. Our calculations considering spin-orbit interaction reveal no weak ferromagnetism in MnTe. Nevertheless, we discuss plausible explanations for weak ferromagnetism and anomalous Hall effect reported from experiments. Our comprehensive analysis of the magnetic space group symmetry and the DFT results leads to a thorough understanding of altermagnetism in MnTe, paving the way for possible future technology.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure property relationship in glassy Ti-Zr-Nb-(Cu,Ni,Co)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we revisit vast amount of existing data on physical properties of Ti-Zr-Nb-(Cu,Ni,Co) glassy alloys over a broad range of concentrations (from the high entropy range to that of conventional Cu-, Ni- or Co-rich alloys). By using our new approach based on total content of late transition metal(s), we derive a number of physical parameters of a hypothetical amorphous TiZrNb alloy: lattice parameter $a = (3.42 \pm 0.02)$\r{A}, Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma = 6.2\,$mJ/mol$\,$K$^2$, density of states at $N(E_F) = 2.6\,(\text{at eV})^{-1}$, magnetic susceptibility $(2.00 \pm 0.05)\,$mJ/T$^2\,$mol, superconducting transition temperature $T_c = (8 \pm 1)\,$K, upper critical field $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0) = (20 \pm 5)\,$T, and coherence length $\xi(0) = (40 \pm 3)\,$\r{A}. We show that our extrapolated results for amorphous TiZrNb alloy would be similar to that of crystalline TiZrNb, except for superconducting properties (most notably the upper critical field $H_{c2}(0)$), which might be attributed to the strong topological disorder of the amorphous phase. Also, we offer an explanation of the discrepancy between the variations of $T_c$ with the average number of valency electrons in neighboring alloys of 4d transition metals and some high entropy alloys. Overall, we find that our novel method of systematic analysis of results is rather general, as it can provide reliable estimates of the properties of any alloy which has not been prepared as yet.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport of amorphous hafnia across the glass transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transport in glasses across a wide range of temperature is vital for applications in gate dielectrics and heat insulator. However, it remains poorly understood due to the challenges of modeling vibrational anharmonicity below glass transition temperature and capturing configurational dynamics across the transition. Interestingly, recent calculations predicted that amorphous hafnia (a-HfO$_2$) exhibits an unusual drop in thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) with temperature, contrasting with the typical rise or saturation observed in glasses upon heating. Using molecular dynamics simulations with a machine-learning-based neuroevolution potential, we compute the vibrational properties and $\kappa$ of a-HfO$_2$ from 50~K to 2000~K. At low temperatures, we employ the Wigner transport equation to incorporate both anharmonicity and Bose-Einstein statistics of atomic vibration in the calculation of $\kappa$. At above 1200~K, atomic diffusion breaks down the Lorentzian-shaped quasiparticle picture and makes the lattice-dynamics treatment invalid. We thus use molecular dynamics with the Green-Kubo method to capture convective heat transport in a-HfO$_2$ near the glass transition at around 1500~K. Additionally, by extending the Wigner transport equation to supercooled liquid states, we find the crucial role of low-frequency modes in facilitating heat convection. The computed $\kappa$ of a-HfO$_2$, based on both Green-Kubo and Wigner transport theories, reveals a continuous increase with temperature up to 2000~K.</description>

Abstract: Niobium (Nb) and its alloys are extensively used in various technological applications owing to their favorable mechanical, thermal and irradiation properties. Accurately modeling Nb under irradiation is essential for predicting microstructural changes, defect evolution, and overall material performance. Traditional interatomic potentials for Nb fail to predict the correct self-interstitial atom (SIA) configuration, a critical factor in radiation damage simulations. We develop a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using the Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP) framework, trained on ab-initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which accurately captures the relative stability of different SIA dumbbell configurations. The resulting potential reproduces DFT-level accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency for large-scale Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Through a series of validation tests involving elastic, thermal, and defect properties -- including collision cascade simulations -- we show that our SNAP potential resolves persistent limitations in existing Embedded Atom Method (EAM) and Finnis--Sinclair (FS) potentials and is effective for MD simulations of collision cascades. Notably, it accurately captures the ground-state SIA configuration of Nb in the primary damage of a collision cascade, offering a robust tool for predictive irradiation studies.</description>

      <title>Ultra-giant Tunneling Magnetoresistance with Two-dimensional Altermagnetic MBene electrode: from material design to device modeling</title>

Abstract: Altermagnetism is an emerging series of unconventional magnetic materials characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split bands in the momentum space with zero net magnetization. Metallic altermagnets offer unique advantages for exploring applications in spintronics as conductive metals allows for serving as electrode in magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) and/or manipulation of spincurrent through external field. Through density functional theory calculations, the 2D altermagnet Cr4B3N was predicted to be stable, resulting from a N atom substitution in the FeSe-like CrB bilayer. Both intra- and inter-layered magnetic exchanges between Cr atoms are in antiferromagnetic with the first three neighbours. Leveraging the anisotropic spin-splittings with momentum dependency revealed in band structure, we designed three edge dependent Cr4B3N/square/Cr4B3N in-plane MTJs with the 7 \AA vaccume the barrie. We found that the Cr-B vertical edge-assembled electrodes based MTJs exhibited giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios of 91001% , by aligning the conduction channels of the electrodes in parallel and anti-parallel states in the momentum space. Our work deepens and generalizes understanding toward altermagnetic 2D metallic electrode with a newly established metal boride (MBene), and broadens applications of the nanoscale spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confining electromagnetic fields inside an optical cavity can enhance the light-matter coupling between quantum materials embedded inside the cavity and the confined photon fields. When the interaction between the matter and the photon fields is strong enough, even the quantum vacuum field fluctuations of the photons confined in the cavity can alter the properties of the cavity-embedded solid-state materials at equilibrium and room temperature. This approach to engineering materials with light avoids fundamental issues of laser-induced transient matter states. To clearly differentiate this field from phenomena in driven systems, we call this emerging field cavity materials engineering. In this review, we first present theoretical frameworks, especially, ab initio methods, for describing light-matter interactions in solid-state materials embedded inside a realistic optical cavity. Next, we overview a few experimental breakthroughs in this domain, detailing how the ground state properties of materials can be altered within such confined photonic environments. Moreover, we discuss state-of-the-art theoretical proposals for tailoring material properties within cavities. Finally, we outline the key challenges and promising avenues for future research in this exciting field.</description>

      <title>Separation between long- and short-range part of the Coulomb interaction in low dimensional systems: implications for the macroscopic screening length and the collective charge excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective charge excitations directly probed in electron energy loss and inelastic X rays scattering spectroscopies play a key role in different fields of condensed matter physics. Being induced by the long-range part of the Coulomb interaction between particles, in standard bulk systems they appear as well-defined features in the spectra associated to the zero crossing of the real part of the macroscopic dielectric function. However, this simple criterion cannot be used to identify collective excitations in low dimensional systems where the macroscopic dielectric function is not a well defined concept. In this work, we discuss how this problem can be traced back to the definition of the long-range Coulomb interaction and we show how the appropriate separation between long- and short-range Coulomb interaction allows one to correctly express the low dimensional macroscopic dielectric function in terms of microscopic quantities accessible in first-principles calculations. This allows disentangling collective charge excitations in low dimensional materials in analogy with what one does in standard bulk systems. In addition, we show how important macroscopic quantities, such as the screening length scale, can be extracted from full first principle calculations. As an illustrative example we perform a study of the screening effects and the collective excitations in prototypical 2D materials including metals (NbSe2) as well as semiconductors (BN and MoS2).</description>

      <title>Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Au/FeCo/Au ultrathin films: Combined experimental and first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions with a magnetic layer with perpendicular anisotropy are currently used in computer memories that do not require voltage sustaining. An example of layers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are ultrathin FeCo films on Au substrate. Here, we present an experimental and computational study of Fe$_{0.75}$Co$_{0.25}$ layers with a thickness up to two nanometers. The investigated FeCo layers are surrounded on both sides by Au layers. In experiment, we found perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in FeCo polycrystalline films with a thickness below 0.74 nm (five atomic monolayers). We also measured a strong surface contribution to effective magnetic anisotropy. From the density functional theory we determined structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the FeCo films. The calculations showed an irregular dependence of magnetic anisotropy on FeCo layer thickness. We observed perpendicular anisotropy for one- and three-atom FeCo monolayers and in-plane anisotropy for two- and four-atom monolayers. However, the determination of running averages of magnetic anisotropy (of three successive thicknesses of atomic monolayers) leads to a close linear thickness dependence of magnetic anisotropy, similar to the experimental result. The reason why the properties of the several-atom-thick FeCo layers differ so significantly from those of the bulk parent material is the disappearance of the central region of the layer whose properties approximate those of the bulk, and instead the existence of near-interface regions with properties altered by the presence of discontinuities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an automatized approach towards maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) applicable to both occupied and unoccupied states. We overcome limitations of the standard optimized projection function (OPF) method and its approximations by providing an exact expression for the gradient of the Wannier spread functional with respect to a single semi-unitary OPF matrix. Moreover, we demonstrate that the localization of the resulting Wannier functions (WFs) can be further improved by including projections on reasonably localized WFs, so-called self-projections.</description>

      <title>Easy-cone state mediating the spin reorientation in topological kagome magnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated temperature-driven spin reorientation (SR) in the itinerant kagome magnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ using high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, magnetometry, and magnetic force microscopy (MFM), further supported by phenomenological analysis. Our study reveals a crossover from the state with easy-plane anisotropy to the high-temperature state with uniaxial easy-axis anisotropy taking place between $\sim40-130$~ K through an intermediate easy-cone (or tilted spin) state. This state, induced by the interplay between the anisotropy constants $K_1$ and $K_2$, is clearly manifested in the thermal evolution of the magnetic structure factor, which reveals a gradual change of the SR angle $\mathbf{\theta}$ between $40-130$~K. We also found that the SR is accompanied by a magnetoelastic effect. Zero-field MFM images across the SR range show a transformation in surface magnetic patterns from a dendritic structure at 120~K, to domain wall dominated MFM contrast at 40~K.</description>

      <title>Mutual control of critical temperature, RRR, stress, and surface quality for sputtered Nb films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting single quantum logic integrated circuits traditionally exploit magnetron sputtered niobium thin films on silicon oxide substrates. The sputtering depends on multiple process parameters, which dramatically affect mechanical, electrical, and cryogenic properties of Nb thin films. In this work, we focus on the comprehensive relationship study between 200-nm Nb film characteristics and their intrinsic stress. It is shown that there is a critical value of the working pressure pcritical at the fixed sputtering power above which stress in the film relaxes whereas the film properties degrade significantly. Below pcritical one can control intrinsic stress in the wide range from -400 MPa to +600 MPa maintaining perfect film surface with a 0.8 nm roughness (Rq), electrical resistivity less than 20 uOhm*cm, critical superconducting transition temperature above 8.9 K and residual resistance ratio over 6.4. We suggest a modified kinetic model to predict Nb films stress with the linear dependence of high-energy parameters on the working pressure replaced with an exponential one, which allowed reduction of the approximation error from 20 to 8%.</description>

      <title>First experiments with ultrashort, circularly polarized soft X-ray pulses at FLASH2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved absorption spectroscopy as well as magnetic circular dichroism with circularly polarized soft X-rays (XAS and XMCD) are powerful tools to probe electronic and magnetic dynamics in magnetic materials element- and site-selectively. Employing these methods, groundbreaking results have been obtained for instance for magnetic alloys, which helped to fundamentally advance the field of ultrafast magnetization dynamics. At the free electron laser facility FLASH key capabilities for ultrafast XAS and XMCD experiments have recently improved: In an upgrade, an APPLE-III helical afterburner undulator was installed at FLASH2 in September 2023. This installation allows for the generation of circularly polarized soft X-ray pulses with a duration of a few tens of femtoseconds covering the L3,2-edges of the important 3d transition metal elements with pulse energies of several uJ. Here, we present first experimental results with such ultrashort X-ray pulses from the FL23 beamline employing XMCD at the L-edges of the 3d metals, Co, Fe and Ni. We obtain significant dichroic difference signals indicating a degree of circular polarization close to 100%. With the pulse-length preserving monochromator at beamline FL23 and an improved pump laser setup, FLASH can offer important and efficient experimental instrumentation for studies on ultrafast spin dynamics in 3d transition metals, multilayers, and alloys.</description>

      <title>Photoemission electron microscopy of exciton-polaritons in thin WSe$_2$ waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in the strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential exchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light harvesting. The coupling causes an energy anti-crossing in the photon dispersion centered around the exciton resonance, i.e., a Rabi splitting between a lower and upper energetic branch. The size of this splitting correlates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic modes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic waveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron microscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric and magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the energy splitting. Ultimately, our findings precipitate the investigation of the propagation of exciton-polaritons in the time-domain via time-resolved photoemission.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation and virtual processes in interacting phonon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon-phonon interactions are fundamental to understanding a wide range of material properties, including thermal transport and vibrational spectra. In conventional perturbative approaches, energy conservation during each microscopic phonon interaction is enforced using delta functions. We demonstrate that these delta functions stem from an incomplete treatment, that violates the fluctuation-dissipation theorem governing systems at equilibrium. By replacing delta functions with convolutions and introducing a self-consistency condition for the phonon spectral function, we provide a more accurate and physically consistent framework. For systems where phonon dynamics can be approximated as Markovian, we simplify this approach, reducing the dissipative component to a single parameter tied to phonon lifetimes. Applying this method to boron arsenide, we find that self-consistent linewidths better capture the phonon scattering processes, significantly improving agreement with experimental thermal conductivity values. These results also challenge the conventional view of four-phonon processes as dominant in BAs, demonstrating the adequacy of a three-phonon description, provided it is self-consistent. With this method we address critical limitations of perturbative approaches, offering new insights into dissipation and phonon-mediated processes, and enabling more accurate modeling of anharmonic materials.</description>

Abstract: Epitaxial strain in thin films can yield surprising magnetic and electronic properties not accessible in bulk. One materials system destined to be explored in this direction are orthoferrites with two intertwined spin systems where strain is predicted to have a significant impact on magnetic and polar properties by modifying the strength of the rare earth-Fe interaction. Here we report the impact of epitaxial strain is reported on the linear magneto-electric DyFeO3, a canted bulk antiferromagnet with a high Neel temperature (645 K) exhibiting a Dy-induced spin reorientation transition at approx. 50 K and antiferromagnetic ordering of the Dy spins at 4 K. An increase in the spin transition of &gt; 20 K is found and a strictly linear, abnormal temperature magnetic response under an applied magnetic field between 100 and 400 K for [010]-oriented DyFeO3 thin films with an in-plane compressive strain between 2% and 3.5%. At room temperature and above, we found that application of approx. 0.06 T causes a spin-flop of the Dy spins coupled to the antiferromagnetic Fe spin lattice, whereby the Dy spins change from an antiferromagnetic alignment to ferromagnetic. The spin-flop field gives a lower energy bound on the Dy-Fe exchange interaction of approx. 15 microeV.</description>

      <title>Unconventional anomalous Hall effect in hexagonal polar magnet Y_3Co_8Sn_4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a rare realization of unconventional anomalous Hall effect (UAHE) both below and above the magnetic transition temperature (T_C) in a hexagonal noncentrosymmetric magnet Y_3Co_8Sn_4, using a combined experimental and ab-initio calculations. Occurrence of such UAHE is mainly attributed to the reciprocal (KS) topology (i.e. the presence of topological Weyl points at/near the Fermi level), along with some contribution from the topological magnetic texture, as inferred from the measured field-dependent ac susceptibility. The effect of UAHE on the measured transport behavior however evolves differently with temperature above and below T_C, suggesting different physical mechanism responsible in the two phases. A unique planar ferrimagnetic ordering is found to be the most stable state with ab-plane as the easy plane below TC, as observed experimentally. The simulated net magnetization and the moment per Co atom agrees fairly well with the measured values. A reasonably large AHC is also observed in both the phases (above and below and T_C) of the present compound, which is again not so ubiquitous. Our results underscore the family of R_3Co_8Sn_4 (R= rare earth) polar magnets as a compelling backdrop for exploring the synergy of topological magnetism and non-trivial electronic bands, pivotal for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>E2Former: A Linear-time Efficient and Equivariant Transformer for Scalable Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19216v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</description>

      <title>Carbon Per Transistor (CPT): The Golden Formula for Green Computing Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As computing power advances, the environmental cost of semiconductor manufacturing and operation has become a critical concern. However, current sustainability metrics fail to quantify carbon emissions at the transistor level, the fundamental building block of modern processors. This paper introduces a Carbon Per Transistor (CPT) formula -- a novel approach and green implementation metric to measuring the CO$_2$ footprint of semiconductor chips from fabrication to end-of-life. By integrating emissions from silicon crystal growth, wafer production, chip manufacturing, and operational power dissipation, the CPT formula provides a scientifically rigorous benchmark for evaluating the sustainability of computing hardware. Using real-world data from Intel Core i9-13900K, AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, and Apple M1/M2/M3 processors, we reveal a startling insight-manufacturing emissions dominate, contributing 60-125 kg CO$_2$ per CPU, far exceeding operational emissions over a typical device lifespan. Notably, Apple's high-transistor-count M-series chips, despite their energy efficiency, exhibit a significantly larger carbon footprint than traditional processors due to extensive fabrication impact. This research establishes a critical reference point for green computing initiatives, enabling industry leaders and researchers to make data-driven decisions in reducing semiconductor-related emissions and get correct estimates for the green factor of the information technology process. The proposed formula paves the way for carbon-aware chip design, regulatory standards, and future innovations in sustainable computing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the hyperpolarizability of crystals with quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of non-linear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced non-linear optical properties.</description>

      <title>Pore network models for the evaporation of complex fluids in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drying of fluids undergoing sol-gel transition in porous media, a process crucial for the consolidation of damaged porous structures in cultural heritage, often leads to skin formation at the surface. This phenomenon significantly hinders evaporation, yet its precise impact on drying kinetics remains poorly understood. To uncover the governing mechanisms, we develop a novel pore network model that closely replicates quasi-2D experimental porous media, incorporating spatial gradients in pore size distribution, with smaller pores near the evaporation side. We demonstrate that this pore distribution dictates the air invasion path and extends the constant-rate period of drying in Newtonian liquids, reproducing the experimental drying curves for water. We further extend our model to capture the interplay of capillary-driven liquid flows, space-dependent viscosity increases, and localized skin formation. To incorporate skin formation, we implement a viscosity-dependent evaporation pressure rule derived from experimental data on evaporation-induced sol-gel transition within a capillary tube. We identify a simple relationship: vapor pressure decreases once the meniscus fluid viscosity exceeds a critical threshold. By accounting for localized skin formation through reduced evaporation pressure at high-viscosity throats, our model successfully captures the slowdown of drying kinetics, achieving remarkable agreement with experimental drying curve.</description>

      <title>ReGNet: Reciprocal Space-Aware Long-Range Modeling and Multi-Property Prediction for Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting properties of crystals from their structures is a fundamental yet challenging task in materials science. Unlike molecules, crystal structures exhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of capturing both local and global information effectively. However, most current works fall short of capturing long-range interactions within periodic structures. To address this limitation, we leverage reciprocal space to efficiently encode long-range interactions with learnable filters within Fourier transforms. We introduce Reciprocal Geometry Network (ReGNet), a novel architecture that integrates geometric GNNs and reciprocal blocks to model short-range and long-range interactions, respectively. Additionally, we introduce ReGNet-MT, a multi-task extension that employs mixture of experts (MoE) for multi-property prediction. Experimental results on the JARVIS and Materials Project benchmarks demonstrate that ReGNet achieves significant performance improvements. Moreover, ReGNet-MT attains state-of-the-art results on two bandgap properties due to positive transfer, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of our model as a scalable and accurate solution for crystal property prediction. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>Strong Long-Wave Infrared Optical Response in a Topological Semiconductor with a Mexican Hat Band Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light sources and photodetectors operating in the far- to mid-infrared (FIR/MIR) band ($8$-$12~\rm \mu m$, $0.1$-$0.15~\rm eV$) remain relatively poorly developed compared to their counterparts operating in the visible and near-infrared ranges, despite extensive application potential for thermal imaging, standoff sensing, and other technologies. This is attributable in part to the lack of narrow-gap materials ($&lt;0.1~\rm eV$) with high optical gain and absorption. In this work, a narrow-gap semiconductor, $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$, is demonstrated to exhibit an optical response $&gt;10\times$ larger than that of $\rm Hg_{x}Cd_{1-x}Te$ (MCT), the dominant material for FIR/MIR photodetectors. A previous theoretical investigation indicated that chalcogen $p$ and metal $d$ band inversion in this material creates a Mexican hat band structure (MHBS), which results in a dramatic increase in the joint density of states at the optical transition edge compared to typical semiconductors. This prediction is experimentally validated here using single-crystal specimens of $\rm Pb_{0.7}Sn_{0.3}Se$ measured using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry over a wavelength range of $1.7$-$20~\rm \mu m$ ($0.73$-$0.062~\rm eV$). These measurements demonstrate a large enhancement in extinction coefficient and refractive index characteristic of a MHBS in the vicinity of the absorption edge, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The realization of topological semiconductors with a MHBS is expected to lead to high-efficiency detectors operating in the FIR/MID range.</description>

      <title>Revealing the orbital origins of exotic electronic states with Ti substitution in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiband kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 exhibits complex orbital textures on the Fermi surface, making the orbital origins of its cascade of correlated electronic states and superconductivity a major scientific puzzle. Chemical doping of the kagome plane can simultaneously tune the exotic states and the Fermi-surface orbital texture, and thus offers a unique opportunity to correlate the given states with specific orbitals. In this Letter, by substituting V atoms with Ti in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, we reveal the orbital origin of a cascade of its correlated electronic states through the orbital-resolved quasiparticle interference (QPI). We analyze the QPI changes associated with different orbitals, aided by first-principles calculations. We have observed that the in-plane and out-of-plane vanadium 3d orbitals cooperate to form unidirectional coherent states in pristine CsV3Sb5, whereas the out-of-plane component disappears with doping-induced suppression of charge density wave and global electronic nematicity. In addition, the Sb pz orbital plays an important role in both the pseudo-gap and superconducting states in CsV3Sb5. Our findings offer new insights into multiorbital physics in quantum materials which are generally manifested with intriguing correlations between atomic orbitals and symmetry-encoded correlated electronic states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Pervasive symmetry-lowering nanoscale structural fluctuations in the cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cuprate superconductors are among the most widely studied quantum materials, yet there remain fundamental open questions regarding their electronic properties and the role of the structural degrees of freedom. Recent neutron and x-ray scattering measurements uncovered exponential scaling with temperature of the strength of orthorhombic fluctuations in the tetragonal phase of $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ and $Tl_2Ba_2CuO_{6+y}$, unusual behavior that closely resembles prior results for the emergence of superconducting fluctuations, and that points to a common origin rooted in inherent correlated structural inhomogeneity. Here we extend the measurements of $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ to higher temperatures in the parent compound (x=0) and to optimal doping (x=0.155), and we furthermore investigate the effects of in-situ in-plane uniaxial stress. Our neutron scattering result for undoped $La_2CuO_4$ complement prior x-ray data and reveal that the structural fluctuations persist to the maximum experimental temperature of nearly 1000K, i.e., to a significant fraction of the melting point. At this temperature, the spatial correlation length extracted from the momentum-space data is still about three lattice constants. The neutron scattering experiment enables quasistatic discrimination and reveals that the response is increasingly dynamic at higher temperatures. We also find that uniaxial stress up to 500 MPa along the tetragonal [110] direction, which corresponds to a strain of about 0.2%, does not significantly alter this robust behavior. Overall, these results support the notion that subtle, underlying inhomogeneity underpins the cuprate phase diagram. Finally, we uncover (for x=0.2) low-energy structural fluctuations at a nominally forbidden reflection. While the origin of these fluctuations is not clear, they might be related to the presence of extended defects such as dislocations or stacking faults.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double perovskites containing heavy transition metal ions are an important family of compounds for the study of the interplay between electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling. Here, by combining magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron scattering measurements, we investigate the dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in two prototype rhenium-based double perovskite compounds, Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$ScReO$_6$. A type-I dipolar antiferromagnetic ground state with a propagation vector $\mathbf{q} = (0, 0, 1)$ is observed in both compounds. At temperatures above the magnetic transitions, a quadrupolar ordered phase is identified. Weak spin excitations, which are gapped at low temperatures and softened in the correlated paramagnetic phase, are explained using a minimal model that considers both the dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. At larger wavevectors, we observe dominant phonon excitations that are well described by density functional calculations.</description>

      <title>Robust spin-orbit coupling in semi-metallic SrIrO3 under hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semi-metallic behavior of the perovskite iridate SrIrO3 shifts the end-member of the strongly spin-orbit (SO) coupled Ruddlesden-Popper series Srn+1IrnO3n+1 away from the Mott insulating regime and the half-filled pseudospin Jeff=1/2 ground state well-established in the layered iridates (n = 1 and 2). To investigate the robustness of the SO coupled ground state of SrIrO3, X-ray absorption spectroscopy was carried out at the Ir L2,3 edges under hydrostatic pressure up to 50 GPa at room temperature. The effective SO coupling was deduced from the branching ratio of the Ir L2 and L3 white lines. With increasing pressure, the branching ratio decreases, and the Ir L2,3 peak positions shift to higher energies. The number of 5d holes remains constant indicating that the spectral weight redistribution and peak shifts arise from orbital mixing between t2g and eg related states. The expectation value of the angular part of the SO operator &lt;LS&gt; decreases by about 15% at 50 GPa. This reduction, which is very similar to that observed in the layered iridates, is well explained by an increase of the octahedral crystal field due to the shortening of the Ir-O bond-length under compression. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the orbital mixing and &lt;LS&gt; decrease as the crystal field increases. However, the effective SO coupling remains robust against pressure and does not indicate a covalency-driven breakdown within the investigated pressure range.</description>

      <title>Spin-valley polarization control in WSe$_2$ monolayers using photochemical doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the influence of a photochemical doping method on the spin-valley polarization degree ($P_{c}$) of excitons in WSe$_2$ monolayers. By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of new crystalline materials is essential to scientific and technological progress. However, traditional trial-and-error approaches are inefficient due to the vast search space. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled generative models to predict new stable materials by incorporating structural symmetries and to condition the generation on desired properties. In this work, we introduce SymmBFN, a novel symmetry-aware Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) for crystalline material generation that accurately reproduces the distribution of space groups found in experimentally observed crystals. SymmBFN substantially improves efficiency, generating stable structures at least 50 times faster than the next-best method. Furthermore, we demonstrate its capability for property-conditioned generation, enabling the design of materials with tailored properties. Our findings establish BFNs as an effective tool for accelerating the discovery of crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Spin photonic topological metasurface based on kagome lattice and leaky-wave application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of topological metasurfaces offers unique advantages, particularly in robustness against backscattering in low-profile structures. The lattice configuration of these structures significantly influences the ability to achieve sharp turns in the propagation path. One of the most studied lattices in condensed matter physics is the kagome lattice, characterized by its hexagonal Brillouin zone, which displays a Dirac cone in its dispersion diagram. Previous research on kagome lattices in photonic topological insulators has primarily focused on valley types of insulators. This article introduces a spin topological metasurface based on the kagome lattice and its unit cell, enabling a broad range of sharp turns and propagation paths. The unit cell is compared to its hexagonal and 60-degree rhombic counterparts, and a parametric study of its dimensions is conducted. As a result of this research, a new X-band leaky-wave antenna designed in the kagome lattice with an armchair arrangement interface has been developed. This antenna provides two forward and two backward beams, each pair achieving an approximately 50-degree scan within the 8.8 to 11.1 GHz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Reversible Switching of the Environment-Protected Quantum Spin Hall Insulator Bismuthene at the Graphene/SiC Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Spin Hall Insulators (QSHI) have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally because they exhibit robust helical edge states driven by spin-orbit coupling and offer the potential for applications in spintronics through dissipationless spin transport. However, to realize devices, it is indispensable to gain control over the interaction of the active layer with the substrate, and to protect it from environmental influences. Here we show that a single layer of elemental Bi, formed by intercalation of an epitaxial graphene buffer layer on SiC(0001), is a promising candidate for a QSHI. This layer can be reversibly switched between an electronically inactive precursor state and a ``bismuthene state'', the latter exhibiting the predicted band structure of a true two-dimensional bismuthene layer. Switching is accomplished by hydrogenation (dehydrogenation) of the sample, i.e., a partial passivation (activation) of dangling bonds of the SiC substrate, causing a lateral shift of Bi atoms involving a change of the adsorption site. In the bismuthene state, the Bi honeycomb layer is a prospective QSHI, inherently protected by the graphene sheet above and the H-passivated substrate below. Thus, our results represent an important step towards protected QSHI systems beyond graphene.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using a theoretical approach based on the equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)], which was recently justified based on extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the hard-sphere phase diagram [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the underlying equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions of $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio of the standard deviation of the disk diameter distribution to its mean $s$. For the power-law size distribution evaluated at $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Electric-field Switching of Interlayer Magnetic Order in a van der Waals Heterobilayer via Spin-potential Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric-field switching of magnetic order is of significant physical interest and holds great potential for spintronic applications. However, it has rarely been reported in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets due to the inherently weak interaction between spin order and electric fields. Here we propose a general spin-potential mechanism that significantly enhances the magnetoelectric coupling. As a result, the relative stability of different interlayer magnetic orders in an asymmetric van der Waals heterobilayer can be reversed by external electric fields via spin-potential coupling. Based on this mechanism, we designed a series of 2D vdW all-magnetic heterobilayers, such as CrI3/MnSe2, in which a transition from interlayer ferromagnetic (iFM) to antiferromagnetic (iAFM) order is realized by a feasible electric field around 0.1 V/{\AA}. Our findings not only reveal a novel magnetoelectric coupling mechanism, but also present a practical strategy for achieving pure electric-field-driven magnetic order switching</description>

      <title>Positive temperature-dependent thermal conductivity induced by wavelike phonons in complex Ag-based argyrodites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phonon transport mechanisms and the anomalous temperature-dependent lattice thermal conductivities (kL) in Ag-based argyrodites have not been fully understood. Herein, we systematically study the phonon thermal transport of five Ag-based crystalline argyrodites Ag7PS6, Ag7AsS6, Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6 and Ag9GaS6 utilizing perturbation theory and the unified theory thermal transport model. Our results show that, as the complexity of the unit cell increases, the proportion of the population terms falls while the coherence contributions become more significant, leading to the relatively weak temperature-dependent kL of Ag7PS6 and Ag7AsS6, while the more complex crystalline argyrodites, Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6 and Ag9GaS6, exhibiting a glass-like behavior in their temperature dependence of kL. We attribute the positive temperature-dependent and ultralow kL of Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6 and Ag9GaS6 to the dominance of wavelike phonons and the strong phonon broadening. Furthermore, using laser flash measurements and the homogeneous non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations based on accurate machine learning neuroevolution potentials, we provide further evidence for the glass-like temperature-dependent kL of Ag8SnS6 and Ag8GeS6.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetic susceptibility of multifold fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are intensively studied in recent years. Besides the well known Weyl and Dirac semimetals, some materials possess nodes with linear crossing of multiple bands. Low energy excitations around these nodes are called multifold fermions and can be described by $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian with pseudospin greater than 1/2. In the present work we investigate the contribution of these states into orbital magnetic susceptibility $\chi$. We have found that, similarly to Weyl semimetals, the dependence of susceptibility on chemical potential $\mu$ shows an extremum when $\mu$ is close to the band crossing energy. In the case of half-integer pseudospin, this extremum is a minimum and the susceptibility is negative (diamagnetic). While in the case of integer pseudospin, the susceptibility is large and positive (paramagnetic) due to the contribution of dispersionless band, corresponding to zero pseudospin projection. This leads also to nonmonotonic temperature dependence of $\chi$. As an example, we considered the case of cobalt monosilicide, where the states near the $\Gamma$ point correspond to pseudospin 1 without spin-orbital interaction, and to a combination of Weyl node and pseudospin-3/2 states taking into account spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Segregation to grain boundaries in disordered systems: an application to a Ni-based multi-component alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segregation to defects, in particular to grain boundaries (GBs), is an unavoidable phenomenon leading to changed material behavior over time. With the increase of available computational power, unbiased quantum-mechanical predictions of segregation energies, which feed classical thermodynamics models of segregation (e.g., McLean isotherm), become available. In recent years, huge progress towards predictions closely resembling experimental observations was made by considering the statistical nature of the segregation process due to competing segregation sites at a single GB and/or many different types of co-existing GBs. In the present work, we further expand this field by explicitly showing how compositional disorder, present in real engineering alloys (e.g. steels or Ni-based superalloys), gives rise to a spectrum of segregation energies. With the example of a $\Sigma 5$ GB in a Ni-based model alloy (Ni-Co-Cr-Ti-Al), we show that the segregation energies of Fe, Mn, W, Nb, and Zr are significantly different from those predicted for pure elemental Ni. We further use the predicted segregation energy spectra in a statistical evaluation of GB enrichment, which allows for extracting segregation enthalpy and segregation entropy terms related to the chemical complexity in multi-component alloys.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectric Altermagnets: Antiferroelectricity Alters Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Observation of Moire potential in Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers by Electron Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moire superlattices (MSLs) are an emerging class of two-dimensional functional materials whose electronic states can be tuned by the twist angle between two van der Waals layers and/or the relative placement of the layers. The intriguing properties of MSLs are closely correlated to the moir\'e potential, which is the electrostatic potential induced by interlayer coupling. Intensive efforts have been made to understand the nature and distribution of the moire potential by using various experimental and theoretical techniques. However, the experimental observation of the moir\'e potential is still challenging because of the possible presence of the surface and/or interlayer contaminants. In this work, we develop a method to obtain hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanolayers (with or without twist) using a specially designed chemical exfoliation technique. The resulting hBN nanolayers are atomically clean and strain free, hence providing ideal MSLs for the investigation of their moir\'e potential. Aberration-corrected high resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements on the twisted hBN nanolayers allow us to observe moir\'e diffraction spots in Fourier space. Then, the moire potential is reconstructed by the inverse fast Fourier transform of the moire diffraction spots. It has been revealed that the local interlayer atomic overlap plays a decisive role in determining the periodicity and distribution of the moir\'e potential, as supported by density functional theory calculations. This work not only provides a general strategy to observe the moire potential in MSLs, but it also expands the application of electron microscopy to the further study of MSLs with atomic resolution.</description>

      <title>Xenon-metal pair formation in UO2 investigated using DFT+U</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent experimental study on a spent uranium dioxide (UO2) fuel sample from Belgium Reactor 3 (BR3) identified a unique pair structure formed by the noble metal phase (NMP) and fission gas (xenon [Xe]) precipitate. However, the fundamental mechanism behind this structure remains unclear. The present study aims to provide an understanding of the interaction between five different metal precipitates (molybdenum [Mo], ruthenium [Ru], palladium [Pd], technetium [Tc], and rhodium [Rh]) and the Xe fission gas atoms in UO2, by using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with the Hubbard U correction to compute the formation energies involved. All DFT+U calculations were performed with occupation matrix control to ensure antiferromagnetic ordering of UO2. The calculated formation and binding energies of the Xe and solid fission products in the NMP reveal that these metal precipitates form stable pair structures with Xe. Notably, the formation energy of Xe-metal pairs is lower than that of the isolated single defects in all instances, with Pd and Mo showing the most favourable binding energy, likely accounting for the observed pair structure formation.</description>

Abstract: The current progress in describing rare-earth-based magnets' electronic structure and magnetic properties is discussed. We use several currently popular electronic structure methods to show the typical values of critical parameters that define the physics of RECo$_5$ (RE = rare earth atom) materials. The magnetic moments and anisotropy of 4\textit{f} atoms are obtained using several approaches, including anisotropic 4\textit{f}-charge density-constrained DFT and DFT+HI methods. We also suggest the introduction of 'penalty' functional for obtaining correct variational total energy in the traditional Hund's rule-constrained DFT-based techniques. The applicability and future extensions are discussed. The proposed combination of methods is potentially suitable for high-throughput computational searches of new rare-earth-containing magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Interactive Multiscale Modeling to Bridge Atomic Properties and Electrochemical Performance in Li-CO$_2$ Battery Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Li-CO$_2$ batteries show promise as energy storage solutions, offering high theoretical energy density and CO$_2$ fixation. Their performance relies on the formation and decomposition of Li$_2$CO$_3$/C during discharge and charge cycles, respectively. We used a multiscale modeling framework that integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT), Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties. The Li-CO$_2$ battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth porous cathode with a Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical conductivities of Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ and Li$_2$CO$_3$ using the Kubo-Greenwood formalism and studied the CO$_2$ reduction mechanism on the cathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, Li$^+$ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li$^+$ solvation structure. The FEA model, incorporating results from atomistic simulations, reproduced experimental voltage-capacity profiles at 1 mA/cm$^2$ and revealed spatio-temporal variations in Li$_2$CO$_3$/C deposition, porosity, and CO$_2$ concentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly, Li$_2$CO$_3$ can form toroidal and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and local porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ and 1 mA/cm$^2$, respectively. The capacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ to 6,200 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm$^2$, due to pore clogging that limits CO$_2$ transport to the cathode interior. Therefore, the performance of Li-CO$_2$ batteries can be significantly improved by enhancing CO$_2$ transport, regulating Li$_2$CO$_3$ deposition, and optimizing cathode architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory that studies the state composition of a bound exciton in magnetic field. Using a basis set made of products of free electron and hole wavefunctions in Landau gauge, we derive a secular equation which shows the relation between Landau levels (LLs) of the electron and hole when a bound exciton is formed. Focusing on excitons in the light cone, we establish a scattering selection rule for the interaction of an electron in LL $n_\text{e}$ with a hole in LL $n_\text{h}$. We solve the resulting secular equation and identify a simple pairing law, $n_\text{e} = n_\text{h} + l$, which informs us on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number $l$, and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. We obtain good agreement between theory results and recent measurements of the diamagnetic shifts of exciton states in WSe$_2$ monolayers.</description>

      <title>Experimental signature of layer skyrmions and implications for band topology in twisted WSe2 bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) twisted homobilayers have been established as an ideal platform for studying strong correlation phenomena, as exemplified by the recent discovery of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe2 and Chern insulators (CI) and unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe2 (tWSe2). In these systems, nontrivial topology in the strongly layer-hybridized regime can arise from a spatial patterning of interlayer tunneling amplitudes and layer-dependent potentials that yields a lattice of layer skyrmions. Here we report on experimental signatures of skyrmion textures in the layer degree of freedom of Rhombohedral-stacked (R-stacked) tWSe2 homobilayers. This observation is based on scanning tunneling spectroscopy that separately resolves the Gamma-valley and K-valley moir\'e electronic states. We show that Gamma-valley states are subjected to a moir\'e potential with an amplitude of ~ 120 meV. At ~150 meV above the Gamma-valley, the K-valley states are subjected to a weaker moir\'e potential of ~30 meV. Most significantly, we reveal opposite layer polarizations of the K-valley at the MX and XM sites within the moir\'e unit cell, confirming the theoretically predicted layer skyrmion texture. The dI/dV mappings allow the parameters that enter the continuum model of moir\'e bands in twisted TMD bilayers to be determined experimentally, further establishing a direct correlation between the shape of the LDOS profile in real space and the topology of topmost moir\'e band.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of the current work is the development of a so-called physics-encoded Fourier neural operator (PeFNO) for surrogate modeling of the quasi-static equilibrium stress field in solids. Rather than accounting for constraints from physics in the loss function as done in the (now standard) physics-informed approach, the physics-encoded approach incorporates or "encodes" such constraints directly into the network or operator architecture. As a result, in contrast to the physics-informed approach in which only training is physically constrained, both training and output are physically constrained in the physics-encoded approach. For the current constraint of divergence-free stress, a novel encoding approach based on a stress potential is proposed.
  As a "proof-of-concept" example application of the proposed PeFNO, a heterogeneous polycrystalline material consisting of isotropic elastic grains subject to uniaxial extension is considered. Stress field data for training are obtained from the numerical solution of a corresponding boundary-value problem for quasi-static mechanical equilibrium. This data is also employed to train an analogous physics-guided FNO (PgFNO) and physics-informed FNO (PiFNO) for comparison. As confirmed by this comparison and as expected on the basis of their differences, the output of the trained PeFNO is significantly more accurate in satisfying mechanical equilibrium than the output of either the trained PgFNO or the trained PiFNO.</description>

      <title>Entropic selection of magnetization in a frustrated 2D magnetic model</title>

Abstract: We discuss the magnetic ground state and properties of a frustrated two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model of interacting hexagonal clusters of spins. The energy of the ground states is found exactly for arbitrary values of $J_1$ (intra-cluster couplings) and $J_2$ (inter-cluster couplings). Our main results concern a frustrated region of the phase diagram, where we show that the set of ground states has a degeneracy larger than that due to global rotation symmetry. Furthermore, the ground state manifold does not have a fixed total magnetization~: there is a range of allowed values. At finite temperature, our Monte-Carlo simulations show that the entropy selects the most probable value of the total magnetization, while the histogram of the Monte-Carlo time series is non-trivial. This model is a first step towards modelling properties of a class of frustrated magnetic structures composed of coupled spin clusters.</description>

      <title>Local Field Statistics in Linear Elastic Unidirectional Fibrous Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14967</link>

Abstract: Statistical fluctuations of local tensorial fields beyond the mean are relevant to predict localized failure or overall behavior of the inelastic composites. The expression for second moments of the local fields can be established using the Hill-Mandel condition. Complete estimation of statistical fluctuations via second moments is usually ignored despite its significance. In Eshelby-based mean-field approaches, the second moments are evaluated through derivatives of Hill's Polarization tensor $ \left ( \mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{o}} \right )$ using a singular approximation. Typically, semi-analytical procedures using numerical integration are used to evaluate the derivatives of the polarization tensor $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{o}}$. Here, new analytically derived explicit expressions are presented for calculating the derivatives, specifically for unidirectional fibrous composites with isotropic phases. Full-field homogenization using finite element is used to compute the statistical distribution of local fields (exact solution) for the class of random fibrous microstructures. The mean-field estimates are validated with the exact solution across different fiber volume fractions and aspect ratios. The results indicate that the fiber volume fraction significantly influences the fluctuation of stress tensor invariants, whereas the aspect ratio has minimal effect.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional spin liquid state in the frustrated $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$</title>

Abstract: Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a spin-liquid phase emerges from the interplay of strongly frustrated exchange interactions and subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects.</description>
