      <title>Defensive Rebalancing for Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and analyzes \emph{defensive rebalancing}, a novel mechanism for protecting constant-function market makers (CFMMs) from value leakage due to arbitrage. A \emph{rebalancing} transfers assets directly from one CFMM's pool to another's, bypassing the CFMMs' standard trading protocols. In any \emph{arbitrage-prone} configuration, we prove there exists a rebalancing to an \textit{arbitrage-free} configuration that strictly increases some CFMMs' liquidities without reducing the liquidities of the others. Moreover, we prove that a configuration is arbitrage-free if and only if it is \emph{Pareto efficient} under rebalancing, meaning that any further direct asset transfers must decrease some CFMM's liquidity. We prove that for any log-concave trading function, including the ubiquitous constant product market maker, the search for an optimal, arbitrage-free rebalancing that maximizes global liquidity while ensuring no participant is worse off can be cast as a convex optimization problem with a unique, computationally tractable solution. We extend this framework to \emph{mixed rebalancing}, where a subset of participating CFMMs use a combination of direct transfers and standard trades to transition to an arbitrage-free configuration while harvesting arbitrage profits from non-participating CFMMs, and from price oracle market makers such as centralized exchanges. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for future AMM protocols that proactively defend liquidity providers against arbitrage.</description>

      <title>Guiding the Recommender: Information-Aware Auto-Bidding for Content Promotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern content platforms offer paid promotion to mitigate cold start by allocating exposure via auctions. Our empirical analysis reveals a counterintuitive flaw in this paradigm: while promotion rescues low-to-medium quality content, it can harm high-quality content by forcing exposure to suboptimal audiences, polluting engagement signals and downgrading future recommendation. We recast content promotion as a dual-objective optimization that balances short-term value acquisition with long-term model improvement. To make this tractable at bid time in content promotion, we introduce a decomposable surrogate objective, gradient coverage, and establish its formal connection to Fisher Information and optimal experimental design. We design a two-stage auto-bidding algorithm based on Lagrange duality that dynamically paces budget through a shadow price and optimizes impression-level bids using per-impression marginal utilities. To address missing labels at bid time, we propose a confidence-gated gradient heuristic, paired with a zeroth-order variant for black-box models that reliably estimates learning signals in real time. We provide theoretical guarantees, proving monotone submodularity of the composite objective, sublinear regret in online auction, and budget feasibility. Extensive offline experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the framework: it outperforms baselines, achieves superior final AUC/LogLoss, adheres closely to budget targets, and remains effective when gradients are approximated zeroth-order. These results show that strategic, information-aware promotion can improve long-term model performance and organic outcomes beyond naive impression-maximization strategies.</description>

      <title>Inequality in Congestion Games with Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Who benefits from expanding transport networks? While designed to improve mobility, such interventions can also create inequality. In this paper, we show that disparities arise not only from the structure of the network itself but also from differences in how commuters adapt to it. We model commuters as reinforcement learning agents who adapt their travel choices at different learning rates, reflecting unequal access to resources and information. To capture potential efficiency-fairness tradeoffs, we introduce the Price of Learning (PoL), a measure of inefficiency during learning. We analyze both a stylized network -- inspired in the well-known Braess's paradox, yet with two-source nodes -- and an abstraction of a real-world metro system (Amsterdam). Our simulations show that network expansions can simultaneously increase efficiency and amplify inequality, especially when faster learners disproportionately benefit from new routes before others adapt. These results highlight that transport policies must account not only for equilibrium outcomes but also for the heterogeneous ways commuters adapt, since both shape the balance between efficiency and fairness.</description>

      <title>Independence of Approximate Clones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an ordinal election, two candidates are said to be perfect clones if every voter ranks them adjacently. The independence of clones axiom then states that removing one of the two clones should not change the election outcome. This axiom has been extensively studied in social choice theory, and several voting rules are known to satisfy it (such as IRV, Ranked Pairs and Schulze). However, perfect clones are unlikely to occur in practice, especially for political elections with many voters.
  In this work, we study different notions of approximate clones in ordinal elections. Informally, two candidates are approximate clones in a preference profile if they are close to being perfect clones. We discuss two measures to quantify this proximity, and we show under which conditions the voting rules that are known to be independent of clones are also independent of approximate clones. In particular, we show that for elections with at least four candidates, none of these rules are independent of approximate clones in the general case. However, we find a more positive result for the case of three candidates. Finally, we conduct an empirical study of approximate clones and independence of approximate clones based on three real-world datasets: votes in local Scottish elections, votes in mini-jury deliberations, and votes of judges in figure skating competitions. We find that approximate clones are common in some contexts, and that the closest two candidates are to being perfect clones, the less likely their removal is to change the election outcome, especially for voting rules that are independent of perfect clones.</description>

      <title>C2:Cross learning module enhanced decision transformer with Constraint-aware loss for auto-bidding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20257v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT) shows promise for generative auto-bidding by capturing temporal dependencies, but suffers from two critical limitations: insufficient cross-correlation modeling among state, action, and return-to-go (RTG) sequences, and indiscriminate learning of optimal/suboptimal behaviors. To address these, we propose C2, a novel framework enhancing DT with two core innovations: (1) a Cross Learning Block (CLB) via cross-attention to strengthen inter-sequence correlation modeling; (2) a Constraint-aware Loss (CL) incorporating budget and Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA) constraints for selective learning of optimal trajectories. Extensive offline evaluations on the AuctionNet dataset demonstrate consistent performance gains (up to 3.2% over state-of-the-art method) across diverse budget settings; ablation studies verify the complementary synergy of CLB and CL, confirming C2's superiority in auto-bidding. The code for reproducing our results is available at: https://github.com/Dingjinren/C2.</description>

      <title>Truthfulness Despite Weak Supervision: Evaluating and Training LLMs Using Peer Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation and post-training of large language models (LLMs) rely on supervision, but strong supervision for difficult tasks is often unavailable, especially when evaluating frontier models. In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.</description>

      <title>Normative Equivalence in Human-AI Cooperation: Behaviour, Not Identity, Drives Cooperation in Mixed-Agent Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20487v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into human group settings raises essential questions about how these novel participants influence cooperative social norms. While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.</description>

      <title>Distributed Learning over Noisy Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study binary coordination games over graphs under log-linear learning when neighbor actions are conveyed through explicit noisy communication links. Each edge is modeled as either a binary symmetric channel (BSC) or a binary erasure channel (BEC). We analyze two operational regimes. For binary symmetric and binary erasure channels, we provide a structural characterization of the induced learning dynamics. In a fast-communication regime, agents update using channel-averaged payoffs; the resulting learning dynamics coincide with a Gibbs sampler for a scaled coordination potential, where channel reliability enters only through a scalar attenuation coefficient. In a snapshot regime, agents update from a single noisy realization and ignore channel statistics; the induced Markov chain is generally nonreversible, but admits a high-temperature expansion whose drift matches that of the fast Gibbs sampler with the same attenuation. We further formalize a finite-$K$ communication budget, which interpolates between snapshot and fast behavior as the number of channel uses per update grows. This viewpoint yields a communication-theoretic interpretation in terms of retransmissions and repetition coding, and extends naturally to heterogeneous link reliabilities via effective edge weights. Numerical experiments illustrate the theory and quantify the tradeoff between communication resources and steady-state coordination quality.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Selection for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has produced numerous algorithms that converge to Nash or related equilibria, such equilibria are often non-unique and can exhibit widely varying efficiency.
  This raises a fundamental question: how can one design learning dynamics that not only converge to equilibrium but also select equilibria with desirable performance, such as high social welfare? In contrast to the MARL literature, equilibrium selection has been extensively studied in normal-form games, where decentralized dynamics are known to converge to potential-maximizing or Pareto-optimal Nash equilibria (NEs). Motivated by these results, we study equilibrium selection in finite-horizon stochastic games. We propose a unified actor-critic framework in which a critic learns state-action value functions, and an actor applies a classical equilibrium-selection rule state-wise, treating learned values as stage-game payoffs. We show that, under standard stochastic stability assumptions, the stochastically stable policies of the resulting dynamics inherit the equilibrium selection properties of the underlying normal-form learning rule. As consequences, we obtain potential-maximizing policies in Markov potential games and Pareto-optimal (Markov perfect) equilibria in general-sum stochastic games, together with sample-based implementation of the framework.</description>

      <title>Randomly Wrong Signals: Bayesian Auction Design with ML Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study auction design when a seller relies on machine-learning predictions of bidders' valuations that may be unreliable. Motivated by modern ML systems that are often accurate but occasionally fail in a way that is essentially uninformative, we model predictions as randomly wrong: with high probability the signal equals the bidder's true value, and otherwise it is a hallucination independent of the value. We analyze revenue-maximizing auctions when the seller publicly reveals these signals. A central difficulty is that the resulting posterior belief combines a continuous distribution with a point mass at the signal, so standard Myerson techniques do not directly apply. We provide a tractable characterization of the optimal signal-revealing auction by providing a closed-form characterization of the appropriate ironed virtual values. This characterization yields simple and intuitive implications. With a single bidder, the optimal mechanism reduces to a posted-price policy with a small number of regimes: the seller ignores low signals, follows intermediate signals, caps moderately high signals, and may again follow very high signals. With multiple bidders, we show that a simple eager second-price auction with signal-dependent reserve prices performs nearly optimally in numerical experiments and substantially outperforms natural benchmarks that either ignore the signal or treat it as fully reliable.</description>

      <title>Playing Markov Games Without Observing Payoffs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization under uncertainty is a fundamental problem in learning and decision-making, particularly in multi-agent systems. Previously, Feldman, Kalai, and Tennenholtz [2010] demonstrated the ability to efficiently compete in repeated symmetric two-player matrix games without observing payoffs, as long as the opponents actions are observed. In this paper, we introduce and formalize a new class of zero-sum symmetric Markov games, which extends the notion of symmetry from matrix games to the Markovian setting. We show that even without observing payoffs, a player who knows the transition dynamics and observes only the opponents sequence of actions can still compete against an adversary who may have complete knowledge of the game. We formalize three distinct notions of symmetry in this setting and show that, under these conditions, the learning problem can be reduced to an instance of online learning, enabling the player to asymptotically match the return of the opponent despite lacking payoff observations. Our algorithms apply to both matrix and Markov games, and run in polynomial time with respect to the size of the game and the number of episodes. Our work broadens the class of games in which robust learning is possible under severe informational disadvantage and deepens the connection between online learning and adversarial game theory.</description>

      <title>Governing Strategic Dynamics: Equilibrium Stabilization via Divergence-Driven Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-box coevolution in mixed-motive games is often undermined by opponent-drift non-stationarity and noisy rollouts, which distort progress signals and can induce cycling, Red-Queen dynamics, and detachment. We propose the \emph{Marker Gene Method} (MGM), a curriculum-inspired governance mechanism that stabilizes selection by anchoring evaluation to cross-generational marker individuals, together with DWAM and conservative marker-update rules to reduce spurious updates. We also introduce NGD-Div, which adapts the key update threshold using a divergence proxy and natural-gradient optimization. We provide theoretical analysis in strictly competitive settings and evaluate MGM integrated with evolution strategies (MGM-E-NES) on coordination games and a resource-depletion Markov game. MGM-E-NES reliably recovers target coordination in Stag Hunt and Battle of the Sexes, achieving final cooperation probabilities close to $(1,1)$ (e.g., $0.991\pm0.01/1.00\pm0.00$ and $0.97\pm0.00/0.97\pm0.00$ for the two players). In the Markov resource game, it maintains high and stable state-conditioned cooperation across 30 seeds, with final cooperation of $\approx 0.954/0.980/0.916$ in \textsc{Rich}/\textsc{Poor}/\textsc{Collapsed} (both players; small standard deviations), indicating welfare-aligned and state-dependent behavior. Overall, MGM-E-NES transfers across tasks with minimal hyperparameter changes and yields consistently stable training dynamics, showing that top-level governance can substantially improve the robustness of black-box coevolution in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization: Addressing Theoretical Risks in Neural Fictitious Self-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include: (1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and (4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.</description>
