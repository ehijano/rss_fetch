      <title>How many autonomous vehicles are required to stabilize traffic flow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective behavior of human-driven vehicles (HVs) results in the well-known stop-and-go waves potentially leading to higher fuel consumption and emissions. This letter investigates the stabilization of traffic flow via a minimum number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) subject to constraints on the control parameters. The unconstrained scenario has been well-studied in recent studies. The main motivation to investigate the constrained scenario is that, in reality, lower and upper bounds exist on the control parameters. For the constrained scenario, we optimally find the minimum number of required AVs (via computing the optimal lower bound on the AV penetration rate) to stabilize traffic flow for a given number of HVs. As an immediate consequence, we conclude that for a given number of AVs, the number of HVs in the stabilized traffic flow cannot be arbitrarily large in the constrained scenario unlike the unconstrained scenario studied in the literature. Using nonlinear optimization techniques, we systematically propose a procedure to compute the optimal lower bound on the AV penetration rate. Finally, we validate the theoretical results via numerical simulations. Numerical simulations suggest that by enlarging the constraint intervals, a smaller optimal lower bound on the AV penetration rate is attainable. However, it leads to a slower transient response due to a dominant pole closer to the origin.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based Fast Quantum State Stabilization with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stabilization of quantum states is a fundamental problem for realizing various quantum technologies. Measurement-based-feedback strategies have demonstrated powerful performance, and the construction of quantum control signals using measurement information has attracted great interest. However, the interaction between quantum systems and the environment is inevitable, especially when measurements are introduced, which leads to decoherence. To mitigate decoherence, it is desirable to stabilize quantum systems faster, thereby reducing the time of interaction with the environment. In this paper, we utilize information obtained from measurement and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, without explicitly constructing specific complex measurement-control mappings, to rapidly drive random initial quantum state to the target state. The proposed DRL algorithm has the ability to speed up the convergence to a target state, which shortens the interaction between quantum systems and their environments to protect coherence. Simulations are performed on two-qubit and three-qubit systems, and the results show that our algorithm can successfully stabilize random initial quantum system to the target entangled state, with a convergence time faster than traditional methods such as Lyapunov feedback control. Moreover, it exhibits robustness against imperfect measurements and delays in system evolution.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform Using Metamaterial Coupled Lines Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete Fractional Fourier Transforms (DFrFT) are universal mathematical tools in signal processing, communications and microwave sensing. Despite the excessive applications of DFrFT, implementation of corresponding fractional orders in the baseband signal often leads to bulky, power-hungry, and high-latency systems. In this paper, we present a passive metamaterial coupled lines network (MCLN) that performs the analog DFrFT in real-time at microwave frequencies. The proposed MCLN consists of M parallel microstrip transmission lines (TLs) in which adjacent TLs are loaded with interdigital capacitors to enhance the coupling level. We show that with proper design of the coupling coefficients between adjacent channels, the MCLN can perform an M-point DFrFT of an arbitrary fractional order that can be designed through the length of the network. In the context of real-time signal processing for realization of DFrFT, we design, model, simulate and implement a 16x16 MCLN and experimentally demonstrate the performance of the proposed structure. The proposed innovative approach is versatile and is capable to be used in various applications where DFrFT is an essential tool. The proposed design scheme based on MCLN is scalable across the frequency spectrum and can be applied to millimeter and submillimeter wave systems.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Fast and Efficient Design Method Using Deep Learning for Capacitive Coupling WPT System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capacitive coupling wireless power transfer (CCWPT) is one of the pervasive methods to transfer power in the reactive near-field zone. In this paper, a flexible design methodology based on Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) algorithm is proposed for a pixelated microstrip structure. The pixel configuration of each parallel plate (43x43 pixels) determines the frequency response of the system (S-parameters) and by changing this configuration, we can achieve the dedicated operating frequency (resonance frequency) and its related |S21| value. Due to the large number of pixels, iterative optimization algorithm (BPSO) is the solution for designing a CCWPT system. However, the output of each iteration should be simulated in electromagnetic simulators (e.g., CST, HFSS, etc.), hence, the whole optimization process is time-consuming. This paper develops a rapid, agile and efficient method for designing two parallel pixelated microstrip plates of a CCWPT system based on deep neural networks. In the proposed method, CST-based BPSO algorithm is replaced with an AI-based method using ResNet-18. Advantages of the AI-based iterative method are automatic design process, more efficient, less time-consuming, less computational resource-consuming and less background EM knowledge requirements compared to the conventional techniques. Finally, the prototype of the proposed simulated structure is fabricated and measured. The simulation and measurement results validate the design procedure accuracy, using AI-based BPSO algorithm. The MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of prediction for the main resonance frequency and related |S21| are 110 MHz and 0.18 dB, respectively and according to the simulation results, the whole design process is 3629 times faster than the CST-based BPSO algorithm.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Combined Sewer Systems for Urban Sustainability: An Empirical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change poses complex challenges, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to model. Examples include the dynamics of Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overburdened CSS during heavy rainfall will overflow untreated wastewater into surface water bodies. Classical approaches to modeling the impact of extreme rainfall events rely on physical simulations, which are particularly challenging to create for large urban infrastructures. Deep Learning (DL) models offer a cost-effective alternative for modeling the complex dynamics of sewer systems. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art DL time series models for predicting sewer system dynamics in a large urban infrastructure, utilizing three years of measurement data. We especially investigate the potential of DL models to maintain predictive precision during network outages by comparing global models, which have access to all variables within the sewer system, and local models, which are limited to data from a restricted set of local sensors. Our findings demonstrate that DL models can accurately predict the dynamics of sewer system load, even under network outage conditions. These results suggest that DL models can effectively aid in balancing the load redistribution in CSS, thereby enhancing the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Data-driven H2-optimal Model Reduction via Offline Transfer Function Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model order reduction algorithms represent a significant class of techniques, known for their accuracy, which has been extensively validated over the past two decades. Among these, the Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (IRKA) is widely regarded as a benchmark for constructing $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal reduced-order models. However, a key challenge in its data-driven implementation lies in the need for transfer function samples and their derivatives, which must be updated iteratively. Conducting new experiments to acquire these samples each time IRKA updates the interpolation data is impractical. Additionally, for discrete-time systems, obtaining transfer function samples at frequencies outside the unit circle is challenging, as these are not easily accessible through measurements. This paper proposes a method to sample the transfer function and its derivative offline using frequency or time-domain data, which is commonly measured for various design and analysis purposes in industry. By leveraging this approach, there is no need to directly measure transfer function samples at interpolation points, as these can be generated offline using the pre-existing data. This facilitates the offline implementation of IRKA within the frequency- or time-domain Loewner framework. The approach is also extended to discrete-time systems in this work. A numerical example is provided to validate the theoretical findings presented.</description>

      <title>Consensus over Clustered Networks using Intermittent and Asynchronous Output Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, multi-agent teaming has garnered considerable interest since complex objectives, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, can be divided into multiple cluster-level sub-tasks and assigned to a cluster of agents with the appropriate functionality. Yet, coordination and information dissemination between clusters may be necessary to accomplish a desired objective. Distributed consensus protocols provide a mechanism for spreading information within clustered networks, allowing agents and clusters to make decisions without requiring direct access to the state of the ensemble. Hence, we propose a strategy for achieving system-wide consensus in the states of identical linear time-invariant systems coupled by an undirected graph whose directed sub-graphs are available only at sporadic times. Within this work, the agents of the network are organized into pairwise disjoint clusters, which induce sub-graphs of the undirected parent graph. Some cluster sub-graph pairs are linked by an inter-cluster sub-graph, where the union of all cluster and inter-cluster sub-graphs yields the undirected parent graph. Each agent utilizes a distributed consensus protocol with components that are updated intermittently and asynchronously with respect to other agents. The closed-loop ensemble dynamics is modeled as a hybrid system, and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis yields sufficient conditions for rendering the agreement subspace (consensus set) globally exponentially stable. Furthermore, an input-to-state stability argument demonstrates the consensus set is robust to a class of perturbations. A numerical simulation considering both nominal and perturbed scenarios is provided for validation purposes.</description>

      <title>CAMEO:A Co-design Architecture for Multi-objective Energy System Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-design plays a pivotal role in energy system planning as it allows for the holistic optimization of interconnected components, fostering efficiency, resilience, and sustainability by addressing complex interdependencies and trade-offs within the system. This leads to reduced operational costs and improved financial performance through optimized system design, resource allocation, and system-wide synergies. In addition, system planners must consider multiple probable scenarios to plan for potential variations in operating conditions, uncertainties, and future demands, ensuring robust and adaptable solutions that can effectively address the needs and challenges of various systems. This research introduces Co-design Architecture for Multi-objective Energy System Optimization (CAMEO), which facilitates design space exploration of the co-design problem via a modular and automated workflow system, enhancing flexibility and accelerating the design and validation cycles. The cloud-scale automation provides a user-friendly interface and enable energy system modelers to efficiently explore diverse design alternatives. CAMEO aims to revolutionize energy system optimization by developing next-generation design assistant with improved scalability, usability, and automation, thereby enabling the development of optimized energy systems with greater ease and speed.</description>

      <title>Newton-Raphson Flow for Aggressive Quadrotor Tracking Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the Newton-Raphson flow tracking controller to aggressive quadrotor flight and demonstrate that it achieves good tracking performance over a suite of benchmark trajectories, beating the native trajectory tracking controller in the popular PX4 Autopilot. The Newton-Raphson flow tracking controller is a recently proposed integrator-type controller that aims to drive to zero the error between a future predicted system output and the reference trajectory. This controller is computationally lightweight, requiring only an imprecise predictor, and achieves guaranteed asymptotic error bounds under certain conditions. We show that these theoretical advantages are realizable on a quadrotor hardware platform. Our experiments are conducted on a Holybrox x500v2 quadrotor using a Pixhawk 6x flight controller and a Rasbperry Pi 4 companion computer which receives location information from an OptiTrack motion capture system and sends input commands through the ROS2 API for the PX4 software stack.</description>

      <title>Reflex-Based Open-Vocabulary Navigation without Prior Knowledge Using Omnidirectional Camera and Multiple Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various robot navigation methods have been developed, but they are mainly based on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), reinforcement learning, etc., which require prior map construction or learning. In this study, we consider the simplest method that does not require any map construction or learning, and execute open-vocabulary navigation of robots without any prior knowledge to do this. We applied an omnidirectional camera and pre-trained vision-language models to the robot. The omnidirectional camera provides a uniform view of the surroundings, thus eliminating the need for complicated exploratory behaviors including trajectory generation. By applying multiple pre-trained vision-language models to this omnidirectional image and incorporating reflective behaviors, we show that navigation becomes simple and does not require any prior setup. Interesting properties and limitations of our method are discussed based on experiments with the mobile robot Fetch.</description>

      <title>Learning Deep Dissipative Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study challenges strictly guaranteeing ``dissipativity'' of a dynamical system represented by neural networks learned from given time-series data. Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

      <description>arXiv:2408.11580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the algebraic foundations of the HEOL setting, which combines flatness-based control and intelligent controllers, two advances in automatic control that have been proven in practice, including in industry. The result provides a solution to many pending questions on feedback loops concerning flatness-based control and model-free control (MFC). Elementary module theory, ordinary differential fields and the generalization of K\"ahler differentials to differential fields provide an intrinsic definition of the tangent linear system. The algebraic manipulations associated with the operational calculus lead to homeostat and intelligent controllers. They are illustrated via some computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Visual SLAM for Collision-free Driving with Lightweight Autonomous Cars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a vision-based obstacle avoidance strategy for lightweight self-driving cars that can be run on a CPU-only device using a single RGB-D camera. The method consists of two steps: visual perception and path planning. The visual perception part uses ORBSLAM3 enhanced with optical flow to estimate the car's poses and extract rich texture information from the scene. In the path planning phase, we employ a method combining a control Lyapunov function and control barrier function in the form of quadratic program (CLF-CBF-QP) together with an obstacle shape reconstruction process (SRP) to plan safe and stable trajectories. To validate the performance and robustness of the proposed method, simulation experiments were conducted with a car in various complex indoor environments using the Gazebo simulation environment. Our method can effectively avoid obstacles in the scenes. The proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in achieving more stable and shorter trajectories across multiple simulated scenes.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Mean-Field Games with Function Approximation and Empirical Mean-Field Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have provided algorithms by which decentralised agents, which may be connected via a communication network, can learn equilibria in Mean-Field Games from a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. However, these algorithms are given for tabular settings: this computationally limits the size of players' observation space, meaning that the algorithms are not able to handle anything but small state spaces, nor to generalise beyond policies depending on the ego player's state to so-called 'population-dependent' policies. We address this limitation by introducing function approximation to the existing setting, drawing on the Munchausen Online Mirror Descent method that has previously been employed only in finite-horizon, episodic, centralised settings. While this permits us to include the population's mean-field distribution in the observation for each player's policy, it is arguably unrealistic to assume that decentralised agents would have access to this global information: we therefore additionally provide new algorithms that allow agents to estimate the global empirical distribution based on a local neighbourhood, and to improve this estimate via communication over a given network. Our experiments showcase how the communication network allows decentralised agents to estimate the mean-field distribution for population-dependent policies, and that exchanging policy information helps networked agents to outperform both independent and even centralised agents in function-approximation settings, by an even greater margin than in tabular settings.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Robot Arm Inserting Nasopharyngeal Swabs with Admittance Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sample test, commonly used to detect COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, involves moving a swab through the nasal cavity to collect samples from the nasopharynx. While typically this is done by human healthcare workers, there is a significant societal interest to enable robots to do this test to reduce exposure to patients and to free up human resources. The task is challenging from the robotics perspective because of the dexterity and safety requirements. While other works have implemented specific hardware solutions, our research differentiates itself by using a ubiquitous rigid robotic arm. This work presents a case study where we investigate the strengths and challenges using compliant control system to accomplish NP swab tests with such a robotic configuration. To accomplish this, we designed a force sensing end-effector that integrates with the proposed torque controlled compliant control loop. We then conducted experiments where the robot inserted NP swabs into a 3D printed nasal cavity phantom. Ultimately, we found that the compliant control system outperformed a basic position controller and shows promise for human use.

      <title>An Advanced Microscopic Energy Consumption Model for Automated Vehicle:Development, Calibration, Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automated vehicle (AV) equipped with the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system is expected to reduce the fuel consumption for the intelligent transportation system. This paper presents the Advanced ACC-Micro (AA-Micro) model, a new energy consumption model based on micro trajectory data, calibrated and verified by empirical data. Utilizing a commercial AV equipped with the ACC system as the test platform, experiments were conducted at the Columbus 151 Speedway, capturing data from multiple ACC and Human-Driven (HV) test runs. The calibrated AA-Micro model integrates features from traditional energy consumption models and demonstrates superior goodness of fit, achieving an impressive 90% accuracy in predicting ACC system energy consumption without overfitting. A comprehensive statistical evaluation of the AA-Micro model's applicability and adaptability in predicting energy consumption and vehicle trajectories indicated strong model consistency and reliability for ACC vehicles, evidenced by minimal variance in RMSE values and uniform RSS distributions. Conversely, significant discrepancies were observed when applying the model to HV data, underscoring the necessity for specialized models to accurately predict energy consumption for HV and ACC systems, potentially due to their distinct energy consumption characteristics.</description>

      <title>Reducing transmission expansion by co-optimizing sizing of wind, solar, storage and grid connection capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expanding transmission capacity is likely a bottleneck that will restrict variable renewable energy (VRE) deployment required to achieve ambitious emission reduction goals. Grid interconnection and inter-regional transmission capacity may be reduced by the optimal sizing of VREs to grid connection or co-location of VRE and battery resources behind the grid interconnection, but neither of these capabilities are commonly captured in macro-energy system models. We thus develop these two new functionalities to explore the substitutability of storage for transmission and VRE resource trade-offs through 2030 in the Western Interconnection of the United States. Our findings indicate that not modeling co-location fails to capture the full substitutability of storage and solar photovoltaic (PV) resources for transmission: co-location can reduce long-distance inter-regional transmission expansion by 12-31% and decrease grid connection capacity and shorter-distance transmission interconnection by 20-25%. We also demonstrate that not modeling colocated storage does not accurately reflect competition between wind and solar PV resources and underestimates the value of energy storage: co-location of VREs and storage favors solar PV (4-5% increase) and lithium-ion battery deployment (1.7-6 times increase), while decreasing wind buildout (0.9-1.6% decline).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03690v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying and suppressing unknown disturbances to dynamical systems is a problem with applications in many different fields. Here we present a model-free method to identify and suppress an unknown disturbance to an unknown system based only on previous observations of the system under the influence of a known forcing function. We find that, under very mild restrictions on the training function, our method is able to robustly identify and suppress a large class of unknown disturbances. We illustrate our scheme with the identification of both deterministic and stochastic unknown disturbances to an analog electric chaotic circuit and with numerical examples where a chaotic disturbance to various chaotic dynamical systems is identified and suppressed.</description>

      <title>2-Level Reinforcement Learning for Ships on Inland Waterways: Path Planning and Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a realistic modularized framework for controlling autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) on inland waterways (IWs) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The framework improves operational safety and comprises two levels: a high-level local path planning (LPP) unit and a low-level path following (PF) unit, each consisting of a DRL agent. The LPP agent is responsible for planning a path under consideration of dynamic vessels, closing a gap in the current research landscape. In addition, the LPP agent adequately considers traffic rules and the geometry of the waterway. We thereby introduce a novel application of a spatial-temporal recurrent neural network architecture to continuous action spaces. The LPP agent outperforms a state-of-the-art artificial potential field (APF) method by increasing the minimum distance to other vessels by 65% on average. The PF agent performs low-level actuator control while accounting for shallow water influences and the environmental forces winds, waves, and currents. Compared with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, the PF agent yields only 61% of the mean cross-track error (MCTE) while significantly reducing control effort (CE) in terms of the required absolute rudder angle. Lastly, both agents are jointly validated in simulation, employing the lower Elbe in northern Germany as an example case and using real automatic identification system (AIS) trajectories to model the behavior of other ships.</description>

      <title>Strong exponential stability of switched impulsive systems with mode-constrained switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong stability, defined by bounds that decay not only over time but also with the number of impulses, has been established as a requirement to ensure robustness properties for impulsive systems with respect to inputs or disturbances. Most existing results, however, only consider weak stability, where the bounds only decay with time. In this paper, we provide a method for calculating the maximum overshoot and the decay rate for strong global uniform exponential stability bounds for nonlinear switched impulsive systems. We consider the scenario of mode-constrained switching where not all transitions between subsystems are allowed, and where subsystems may exhibit unstable dynamics in the flow and/or jump maps. Based on direct and reverse mode-dependent average dwell-time and activation-time constraints, we derive stability bounds that can be improved by considering longer switching sequences for computation. We provide an example that shows how the results can be employed to ensure the stability robustness of nonlinear systems that admit a global state weak linearization.</description>

      <title>Receding Horizon Games for Modeling Competitive Supply Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast majority of products we use daily are supplied to us through complex global supply chains that transform raw materials into finished goods and distribute them to end consumers. This paper proposes a modeling methodology for dynamic competitive supply chains based on game theory and model predictive control. We model each manufacturer in the supply chain as a rational utility maximizing agent that selects their actions by finding an open-loop generalized Nash equilibrium of a multi-stage game. To react to competitors and the state of the market, every agent re-plans their actions in a receding horizon manner based on estimates of market and supplier parameters thereby creating an approximate closed-loop equilibrium policy. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that this modeling approach is computationally tractable and generates economically interpretable behaviors in a variety of settings such as demand spikes, supply shocks, and information asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reachable Sets on Lie Groups Using Lie Algebra Monotonicity and Tangent Intervals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we efficiently compute overapproximating reachable sets for control systems evolving on Lie groups, building off results from monotone systems theory and geometric integration theory. We consider intervals in the tangent space, which describe real sets on the Lie group through the exponential map. A local equivalence between the original system and a system evolving on the Lie algebra allows existing interval reachability techniques to apply in the tangent space. Using interval bounds of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, these reachable set estimates are extended to arbitrary time horizons in an efficient Runge-Kutta-Munthe-Kaas integration algorithm. The algorithm is demonstrated through consensus on a torus and attitude control on $SO(3)$.</description>

      <title>Emerging clean technologies: policy-driven cost reductions, implications and perspectives</title>

Abstract: Hydrogen production from water electrolysis, direct air capture (DAC), and synthetic kerosene derived from hydrogen and CO2 (`e-kerosene') are expected to play an important role in global decarbonization efforts. So far, the economics of these nascent technologies hamper their market diffusion. However, a wave of recent policy support in the United States, Europe, China, and elsewhere is anticipated to drive their commercial liftoff and bring their costs down. To this end, we evaluate the potential cost reductions driven by policy-induced scale-up of these emerging technologies through 2030 using an experience curves approach accounting for both local and global learning effects. We then analyze the consequences of projected cost declines on the competitiveness of these nascent technologies compared to conventional fossil alternatives, where applicable, and highlight some of the tradeoffs associated with their expansion. Our findings indicate that enacted policies could lead to substantial capital cost reductions for electrolyzers. Nevertheless, electrolytic hydrogen production at $1-2/kg would still require some form of policy support. Given expected costs and experience curves, it is unlikely that liquid solvent DAC (L-DAC) scale-up will bring removal costs to stated targets of $100/tCO2, though a $200/tCO2 may eventually be within reach. We also underscore the importance of tackling methane leakage for natural gas-powered L-DAC: unmitigated leaks amplify net removal costs, exacerbate the investment requirements to reach targeted costs, and cast doubt on L-DAC's role in the clean energy transition. Lastly, despite reductions in electrolysis and L-DAC costs, e-kerosene remains considerably more expensive than fossil jet fuel. The economics of e-kerosene and the resources required for production raise questions about the fuel's ultimate viability as a decarbonization tool for aviation.</description>

      <title>Proximal observers for secure state estimation</title>

Abstract: This paper discusses a general framework for designing robust state estimators for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems. We consider systems that may be impacted by impulsive (sparse but otherwise arbitrary) measurement noise sequences. We show that a family of state estimators, robust to this type of undesired signal, can be obtained by minimizing a class of nonsmooth convex functions at each time step. The resulting state observers are defined through proximal operators. We obtain a nonlinear implicit dynamical system in term of estimation error and prove, in the noise-free setting, that it vanishes asymptotically when the minimized loss function and the to-be-observed system enjoy appropriate properties. From a computational perspective, even though the proposed observers can be implemented via efficient numerical procedures, they do not admit closed-form expressions. The paper argues that by adopting appropriate relaxations, simple and fast analytic expressions can be derived.</description>

      <title>ComTraQ-MPC: Meta-Trained DQN-MPC Integration for Trajectory Tracking with Limited Active Localization Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal decision-making for trajectory tracking in partially observable, stochastic environments where the number of active localization updates -- the process by which the agent obtains its true state information from the sensors -- are limited, presents a significant challenge. Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of NMPC and Fuzzy PID Controllers for Trajectory Tracking in Omni-Drive Robots: Design, Simulation, and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory tracking for an Omni-drive robot presents a challenging task that demands an efficient controller design. This paper introduces a self-optimizing controller, Type-1 fuzzyPID, which leverages dynamic and static system response analysis to overcome the limitations of manual tuning. To account for system uncertainties, an Interval Type-2 fuzzyPID controller is also developed. Both controllers are designed using Matlab/Simulink and tested through trajectory tracking simulations in the CoppeliaSim environment. Additionally, a non-linear model predictive controller(NMPC) is proposed and compared against the fuzzyPID controllers. The impact of tunable parameters on NMPC tracking accuracy is thoroughly examined. We also present plots of the step-response characteristics and noise rejection experiments for each controller. Simulation results validate the precision and effectiveness of NMPC over fuzzyPID controllers while trading computational complexity.
