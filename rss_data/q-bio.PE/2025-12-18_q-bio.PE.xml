      <title>Characterizing Open-Ended Evolution Through Undecidability Mechanisms in Random Boolean Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete dynamical models underpin systems biology, but we still lack substrate-agnostic diagnostics for when such models can sustain genuinely open-ended evolution (OEE): the continual production of novel phenotypes rather than eventual settling. We introduce a simple, model-independent metric, {\Omega}, that quantifies OEE as the residence-time-weighted contribution of each attractor's cycle length across the sequence of attractors realized over time. {\Omega} is zero for single-attractor dynamics and grows with the number and persistence of distinct cyclic phenotypes, separating enduring innovation from transient noise. Using Random Boolean Networks (RBNs) as a unifying testbed, we compare classical Boolean dynamics with biologically motivated non-classical mechanisms (probabilistic context switching, annealed rule mutation, paraconsistent logic, modal necessary/possible gating, and quantum-inspired superposition/entanglement) under homogeneous and heterogeneous updating schemes. Our results support the view that undecidability-adjacent, state-dependent mechanisms -- implemented as contextual switching, conditional necessity/possibility, controlled contradictions, or correlated branching -- are enabling conditions for sustained novelty. At the end of our manuscript we outline a practical extension of {\Omega} to continuous/hybrid state spaces, positioning {\Omega} as a portable benchmark for OEE in discrete biological modeling and a guide for engineering evolvable synthetic circuits.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modelling and Analysis of Within-Farm Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Dynamics in Dairy Cattle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has expanded its host range with recent detections in dairy cattle, raising critical concerns regarding within-herd persistence and cross-species spillover. This study develops a stochastic $SEI_sI_aR-B$ compartmental model to analyse HPAI transmission, explicitly accounting for environmental pathogen reservoirs and noise intensities through Wiener processes. The positivity and boundedness of solutions are established, and the disease-free and endemic equilibria are analytically derived. The basic reproduction number is determined using the next-generation matrix method. Numerical simulations confirm that the model dynamics are consistent with theoretical analysis and illustrate how stochastic fluctuations significantly influence disease persistence. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC) identifies the transmission rate from asymptomatic infectious cattle ($\beta_a$) as the primary driver of transmission. The model effectively captures the dynamics of environmental variability affecting HPAI spread, suggesting that effective control strategies must prioritise the early detection and isolation of asymptomatic carriers alongside environmental management.</description>

      <title>A multiscale framework integrating within-host infection kinetics with airborne transmission dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling within-host infection dynamics with population-level transmission remains a major challenge in infectious disease modeling, especially for airborne pathogens with potential to spread indoor. The frequent emergence of such diseases highlight the need for integrated frameworks that capture both individual-level infection kinetics and between-host transmission. While analytical models for each scale exist, tractable approaches that link them remain limited. In this study, we present a novel multiscale mathematical framework that integrates within-host infection kinetics with airborne transmission dynamics. The model represents each host as a patch and couples a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing in-host infection kinetics with a diffusion-based partial differential equation (PDE) for airborne pathogen movement in enclosed spaces. These scales are linked through boundary conditions on each patch boundary, representing viral shedding and inhalation. Using matched asymptotic analysis in the regime of intermediate diffusivity, we derived a nonlinear ODE model from the coupled ODE-PDE system that retains spatial heterogeneity through Neumann Green's functions. We established the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of solutions to the reduced model and analyzed within-host infection kinetics as functions of the airborne pathogen diffusion rate and host spatial configuration. In the well-mixed limit, the model recovers the classical target cell limited viral dynamics framework. Overall, the proposed multiscale modeling approach enables the simultaneous study of transient within-host infection dynamics and population-level disease spread, providing a tractable yet biologically grounded framework for investigating airborne disease transmission in indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Reducing Recurrent Competitive Epidemics via Dynamic Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.13395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by scenarios of epidemic competition, as well as how social contagions spread at the level of individuals, this work considers the competition between two conflicting node states that spread over a social graph according to a generic diffusion process. For this setting, we introduce the Generalized Largest Reduction in Infectious Edges (gLRIE), which is a dynamic resource allocation strategy that favors the preferred state against the other. Our analysis assumes a generic continuous-time SIS-like (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) diffusion model that allows for: arbitrary node transition rate functions for nodes to change state, and competition between the healthy (positive) and infected (negative) states, which are both diffusive at the same time, yet mutually exclusive at each node. The strategy follows a minimum-risk-maximum-gain principle, and its features are particularly relevant for social contagion phenomena. In accordance with the LRIE strategy that we generalize, we show that in this context the gLRIE strategy remains a greedy solution for the minimization of the number of infected network nodes over time. Ultimately, simulations are employed to compare the proposed strategy with other existing alternatives, demonstrating that gLRIE exhibits superior performance across a spectrum of scenarios, including a realistic counter-contagion campaign in a small well-monitored community.</description>

      <title>Sufficient condition for dispersal-induced growth on dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a population spreading across a finite number of sites. Individuals can move from one site to the other according to a network (oriented links between the sites) that vary periodically over time. On each site, the population experiences a growth rate which is also periodically time varying. Recently, this kind of models have been extensively studied, using various technical tools to derive precise necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters of the system (ie the local growth rate on each site, the time period and the strength of migration between the sites) for the population to grow. In the present paper, we take a completely different approach: using elementary comparison results between linear systems, we give sufficient condition for the growth of the population This condition is easy to check and can be applied in a broad class of examples. In particular, in the case when all sites are sinks (ie, in the absence of migration, the population become extinct in each site), we prove that when our condition of growth if satisfied, the population grows when the time period is large and for values of the migration strength that are exponentially small with respect to the time period, which answers positively to a conjecture stated by Katriel.</description>
