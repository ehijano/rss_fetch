      <title>An Intermittent Model for the $1/f$ Spectrum in the Pristine Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical, observational study of the $1/f$ range of solar wind turbulence, where $f$ denotes frequency, using in situ data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). We compute the energy cascade rate using the third order law of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, incorporating expansion terms to account for solar wind dynamics. Our results reveal a $1/\tau$ dependence of the energy cascade rate, where $\tau$ is the temporal lag, within the $1/f$ range, in contrast to the constant cascade rate in the inertial range. To explain this behavior, we propose a new intermittent model predicting a $1/\ell$ scaling of the cascade rate, where $\ell$ represents the spatial lag. The analysis of the probability density function (PDF) of magnetic field increments confirms the intermittent nature of the parallel fluctuation component, whereas the perpendicular fluctuations are found to be quasi Gaussian. These findings provide new insights into energy transfer processes in the $1/f$ range of solar wind turbulence, with potential applications in planetary magnetosheaths.</description>

      <title>Precise Timing Analysis of Four Magnetic Cataclysmic Variables with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analysed high time-resolution optical photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to study the timing behaviour of four intermediate polar-like objects, namely, V1460 Her, 1RXS J045707.4+452751, Swift J0958.0-4208, and V842 Cen. In the case of V1460 Her, we refined the measurement of its orbital period. Long-term observations suggest a gradual decrease in the orbital period of V1460 Her, and the stable light curve during the TESS observations indicates its quiescent state. We detected a beat period of 1290.6 $\pm$ 0.5 s for the first time for the source 1RXS J045707.4+452751, suggesting a possible disc-overflow accretion scenario. For the sources Swift J0958.0-4208 and V842 Cen, we determined periods 6.11 $\pm$ 0.02 h and 3.555 $\pm$ 0.005 h, respectively, which can be provisionally suggested to be orbital periods. These findings provide valuable insights into the accretion processes and long-term evolution of these intriguing binary systems.</description>

      <title>Flare frequency in M dwarfs belonging to Young Moving Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. M stars are preferred targets for studying terrestrial exoplanets, for which we hope to obtain their atmosphere spectra in the next decade. However, M dwarfs have long been known for strong magnetic activity and the ability to frequently produce optical, broadband emission flares. Aims. We aim to characterise the flaring behaviour of young M dwarfs in the temporal, spectral, and energetic dimensions, as well as examine the stellar parameters governing this behaviour, in order to improve our understanding of the energy and frequency of the flare events capable of shaping the exoplanet atmosphere. Methods. Young Moving Group (YMG) members provide a unique age-based perspective on stellar activity. By examining their flare behaviour in conjunction with rotation, mass, and H{\alpha} data, we obtain a comprehensive understanding of flare activity drivers in young stars. Results. We demonstrate that young stars sharing similar stellar parameters can exhibit a variety in flare frequency distributions and that the flare behaviour shows indications of difference between optical and far-UV. We propose that the period of rotation, not the age of the star, can be a good proxy for assessing flaring activity. Furthermore, we recommend that instead of a simple power law for describing the flare frequency distribution, a piecewise power law be used to describe mid-size and large flare distributions in young and active M dwarfs. Conclusions. Using known periods of rotation and fine-tuned power laws governing the flare frequency, we can produce a realistic sequence of flare events to study whether the atmosphere of small exoplanets orbiting M dwarf shall withstand such activity until life can emerge.</description>

      <title>Using the Coolest Ae Stars to Constrain Circumstellar Disk Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Ae (CAe) stars are main sequence, A-type stars with H{\alpha} emission but no signature of dust. They are thought to be the cool extension of the classical Be stars to lower masses. Recent surveys based on H{\alpha} spectroscopy have significantly increased the number of known CAe stars, with the population extending to spectral types as cool as A4 (Teff approx. 8500 K). We compute the temperature structure of gaseous, circumstellar disks around A-type stars, including both radiative heating from the central star and viscous shear heating from the disk's rotation. We find that shear heating can become important for spectral types A2 and later and can act to increase the low temperatures predicted by purely radiatively heated disks. Our modeling indicates that the presence and strength of H{\alpha} emission for spectral types A2 and later significantly increases with the amount of shear heating included, and we propose that this dependence can be used to constrain the {\alpha} viscosity parameter appropriate for CAe star disks.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive light curve model of the very fast nova V1674 Herculis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V1674 Her is one of the fastest novae, of which the very early phase is well observed including optical rise to the peak over 10 magnitudes. We present a full theoretical light curve model of V1674 Her. Our $1.35~M_\odot$ white dwarf (WD) model with the mass accretion rate of $1\times 10^{-11}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ explains overall properties including a very fast rise and decay of the optical $V$ light curve. The WD photosphere expands up to $21 ~R_\odot$, thus, a $0.26 ~M_\odot$ companion star orbiting the WD every 3.67 hours, is engulfed 2.7 hours after the onset of thermonuclear runaway, and appears 5.3 days after that. The duration of X-ray flash is only 0.96 hours. The evolution of the expanding envelope and temporal change of the photospheric radius are very consistent with observed optical and X-ray modulations with the orbital and spin (501 s) periods. We confirmed that the decay phase of nova light curve is well approximated by a sequence of steady-state envelope solutions. Using time-stretching method of nova light curves, we obtain the $V$ band distance modulus of $(m-M)_V= 16.3\pm 0.2$, and determine the distance to be $d=8.9\pm 1$ kpc for the interstellar extinction of $E(B-V)= 0.5 \pm 0.05$.</description>

      <title>Implications of a turbulent convection model for classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appearance of blue loops in the evolutionary tracks of intermediate-mass core He-burning stars is essential for explaining the observed characteristics of Cepheids. The blue loops for lower mass Cepheids cannot always be reproduced when only classical, local mixing length theory (MLT) is used. Additionally, classical models result in a mass discrepancy compared to pulsational and dynamical mass determinations. Both problems can be resolved through an ad-hoc extension of the MLT for convection. We use the non-local Kuhfuss turbulent convection model (TCM) which can explain overshooting directly from the solution of the TCM equations. The primary objective of this study is to test the predictions of the Kuhfuss TCM when applied to intermediate-mass core He-burning stars and validate the model predictions against observations of Cepheids. We used the state-of-the-art 1D stellar evolution code GARSTEC with the implementation of the Kuhfuss TCM and computed evolutionary tracks for intermediate-mass core He-burning stars. We compare these tracks with those computed with MLT including and excluding ad-hoc overshooting and with observations of five Cepheids in detached binary systems obtained from the literature. The stellar evolution tracks generated using the Kuhfuss TCM and MLT with ad-hoc overshooting exhibit similar appearances. Overshoot mixing from the convective boundaries and the occurrence of the Cepheid blue-loop have been achieved naturally as solutions to the Kuhfuss TCM equations. Furthermore, these models successfully reproduce observed stellar parameters including mass, luminosity, radius, and effective temperature. In conclusion, our TCM approach reproduces Cepheid blue loops and agrees with observations similarly well as MLT models with overshooting, however, without fine-tuning the model parameters or ad-hoc assumptions.</description>

      <title>Deep learning image burst stacking to reconstruct high-resolution ground-based solar observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large aperture ground based solar telescopes allow the solar atmosphere to be resolved in unprecedented detail. However, observations are limited by Earths turbulent atmosphere, requiring post image corrections. Current reconstruction methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts. An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.</description>

      <title>Coronal dimmings from active region 13664 during the May 2024 solar energetic events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal dimmings are regions of transiently reduced brightness in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray (SXR) emissions associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), providing key insights into CME initiation and early evolution. During May 2024, AR 13664 was among the most flare-productive regions in recent decades, generating 55 M-class and 12 X-class flares along with multiple Earth-directed CMEs. The rapid succession of these CMEs triggered the most intense geomagnetic storm in two decades. We study coronal dimmings from a single active region (AR 13664) and compare them with statistical dimming properties. We investigate how coronal dimming parameters - such as area, brightness, and magnetic flux - relate to key flare and CME properties. We systematically identified all flares above M1.0, all coronal dimmings and all CMEs (from the CDAW SOHO/LASCO catalogue) produced by AR 13664 during 2024 May 1 - 15, and studied the associations between the different phenomena and their characteristic parameters. We detect coronal dimmings in 22 events, with 16 occurring on-disc and six off-limb. Approximately 83% of X-class flares and 23% of M-class flares are associated with CMEs, with 13 out of 16 on-disc dimmings linked to CME activity. Our results support the strong interplay between coronal dimmings and flares, as we find increased correlations between flare and dimming parameters in this single-AR study compared to the general dimming population. Furthermore, we confirm that coronagraphic observations, unable to observe the lower corona, underestimate correlations between CME velocities and dimming parameters, as they fail to capture the early CME acceleration phase. This highlights the critical role of dimming observations in providing a more comprehensive understanding of CME dynamics.</description>

      <title>Weak or strong: coupling of mixed oscillation modes on the red-giant branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The high precision of recent asteroseismic observations of red-giant stars has revealed the presence of mixed dipole modes in their oscillation spectra. These modes allow for a look inside the stars. Among the parameters used to characterize mixed modes is the coupling strength q, which is sensitive to the stellar structure in the evanescent zone near the bottom of the convective envelope.
  Aims. The aim of this work is to probe the validity of the weak and strong coupling approximations, commonly used to calculate q, during stellar evolution along the red-giant branch (RGB).
  Methods. To test the approximations empirically, we calculate q-values in both, the weak and strong limit for stellar models on the RGB and compare them to the coupling derived from the mixed mode frequency pattern obtained from numerical solutions to the oscillation equations.
  Results. We find good agreement with the strong coupling approximation on the early RGB, when the evanescent zone lies in the radiative layer right above the hydrogen-burning shell; and with the weak coupling approximation once the evanescent zone is situated in the convective envelope. This is consistent with earlier studies. Additionally, we find that it is viable to use the weak coupling approximation as an estimate for q in the intermediate regime, in the mass range considered in this work (1.00 Msun &lt;= M &lt;= 2.00 Msun).
  Conclusions. The width of the evanescent zone serves as a good measure for which approximation to use. The serendipitous alignment of the weak coupling approximation with the observable q in the regime where neither approximation is expected to be valid simplifies the asymptotic calculation of mixed mode properties.</description>

      <title>Continued Photometric Monitoring Supports Long-Term Dynamical Evolution in the Young Binary Star-Disk System KH 15D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric time series data spanning 2018-2024 that show the effects of temporal dynamics in the binary system KH 15D, a member of the NGC 2264 star forming region. This source exhibits complex eclipsing behavior due to a precessing circumbinary disk or ring that is slightly inclined relative to the orbital plane of the binary. Using g-band and r-band observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) over seven observing seasons, we follow the evolution of the KH 15D lightcurve as it continues to emerge from its deepest observed photometric minimum about 15 years ago. Our observations are consistent with previous models that propose a precessing, warped circumbinary disk orbiting KH 15D. We verify the gradual precession of the disk by quantifying the times of eclipse ingresses and egresses. We also examine the central re-brightening within the minima of the phased lightcurve. This feature has increased in amplitude over our observing seasons, and we measure its evolution in both amplitude and phase from year to year. Finally, we assess color as a function of phase and brightness. Our findings support the assertion that line-of-sight variations in disk density and structure, possibly due to clumping, coupled with a precessing circumbinary disk are responsible for the central re-brightening event.</description>

      <title>K2 observations of five pulsating subdwarf B stars with white dwarf companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report seismic analyses of five pulsating subdwarf B (sdBV) stars observed during Kepler's K2 mission, each with a white dwarf companion. We find three of the five to be g-mode-dominated hybrid pulsators. For the other two, we only detect g modes. We determine rotation periods from frequency multiplets for four stars and each rotates subsynchronously to its binary period, including PG 0101+039 and PG 0902+124 both with binary periods near 0.57 days and spin periods near 9 days. We detect frequency multiplets in both p and g modes for PG 0101+039 and LT Cnc and determine that PG 0101+039 rotates like a solid body while LT Cnc rotates differentially radially with the envelope spinning faster than deeper layers. Mostly we find these five stars to be quite similar to one another, spectroscopically and seismically. We find the p modes of the three hybrid pulsators to have gaps between regions of power, which we interpret as overtones and apply a technique to assign modes. We examine their g mode period spacings and deviations thereof and again, find the stars to be similar with period spacings near the average of 250 s and deviations mostly under 25 s. We compare Kepler-observed sdBV stars of different binary types and likely-single pulsators.</description>

      <title>Coupling 1D stellar evolution with 3D-hydrodynamical simulations on-the-fly III: stellar evolution at different metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major weakness in one-dimensional (1D) stellar structure and evolution modeling is the simplified treatment of convection, which leads to erroneous near-surface stratification and considerable uncertainties in predicted effective temperatures and luminosities of low-mass stars. In a series of preceding works, a novel method for coupling 1D stellar structural models with a grid of 3D surface convection simulations during stellar evolution was developed, at solar metallicity. This 1D-3D coupling method slightly shifts evolutionary tracks relative to standard calculations, meanwhile providing oscillation frequencies that agree more closely with asteroseismic observations. Here we extend this method to model metal-poor and metal-rich FGK-type stars, by implementing interpolations on-the-fly across metallicity ($\rm -3 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.5$) for mean 3D models during stellar evolution. We demonstrate quantitatively that the fundamental stellar parameters modeled within our framework are insensitive to the mixing-length parameter. A 20% change in the mixing-length parameter results in evolutionary tracks with a temperature shift of less than 30 K, compared to a difference of over 200 K in standard evolution calculations. Our extension is validated against eclipsing binary systems with extremely precise observational constraints as well as stars in binaries with asteroseismic data. Using a fixed mixing-length parameter that merely governs convective heat transport in the near-adiabatic layers, the 1D-3D coupling method successfully reproduces most observational constraints for all target stars. Coupling 1D stellar evolution models with 3D simulations greatly reduces uncertainties associated with the choice of atmosphere boundary conditions and mixing-length parameters, hence offering a powerful tool for characterizing stars with seismic measurements and determining ages for globular clusters.</description>

Abstract: T~Coronae Borealis is the nearest symbiotic recurrent nova. Twice in the last two centuries, in 1866 and 1946, the accreted material ignited on the surface of the white dwarf via runaway thermonuclear fusion reactions and produced a nova eruption. Both eruptions occurred approximately midway through a transient state of high luminosity. A possible explanation of such a state is a dwarf-nova-like outburst, which may arise from a transient increase in the mass-transfer rate of the donor star. We simulate the response of an accretion disk to an event of enhanced mass-transfer that is ``interrupted'' by a pre-eruption dip associated to the convective phase leading to the thermonuclear runaway, and model the resulting optical light curve using the parameters of the T~CrB binary. Our model represents the first attempt to reproduce the transient high-accretion state. The observed brightening can be satisfactorily reproduced by models of an accretion disk with a viscosity parameter $\alpha = 3$, an event of enhanced mass-transfer with a duration of $\Delta t = 15$\,yr, and quiescent and high-state mass-transfer rates of $2.0 \times 10^{-9} \, M_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$ and $1.9 \times 10^{-7} \, M_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$, respectively, while the pre-eruption dip can be reproduced by the small, accelerated expansion of the inner disk radius, at an average velocity of 0.02\,km\,s$^{-1}$. Our model is also capable of reproducing the observed changes in color of T~CrB throughout the transient event.</description>

      <title>Going Bayesian on the ages of nearby young stellar systems I. The expansion rate method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Determining the ages of young stellar systems is fundamental to test and validate current star-formation theories. Aims. We aim at developing a Bayesian version of the expansion rate method that incorporates the a priori knowledge on the stellar system's age and solves some of the caveats of the traditional frequentist approach. Methods. We upgrade an existing Bayesian hierarchical model with additional parameter hierarchies that include, amongst others, the system's age. For this later, we propose prior distributions inspired by literature works. Results. We validate our method on a set of extensive simulations mimicking the properties of real stellar systems. In stellar associations between 10 and 40 Myr and up to 150 pc the errors are &lt;10%. In star forming regions up to 400 pc, the error can be as large as 80% at 3 Myr but it rapidly decreases with increasing age. Conclusions. The Bayesian expansion rate methodology that we present here offers several advantages over the traditional frequentist version. In particular, the Bayesian age estimator is more robust and credible than the commonly used the frequentist ones. This new Bayesian expansion rate method is made publicly available as a module of the free and open-source code Kalkayotl.</description>

      <title>Bayesian ages of local young stellar associations I. Through the expansion rate method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Local young stellar associations (LYSAs &lt;50 Myr and &lt;150 pc) are important laboratories to test predictions from star-formation theories. Estimating their ages through various dating techniques with minimal biases is thus of paramount importance. Aims. We aim at determining the ages of LYSAs with the expansion rate dating technique. Methods. We estimate the ages of the LYSAs using literature membership lists, publicly available data (astrometry and radial velocities), and a recent open-source Bayesian code that implements the expansion rate method. This code in combination with simple statistical assumptions allow us to decontaminate, identify possible substructures or populations, and estimate expansion ages. Results. We derive the largest and most methodological homogeneous set of ages of LYSAs. We rediscover three and discover four associations hidden within the literature membership lists of the classical ones. Conclusions. The expansion ages we report here are compatible with literature age estimates. Moreover, our analysis shows that previous age tensions can be explained, in most cases, by the presence of unidentified populations or substructures.</description>

      <title>Search for binarity in Asymptotic Giant Branch stars utilizing the future Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary systems in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase are widely recognized as a leading theoretical framework underpinning the observed asymmetric morphologies of planetary nebulae. However, the detection of binary companions in AGB systems is severely hampered by the overwhelming brightness and variability of the evolved primary star, which dominate the photo-metric and spectroscopic signatures. Ultraviolet (UV) excess emission has been proposed as a candidate diagnostic for the presence of binary companions in AGB systems. This paper evaluates the Chinese Space Station Telescope's (CSST) ability to detect UV excess emission in AGB stars, leveraging its unprecedented UV sensitivity and wide-field survey capabilities. We employed synthetic spectral libraries of M0-M8 type giants for primary stars and the ATLAS 9 atmospheric model grid for companion stars spanning a temperature range of 6500 K to 12000 K. By convolving these model spectra with the CSST multi-band filter system, we computed color-color diagrams (g-y versus NUV-u) to construct a diagnostic grid. This grid incorporates interstellar extinction corrections and establishes a framework for identifying AGB binary candidates through direct comparison between observed photometry and theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we discuss the physical origins of UV excess in AGB stars. This study pioneers a diagnostic framework leveraging CSST's unique multi-band UV-visible synergy to construct color-color grids for binary candidate identification, overcoming limitations of non-simultaneous multi-instrument observations.</description>

      <title>The Age and High Energy Environment of the Very Young Transiting Exoplanet TOI 1227b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mid-M star TOI~1227 hosts among the youngest known transiting exoplanets. We have conducted new X-ray imaging and optical spectroscopic observations of TOI 1227 aimed at ascertaining its age and the influence of its high-energy radiation on the exoplanet, TOI 1227b. We obtained a definitive X-ray detection of TOI 1227 with Chandra/HRC-I, and measured its Li and H$\alpha$ lines using ANU SSO 2.3 m telescope (WiFeS) spectroscopy. Through spatiokinematic, isochronal, and SED-based modeling, we have constrained the age of TOI 1227 as lying between 5 Myr and 12 Myr, with a best estimate of $\sim$8 Myr. In the context of this age, we model the evolution of the transiting exoplanet TOI 1227b, using the X-ray luminosity derived from Chandra HRC-I imaging. Our modeling suggests that TOI 1227b is currently undergoing rapid atmospheric mass loss at rates on the order of $\sim 10^{12}$ g s$^{-1}$. The modeling demonstrates that the exoplanet's predicted future evolution depends sensitively on assumptions for total and core planet mass, highlighting the importance of follow-up observations of the TOI 1227 star-exoplanet system to enable measurements of both planetary mass and mass-loss rate.</description>

      <title>Mapping the reddening plane in the Galactic disk through interstellar extinction of open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As thousands of new open clusters in the Galaxy have recently been reported with reddening or extinction information, we map the distribution and properties of the Galaxy's interstellar material in the Galactic disk as traced by these open clusters. By analyzing the distribution of interstellar extinction for 6215 open clusters located at low Galactic latitude b &lt;= 6 deg, corresponding to the thin Galactic disk, we identify a reddening plane characterized by a dust layer whose thickness varies with Galactic longitude. By splitting the open clusters sample into several sub-regions of Galactic longitude, we observe that the reddening plane is not perfectly aligned with the formal Galactic plane, but instead varies sinusoidally around the Galactic mid-plane. The maximum and minimum interstellar absorption occur at approximately 42 deg and 222 deg, respectively, along the Galactic longitude. Our analysis reveals a noticeable north-south asymmetry in the distribution of interstellar absorption, with a higher proportion of interstellar material below the Galactic plane. We also find that the Sun is located 15.7 +/- 7.3 pc above the reddening plane. The scale height of the open clusters from the reddening plane is estimated to be z_h = 87.3 +/- 1.8 pc. The mean thickness of the absorbing material in the reddening plane, which represents the average extent of the dust layer responsible for interstellar extinction, is found to be about 201 +/- 20 pc. Our findings provide insights into the distribution of interstellar dust, its relationship with the Galactic thin disk, and its implications for the Galactic structure.</description>

      <title>The structural and kinematical properties of NGC 5634, a globular cluster associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of NGC 5634 through a comprehensive analysis of its morphology, kinematics and dynamics. Utilizing data from the DESI Legacy Survey, we refined its fundamental parameters (age t = 12.8 +/- 0.3 Gyr, metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.8 +/- 0.1 dex, distance modulus dm = 17.0 +/- 0.1 mag) and constructed matched-filter template based on the combination of these parameters to search for extra-tidal structures. However, no significant features were detected above a 3 sigma signal-to-noise threshold, which limits our ability to further investigate the association between NGC 5634 and the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream based on morphological evidence. Incorporating GAIA data, we further examine the orbital path of NGC 5634. We found that its orbit only briefly intersects with the Sgr stream and diverges significantly over long-term integrations. This behavior contrasts with that of confirmed Sgr-associated clusters, whose orbits remain closely aligned with the stream throughout their orbital evolution. Additionally, NGC 5634 exhibits a relatively shorter semi-major axis and smaller apocenter and pericenter distances compared to Sgr clusters. These orbital characteristics are more consistent with clusters associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) or the Helmi streams. From a dynamical perspective, in the Lz-E space, NGC 5634 is also distinctly different from Sgr clusters and aligns more closely with the GSE and Helmi regions. Taken together, these findings do not support a strong connection between NGC 5634 and the Sgr dSph, but instead suggest a potential association with another progenitor system, such as GSE or Helmi stream. Nevertheless, further evidence is needed to definitively establish its origin.</description>

      <title>Testing gravity with wide binaries -- 3D velocities and distances of wide binaries from Gaia and HARPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide Binaries (WBs) are interesting systems to test Newton-Einstein gravity in low potentials. The basic concept is to verify whether the difference in velocity between the WB components is compatible with what is expected from the Newton law. Previous attempts, based solely on Gaia proper motion differences scaled to transverse velocity differences using mean parallax distances, do not provide conclusive results. Here we add to the Gaia transverse velocities precise measurements of the third velocity component, the radial velocity (RV), in order to identify multiple stars, and to improve the reliability of the test by using velocity differences and positions in three dimensions. We use the HARPS spectra to determine accurate RV difference between the WB components, correcting the observed velocities for gravitational redshift and convective shift. We exploit the Gaia distance distributions to determine the projected and intrinsic separations s and r and the 3-dimensional velocity differences of the binaries. Of the 44 pairs observed with HARPS, 27% show sign of multiplicity or are not suitable for the test, and 32 bona-fide WBs survive our selection. Their projected separation s is up to 14 kAU, or 0.06 parsec. We determine distances, eccentricities and position angles to reproduce the velocity differences according to Newton's law, finding reasonable solutions for all WBs but one, and with some systems possibly too near pericenter and/or at too high inclination. Our (limited) number of WBs does not show obvious trends with separation or acceleration and is consistent with Newtonian dynamics. We are collecting a larger sample of this kind to robustly assess these results.</description>

Abstract: We present static axially symmetric fluid distributions not producing gravitational field outside their boundaries (i.e. fluid sources which match smoothly on the boundary surface to Minkowski space-time). These solutions provide further examples of ghost stars. A specific model is fully described, and its physical and geometrical properties are analyzed in detail. This includes the multipole moment structure of the source and its complexity factors, both of which vanish for our solution.</description>

      <title>The making of robust and highly performing imaging spectropolarimeters for large solar telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the requirements, concepts, simulations, implementation, and calibration of two dual Fabry-Perot based imaging spectropolarimeters, CRISP and CHROMIS, at the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope, and CRISP2 that is under construction. These instruments use a combination of a high-resolution and a low-resolution etalon together with an order-sorting prefilter to define the bandpass. The overall design is made robust and stable by tailoring the low-resolution etalon reflectivity to accommodate expected cavity errors from both etalons, and by using a compact optical design that eliminates the need for folding mirrors. By using a telecentric design based on lenses rather than mirrors, image degradation by the FPI system is negligible, as shown in a previous publication, and the throughput of the system is maximised. Initial alignment, and maintaining that alignment over time, is greatly simplified. The telecentric design allows full calibration and/or modelling of essential system parameters to be carried out without interfering with the optical setup. We also discuss briefly the polarimeters developed for CRISP and CHROMIS. The high performance of CRISP and CHROMIS has been demonstrated in an earlier publication through measurements of the granulation contrast and comparisons with similar measurements simultaneously made through broadband continuum filters. Here, we focus on the aspects of the design that are central to enabling high performance and robustness, but also discuss the calibration and processing of the data, and use a few examples of processed data to demonstrate the achievable image and data quality. We put forward a proposal for a similar conceptual design for the European Solar Telescope and conclude by discussing potential problems of the proposed approach to designs of this type. Some aspects of these FPI systems may be of interest also outside the solar community.</description>

      <title>Weighing The Options: The Unseen Companion in LAMOST J2354 is Likely a Massive White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LAMOST J235456.73+335625 (J2354) is a binary system hosting a $\sim 0.7~\rm M_\odot$ K dwarf and a $\sim 1.4~\rm M_\odot$ dark companion, supposedly a neutron star, in a 0.48d orbit. Here we present high- and low-resolution spectroscopy to better constrain the properties of the system. The low-resolution spectrum confirms that the luminous star is a slightly metal-poor K dwarf and strengthens the limits on any optical flux from the dimmer companion. We use the high-resolution spectra to measure atmospheric parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_{\rm rot}\sin i$) and abundances for 8 elements for the K dwarf. We refine the mass of the compact object to $M_{\rm co} \sim 1.3~\rm M_\odot$ with a minimum mass of $M_{\rm co, min} = 1.23\pm0.04~\rm M_\odot$. The expected overabundance of intermediate-mass elements from the incident supernova ejecta is not detected in the K-dwarf atmosphere. This contrasts with known binaries hosting neutron stars where almost all companions show evidence for polluting material. Moving the neutron-star progenitor further from the K-dwarf at the time of explosion to minimize atmospheric pollution requires a finely-tuned kick to produce the current orbital separation of $\sim 3.3~\rm R_\odot$. Instead, we find that a massive white dwarf with a cooling age of $\gtrsim 3~$Gyr satisfies all observational constraints. The system likely experienced two common-envelope phases leading to its current state because the white dwarf progenitor was massive enough to ignite He-shell burning. The system will become a cataclysmic variable in the distant future when the K-dwarf evolves off of the main sequence. These short-period high-$q$ binaries represent an intriguing formation pathway for compact double white dwarf binaries and thermonuclear supernovae. An ultraviolet spectrum is the most promising avenue for directly detecting the white dwarf companion.</description>

      <title>The Temperature Anisotropy and Helium Abundance Features of Alfv\'enic Slow Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe, Helios, and Wind Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.12372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow solar wind is typically characterized as having low Alfv\'enicity, but the occasional occurrence of highly Alfv\'enic slow solar wind (HASSW) raises questions about its source regions and evolution. In this work, we conduct a statistical analysis of temperature anisotropy and helium abundance in HASSW using data from PSP within 0.25 AU, Helios between 0.3 AU and 1 AU, and Wind near 1 AU. Our findings reveal that HASSW is prevalent close to the Sun, with PSP observations displaying a distinct ``U-shaped" Alfv\'enicity distribution with respect to increasing solar wind speed, unlike the monotonic increase trend seen in Helios and Wind data. This highlights a previously unreported population of unusually low speed HASSW, which is found in both sub-Alfv\'enic and super-Alfv\'enic regimes. The observed decreasing overlap in temperature anisotropy between HASSW and fast solar wind (FSW) with increasing heliocentric distance suggests different underlying heating processes. Additionally, HASSW exhibits two distinct helium abundance populations, particularly evident in PSP data, with generally higher helium abundance compared to less Alfv\'enic slow solar wind. Moreover, the decreasing overlap in temperature anisotropy versus helium abundance distributions between HASSW and FSW with decreasing radial distance implies that not all HASSW originates from the same source region as FSW.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds: Properties of Critical Cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fraction of the dense cores within a turbulent molecular cloud will eventually collapse to form stars. Identifying the physical criteria for instability and analyzing critical core properties is therefore necessary to star formation theory. Here we quantify the characteristics of an ensemble of "critical cores" on the verge of collapse. This critical epoch was identified in a companion paper, which followed the dynamical evolution of prestellar cores in numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. We find that radial profiles of density and turbulent velocity dispersion in individual critical cores are consistent with our new model for turbulent equilibrium spheres (TESs). While a global linewidth-size relation exists for a cloud with given size and Mach number, the turbulent scaling relations around each core exhibit significant variations. As a result, there is no single density threshold for collapse; instead, cores collapse at a range of densities determined by the local sonic scale and gravitational potential environment. The critical cores in our simulations are mostly transonic; we do not find either purely thermal or highly turbulent cores. In our low Mach number model which better resolves the characteristic mass and sonic scales, we find marginal evidence that the core mass function (CMF) of critical cores peaks around a characteristic mass scale associated with the large-scale cloud properties. We highlight the importance of constructing the CMF at the critical time for the purpose of testing gravoturbulent fragmentation theories, and derive the resolution requirements to unambiguously identify the peak of the CMF.</description>

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) correspond to the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (C-O WD) star in a binary system, triggered by the accretion of material from another star, or the merger/collision with a secondary WD. Their phenomenal luminosity -- several billion times that of the sun -- has motivated their use as cosmological distance indicators and led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. SNe Ia are also the main producers of iron and hence play a fundamental role in the chemical evolution of galaxies. While recent observations have confirmed the basic theoretical picture of an exploding C-O WD star whose luminosity is powered by the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, a number of uncertainties remain concerning the nature of the binary companion and the explosion mechanism. Several lines of evidence point towards the existence of multiple progenitor channels in order to explain the full range of the observed diversity. A complete physical understanding of these energetic stellar explosions remains a long-lasting goal of modern astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Network of velocity-coherent filaments formed by supersonic turbulence in a very-high-velocity HI cloud</title>

Abstract: The warm neutral medium (WNM) was thought to be subsonically/transonically turbulent, and it lacks a network of intertwined filaments that are commonly seen in both molecular clouds and cold neutral medium (CNM). Here, we report HI~21 cm line observations of a very-high-velocity (-330 km s$^{-1}$ $&lt;V_{\rm LSR}&lt;$ -250 km s$^{-1}$) cloud (VHVC), using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. For the first time, such a VHVC is clearly revealed to be a supersonic WNM system consisting of a network of velocity-coherent HI~filaments. The filaments are in the forms of slim curves, hubs, and webs, distributed in different layers within the position-position-velocity ({\it ppv}) data cube. The entire cloud has skewed log-normal probability distribution of column density and the filaments themselves show asymmetrical radial density profiles, indicating shock compression by supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, as is also confirmed by our MHD simulation (sonic Mach number $M_{\rm s}=3$ and Alfv\'en Mach number $M_{\rm A}=1$). This work suggests that hierarchical filaments can be established by shocks in a low-density WNM, where gravity is negligible, offering a viable pathway to structure formation in the earliest evolutionary phases of the interstellar medium (ISM).</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Emulation of Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network-based emulators for the inference of stellar parameters and elemental abundances represent an increasingly popular methodology in modern spectroscopic surveys. However, these approaches are often constrained by their emulation precision and domain transfer capabilities. Greater generalizability has previously been achieved only with significantly larger model architectures, as demonstrated by Transformer-based models in natural language processing. This observation aligns with neural scaling laws, where model performance predictably improves with increased model size, computational resources allocated to model training, and training data volume. In this study, we demonstrate that these scaling laws also apply to Transformer-based spectral emulators in astronomy. Building upon our previous work with TransformerPayne and incorporating Maximum Update Parametrization techniques from natural language models, we provide training guidelines for scaling models to achieve optimal performance. Our results show that within the explored parameter space, clear scaling relationships emerge. These findings suggest that optimal computational resource allocation requires balanced scaling. Specifically, given a tenfold increase in training compute, achieving an optimal seven-fold reduction in mean squared error necessitates an approximately 2.5-fold increase in dataset size and a 3.8-fold increase in model size. This study establishes a foundation for developing spectral foundational models with enhanced domain transfer capabilities.</description>
