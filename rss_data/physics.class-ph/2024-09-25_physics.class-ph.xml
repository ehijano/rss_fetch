      <title>The Viscosity of Liquids in the Dual Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reliable model of viscosity in liquids using a dual liquid model framework is developed. The analytical expression arrived at exhibits the correct T-dependence Arrhenius-like. It is compared with the values of viscosity for water with acceptable accuracy and those related to the mechano-thermal effect in liquids under low-frequency shear. It has even been shown that a numerical approach of viscosity in liquids dealt with as dual systems provides good agreement with experimental data. The expression of viscosity shows an explicit dependence upon the sound velocity and the collective vibratory degrees of freedom excited at a given temperature. The terms involved depend upon the Boltzmann and Planck constants. Finally, the physical model is coherent with the postulate of microscopic reversibility as well as with the time's arrow for macroscopic dissipative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetries, closed-form solutions, and conservation laws of a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lie-point symmetry method is used to find some closed-form solutions for a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials. The partial differential equation (PDE), which involves a power law with arbitrary exponent n, was investigated by Mason and his collaborators (Magan et al., Wave Motion, 77, 156-185, 2018). The Lie algebra for the model is five-dimensional for the shearing exponent n &gt; 0, and it includes translations in time, space, and displacement, as well as time-dependent changes in displacement and a scaling symmetry. Several reductions and closed-form solutions for the model are established by utilizing different combinations of Lie symmetries, both for general n and for the specific case where n = 1. Furthermore, it is shown that for general n &gt; 0 the model has interesting conservation laws which are computed with symbolic software using the scaling symmetry of the given PDE.</description>

      <title>Exploring Relativistic World of Electromagnetism on Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is the theoretical structure of electromagnetism that led Einstein to special relativity. To foster an intuitive understanding of relativity's core idea, it is valuable to create a fully special relativistic computer simulation incorporating electromagnetic dynamics. In this paper, we provide a basic formulation for such an implementation. Specifically, the player observes the world via their past light cone and experiences the Lorentz force generated by the electromagnetic field at their spacetime location. The electromagnetic field at any given spacetime point is determined by the sublight-speed motion of individual point charges on the past light cone of that spacetime point.</description>
