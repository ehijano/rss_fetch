      <title>Direct Inversion for the Squared Bessel Process and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new direct inversion method to simulate squared Bessel processes. Since the transition probability of these processes can be represented by a non-central chi-square distribution, we construct an efficient and accurate algorithm to simulate non-central chi-square variables. In this method, the dimension of the squared Bessel process, equivalently the degrees of freedom of the chi-square distribution, is treated as a variable. We therefore use a two-dimensional Chebyshev expansion to approximate the inverse function of the central chi-square distribution with one variable being the degrees of freedom. The method is accurate and efficient for any value of degrees of freedom including the computationally challenging case of small values. One advantage of the method is that noncentral chi-square samples can be generated for a whole range of values of degrees of freedom using the same Chebyshev coefficients. The squared Bessel process is a building block for the well-known Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) processes, which can be generated from squared Bessel processes through time change and linear transformation. Our direct inversion method thus allows the efficient and accurate simulation of these processes, which are used as models in a wide variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Optimization in Financial Data Mining Through Deep Learning and ResNeXt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a multi-task learning framework based on ResNeXt, aiming to solve the problem of feature extraction and task collaborative optimization in financial data mining. Financial data usually has the complex characteristics of high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and time series, and is accompanied by potential correlations between multiple tasks, making it difficult for traditional methods to meet the needs of data mining. This study introduces the ResNeXt model into the multi-task learning framework and makes full use of its group convolution mechanism to achieve efficient extraction of local patterns and global features of financial data. At the same time, through the design of task sharing layers and dedicated layers, it is established between multiple related tasks. Deep collaborative optimization relationships. Through flexible multi-task loss weight design, the model can effectively balance the learning needs of different tasks and improve overall performance. Experiments are conducted on a real S&amp;P 500 financial data set, verifying the significant advantages of the proposed framework in classification and regression tasks. The results indicate that, when compared to other conventional deep learning models, the proposed method delivers superior performance in terms of accuracy, F1 score, root mean square error, and other metrics, highlighting its outstanding effectiveness and robustness in handling complex financial data. This research provides an efficient and adaptable solution for financial data mining, and at the same time opens up a new research direction for the combination of multi-task learning and deep learning, which has important theoretical significance and practical application value.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Startup Success Predictions in Venture Capital: A GraphRAG Augmented Multivariate Time Series Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Venture Capital (VC) industry, predicting the success of startups is challenging due to limited financial data and the need for subjective revenue forecasts. Previous methods based on time series analysis often fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company relationships such as competition and collaboration. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a novel approach using GraphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous models in startup success predictions.</description>
