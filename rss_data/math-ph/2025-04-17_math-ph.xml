      <title>Perturbations vs deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper we define a perturbative (pre-formal) geometry and formulate a theorem on the relation between the construction of a perturbative neighborhood of affine varieties and the higher tangent bundles. In the second part of the paper, we discuss perturbative vector fields and related structures, which are finite-dimensional analogs of perturbation theory characteristics arising in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Beta function without UV divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the beta function in the functorial formulation of two-dimensional quantum field theories (FQFT). A key feature of this approach is the absence of ultraviolet divergences. We show that, nevertheless, in the FQFT perturbation theory, the local observables of deformed theories acquire logarithmic dimension, leading to a conformal anomaly. The beta function arises in the functorial approach as an infinitesimal transformation of the partition function under the variation of the metric's conformal factor, without ultraviolet divergences, UV cutoff, or the traditional renormalization procedure.</description>

      <title>An etude on a renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study renormalization, that is, the procedure for eliminating singularities, for a special model using both combinatorial techniques in the framework of working with formal series, and using a limit transition in a standard multidimensional integral, taking into account the removal of the singular components. Special attention is paid to the comparative analysis of the two views on the problem. It is remarkably that the divergences, which have the same form in one approach, acquire a different nature in another approach and lead to interesting consequences. A special deformation of the spectrum is used as regularization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the $W_{1+\infty}$-n-algebras in the framework of the generalized quantum algebra. We characterize the $\mathcal{R}(p,q)$-multi-variable $W_{1+\infty}$-algebra and derive its $n$-algebra which is the generalized Lie algebra for $n$ even. Furthermore, we investigate the $\mathcal{R}(p,q)$-elliptic hermitian matrix model and determine a toy model for the generalized quantum $W_{\infty}$ constraints. Also, we deduce particular cases of our results.</description>

      <title>Critical exponents at the Nishimori point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07383v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nishimori point of the random bond Ising model is a prototype of renormalization group fixed points with strong disorder. We show that the exact correlation length and crossover critical exponents at this point can be identified in two and three spatial dimensions starting from properties of the Nishimori line. These are the first exact exponents for frustrated random magnets, a circumstance to be also contrasted with the fact that the exact exponents of the Ising model without disorder are not known in three dimensions. Our considerations extend to higher dimensions and models other than Ising.</description>

      <title>The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous work [Van de Moortel, The breakdown of weak null singularities, Duke Mathematical Journal 172 (15), 2957-3012, 2023], we showed that dynamical black holes formed in charged spherical collapse generically feature both a null weakly singular Cauchy horizon and a stronger (presumably spacelike) singularity, confirming a longstanding conjecture in the physics literature. However, this previous result, based on a contradiction argument, did not provide quantitative estimates on the stronger singularity.
  In this study, we adopt a new approach by analyzing local initial data inside the black hole that are consistent with a breakdown of the Cauchy horizon. We prove that the remaining portion is spacelike and obtain sharp spacetime estimates near the null-spacelike transition. Notably, we show that the Kasner exponents of the spacelike portion are positive, in contrast to the well-known Oppenheimer-Snyder model of gravitational collapse. Moreover, these exponents degenerate to (1,0,0) towards the null-spacelike transition.
  Our result provides the first quantitative instances of a null-spacelike singularity transition inside a black hole. In our companion paper, we moreover apply our analysis to carry out the construction of a large class of asymptotically flat one or two-ended black holes featuring coexisting null and spacelike singularities.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-\textbf{$c$} CFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <title>UniqueNESS: Graph Theory Approach to the Uniqueness of Non-Equilibrium Stationary States of the Lindblad Master Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dimensionality of kernels for Lindbladian superoperators is of physical interest in various scenarios out of equilibrium, for example in mean-field methods for driven-dissipative spin lattice models that give rise to phase diagrams with a multitude of non-equilibrium stationary states in specific parameter regions. We show that known criteria established in the literature for unique fixpoints of the Lindblad master equation can be better treated in a graph-theoretic framework via a focus on the connectivity of directed graphs associated to the Hamiltonian and jump operators.</description>

      <title>The Sky as a Killing Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more simplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental perspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper, we propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and generalizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by considering BMS-like symmetries for "asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons", or A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector field satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The construction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of the Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with different dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the results by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing horizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a larger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of "superdilations". We speculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work, including the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general relativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in terms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter spacetime and Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs group and related topics in infrared physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are the extended lecture notes for a minicourse presented at the I S\~ao Paulo School on Gravitational Physics discussing the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group, the group of symmetries at null infinity on asymptotically flat spacetimes. The BMS group has found many applications in classical gravity, quantum field theory in flat and curved spacetimes, and quantum gravity. These notes build the BMS group from its most basic prerequisites (such as group theory, symmetries in differential geometry, and asymptotic flatness) up to modern developments. These include its connections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem, the memory effect, its use to construct Hadamard states in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, and other ideas. Advanced sections briefly discuss the main concepts behind the infrared triangle in electrodynamics, superrotations, and the Dappiaggi--Moretti--Pinamonti group in expanding universes with cosmological horizons (or "asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes"). New contributions by the author concerning asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons are discussed at the end.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic states and operations: a generalized resource theory of coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we focus on the concept of macroscopic states, i.e. coarse representations of microscopic details, defined as states that can be inferred solely from the outcomes of macroscopic measurements. Building on the theories of quantum statistical sufficiency and quantum Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through several equivalent formulations, ranging from algebraic to explicitly constructive. We introduce a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-decreasing operations and develop a resource theory of microscopicity that unifies and generalizes existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, purity, and asymmetry. Finally, we introduce the concept of inferential reference frames and reinterpret macroscopic entropy as a measure of inferential asymmetry, i.e., irretrodictability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a general result of bidifferential calculus and recent results of other authors, a vectorial binary Darboux transformation is derived for the first member of the "negative" part of the potential Kaup-Newell hierarchy, which is a system of two coupled Fokas-Lenells equations. Miura transformations are found from the latter to the first member of the negative part of the AKNS hierarchy and also to its "pseudodual". The reduction to the Fokas-Lenells equation is implemented and exact solutions with a plane wave seed generated.</description>

      <title>A Holomorphic perspective of Strict Deformation Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide and discuss complex analytic methods for overcoming the formal character of formal deformation quantization. This is a necessity for returning to physically meaningful statements, and accounts for the fact that the formal parameter $\hbar$ carries the interpretation of Planck's constant. As formal star products are given by a formal power series, this naturally leads into the realm of holomorphic functions and analytic continuation, both in finite and infinite dimensions. We propose a general notion of strict deformation quantization and investigate how one can use established results from complex analysis to think about the resulting objects. Within the main body of the text, the outlined program is then put into practice for strict deformation quantizations of constant Poisson structures on locally convex vector spaces and the strict deformation quantization of canonical mechanics on the cotangent bundle of a Lie group. Numerous auxiliary results, many of which are well-known yet remarkable in their own right, are provided throughout.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue distribution in gaps of the essential spectrum of the Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator $H_{p}=\frac 1p\Delta^{L^p}+V$ on high tensor powers $L^p$ of a Hermitian line bundle $L$ on a Riemannian manifold $X$ of bounded geometry is studied under the assumption of non-degeneracy of the curvature form of $L$. For large $p$, the spectrum of $H_p$ asymptotically coincides with the union of all local Landau levels of the operator at the points of $X$. Moreover, if the union of the local Landau levels over the complement of a compact subset of $X$ has a gap, then the spectrum of $H_{p}$ in the gap is discrete. The main result of the paper is the trace asymptotics formula associated with these eigenvalues. As a consequence, we get a Weyl type asymptotic formula for the eigenvalue counting function.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we develop the author's previous work on the dynamical relationship between determinantal point processes and CAR algebras. Secondly, we present a novel application of the theory of stochastic processes associated with KMS states for CAR algebras and their quasi-free states. Lastly, we propose a unified theory of algebraic constructions and analysis of stationary processes on point configuration spaces with respect to determinantal point processes. As a byproduct, we establish an algebraic derivation of a determinantal formula for space-time correlations of stochastic processes, and we analyze several limiting behaviors of these processes.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Spectrum of the Random String</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the response of a finite string to white noise and obtain the exact time-dependent spectrum. The complete exact solution is obtained, that is, both the transient and steady-state solution. To define the time-varying spectrum we ensemble average the Wigner distribution. We obtain the exact solution by transforming the differential equation for the string into the phase space differential equation of time and frequency and solve it directly. We also obtain the exact solution by an impulse response method which gives a different form of the solution. Also, we obtain the time-dependent variance of the process at each position. Limiting cases for small and large times are obtained. As a special case we obtain the results of van Lear Jr. and Uhlenbeck and Lyon. A numerical example is given and the results plotted.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Poisson and Poisson-supersymmetric sigma models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit and construct new examples of supersymmetric 2D topological sigma models whose target space is a Poisson supermanifold. Inspired by the AKSZ construction of topological field theories, we follow a graded-geometric approach and identify two commuting homological vector fields compatible with the graded symplectic structure, which control the gauge symmetries and the supersymmetries of the sigma models. Exemplifying the general structure, we show that two distinguished cases exist, one being the differential Poisson sigma model constructed before by Arias, Boulanger, Sundell and Torres-Gomez and the other a contravariant differential Poisson sigma model. The new model features nonlinear supersymmetry transformations that are generated by the Poisson structure on the body of the target supermanifold, giving rise to a Poisson supersymmetry. Further examples are characterised by supersymmetry transformations controlled by the anchor map of a Lie algebroid, when this map is invertible, in which case we determine the geometric conditions for invariance under supersymmetry and closure of the supersymmetry algebra. Moreover, we show that the common thread through this type of models is that their supersymmetry-generating vector field is the coadjoint representation up to homotopy of a Lie algebroid.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy of squeezed states in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we derive a closed-form analytic expression for the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between a squeezed state and the vacuum state in a free relativistic massive scalar Quantum Field Theory within wedge regions of Minkowski spacetime. Similarly to the case of coherent states, this relative entropy is proportional to the smeared Pauli-Jordan distribution. Consequently, the Araki-Uhlmann entropy between a squeezed state and the vacuum satisfies all expected properties: it remains positive, increases with the size of the Minkowski region under consideration, and decreases as the mass parameter grows.</description>

      <title>Complex symmetric, self-dual, and Ginibre random matrices: Analytical results for three classes of bulk and edge statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a conjecture about the local bulk statistics of complex eigenvalues has been made based on numerics. It claims that there are only three universality classes, which have all been observed in open chaotic quantum systems. Motivated by these new insights, we compute and compare the expectation values of $k$ pairs of complex conjugate characteristic polynomials in three ensembles of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices representative for the three classes: the well-known complex Ginibre ensemble, complex symmetric and complex self-dual matrices. In the Cartan classification scheme of non-Hermitian random matrices they are labelled as class A, AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$, respectively. Using the technique of Grassmann variables, we derive explicit expressions for a single pair of expected characteristic polynomials for finite as well as infinite matrix dimension. For the latter we consider the global limit as well as zoom into the edge and the bulk of the spectrum, providing new analytical results for classes AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$. For general $k$, we derive the effective Lagrangians corresponding to the non-linear $\sigma$-models in the respective physical systems. Interestingly, they agree for all three ensembles, while the corresponding Goldstone manifolds, over which one has to perform the remaining integrations, are different and equal the three classical compact groups in the bulk. In particular, our analytical results show that these three ensembles have indeed different local bulk and edge spectral statistics, corroborating the conjecture further.</description>

Abstract: We derive the zero order approximation of a charged particle under the influence of a strong magnetic field in a mathematically rigorous manner and clarify in which sense this approximation is valid. We use this to further rigorously derive a displacement formula for the pressure of plasma equilibria and compare our findings to results in the physics literature. The main novelty of our results is a qualitative estimate of the confinement time for optimised plasma equilibria with respect to the gyro frequency. These results are of interest in the context of plasma fusion confinement.</description>

      <title>Currently there are no reasons to doubt the Riemann Hypothesis: The zeta function beyond the realm of computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine published arguments which suggest that the Riemann Hypothesis may not be true. In each case we provide evidence to explain why the claimed argument does not provide a good reason to doubt the Riemann Hypothesis. The evidence we cite involves a mixture of theorems in analytic number theory, theorems in random matrix theory, and illustrative examples involving the characteristic polynomials of random unitary matrices. Similar evidence is provided for four mistaken notions which appear repeatedly in the literature concerning computations of the zeta-function. A fundamental question which underlies some of the arguments is: what does the graph of the Riemann zeta-function look like in a neighborhood of its largest values? We explore that question in detail and provide a survey of results on the relationship between L-functions and the characteristic polynomials of random matrices. We highlight the key role played by the emergent phenomenon of carrier waves, which arise from fluctuations in the density of zeros. The main point of this paper is that it is possible to understand some aspects of the zeta function at large heights, but the computation evidence is misleading.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to give an explicit description of the integrable structure of the Hitchin moduli spaces. This is done by introducing explicit parameterisations for the different strata of the Hitchin moduli spaces, and by adapting the Separation of Variables method from the theory of integrable models to the Hitchin moduli spaces. The resulting description exhibits a clear analogy with Drinfeld's first construction of the geometric Langlands correspondence. It can be seen as a classical limit of a version of Drinfeld's construction which is adapted to the complex number field.</description>

Abstract: Non K\"ahler Calabi Yau theory is a newly developed subject and it arises naturally in mathematical physics and generalized geometry. The relevant geometrics are pluriclosed metrics which are critical points of the generalized Einstein Hilbert action. In this work, we study the critical points of the generalized Einstein Hilbert action and discuss the stability of critical points which are defined as pluriclosed steady solitons. We proved that all Bismut Hermitian Einstein manifolds are linearly stable which generalizes the work from Tian, Zhu, Hall, Murphy and Koiso In addition, all Bismut flat pluriclosed steady solitons with positive Ricci curvature are linearly strictly stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine optimal matchings or transport between two stationary random measures. It covers allocation from the Lebesgue measure to a point process and matching a point process to a regular (shifted) lattice. The main focus of the article is the impact of hyperuniformity (reduced variance fluctuations in point processes) to optimal transport: in dimension 2, we show that the typical matching cost has finite second moment under a mild logarithmic integrability condition on the reduced pair correlation measure, showing that most planar hyperuniform point processes are L2-perturbed lattices. Our method also retrieves known sharp bounds in finite windows for neutral integrable systems such as Poisson processes, and also applies to hyperfluctuating systems. Further, in three dimensions onwards, all point processes with an integrable pair correlation measure are L2-perturbed lattices without requiring hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical model that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we propose the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>

Abstract: We compute the scalar determinants $\det(\Delta+M^{2})$ on the two-dimensional round disks of constant curvature $R=0$, $\mp 2$, for any finite boundary length $\ell$ and mass $M$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions, using the $\zeta$-function prescription. When $M^{2}=\pm q(q+1)$, $q\in\mathbb N$, a simple expression involving only elementary functions and the Euler $\Gamma$ function is found. Applications to two-dimensional Liouville and Jackiw-Teitelboim quantum gravity are presented in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>The geometric Toda equations for noncompact symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper has two purposes. The first is to classify all those versions of the Toda equations which govern the existence of $\tau$-primitive harmonic maps from a surface into a homogeneous space $G/T$ for which $G$ is a noncomplex noncompact simple real Lie group, $\tau$ is the Coxeter automorphism which Drinfel'd \&amp; Sokolov assigned to each affine Dynkin diagram, and $T$ is the compact torus fixed pointwise by $\tau$. Here $\tau$ may be either an inner or an outer automorphism. We interpret the Toda equations over a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ as equations for a metric on a holomorphic principal $T^\mathbb{C}$-bundle $Q^\mathbb{C}$ over $\Sigma$ whose Chern connection, when combined with holomorphic field $\varphi$, produces a $G$-connection which is flat precisely when the Toda equations hold. The second purpose is to establish when stability criteria for the pair $(Q^\mathbb{C},\varphi)$ can be used to prove the existence of solutions. We classify those real forms of the Toda equations for which this pair is a principal pair and we call these \emph{totally noncompact} Toda pairs: stability theory then gives algebraic conditions for the existence of solutions. Every solution to the geometric Toda equations has a corresponding $G$-Higgs bundle. We explain how to construct this $G$-Higgs bundle directly from the Toda pair and show that Baraglia's cyclic Higgs bundles arise from a very special case of totally noncompact cyclic Toda pairs.</description>

      <title>Heat flow in a periodically forced, unpinned thermostatted chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the hydrodynamic limit for a one-dimensional harmonic chain of interacting atoms with a random flip of the momentum sign. The system is open: at the left boundary it is attached to a heat bath at temperature $T_-$, while at the right endpoint it is subject to an action of a force which reads as $\bar F + \frac 1{\sqrt n} \widetilde{\mathcal F} (n^2 t)$, where $\bar F \ge0$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal F}(t)$ is a periodic function. Here $n$ is the size of the microscopic system. Under a diffusive scaling of space-time, we prove that the empirical profiles of the two locally conserved quantities - the volume stretch and the energy - converge, as $n\to+\infty$, to the solution of a non-linear diffusive system of conservative partial differential equations with a Dirichlet type and Neumann boundary conditions on the left and the right endpoints, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unital associative algebra ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$, having $q$ and $k$ as complex parameters, generated by the elements $K^\pm_m$ ($\pm m\geq 0$), $T_m$ ($m\in \mathbb{Z}$), and $G^\pm_m$ ($m\in \mathbb{Z}+{1\over 2}$ in the Neveu-Schwarz sector, $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ in the Ramond sector), satisfying relations which are at most quartic. Calculations of some low-lying Kac determinants are made, providing us with a conjecture for the factorization property of the Kac determinants. The analysis of the screening operators gives a supporting evidence for our conjecture. It is shown that by taking the limit $q\rightarrow 1$ of ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$ we recover the ordinary ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal algebra. We also give a nontrivial Heisenberg representation of the algebra ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$, making a twist of the $U(1)$ boson in the Wakimoto representation of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$, which naturally follows from the construction of ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$ by gluing the deformed $Y$-algebras of Gaiotto and Rap$\check{\mathrm{c}}$\'{a}k.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider corotational wave maps from Minkowski spacetime into the sphere and the equivariant Yang-Mills equation for all energy-supercritical dimensions. Both models have explicit self-similar finite time blowup solutions, which continue to exist even past the singularity. We prove the nonlinear asymptotic stability of these solutions in spacetime regions that approach the future light cone of the singularity. For this, we develop a general functional analytic framework in adapted similarity coordinates that allows to evolve the stable wave flow near a self-similar blowup solution in such spacetime regions.</description>

      <title>Supercritical Fokker-Planck equations for consensus dynamics: large-time behaviour and weighted Nash-type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the main properties of the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation characterized by a variable diffusion coefficient and a polynomial superlinear drift, modeling the formation of consensus in a large interacting system of individuals. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived from the kinetic description of the dynamics of a quantum particle system, and in presence of a high nonlinearity in the drift operator, mimicking the effects of the mass in the alignment forces, allows for steady states similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate. The main feature of this Fokker-Planck equation is the presence of a variable diffusion coefficient, a nonlinear drift and boundaries, which introduce new challenging mathematical problems in the study of its long-time behavior. In particular, propagation of regularity is shown as a consequence of new weighted Nash and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities.</description>

      <title>Global Well-posedness and Long-time Behavior of the General Ericksen--Leslie System in 2D under a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global well-posedness and long-time behavior of the two-dimensional general Ericksen--Leslie system for a nematic liquid crystal in a constant magnetic field. The PDE system consists of Navier--Stokes equations and the harmonic heat flow equation for the orientations of liquid crystal molecules. For incompressible nematic liquid crystal fluids with either isotropic or anisotropic properties in torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, we derive the global well-posedness of strong solutions through higher-order energy estimates combined with compactness methods and acquire the long-time behavior of the solutions by using the \L ojasiewicz--Simon inequality after obtaining the boundedness of the nematic liquid crystal molecules' angle.</description>

      <title>The Higher Structure of Symmetries of Axion-Maxwell Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized symmetries of quantum field theories can be characterized by topological defects/operators organized into a higher category. In this paper we consider the Axion-Maxwell field theory in four dimensions and, building on the construction of its topological defects by Choi, Lam, Shao, Hidaka, Nitta and Yokokura, we discuss field theoretical methods to compute some aspects of the higher structure of such category. In particular, we determine explicitly the generalized F-symbols for the non-invertible electric 1-form symmetry of the theory. Along the way, we clarify various aspects of the bottom-up worldvolume approach towards the calculus of defects.</description>

      <title>A gradient model for the Bernstein polynomial basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a symmetric, gradient exclusion process within the class of non-cooperative kinetically constrained lattice gases, modelling a non-linear diffusivity in which the exchange of occupation values between two neighbouring sites depends on the local density in specific boxes surrounding the pair. The existence of such a model satisfying the gradient property is the main novelty of this work, filling a gap in the literature regarding the types of diffusivities attainable within this class of models. The resulting dynamics exhibits similarities with the Bernstein polynomial basis and generalises the Porous Media Model. We also introduce an auxiliary collection of processes, which extend the Porous Media Model in a different direction and are related to the former process via an inversion formula.</description>

      <title>Free Convolution and Generalized Dyson Brownian Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenvalue spectrum of the sum of large random matrices that are mutually "free", i.e., randomly rotated, can be obtained using the formalism of R-transforms, with many applications in different fields. We provide a direct interpretation of the otherwise abstract additivity property of R-transforms for the sum in terms of a dynamical evolution of "particles" (the eigenvalues), interacting through two-body and higher-body forces and subject to a Gaussian noise, generalizing the usual Dyson Brownian motion with Coulomb interaction. Interestingly, the appearance of an outlier outside of the bulk of the spectrum is signalled by a divergence of the "velocity" of the generalized Dyson motion. We extend our result to products of free matrices.</description>

      <title>pyBoLaNO: A Python symbolic package for normal ordering involving bosonic ladder operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present pyBoLaNO, a Python symbolic package based on SymPy to quickly normal-order (Wick-order) any polynomial in bosonic ladder operators. By extension, this package offers the normal ordering of commutators of any two polynomials in bosonic ladder operators and the evaluation of the normal-ordered expectation value evolution in the Lindblad master equation framework for open quantum systems. The package also supports multipartite descriptions and multiprocessing. We describe the package's workflow, show examples of use, and discuss its computational performance. All codes and examples are available on our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Soliton Resonances in Four Dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two kinds of resonance soliton solutions on the Ultrahyperbolic space $\mathbb{U}$ for the G=U(2) Yang equation, which is equivalent to the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills (ASDYM) equation. We reveal and illustrate the solitonic behaviors in the four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW$_4$) model through the sigma model action densities. The Yang equation is the equation of motion of the WZW$_4$ model. In the case of $\mathbb{U}$, the WZW$_4$ model describes a string field theory action of open N=2 string theories. Hence, our solutions on $\mathbb{U}$ suggest the existence of the corresponding classical objects in the N=2 string theories. Our solutions include multiple-pole solutions and V-shape soliton solutions. The V-shape solitons suggest annihilation and creation processes of two solitons and would be building blocks to classify the ASDYM solitons, like the role of Y-shape solitons in classification of the KP (line) solitons.
  We also clarify the relationship between the Cauchy matrix approach and the binary Darboux transformation in terms of quasideterminants. Our formalism can start with a simpler input data for the soliton solutions and hence might give a suitable framework for the classification of the ASDYM solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the scattering of particles by a sandwich gravitational wave generated during a flyby using an analytical approach. The derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking is approximated by the hyperbolic scarf potential, which allows for an exact analytic solution via the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our results confirm the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev about certain ``magical" amplitudes of the potential.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>
