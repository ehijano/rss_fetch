      <title>p-Hacking Inflates Type I Error Rates in the Error Statistical Approach but not in the Formal Inference Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: p-hacking occurs when researchers conduct multiple significance tests (e.g., p1;H0,1 and p2;H0,2) and then selectively report tests that yield desirable (usually significant) results (e.g., p2 &lt; 0.05;H0,2) without correcting for multiple testing (e.g., 0.05/2 = 0.025). In the present article, I consider p-hacking in the context of two philosophies of significance testing - the error statistical approach and the formal inference approach. I argue that although p-hacking inflates Type I error rates in the error statistical approach, it does not inflate them in the formal inference approach. Specifically, in the error statistical approach, the "actual" familywise error rate (e.g., 1 - [1 - 0.05]2 = 0.098 for two tests) is relevant because it covers both the selectively reported and unreported tests in the "actual" test procedure (i.e., p1;H0,1 and p2;H0,2). In this approach, Type I error rate inflation occurs because the "actual" error rate (0.098) is higher than the nominal error rate (0.05). In contrast, in the formal inference approach, the "actual" familywise error rate is irrelevant because (a) the researcher does not report a statistical inference about the corresponding intersection null hypothesis (i.e., H0,1 intersect H0,2), and (b) the "actual" familywise error rate does not license inferences about the reported individual hypotheses (i.e., H0,2). Instead, in the formal inference approach, only the nominal error rate is relevant, and a comparison with the "actual" error rate is inappropriate. Implications for conceptualizing, demonstrating, and reducing p-hacking are discussed.</description>

      <title>Teachable normal approximations to binomial and related probabilities or confidence bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the usual normal approximations to binomial, hypergeometric, or Poisson interval probabilities, we collect some simple but then reasonably sharp error bounds. For the Clopper-Pearson~(1934) binomial confidence bounds, we present, following Michael Short's~(2023) approach, bounds similar to, but necessarily more complicated than, Lagrange's (1776) success rate plus/minus normal quantile times estimated standard deviation.
  The bounds, as presented here in four theorems, should be teachable, to people ranging from sufficiently advanced high school pupils to university students in mathematics or statistics: For understanding most of the proposed approximation results, it should suffice to know binomial laws, their means and variances, and the standard normal distribution function, but not necessarily the concept of a corresponding normal random variable.
  Accompanying technical remarks, references, and proofs are meant for assuring teachers or for stimulating further research.
  Of the proposed approximations, some are essentially well-known at least to experts, and some are based on teaching experience and research at Trier University.</description>
