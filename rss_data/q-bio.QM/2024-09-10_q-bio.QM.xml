      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the drug discovery and development field marks a significant paradigm shift, offering novel methodologies for understanding disease mechanisms, facilitating drug discovery, and optimizing clinical trial processes. This review highlights the expanding role of LLMs in revolutionizing various stages of the drug development pipeline. We investigate how these advanced computational models can uncover target-disease linkage, interpret complex biomedical data, enhance drug molecule design, predict drug efficacy and safety profiles, and facilitate clinical trial processes. Our paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview for researchers and practitioners in computational biology, pharmacology, and AI4Science by offering insights into the potential transformative impact of LLMs on drug discovery and development.</description>

      <title>Protein sequence classification using natural language processing techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins are essential to numerous biological functions, with their sequences determining their roles within organisms. Traditional methods for determining protein function are time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study addresses the increasing demand for precise, effective, and automated protein sequence classification methods by employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques on a dataset comprising 75 target protein classes. We explored various machine learning and deep learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multinomial Na\"ive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Voting and Stacking classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and transformer models (BertForSequenceClassification, DistilBERT, and ProtBert). Experiments were conducted using amino acid ranges of 1-4 grams for machine learning models and different sequence lengths for CNN and LSTM models. The KNN algorithm performed best on tri-gram data with 70.0% accuracy and a macro F1 score of 63.0%. The Voting classifier achieved best performance with 74.0% accuracy and an F1 score of 65.0%, while the Stacking classifier reached 75.0% accuracy and an F1 score of 64.0%. ProtBert demonstrated the highest performance among transformer models, with a accuracy 76.0% and F1 score 61.0% which is same for all three transformer models. Advanced NLP techniques, particularly ensemble methods and transformer models, show great potential in protein classification. Our results demonstrate that ensemble methods, particularly Voting Soft classifiers, achieved superior results, highlighting the importance of sufficient training data and addressing sequence similarity across different classes.</description>

      <title>How hosts and pathogens choose the strengths of defense and counter-defense. A game-theoretical view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Host-pathogen interactions consist of an attack by the pathogen, frequently a defense by the host and possibly a counter-defense by the pathogen. Here, we present a game-theoretical approach to describing such interactions. We consider a game where the host and pathogen are players and they can choose between the strategies of defense (or counter-defense) and no response. Specifically, they may or may not produce a toxin and an enzyme degrading the toxin, respectively. We consider that the host and pathogen must also incur a cost for toxin or enzyme production. We highlight both the sequential and non-sequential versions of the game and determine the Nash equilibria. Further, we resolve a paradox occurring in that interplay. If the inactivating enzyme is very efficient, producing the toxin becomes useless, leading to the enzyme being no longer required. Then, production of the defense becomes useful again. In game theory, such situations can be described by a generalized matching pennies game. As a novel result, we find under which conditions the defense cycle leads to a steady state or to an oscillation. We obtain, for saturating dose-response kinetics and considering monotonic cost functions, 'partial (counter-)defense' strategies as pure Nash equilibria. This implies that producing a moderate amount of toxin and enzyme is the best choice.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Transformers for Molecule Property Prediction on Small-scale Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) serves as a protective barrier that separates the brain from the circulatory system, regulating the passage of substances into the central nervous system. Assessing the BBB permeability of potential drugs is crucial for effective drug targeting. However, traditional experimental methods for measuring BBB permeability are challenging and impractical for large-scale screening. Consequently, there is a need to develop computational approaches to predict BBB permeability. This paper proposes a GPS Transformer architecture augmented with Self Attention, designed to perform well in the low-data regime. The proposed approach achieved a state-of-the-art performance on the BBB permeability prediction task using the BBBP dataset, surpassing existing models. With a ROC-AUC of 78.8%, the approach sets a state-of-the-art by 5.5%. We demonstrate that standard Self Attention coupled with GPS transformer performs better than other variants of attention coupled with GPS Transformer.</description>

      <title>Focusing Viral Risk Ranking Tool on Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing to rapidly respond to emerging infectious diseases is becoming ever more critical. "SpillOver: Viral Risk Ranking" is an open-source tool developed to evaluate novel wildlife-origin viruses for their risk of spillover from animals to humans and their risk of spreading in human populations. However, several of the factors used in the risk assessment are dependent on evidence of previous zoonotic spillover and/or sustained transmission in humans. Therefore, we performed a reanalysis of the "Ranking Comparison" after removing eight factors that require post-spillover knowledge and compared the adjusted risk rankings to the originals. The top 10 viruses as ranked by their adjusted scores also had very high original scores. However, the predictive power of the tool for whether a virus was a human virus or not as classified in the Spillover database deteriorated when these eight factors were removed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) for the original score, 0.94, decreased to 0.73 for the adjusted scores. Furthermore, we compared the mean and standard deviation of the human and non-human viruses at the factor level. Most of the excluded spillover-dependent factors had dissimilar means between the human and non-human virus groups compared to the non-spillover dependent factors, which frequently demonstrated similar means between the two groups with some exceptions. We concluded that the original formulation of the tool depended heavily on spillover-dependent factors to "predict" the risk of zoonotic spillover for a novel virus. Future iterations of the tool should take into consideration other non-spillover dependent factors and omit those that are spillover-dependent to ensure the tool is fit for purpose.</description>

      <title>Microsimulation Estimates of Decision Uncertainty and Value of Information Are Biased but Consistent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual-level state-transition microsimulations (iSTMs) have proliferated for economic evaluations in place of cohort state transition models (cSTMs). Probabilistic economic evaluations quantify decision uncertainty and value of information (VOI). Prior studies show that iSTMs provide unbiased estimates of expected incremental net monetary benefits (EINMB), but statistical properties of their estimates of decision uncertainty and VOI are uncharacterized. We compare such iSTMs-produced estimates to corresponding cSTMs. For a 2-alternative decision and normally distributed incremental costs and benefits, we derive analytical expressions for the probability of being cost-effective and the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) for cSTMs and iSTMs, accounting for correlations in incremental outcomes at the population and individual levels. Numerical simulations illustrate our findings and explore relaxation of normality assumptions or having &gt;2 decision alternatives. iSTM estimates of decision uncertainty and VOI are biased but asymptotically consistent (i.e., bias-&gt;0 as number of microsimulated individuals-&gt;infinity). Decision uncertainty depends on one tail of the INMB distribution (e.g., P(INMB&lt;=0)) which depends on estimated variance (larger with iSTMs given first-order noise). While iSTMs overestimate EVPI, their direction of bias for the probability of being cost-effective is ambiguous. Bias is larger when uncertainties in incremental costs and effects are negatively correlated. While more samples at the population uncertainty level are interchangeable with more microsimulations for estimating EINMB, minimizing iSTM bias in estimating decision uncertainty and VOI depends on sufficient microsimulations. Analysts should account for this when allocating their computational budgets and, at minimum, characterize such bias in their reported results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian estimation of transmission networks for infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing transmission networks is essential for identifying key factors like superspreaders and high-risk locations, which are critical for developing effective pandemic prevention strategies. In this study, we developed a Bayesian framework that integrates genomic and temporal data to reconstruct transmission networks for infectious diseases. The Bayesian transmission model accounts for the latent period and differentiates between symptom onset and actual infection time, enhancing the accuracy of transmission dynamics and epidemiological models. Additionally, the model allows for the transmission of multiple pathogen lineages, reflecting the complexity of real-world transmission events more accurately than models that assume a single lineage transmission. Simulation results show that the Bayesian model reliably estimates both the model parameters and the transmission network. Moreover, hypothesis testing effectively identifies direct transmission events. This approach highlights the crucial role of genetic data in reconstructing transmission networks and understanding the origins and transmission dynamics of infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Outlier Removal in Cryo-EM via Radial Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of particle picking, a crucial step in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) image analysis, often encounters challenges due to outliers, leading to inaccuracies in downstream processing. In response to this challenge, this research introduces an additional automated step to reduce the number of outliers identified by the particle picker. The proposed method enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of particle picking, thereby reducing the overall running time and the necessity for expert intervention in the process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating outlier inclusion and its potential to enhance cryo-EM data analysis pipelines significantly. This work contributes to the ongoing advancement of automated cryo-EM image processing methods, offering novel insights and solutions to challenges in structural biology research.</description>

      <title>signDNE: A python package for ariaDNE and its sign-oriented extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in evolutionary biology is to develop robust computational tools that can accurately analyze shape variations across diverse anatomical structures. The Dirichlet Normal Energy (DNE) is a shape complexity metric that addresses this by summarizing the local curvature of surfaces, particularly aiding the analytical studies and providing insights into evolutionary and functional adaptations. Building on the DNE concept, we introduce a Python-based implementation, designed to compute both the original DNE and a newly developed sign-oriented DNE metric. This Python package includes a user-friendly command line interface (CLI) and built-in visualization tools to facilitate the interpretation of the surface's local curvature properties. The addition of signDNE, which integrates the convexity and concavity of surfaces, enhances the tool's ability to identify fine-scale features across a broad range of biological structures. We validate the robustness of our method by comparing its performance with standard implementations on a dataset of triangular meshes with varying discrete representations. Additionally, we demonstrate its potential applications through visualization of the local curvature field (i.e., local curvature value over the surface) on various biological specimens, showing how it effectively captures complex biological features. In this paper, we offer a brief overview of the Python CLI for ease of use. Alongside the Python implementation, we have also updated the original MATLAB package to ensure consistent and accurate DNE computation across platforms. These improvements enhance the tool's flexibility, reduce sensitivity to sampling density and mesh quality, and support a more accurate interpretation of biological surface topography.</description>

      <title>Multilevel testing of constraints induced by structural equation modeling in fMRI effective connectivity analysis: A proof of concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In functional MRI (fMRI), effective connectivity analysis aims at inferring the causal influences that brain regions exert on one another. A common method for this type of analysis is structural equation modeling (SEM). We here propose a novel method to test the validity of a given model of structural equation. Given a structural model in the form of a directed graph, the method extracts the set of all constraints of conditional independence induced by the absence of links between pairs of regions in the model and tests for their validity in a Bayesian framework, either individually (constraint by constraint), jointly (e.g., by gathering all constraints associated with a given missing link), or globally (i.e., all constraints associated with the structural model). This approach has two main advantages. First, it only tests what is testable from observational data and does allow for false causal interpretation. Second, it makes it possible to test each constraint (or group of constraints) separately and, therefore, quantify in what measure each constraint (or, e..g., missing link) is respected in the data. We validate our approach using a simulation study and illustrate its potential benefits through the reanalysis of published data.</description>

      <title>A physical perspective on lithium therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium salts have strong medical properties in neurological disorders such as bipolar disorder and primary headaches, and has recently gathered attention due to its preventive effect on viral attacks. Though the therapeutic effect of lithium was documented by Cade already in the late 1940s, the underlying mechanism of action is still disputed. Acute lithium exposure has an activating effect on excitable organic tissue and organisms, and is highly toxic. The therapeutic effect is achieved through long-term exposure to lower doses, where it, opposite to acute doses, alleviates excessive cellular activity, and induces a strong metabolic response in the organism, with large changes in phospholipid and cholesterol expression.
  This review investigates how lithium ions affect membrane composition and function, and how lithium response might in fact be the body's attempt to counteract the physical presence of lithium ions at cell level. The presence of lithium ions strongly affects lipid conformation and membrane phase unlike other alkali ions, with consequences for membrane permeability, buffer property and excitability, and ideas for further research in microbiology and drug development are discussed.</description>

      <title>CRADLE-VAE: Enhancing Single-Cell Gene Perturbation Modeling with Counterfactual Reasoning-based Artifact Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05484v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to various perturbations is a critical focus in drug discovery and personalized therapeutics, with deep learning models playing a significant role in this endeavor. Single-cell datasets contain technical artifacts that may hinder the predictability of such models, which poses quality control issues highly regarded in this area. To address this, we propose CRADLE-VAE, a causal generative framework tailored for single-cell gene perturbation modeling, enhanced with counterfactual reasoning-based artifact disentanglement. Throughout training, CRADLE-VAE models the underlying latent distribution of technical artifacts and perturbation effects present in single-cell datasets. It employs counterfactual reasoning to effectively disentangle such artifacts by modulating the latent basal spaces and learns robust features for generating cellular response data with improved quality. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves not only treatment effect estimation performance but also generative quality as well. The CRADLE-VAE codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/CRADLE-VAE.</description>

      <title>Improving Antibody Design with Force-Guided Sampling in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antibodies, crucial for immune defense, primarily rely on complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) to bind and neutralize antigens, such as viruses. The design of these CDRs determines the antibody's affinity and specificity towards its target. Generative models, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have shown potential to advance the structure-based design of CDR regions. However, only a limited dataset of bound antibody-antigen structures is available, and generalization to out-of-distribution interfaces remains a challenge. Physics based force-fields, which approximate atomic interactions, offer a coarse but universal source of information to better mold designs to target interfaces. Integrating this foundational information into diffusion models is, therefore, highly desirable. Here, we propose a novel approach to enhance the sampling process of diffusion models by integrating force field energy-based feedback. Our model, DiffForce, employs forces to guide the diffusion sampling process, effectively blending the two distributions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method guides the model to sample CDRs with lower energy, enhancing both the structure and sequence of the generated antibodies.</description>
