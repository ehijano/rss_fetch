      <title>Application of Natural Language Processing in Financial Risk Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in financial risk detection. By constructing an NLP-based financial risk detection model, this study aims to identify and predict potential risks in financial documents and communications. First, the fundamental concepts of NLP and its theoretical foundation, including text mining methods, NLP model design principles, and machine learning algorithms, are introduced. Second, the process of text data preprocessing and feature extraction is described. Finally, the effectiveness and predictive performance of the model are validated through empirical research. The results show that the NLP-based financial risk detection model performs excellently in risk identification and prediction, providing effective risk management tools for financial institutions. This study offers valuable references for the field of financial risk management, utilizing advanced NLP techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial risk detection.</description>

      <title>Semi-parametric financial risk forecasting incorporating multiple realized measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A semi-parametric joint Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) forecasting framework employing multiple realized measures is developed. The proposed framework extends the realized exponential GARCH model to be semi-parametrically estimated, via a joint loss function, whilst extending existing quantile time series models to incorporate multiple realized measures. A quasi-likelihood is built, employing the asymmetric Laplace distribution that is directly linked to a joint loss function, which enables Bayesian inference for the proposed model. An adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used for the model estimation. The empirical section evaluates the performance of the proposed framework with six stock markets from January 2000 to June 2022, covering the period of COVID-19. Three realized measures, including 5- minute realized variance, bi-power variation, and realized kernel, are incorporated and evaluated in the proposed framework. One-step-ahead VaR and ES forecasting results of the proposed model are compared to a range of parametric and semi-parametric models, lending support to the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>
