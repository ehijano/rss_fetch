      <title>Reduced kinetic modelling of shattered pellet injection in ASDEX Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-terminating disruptions represent a critical outstanding issue for reactor-relevant tokamaks. ITER will use shattered pellet injection (SPI) as its disruption mitigation system to reduce heat loads, vessel forces, and to suppress the formation of runaway electrons. In this paper we demonstrate that reduced kinetic modelling of SPI is capable of capturing the major experimental trends in ASDEX Upgrade SPI experiments, such as dependence of the radiated energy fraction on neon content, or the current quench dynamics. Simulations are also consistent with the experimental observation of no runaway electron generation with neon and mixed deuterium-neon pellet composition. We also show that statistical variations in the fragmentation process only have a notable impact on disruption dynamics at intermediate neon doping, as was observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Amplifier scheme: driven by indirect-drive under 10 MJ laser toward inertial fusion energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burn efficiency is a key for commercial feasibility of fusion power station for inertial fusion energy, while burn efficiency is usually lower than 30% in the central ignition scheme of inertial confinement fusion (ICF). A recent conceptual design for a 10 MJ laser driver [Z. Sui and K. Lan et al., Matter Radiat. Extremes 9, 043002 (2024)] provides a new room for target design to achieve a higher burn efficiency. Here, we take the advantage of fuel density in reaction rate and propose a novel amplifier scheme for increasing burn efficiency via two cascading explosions by ICF. The amplifier scheme can be realized either by indirect-drive or by direct-drive. Here, we give a 1D design for an indirect-driven amplifier capsule containing 2.02 mg DT fuel under a 300 eV radiation generated by a 10 MJ and 1785 TW laser inside an octahedral spherical hohlraum. As a result, the amplifier capsule has a burn efficiency of 48% and a gain of 33 at a convergence ratio of 24. This novel scheme can achieve a relatively high burn efficiency at a relatively low convergence ratio, which can greatly relax the stringent requirements of high gain fusion on hot spot ignition conditions and engineering issues.</description>

      <title>Lectures on Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Presented here is a transcription of the lecture notes from Professor Allan N. Kaufman's graduate statistical mechanics course at Berkeley from the 1972-1973 academic year. Part 1 addresses equilibrium statistical mechanics with topics: fundamentals, classical fluids and other systems, chemical equilibrium, and long-range interactions. Part 2 addresses non-equilibrium statistical mechanics with topics: fundamentals, Brownian motion, Liouville and Klimontovich equations, Landau equation, Markov processes and Fokker-Planck equation, linear response and transport theory, and an introduction to non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics.</description>
