      <title>Three-Dimensional Spin TFTs from Gauging Line Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the input of an oriented three-dimensional TFT with framed line defects and a commutative $\Delta$-separable Frobenius algebra $A$ in the ribbon category of these line defects, we construct a three-dimensional spin TFT. The framed line defects of the spin TFT are labelled by certain equivariant modules over $A$, and the spin structure may or may not extend to a given line defect. Physically the spin TFT can be interpreted as the result of gauging a one-form symmetry in the original oriented TFT. This spin TFT extends earlier constructions in Blanchet-Masbaum (1996) and Blanchet (2005) [arXiv:math/0303240], and it reproduces the classification of abelian spin Chern-Simons theories in Belov-Moore (2005) [arXiv:hep-th/0505235].</description>

      <title>On torsion in the Kauffman bracket skein module of $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Kirby problems 1.92(E)-(G), which, roughly speaking, ask for which compact oriented $3$-manifold $M$ the Kauffman bracket skein module $\mathcal{S}(M)$ has torsion as a $\mathbb{Z}[A^{\pm 1}]$-module. We give new criteria for the presence of torsion in terms of how large the $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$-character variety of $M$ is. This gives many counterexamples to question 1.92(G)-(i) in Kirby's list. For manifolds with incompressible tori, we give new effective criteria for the presence of torsion, revisiting the work of Przytycki and Veve. We also show that $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R P}^3# L(p,1))$ has torsion when $p$ is even. Finally, we show that for $M$ an oriented Seifert manifold, closed or with boundary, $\mathcal{S}(M)$ has torsion if and only if $M$ admits a $2$-sided non-boundary parallel essential surface.</description>

      <title>Transverse surfaces and pseudo-Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\varphi$ be a transitive pseudo-Anosov flow on an oriented, compact $3$-manifold $M$, possibly with toral boundary. We characterize the surfaces in $M$ that are (almost) transverse to $\phi$. When $\varphi$ has no perfect fits (e.g. $\varphi$ is the suspension flow of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism), we prove that any Thurston-norm minimizing surface $S$ that pairs nonnegatively with the closed orbits of $\varphi$ is almost transverse to $\varphi$, up to isotopy. This answers a question of Cooper--Long--Reid. Our main tool is a correspondence between surfaces that are almost transverse to $\varphi$ and those that are relatively carried by any associated veering triangulation. The correspondence also allows us to investigate the uniqueness of almost transverse position, to extend Mosher's Transverse Surface Theorem to the case with boundary, and more generally to characterize when relative homology classes represent Birkhoff surfaces.</description>

      <title>Average signature and 4-genus of 2-bridge knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the average or expected absolute value of the signatures of all 2-bridge knots with crossing number $c$ approaches $\sqrt{{2c}/{\pi}}$. Baader, Kjuchukova, Lewark, Misev, and Ray consider a model for 2-bridge knot diagrams indexed by diagrammatic crossing number $n$ and show that the average 4-genus is sublinear in $n$. We build upon this result in two ways to obtain an upper bound for the average 4-genus of a 2-bridge knot: our model is indexed by crossing number $c$ and gives a specific sublinear upper bound of $9.75c/\log c$.</description>

      <title>Degenerations of k-positive surface group representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.05983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{k-positive representations}, a large class of $\{1,\ldots,k\}$--Anosov surface group representations into PGL(E) that share many features with Hitchin representations, and we study their degenerations: unless they are Hitchin, they can be deformed to non-discrete representations, but any limit is at least (k-3)-positive and irreducible limits are (k-1)-positive. A major ingredient, of independent interest, is a general limit theorem for positively ratioed representations.</description>

      <title>On the nonorientable four-ball genus of torus knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.09187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonorientable four-ball genus of a knot $K$ in $S^3$ is the minimal first Betti number of nonorientable surfaces in $B^4$ bounded by $K$. By amalgamating ideas from involutive knot Floer homology and unoriented knot Floer homology, we give a new lower bound on the smooth nonorientable four-ball genus $\gamma_4$ of any knot. This bound is sharp for several families of torus knots, including $T_{4n,(2n\pm 1)^2}$ for even $n\ge 2$, a family Longo showed were counterexamples to Batson's conjecture. We also prove that, whenever $p$ is an even positive integer and $\frac{p}{2}$ is not a perfect square, the torus knot $T_{p,q}$ does not bound a locally flat M\"obius band for almost all integers $q$ relatively prime to $p$.</description>

      <title>The Dijkgraaf-Witten invariant is a partial case of the photography method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{ManturovNikonovMay2023,ManturovWanMay2023} the author discovered a very general principle (called {\em the photography principle}) which allows one: a) To solve various equations (like pentagon equation) b) To construct invariants of manifolds. The advantage of that principle is that it deals with a very general notion of {\em data} and {\em data transmission} which may be of any kind. In the present paper, we show that the definition of the Dijkgraaf-Witten invariants of manifolds can be thought of as an evidence of the above principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18249v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach for identifying spaces of stability conditions of triangulated categories arising from weighted marked surfaces with moduli spaces of quadratic differentials. This approach is based on the notion of a perverse schober (perverse sheaf of triangulated categories) and their triangulated categories of global sections. Under suitable conditions on the perverse schober, we identify mixed-angulations and their flips with finite-length hearts and their tilts, which then leads to the identification of moduli spaces. As an application we obtain a generalization of the results of Bridgeland--Smith to quadratic differentials with arbitrary singularity type (zero/pole/exponential).</description>

      <title>Spectral Distribution of Twisted Laplacian on Typical Hyperbolic Surfaces of High Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral distribution of the twisted Laplacian associated with uniform square-integrable bounded harmonic 1-form on typical hyperbolic surfaces of high genus. First, we estimate the spectral distribution by the supremum norm of the corresponding harmonic form. Subsequently, we show that the square-integrable bounded harmonic form exhibits a small supremum norm for typical hyperbolic surfaces of high genus. Based on these findings, we prove a uniform Weyl law for the distribution of real parts of the spectrum on typical hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Donaldson-Thomas invariants for the Bridgeland-Smith correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Famous work of Bridgeland and Smith shows that certain moduli spaces of quadratic differentials are isomorphic to spaces of stability conditions on particular 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories. This result has subsequently been generalised and extended by several authors. One facet of this correspondence is that finite-length trajectories of the quadratic differential are related to categories of semistable objects of the corresponding stability condition, which have associated Donaldson-Thomas invariants. On the other hand, computations in the physics literature suggest certain values of these invariants according to the type of trajectory. In this paper, we show that the category recently constructed by Christ, Haiden, and Qiu gives Donaldson-Thomas invariants which agree with the predictions from physics; in particular, degenerate ring domains of the quadratic differential give rise to non-zero Donaldson-Thomas invariants. In calculating all of the invariants, we obtain a novel application of string and band techniques from representation theory.</description>

      <title>Epstein Surfaces, $W$-Volume, and the Osgood-Stowe Differential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Epstein introduced the theory of what are now called Epstein surfaces, which construct surfaces in $\mathbb{H}^3$ associated to a conformal metric on a domain in $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$. More recently, these surfaces have been used by Krasnov-Schlenker to define the W-volume and renormalized volume associated with a convex co-compact hyperbolic 3-manifold. In this paper we consider Epstein surfaces, W-volume and renormalized volume in two main parts. In the first, we develop an alternate construction of Epstein surfaces using the Osgood-Stowe differential, a generalization of the Schwarzian derivative. Krasnov-Schlenker showed that the metric and shape operator of a surface in hyperbolic space is naturally dual to a conformal metric and shape operator on a projective structure via the hyperbolic Gauss map. We show that this projective shape operator can be derived from the Osgood-Stowe differential. This approach allows us to give a comprehensive and self-contained development of Epstein surfaces, W-volume, and renormalized volume. In the second part, we use the theory developed in the first to prove a number of new results including a generalization of Epstein's univalence criterion, a variational formula for W-volume in terms of the Osgood-Stowe differential, and a use of W-volume to relate the length of the bending lamination of the convex core to the norm of the Schwarzian derivative of the associated univalent map on the conformal boundary.</description>
