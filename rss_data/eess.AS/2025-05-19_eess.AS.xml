      <title>AnalyticKWS: Towards Exemplar-Free Analytic Class Incremental Learning for Small-footprint Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) offers a vital mechanism to identify spoken commands in voice-enabled systems, where user demands often shift, requiring models to learn new keywords continually over time. However, a major problem is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their ability to recognize earlier keywords. Although several continual learning methods have proven their usefulness for reducing forgetting, most existing approaches depend on storing and revisiting old data to combat catastrophic forgetting. Though effective, these methods face two practical challenges: 1) privacy risks from keeping user data and 2) large memory and time consumption that limit deployment on small devices. To address these issues, we propose an exemplar-free Analytic Continual Learning (AnalyticKWS) method that updates model parameters without revisiting earlier data. Inspired by efficient learning principles, AnalyticKWS computes a closed-form analytical solution for model updates and requires only a single epoch of adaptation for incoming keywords. AnalyticKWS demands fewer computational resources by avoiding gradient-based updates and does not store old data. By eliminating the need for back-propagation during incremental learning, the model remains lightweight and efficient. As a result, AnalyticKWS meets the challenges mentioned earlier and suits resource-limited settings well. Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings show that AnalyticKWS consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of SSL Models for Sound Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer powerful representations for sound event detection (SED), yet their synergistic potential remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art SSL models to guide optimal model selection and integration for SED. We propose a framework that combines heterogeneous SSL representations (e.g., BEATs, HuBERT, WavLM) through three fusion strategies: individual SSL embedding integration, dual-modal fusion, and full aggregation. Experiments on the DCASE 2023 Task 4 Challenge reveal that dual-modal fusion (e.g., CRNN+BEATs+WavLM) achieves complementary performance gains, while CRNN+BEATs alone delivers the best results among individual SSL models. We further introduce normalized sound event bounding boxes (nSEBBs), an adaptive post-processing method that dynamically adjusts event boundary predictions, improving PSDS1 by up to 4% for standalone SSL models. These findings highlight the compatibility and complementarity of SSL architectures, providing guidance for task-specific fusion and robust SED system design.</description>

      <title>BINAQUAL: A Full-Reference Objective Localization Similarity Metric for Binaural Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial audio enhances immersion in applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, gaming, and cinema by creating a three-dimensional auditory experience. Ensuring the spatial fidelity of binaural audio is crucial, given that processes such as compression, encoding, or transmission can alter localization cues. While subjective listening tests like MUSHRA remain the gold standard for evaluating spatial localization quality, they are costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces BINAQUAL, a full-reference objective metric designed to assess localization similarity in binaural audio recordings. BINAQUAL adapts the AMBIQUAL metric, originally developed for localization quality assessment in ambisonics audio format to the binaural domain. We evaluate BINAQUAL across five key research questions, examining its sensitivity to variations in sound source locations, angle interpolations, surround speaker layouts, audio degradations, and content diversity. Results demonstrate that BINAQUAL effectively differentiates between subtle spatial variations and correlates strongly with subjective listening tests, making it a reliable metric for binaural localization quality assessment. The proposed metric provides a robust benchmark for ensuring spatial accuracy in binaural audio processing, paving the way for improved objective evaluations in immersive audio applications.</description>

      <title>Shallow Flow Matching for Coarse-to-Fine Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a shallow flow matching (SFM) mechanism to enhance flow matching (FM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models within a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths using coarse output representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow. The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise and focuses computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments show that SFM consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech in both objective and subjective evaluations, while significantly reducing inference when using adaptive-step ODE solvers. Demo and codes are available at https://ydqmkkx.github.io/SFMDemo/.</description>

      <title>Unified Architecture and Unsupervised Speech Disentanglement for Speaker Embedding-Free Enrollment in Personalized Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional speech enhancement (SE) aims to improve speech perception and intelligibility by suppressing noise without requiring enrollment speech as reference, whereas personalized SE (PSE) addresses the cocktail party problem by extracting a target speaker's speech using enrollment speech. While these two tasks tackle different yet complementary challenges in speech signal processing, they often share similar model architectures, with PSE incorporating an additional branch to process enrollment speech. This suggests developing a unified model capable of efficiently handling both SE and PSE tasks, thereby simplifying deployment while maintaining high performance. However, PSE performance is sensitive to variations in enrollment speech, like emotional tone, which limits robustness in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose two novel models, USEF-PNet and DSEF-PNet, both extending our previous SEF-PNet framework. USEF-PNet introduces a unified architecture for processing enrollment speech, integrating SE and PSE into a single framework to enhance performance and streamline deployment. Meanwhile, DSEF-PNet incorporates an unsupervised speech disentanglement approach by pairing a mixture speech with two different enrollment utterances and enforcing consistency in the extracted target speech. This strategy effectively isolates high-quality speaker identity information from enrollment speech, reducing interference from factors such as emotion and content, thereby improving PSE robustness. Additionally, we explore a long-short enrollment pairing (LSEP) strategy to examine the impact of enrollment speech duration during both training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on the Libri2Mix and VoiceBank DEMAND demonstrate that our proposed USEF-PNet, DSEF-PNet all achieve substantial performance improvements, with random enrollment duration performing slightly better.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Field Reconstruction in Tubes via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to inverse problems in acoustic tube analysis, focusing on reconstructing acoustic fields from noisy and limited observation data. Specifically, we address scenarios where the radiation model is unknown, and pressure data is only available at the tube's radiation end. A PINNs framework is proposed to reconstruct the acoustic field, along with the PINN Fine-Tuning Method (PINN-FTM) and a traditional optimization method (TOM) for predicting radiation model coefficients. The results demonstrate that PINNs can effectively reconstruct the tube's acoustic field under noisy conditions, even with unknown radiation parameters. PINN-FTM outperforms TOM by delivering balanced and reliable predictions and exhibiting robust noise-tolerance capabilities.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scalogram for Computational Complexity Reduction in Acoustic Recognition Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an effective tool for feature extraction in acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when applied to non-stationary audio. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge, often leading researchers to prefer alternative methods such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce the computational complexity of CWT by optimizing the length of the wavelet kernel and the hop size of the output scalogram. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the robust performance of the trained model in acoustic recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>MDDM: A Multi-view Discriminative Enhanced Diffusion-based Model for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of deep learning, speech enhancement has been greatly optimized in terms of speech quality. Previous methods typically focus on the discriminative supervised learning or generative modeling, which tends to introduce speech distortions or high computational cost. In this paper, we propose MDDM, a Multi-view Discriminative enhanced Diffusion-based Model. Specifically, we take the features of three domains (time, frequency and noise) as inputs of a discriminative prediction network, generating the preliminary spectrogram. Then, the discriminative output can be converted to clean speech by several inference sampling steps. Due to the intersection of the distributions between discriminative output and clean target, the smaller sampling steps can achieve the competitive performance compared to other diffusion-based methods. Experiments conducted on a public dataset and a realworld dataset validate the effectiveness of MDDM, either on subjective or objective metric.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Knowledge Transfer Learning as Graph Matching Based on Optimal Transport for ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transferring linguistic knowledge from a pretrained language model (PLM) to acoustic feature learning has proven effective in enhancing end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR). However, aligning representations between linguistic and acoustic modalities remains a challenge due to inherent modality gaps. Optimal transport (OT) has shown promise in mitigating these gaps by minimizing the Wasserstein distance (WD) between linguistic and acoustic feature distributions. However, previous OT-based methods overlook structural relationships, treating feature vectors as unordered sets. To address this, we propose Graph Matching Optimal Transport (GM-OT), which models linguistic and acoustic sequences as structured graphs. Nodes represent feature embeddings, while edges capture temporal and sequential relationships. GM-OT minimizes both WD (between nodes) and Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD) (between edges), leading to a fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance (FGWD) formulation. This enables structured alignment and more efficient knowledge transfer compared to existing OT-based approaches. Theoretical analysis further shows that prior OT-based methods in linguistic knowledge transfer can be viewed as a special case within our GM-OT framework. We evaluate GM-OT on Mandarin ASR using a CTC-based E2E-ASR system with a PLM for knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art models, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Universal Semantic Disentangled Privacy-preserving Speech Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of audio recordings of human speech to train LLMs poses privacy concerns due to these models' potential to generate outputs that closely resemble artifacts in the training data. In this study, we propose a speaker privacy-preserving representation learning method through the Universal Speech Codec (USC), a computationally efficient encoder-decoder model that disentangles speech into: $\textit{(i)}$ privacy-preserving semantically rich representations, capturing content and speech paralinguistics, and $\textit{(ii)}$ residual acoustic and speaker representations that enables high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive evaluations presented show that USC's semantic representation preserves content, prosody, and sentiment, while removing potentially identifiable speaker attributes. Combining both representations, USC achieves state-of-the-art speech reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation methodology for measuring privacy-preserving properties, aligning with perceptual tests. We compare USC against other codecs in the literature and demonstrate its effectiveness on privacy-preserving representation learning, illustrating the trade-offs of speaker anonymization, paralinguistics retention and content preservation in the learned semantic representations. Audio samples are shared in $\href{https://www.amazon.science/usc-samples}{https://www.amazon.science/usc-samples}$.</description>

      <title>SAKURA: On the Multi-hop Reasoning of Large Audio-Language Models Based on Speech and Audio Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation. Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks, conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become ubiquitous in everyday applications, yet significant disparities in performance across diverse demographic groups persist. In this work, we introduce the ASR-FAIRBENCH leaderboard which is designed to assess both the accuracy and equity of ASR models in real-time. Leveraging the Meta's Fair-Speech dataset, which captures diverse demographic characteristics, we employ a mixed-effects Poisson regression model to derive an overall fairness score. This score is integrated with traditional metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) to compute the Fairness Adjusted ASR Score (FAAS), providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Our approach reveals significant performance disparities in SOTA ASR models across demographic groups and offers a benchmark to drive the development of more inclusive ASR technologies.</description>

      <title>Automatic Speech Recognition for African Low-Resource Languages: Challenges and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have transformed human-computer interaction; however, low-resource languages in Africa remain significantly underrepresented in both research and practical applications. This study investigates the major challenges hindering the development of ASR systems for these languages, which include data scarcity, linguistic complexity, limited computational resources, acoustic variability, and ethical concerns surrounding bias and privacy. The primary goal is to critically analyze these barriers and identify practical, inclusive strategies to advance ASR technologies within the African context. Recent advances and case studies emphasize promising strategies such as community-driven data collection, self-supervised and multilingual learning, lightweight model architectures, and techniques that prioritize privacy. Evidence from pilot projects involving various African languages showcases the feasibility and impact of customized solutions, which encompass morpheme-based modeling and domain-specific ASR applications in sectors like healthcare and education. The findings highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to tackle the distinct linguistic and infrastructural challenges faced by the continent. This study offers a progressive roadmap for creating ethical, efficient, and inclusive ASR systems that not only safeguard linguistic diversity but also improve digital accessibility and promote socioeconomic participation for speakers of African languages.</description>

      <title>SepPrune: Structured Pruning for Efficient Deep Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although deep learning has substantially advanced speech separation in recent years, most existing studies continue to prioritize separation quality while overlooking computational efficiency, an essential factor for low-latency speech processing in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose SepPrune, the first structured pruning framework specifically designed to compress deep speech separation models and reduce their computational cost. SepPrune begins by analyzing the computational structure of a given model to identify layers with the highest computational burden. It then introduces a differentiable masking strategy to enable gradient-driven channel selection. Based on the learned masks, SepPrune prunes redundant channels and fine-tunes the remaining parameters to recover performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this learnable pruning paradigm yields substantial advantages for channel pruning in speech separation models, outperforming existing methods. Notably, a model pruned with SepPrune can recover 85% of the performance of a pre-trained model (trained over hundreds of epochs) with only one epoch of fine-tuning, and achieves convergence 36$\times$ faster than training from scratch. Code is available at https://github.com/itsnotacie/SepPrune.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant increase in video content creation and consumption. Crafting engaging content requires the careful curation of both visual and audio elements. While visual cue curation, through techniques like optimal viewpoint selection or post-editing, has been central to media production, its natural counterpart, audio, has not undergone equivalent advancements. This often results in a disconnect between visual and acoustic saliency. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: visually-guided acoustic highlighting, which aims to transform audio to deliver appropriate highlighting effects guided by the accompanying video, ultimately creating a more harmonious audio-visual experience. We propose a flexible, transformer-based multimodal framework to solve this task. To train our model, we also introduce a new dataset -- the muddy mix dataset, leveraging the meticulous audio and video crafting found in movies, which provides a form of free supervision. We develop a pseudo-data generation process to simulate poorly mixed audio, mimicking real-world scenarios through a three-step process -- separation, adjustment, and remixing. Our approach consistently outperforms several baselines in both quantitative and subjective evaluation. We also systematically study the impact of different types of contextual guidance and difficulty levels of the dataset. Our project page is here: https://wikichao.github.io/VisAH/.</description>

      <title>WaLRUS: Wavelets for Long-range Representation Using SSMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have proven to be powerful tools for modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. While the recent method known as HiPPO has demonstrated strong performance, and formed the basis for machine learning models S4 and Mamba, it remains limited by its reliance on closed-form solutions for a few specific, well-behaved bases. The SaFARi framework generalized this approach, enabling the construction of SSMs from arbitrary frames, including non-orthogonal and redundant ones, thus allowing an infinite diversity of possible "species" within the SSM family. In this paper, we introduce WaLRUS (Wavelets for Long-range Representation Using SSMs), a new implementation of SaFARi built from Daubechies wavelets.</description>

      <title>BenSParX: A Robust Explainable Machine Learning Framework for Parkinson's Disease Detection from Bengali Conversational Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a growing global health challenge, with Bangladesh experiencing a notable rise in PD-related mortality. Early detection of PD remains particularly challenging in resource-constrained settings, where voice-based analysis has emerged as a promising non-invasive and cost-effective alternative. However, existing studies predominantly focus on English or other major languages; notably, no voice dataset for PD exists for Bengali - posing a significant barrier to culturally inclusive and accessible healthcare solutions. Moreover, most prior studies employed only a narrow set of acoustic features, with limited or no hyperparameter tuning and feature selection strategies, and little attention to model explainability. This restricts the development of a robust and generalizable machine learning model. To address this gap, we present BenSparX, the first Bengali conversational speech dataset for PD detection, along with a robust and explainable machine learning framework tailored for early diagnosis. The proposed framework incorporates diverse acoustic feature categories, systematic feature selection methods, and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with extensive hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, to enhance interpretability and trust in model predictions, the framework incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to quantify the contribution of individual acoustic features toward PD detection. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding an accuracy of 95.77%, F1 score of 95.57%, and AUC-ROC of 0.982. We further externally validated our approach by applying the framework to existing PD datasets in other languages, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, the dataset has been made publicly available at https://github.com/Riad071/BenSParX.</description>

      <title>VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.</description>

      <title>Chain-Talker: Chain Understanding and Rendering for Empathetic Conversational Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to align synthesized speech with the emotional and stylistic context of user-agent interactions to achieve empathy. Current generative CSS models face interpretability limitations due to insufficient emotional perception and redundant discrete speech coding. To address the above issues, we present Chain-Talker, a three-stage framework mimicking human cognition: Emotion Understanding derives context-aware emotion descriptors from dialogue history; Semantic Understanding generates compact semantic codes via serialized prediction; and Empathetic Rendering synthesizes expressive speech by integrating both components. To support emotion modeling, we develop CSS-EmCap, an LLM-driven automated pipeline for generating precise conversational speech emotion captions. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Chain-Talker produces more expressive and empathetic speech than existing methods, with CSS-EmCap contributing to reliable emotion modeling. The code and demos are available at: https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Chain-Talker.</description>

      <title>Text2midi-InferAlign: Improving Symbolic Music Generation with Inference-Time Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Text2midi-InferAlign, a novel technique for improving symbolic music generation at inference time. Our method leverages text-to-audio alignment and music structural alignment rewards during inference to encourage the generated music to be consistent with the input caption. Specifically, we introduce two objectives scores: a text-audio consistency score that measures rhythmic alignment between the generated music and the original text caption, and a harmonic consistency score that penalizes generated music containing notes inconsistent with the key. By optimizing these alignment-based objectives during the generation process, our model produces symbolic music that is more closely tied to the input captions, thereby improving the overall quality and coherence of the generated compositions. Our approach can extend any existing autoregressive model without requiring further training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our work on top of Text2midi - an existing text-to-midi generation model, demonstrating significant improvements in both objective and subjective evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>RoVo: Robust Voice Protection Against Unauthorized Speech Synthesis with Embedding-Level Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of AI-based speech synthesis technologies such as Deep Voice, there is an increasing risk of voice spoofing attacks, including voice phishing and fake news, through unauthorized use of others' voices. Existing defenses that inject adversarial perturbations directly into audio signals have limited effectiveness, as these perturbations can easily be neutralized by speech enhancement methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoVo (Robust Voice), a novel proactive defense technique that injects adversarial perturbations into high-dimensional embedding vectors of audio signals, reconstructing them into protected speech. This approach effectively defends against speech synthesis attacks and also provides strong resistance to speech enhancement models, which represent a secondary attack threat.
  In extensive experiments, RoVo increased the Defense Success Rate (DSR) by over 70% compared to unprotected speech, across four state-of-the-art speech synthesis models. Specifically, RoVo achieved a DSR of 99.5% on a commercial speaker-verification API, effectively neutralizing speech synthesis attack. Moreover, RoVo's perturbations remained robust even under strong speech enhancement conditions, outperforming traditional methods. A user study confirmed that RoVo preserves both naturalness and usability of protected speech, highlighting its effectiveness in complex and evolving threat scenarios.</description>

      <title>SounDiT: Geo-Contextual Soundscape-to-Landscape Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel and practically significant problem-Geo-Contextual Soundscape-to-Landscape (GeoS2L) generation-which aims to synthesize geographically realistic landscape images from environmental soundscapes. Prior audio-to-image generation methods typically rely on general-purpose datasets and overlook geographic and environmental contexts, resulting in unrealistic images that are misaligned with real-world environmental settings. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel geo-contextual computational framework that explicitly integrates geographic knowledge into multimodal generative modeling. We construct two large-scale geo-contextual multimodal datasets, SoundingSVI and SonicUrban, pairing diverse soundscapes with real-world landscape images. We propose SounDiT, a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based model that incorporates geo-contextual scene conditioning to synthesize geographically coherent landscape images. Furthermore, we propose a practically-informed geo-contextual evaluation framework, the Place Similarity Score (PSS), across element-, scene-, and human perception-levels to measure consistency between input soundscapes and generated landscape images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SounDiT outperforms existing baselines in both visual fidelity and geographic settings. Our work not only establishes foundational benchmarks for GeoS2L generation but also highlights the importance of incorporating geographic domain knowledge in advancing multimodal generative models, opening new directions at the intersection of generative AI, geography, urban planning, and environmental sciences.</description>

      <title>OZSpeech: One-step Zero-shot Speech Synthesis with Learned-Prior-Conditioned Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have seen significant advancements in recent years, driven by improvements in deep learning and neural network architectures. Viewing the output speech as a data distribution, previous approaches often employ traditional speech representations, such as waveforms or spectrograms, within the Flow Matching framework. However, these methods have limitations, including overlooking various speech attributes and incurring high computational costs due to additional constraints introduced during training. To address these challenges, we introduce OZSpeech, the first TTS method to explore optimal transport conditional flow matching with one-step sampling and a learned prior as the condition, effectively disregarding preceding states and reducing the number of sampling steps. Our approach operates on disentangled, factorized components of speech in token format, enabling accurate modeling of each speech attribute, which enhances the TTS system's ability to precisely clone the prompt speech. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance over existing methods in content accuracy, naturalness, prosody generation, and speaker style preservation. Audio samples are available at our demo page https://ozspeech.github.io/OZSpeech_Web/.</description>

      <title>Unified Cross-modal Translation of Score Images, Symbolic Music, and Performance Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music exists in various modalities, such as score images, symbolic scores, MIDI, and audio. Translations between each modality are established as core tasks of music information retrieval, such as automatic music transcription (audio-to-MIDI) and optical music recognition (score image to symbolic score). However, most past work on multimodal translation trains specialized models on individual translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified approach, where we train a general-purpose model on many translation tasks simultaneously. Two key factors make this unified approach viable: a new large-scale dataset and the tokenization of each modality. Firstly, we propose a new dataset that consists of more than 1,300 hours of paired audio-score image data collected from YouTube videos, which is an order of magnitude larger than any existing music modal translation datasets. Secondly, our unified tokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into a sequence of tokens, enabling a single encoder-decoder Transformer to tackle multiple cross-modal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task. Experimental results confirm that our unified multitask model improves upon single-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error rate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%, while similarly substantial improvements are observed across the other translation tasks. Notably, our approach achieves the first successful score-image-conditioned audio generation, marking a significant breakthrough in cross-modal music generation.</description>

      <title>The Computation of Generalized Embeddings for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition using Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing level of sound pollution in marine environments poses an increased threat to ocean health, making it crucial to monitor underwater noise. By monitoring this noise, the sources responsible for this pollution can be mapped. Monitoring is performed by passively listening to these sounds. This generates a large amount of data records, capturing a mix of sound sources such as ship activities and marine mammal vocalizations. Although machine learning offers a promising solution for automatic sound classification, current state-of-the-art methods implement supervised learning. This requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data that is not publicly available. In contrast, a massive amount of lower-quality unlabeled data is publicly available, offering the opportunity to explore unsupervised learning techniques. This research explores this possibility by implementing an unsupervised Contrastive Learning approach. Here, a Conformer-based encoder is optimized by the so-called Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization loss function on these lower-quality unlabeled data and the translation to the labeled data is made. Through classification tasks involving recognizing ship types and marine mammal vocalizations, our method demonstrates to produce robust and generalized embeddings. This shows to potential of unsupervised methods for various automatic underwater acoustic analysis tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present our submission to the Speech Accessibility Project challenge for dysarthric speech recognition. We integrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning with latent audio representations to improve an encoder-decoder ASR system. Synthetic training data is generated by fine-tuning Parler-TTS to mimic dysarthric speech, using LLM-generated prompts for corpus-consistent target transcripts. Personalization with x-vectors consistently reduces word error rates (WERs) over non-personalized fine-tuning. AdaLoRA adapters outperform full fine-tuning and standard low-rank adaptation, achieving relative WER reductions of ~23% and ~22%, respectively. Further improvements (~5% WER reduction) come from incorporating wav2vec 2.0-based audio representations. Training with synthetic dysarthric speech yields up to ~7% relative WER improvement over personalized fine-tuning alone.</description>

      <title>Codec-Based Deepfake Source Tracing via Neural Audio Codec Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG) models have produced remarkably realistic audio deepfakes. We refer to deepfake speech generated by CoSG systems as codec-based deepfake, or CodecFake. Although existing anti-spoofing research on CodecFake predominantly focuses on verifying the authenticity of audio samples, almost no attention was given to tracing the CoSG used in generating these deepfakes. In CodecFake generation, processes such as speech-to-unit encoding, discrete unit modeling, and unit-to-speech decoding are fundamentally based on neural audio codecs. Motivated by this, we introduce source tracing for CodecFake via neural audio codec taxonomy, which dissects neural audio codecs to trace CoSG. Our experimental results on the CodecFake+ dataset provide promising initial evidence for the feasibility of CodecFake source tracing while also highlighting several challenges that warrant further investigation.</description>

      <title>DualCodec: A Low-Frame-Rate, Semantically-Enhanced Neural Audio Codec for Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs form the foundational building blocks for language model (LM)-based speech generation. Typically, there is a trade-off between frame rate and audio quality. This study introduces a low-frame-rate, semantically enhanced codec model. Existing approaches distill semantically rich self-supervised (SSL) representations into the first-layer codec tokens. This work proposes DualCodec, a dual-stream encoding approach that integrates SSL and waveform representations within an end-to-end codec framework. In this setting, DualCodec enhances the semantic information in the first-layer codec and enables the codec system to maintain high audio quality while operating at a low frame rate. Note that a low-frame-rate codec improves the efficiency of speech generation. Experimental results on audio codec and speech generation tasks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed DualCodec compared to state-of-the-art codec systems, such as Mimi Codec, SpeechTokenizer, DAC, and Encodec. Demos and codes are available at: https://dualcodec.github.io</description>

      <title>MMAR: A Challenging Benchmark for Deep Reasoning in Speech, Audio, Music, and Their Mix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MMAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the deep reasoning capabilities of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) across massive multi-disciplinary tasks. MMAR comprises 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets, collected from real-world internet videos and refined through iterative error corrections and quality checks to ensure high quality. Unlike existing benchmarks that are limited to specific domains of sound, music, or speech, MMAR extends them to a broad spectrum of real-world audio scenarios, including mixed-modality combinations of sound, music, and speech. Each question in MMAR is hierarchically categorized across four reasoning layers: Signal, Perception, Semantic, and Cultural, with additional sub-categories within each layer to reflect task diversity and complexity. To further foster research in this area, we annotate every question with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationale to promote future advancements in audio reasoning. Each item in the benchmark demands multi-step deep reasoning beyond surface-level understanding. Moreover, a part of the questions requires graduate-level perceptual and domain-specific knowledge, elevating the benchmark's difficulty and depth. We evaluate MMAR using a broad set of models, including Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), Large Audio Reasoning Models (LARMs), Omni Language Models (OLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with audio caption inputs. The performance of these models on MMAR highlights the benchmark's challenging nature, and our analysis further reveals critical limitations of understanding and reasoning capabilities among current models. We hope MMAR will serve as a catalyst for future advances in this important but little-explored area.</description>

      <title>Hearing from Silence: Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos via Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans can intuitively infer sounds from silent videos, but whether multimodal large language models can perform modal-mismatch reasoning without accessing target modalities remains relatively unexplored. Current text-assisted-video-to-audio (VT2A) methods excel in video foley tasks but struggle to acquire audio descriptions during inference. We introduce the task of Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos (SVAD) to address this challenge and investigate vision-language models' (VLMs) capabilities on this task. To further enhance the VLMs' reasoning capacity for the SVAD task, we construct a CoT-AudioCaps dataset and propose a Chain-of-Thought-based supervised fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on SVAD and subsequent VT2A tasks demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two key aspects: significantly improving VLMs' modal-mismatch reasoning for SVAD and effectively addressing the challenge of acquiring audio descriptions during VT2A inference.</description>

      <title>Suicide Risk Assessment Using Multimodal Speech Features: A Study on the SW1 Challenge Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge conveys the need for speech-based suicide risk assessment in adolescents. This study investigates a multimodal approach for this challenge, integrating automatic transcription with WhisperX, linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa, and audio embeddings from WavLM. Additionally, handcrafted acoustic features -- including MFCCs, spectral contrast, and pitch-related statistics -- were incorporated. We explored three fusion strategies: early concatenation, modality-specific processing, and weighted attention with mixup regularization. Results show that weighted attention provided the best generalization, achieving 69% accuracy on the development set, though a performance gap between development and test sets highlights generalization challenges. Our findings, strictly tied to the MINI-KID framework, emphasize the importance of refining embedding representations and fusion mechanisms to enhance classification reliability.</description>

      <title>MultiActor-Audiobook: Zero-Shot Audiobook Generation with Faces and Voices of Multiple Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MultiActor-Audiobook, a zero-shot approach for generating audiobooks that automatically produces consistent, expressive, and speaker-appropriate prosody, including intonation and emotion. Previous audiobook systems have several limitations: they require users to manually configure the speaker's prosody, read each sentence with a monotonic tone compared to voice actors, or rely on costly training. However, our MultiActor-Audiobook addresses these issues by introducing two novel processes: (1) MSP (**Multimodal Speaker Persona Generation**) and (2) LSI (**LLM-based Script Instruction Generation**). With these two processes, MultiActor-Audiobook can generate more emotionally expressive audiobooks with a consistent speaker prosody without additional training. We compare our system with commercial products, through human and MLLM evaluations, achieving competitive results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MSP and LSI through ablation studies.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency-Based Attention Cache Memory Model for Real-Time Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing causal speech separation models often underperform compared to non-causal models due to difficulties in retaining historical information. To address this, we propose the Time-Frequency Attention Cache Memory (TFACM) model, which effectively captures spatio-temporal relationships through an attention mechanism and cache memory (CM) for historical information storage. In TFACM, an LSTM layer captures frequency-relative positions, while causal modeling is applied to the time dimension using local and global representations. The CM module stores past information, and the causal attention refinement (CAR) module further enhances time-based feature representations for finer granularity. Experimental results showed that TFACM achieveed comparable performance to the SOTA TF-GridNet-Causal model, with significantly lower complexity and fewer trainable parameters.

      <title>Benchmarking and Confidence Evaluation of LALMs For Temporal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The popular success of text-based large language models (LLM) has streamlined the attention of the multimodal community to combine other modalities like vision and audio along with text to achieve similar multimodal capabilities. In this quest, large audio language models (LALMs) have to be evaluated on reasoning related tasks which are different from traditional classification or generation tasks. Towards this goal, we propose a novel dataset called temporal reasoning evaluation of audio (TREA).
  We benchmark open-source LALMs and observe that they are consistently behind human capabilities on the tasks in the TREA dataset. While evaluating LALMs, we also propose an uncertainty metric, which computes the invariance of the model to semantically identical perturbations of the input. Our analysis shows that the accuracy and uncertainty metrics are not necessarily correlated and thus, points to a need for wholesome evaluation of LALMs for high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Speech Language Modeling via Energy Distance in Continuous Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.</description>

      <title>Distilling a speech and music encoder with task arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the progress in self-supervised learning (SSL) for speech and music, existing models treat these domains separately, limiting their capacity for unified audio understanding. A unified model is desirable for applications that require general representations, e.g. audio large language models. Nonetheless, directly training a general model for speech and music is computationally expensive. Knowledge Distillation of teacher ensembles may be a natural solution, but we posit that decoupling the distillation of the speech and music SSL models allows for more flexibility. Thus, we propose to learn distilled task vectors and then linearly interpolate them to form a unified speech+music model. This strategy enables flexible domain emphasis through adjustable weights and is also simpler to train. Experiments on speech and music benchmarks demonstrate that our method yields superior overall performance compared to ensemble distillation.</description>

      <title>Contextual Paralinguistic Data Creation for Multi-Modal Speech-LLM: Data Condensation and Spoken QA Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset. The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task and multilingual approaches benefit large models, yet speech processing for low-resource languages remains underexplored due to data scarcity. To address this, we present Granary, a large-scale collection of speech datasets for recognition and translation across 25 European languages. This is the first open-source effort at this scale for both transcription and translation. We enhance data quality using a pseudo-labeling pipeline with segmentation, two-pass inference, hallucination filtering, and punctuation restoration. We further generate translation pairs from pseudo-labeled transcriptions using EuroLLM, followed by a data filtration pipeline. Designed for efficiency, our pipeline processes vast amount of data within hours. We assess models trained on processed data by comparing their performance on previously curated datasets for both high- and low-resource languages. Our findings show that these models achieve similar performance using approx. 50% less data. Dataset will be made available at https://hf.co/datasets/nvidia/Granary</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial sound reasoning is a fundamental human skill, enabling us to navigate and interpret our surroundings based on sound. In this paper we present BAT, which combines the spatial sound perception ability of a binaural acoustic scene analysis model with the natural language reasoning capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to replicate this innate ability. To address the lack of existing datasets of in-the-wild spatial sounds, we synthesized a binaural audio dataset using AudioSet and SoundSpaces 2.0. Next, we developed SpatialSoundQA, a spatial sound-based question-answering dataset, offering a range of QA tasks that train BAT in various aspects of spatial sound perception and reasoning. The acoustic front end encoder of BAT is a novel spatial audio encoder named Spatial Audio Spectrogram Transformer, or Spatial-AST, which by itself achieves strong performance across sound event detection, spatial localization, and distance estimation. By integrating Spatial-AST with LLaMA-2 7B model, BAT transcends standard Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) tasks, enabling the model to reason about the relationships between the sounds in its environment. Our experiments demonstrate BAT's superior performance on both spatial sound perception and reasoning, showcasing the immense potential of LLMs in navigating and interpreting complex spatial audio environments.</description>

      <title>USEF-TSE: Universal Speaker Embedding Free Target Speaker Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Target speaker extraction aims to separate the voice of a specific speaker from mixed speech. Traditionally, this process has relied on extracting a speaker embedding from a reference speech, in which a speaker recognition model is required. However, identifying an appropriate speaker recognition model can be challenging, and using the target speaker embedding as reference information may not be optimal for target speaker extraction tasks. This paper introduces a Universal Speaker Embedding-Free Target Speaker Extraction (USEF-TSE) framework that operates without relying on speaker embeddings. USEF-TSE utilizes a multi-head cross-attention mechanism as a frame-level target speaker feature extractor. This innovative approach allows mainstream speaker extraction solutions to bypass the dependency on speaker recognition models and better leverage the information available in the enrollment speech, including speaker characteristics and contextual details. Additionally, USEF-TSE can seamlessly integrate with other time-domain or time-frequency domain speech separation models to achieve effective speaker extraction. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) on the WSJ0-2mix, WHAM!, and WHAMR! datasets, which are standard benchmarks for monaural anechoic, noisy and noisy-reverberant two-speaker speech separation and speaker extraction. The results on the LibriMix and the blind test set of the ICASSP 2023 DNS Challenge demonstrate that the model performs well on more diverse and out-of-domain data.

      <description>arXiv:2501.03612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining 'who spoke what and when' remains challenging in real-world applications. In typical scenarios, Speaker Diarization (SD) is employed to address the problem of 'who spoke when,' while Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) or Target Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition (TSASR) techniques are utilized to resolve the issue of 'who spoke what.' Although some works have achieved promising results by combining SD and TSE systems, inconsistencies remain between SD and TSE regarding both output inconsistency and scenario mismatch. To address these limitations, we propose a Universal Speaker Embedding Free Target Speaker Extraction and Personal Voice Activity Detection (USEF-TP) model that jointly performs TSE and Personal Voice Activity Detection (PVAD). USEF-TP leverages frame-level features obtained through a cross-attention mechanism as speaker-related features instead of using speaker embeddings as in traditional approaches. Additionally, a multi-task learning algorithm with a scenario-aware differentiated loss function is applied to ensure robust performance across various levels of speaker overlap. The experimental results show that our proposed USEF-TP model achieves superior performance in TSE and PVAD tasks on the LibriMix and SparseLibriMix datasets. The results on the CALLHOME dataset demonstrate the competitive performance of our model on real recordings.</description>

      <title>ArrayDPS: Unsupervised Blind Speech Separation with a Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR. Audio demos are provided at: https://arraydps.github.io/ArrayDPSDemo/.</description>

Abstract: The EMelodyGen system focuses on emotional melody generation in ABC notation controlled by the musical feature template. Owing to the scarcity of well-structured and emotionally labeled sheet music, we designed a template for controlling emotional melody generation by statistical correlations between musical features and emotion labels derived from small-scale emotional symbolic music datasets and music psychology conclusions. We then automatically annotated a large, well-structured sheet music collection with rough emotional labels by the template, converted them into ABC notation, and reduced label imbalance by data augmentation, resulting in a dataset named Rough4Q. Our system backbone pre-trained on Rough4Q can achieve up to 99% music21 parsing rate and melodies generated by our template can lead to a 91% alignment on emotional expressions in blind listening tests. Ablation studies further validated the effectiveness of the feature controls in the template. Available code and demos are at https://github.com/monetjoe/EMelodyGen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce STAR (Stream Transduction with Anchor Representations), a novel Transformer-based model designed for efficient sequence-to-sequence transduction over streams. STAR dynamically segments input streams to create compressed anchor representations, achieving nearly lossless compression (12x) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and outperforming existing methods. Moreover, STAR demonstrates superior segmentation and latency-quality trade-offs in simultaneous speech-to-text tasks, optimizing latency, memory footprint, and quality.</description>

      <title>An interpretable speech foundation model for depression detection by revealing prediction-relevant acoustic features from long speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech-based depression detection tools could aid early screening. Here, we propose an interpretable speech foundation model approach to enhance the clinical applicability of such tools. We introduce a speech-level Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) to detect depression using long-duration speech instead of short segments, along with a novel interpretation method that reveals prediction-relevant acoustic features for clinician interpretation. Our experiments show the proposed model outperforms a segment-level AST, highlighting the impact of segment-level labelling noise and the advantage of leveraging longer speech duration for more reliable depression detection. Through interpretation, we observe our model identifies reduced loudness and F0 as relevant depression signals, aligning with documented clinical findings. This interpretability supports a responsible AI approach for speech-based depression detection, rendering such tools more clinically applicable.</description>

      <title>Audio xLSTMs: Learning Self-Supervised Audio Representations with xLSTMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the transformer has emerged as the eminent neural architecture, several independent lines of research have emerged to address its limitations. Recurrent neural approaches have observed a lot of renewed interest, including the extended long short-term memory (xLSTM) architecture, which reinvigorates the original LSTM. However, while xLSTMs have shown competitive performance compared to the transformer, their viability for learning self-supervised general-purpose audio representations has not been evaluated. This work proposes Audio xLSTM (AxLSTM), an approach for learning audio representations from masked spectrogram patches in a self-supervised setting. Pretrained on the AudioSet dataset, the proposed AxLSTM models outperform comparable self-supervised audio spectrogram transformer (SSAST) baselines by up to 25% in relative performance across a set of ten diverse downstream tasks while having up to 45% fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>SSR: Alignment-Aware Modality Connector for Speech Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fusing speech into pre-trained language model (SpeechLM) usually suffers from inefficient encoding of long-form speech and catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained text modality. We propose SSR-Connector (Segmented Speech Representation Connector) for better modality fusion. Leveraging speech-text alignments, our approach segments and compresses speech features to match the granularity of text embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training pipeline that includes the distillation and fine-tuning phases to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. SSR-Connector outperforms existing mechanism for speech-text modality fusion, consistently achieving better speech understanding (e.g., +10 accuracy on StoryCloze and +20 on Speech-MMLU) while preserving pre-trained text ability.</description>

      <title>BrainECHO: Semantic Brain Signal Decoding through Vector-Quantized Spectrogram Reconstruction for Whisper-Enhanced Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current EEG/MEG-to-text decoding systems suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on teacher-forcing methods, which compromises robustness during inference, (2) sensitivity to session-specific noise, hindering generalization across subjects, and (3) misalignment between brain signals and linguistic representations due to pre-trained language model over-dominance. To overcome these challenges, we propose BrainECHO (Brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn), a multi-stage framework that employs decoupled representation learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both EEG and MEG datasets. Specifically, BrainECHO consists of three stages: (1) Discrete autoencoding, which transforms continuous Mel spectrograms into a finite set of high-quality discrete representations for subsequent stages. (2) Frozen alignment, where brain signal embeddings are mapped to corresponding Mel spectrogram embeddings in a frozen latent space, effectively filtering session-specific noise through vector-quantized reconstruction, yielding a 3.65% improvement in BLEU-4 score. (3) Constrained decoding fine-tuning, which leverages the pre-trained Whisper model for audio-to-text translation, balancing signal adaptation with knowledge preservation, and achieving 74%-89% decoding BLEU scores without excessive reliance on teacher forcing. BrainECHO demonstrates robustness across sentence, session, and subject-independent conditions, passing Gaussian noise tests and showcasing its potential for enhancing language-based brain-computer interfaces.</description>

      <title>USpeech: Ultrasound-Enhanced Speech with Minimal Human Effort via Cross-Modal Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement is crucial for ubiquitous human-computer interaction. Recently, ultrasound-based acoustic sensing has emerged as an attractive choice for speech enhancement because of its superior ubiquity and performance. However, due to inevitable interference from unexpected and unintended sources during audio-ultrasound data acquisition, existing solutions rely heavily on human effort for data collection and processing. This leads to significant data scarcity that limits the full potential of ultrasound-based speech enhancement. To address this, we propose USpeech, a cross-modal ultrasound synthesis framework for speech enhancement with minimal human effort. At its core is a two-stage framework that establishes the correspondence between visual and ultrasonic modalities by leveraging audio as a bridge. This approach overcomes challenges from the lack of paired video-ultrasound datasets and the inherent heterogeneity between video and ultrasound data. Our framework incorporates contrastive video-audio pre-training to project modalities into a shared semantic space and employs an audio-ultrasound encoder-decoder for ultrasound synthesis. We then present a speech enhancement network that enhances speech in the time-frequency domain and recovers the clean speech waveform via a neural vocoder. Comprehensive experiments show USpeech achieves remarkable performance using synthetic ultrasound data comparable to physical data, outperforming state-of-the-art ultrasound-based speech enhancement baselines. USpeech is open-sourced at https://github.com/aiot-lab/USpeech/.</description>

      <title>CLaMP 3: Universal Music Information Retrieval Across Unaligned Modalities and Unseen Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CLaMP 3 is a unified framework developed to address challenges of cross-modal and cross-lingual generalization in music information retrieval. Using contrastive learning, it aligns all major music modalities--including sheet music, performance signals, and audio recordings--with multilingual text in a shared representation space, enabling retrieval across unaligned modalities with text as a bridge. It features a multilingual text encoder adaptable to unseen languages, exhibiting strong cross-lingual generalization. Leveraging retrieval-augmented generation, we curated M4-RAG, a web-scale dataset consisting of 2.31 million music-text pairs. This dataset is enriched with detailed metadata that represents a wide array of global musical traditions. To advance future research, we release WikiMT-X, a benchmark comprising 1,000 triplets of sheet music, audio, and richly varied text descriptions. Experiments show that CLaMP 3 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MIR tasks, significantly surpassing previous strong baselines and demonstrating excellent generalization in multimodal and multilingual music contexts.</description>

      <title>M3G: Multi-Granular Gesture Generator for Audio-Driven Full-Body Human Motion Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating full-body human gestures encompassing face, body, hands, and global movements from audio is a valuable yet challenging task in virtual avatar creation. Previous systems focused on tokenizing the human gestures framewisely and predicting the tokens of each frame from the input audio. However, one observation is that the number of frames required for a complete expressive human gesture, defined as granularity, varies among different human gesture patterns. Existing systems fail to model these gesture patterns due to the fixed granularity of their gesture tokens. To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework named Multi-Granular Gesture Generator (M3G) for audio-driven holistic gesture generation. In M3G, we propose a novel Multi-Granular VQ-VAE (MGVQ-VAE) to tokenize motion patterns and reconstruct motion sequences from different temporal granularities. Subsequently, we proposed a multi-granular token predictor that extracts multi-granular information from audio and predicts the corresponding motion tokens. Then M3G reconstructs the human gestures from the predicted tokens using the MGVQ-VAE. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3G framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of generating natural and expressive full-body human gestures.</description>
