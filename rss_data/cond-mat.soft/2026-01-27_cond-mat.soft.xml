      <title>Practical Considerations for Finite Concentrations Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding concentrated electrolytes requires a theory that spans local hydration and mesoscale interfacial assembly. We present an integrated workflow-SCOPE-that combines (i) enhanced sampling focused on a single Li+ ion, (ii) reweighting of biased trajectories to recover equilibrium microstate probabilities, and (iii) a chemical-potential correction that accounts for the limited reservoir of free water in finite simulation boxes. Applied to LiCl(aq) across 0.5-26 M and 283-313 K, this approach reveals a simple organizing principle: solvated ions dominate at low concentration; contact ion pairs emerge at intermediate strength; and aggregated Li-xCl clusters become most stable at the solubility limit. The resulting free-energy trends predict temperature-dependent solubility in close agreement with experiment and clarify the role of interfacial nucleation in precipitation. Beyond the simple LiCl(aq) salt considered here, SCOPE offers a transferable strategy for characterizing speciation and phase behavior in concentrated liquid systems where collective coordinates and rare events dominate.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in Drying Colloidal Films: Role of Surface Charge and Substrate Wettability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drying of colloidal suspensions leads to complex deposition patterns, accompanied by instabilities such as cracking and delamination. In this study, we experimentally investigate the coupled influence of particle surface charge and substrate wettability on the evaporation dynamics, final deposition morphology, and crack patterns of sessile droplets containing silica nanoparticles. We examine the dynamics of two types of colloids, namely the negatively charged colloidal silica nanoparticles (Ludox TM50) and the positively charged silica nanoparticle (Ludox CL30), at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 weight percentages, deposited on glass, polystyrene, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) substrates with distinct wettability. Side and top-view imaging techniques are employed to capture the evaporation process and analyze the resulting cracks. Our results reveal that the nature of the particle charge and substrate wettability significantly affect the evaporation mode, with transitions observed between constant contact radius (CCR), constant contact angle (CCA), and mixed modes. TM50-laden droplets consistently exhibit radial cracks, whereas CL30 droplets display more randomly oriented and irregular cracks. At higher particle concentrations, TM50 suspensions form thicker deposits that undergo delamination, particularly on highly wettable substrates like glass. Quantitative analysis reveals that crack spacing and length follow power-law relationships with particle concentration. Additionally, the delamination behavior is strongly influenced by both the particle concentration and the type of substrate. We propose a mechanistic framework to explain the role of particle-substrate interactions in governing the observed cracking and delamination behaviors.</description>

      <title>Large temperature-up-jump simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents simulations of the physical aging of a binary Kob-Andersen-type Lennard-Jones liquid following large temperature up-jumps from equilibrated states of high relaxation time. The purpose is to investigate how well the Tool-Narayanaswamy (TN) material-time concept works for this rather extreme case of aging. First the triangular relation of the potential energy is studied. This is found to be well obeyed, making it possible to define a potential-energy-based material time $\xi$. We proceed to study aging toward equilibrium at the final temperature 0.48 for jumps from the temperatures 0.43 and 0.37, monitoring the following five quantities: the potential energy, the self-intermediate scattering function, the mean-square displacement, the dynamic susceptibility $\chi_4$, and the non-Gaussian parameter $\alpha_2$. The TN material-time prediction is that all time-autocorrelation functions should collapse to only depend on the material-time difference $\xi_2-\xi_1$. This is found to work much better for the $0.43\to 0.48$ temperature jump than for the $0.37\to 0.48$ jump. Our findings thus confirm the general understanding that the TN aging formalism works best for systems that are never very far from equilibrium. This raises two questions for future work: Is the collapse significantly improved if each aging quantity is allowed its own material time? Can better collapse be obtained if the material-time is generalized to be defined locally in order to reflect dynamic heterogeneity?</description>

      <title>Chain-Length-Dependent Partitioning of 1-Alkanols in Raft-Like Lipid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although 1-alkanols are widely used as anesthetics and membrane-active agents, the molecular basis of their chain-length-dependent cutoff behavior remains unclear. Here, we perform extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the partitioning of 1-alkanols with varying chain lengths in a raft-like lipid bilayer composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and cholesterol (Chol), which exhibits coexistence of liquid-ordered ($l_o$) and liquid-disordered ($l_d$) domains. We observe pronounced lateral heterogeneity in alkanol distribution, membrane thickness, number density, and lateral pressure profiles across coexisting phases. A distinct cutoff chain length, $n_{cutoff}=12$, is identified: alkanols with $n&lt;n_{cutoff}$ preferentially partition into DOPC-rich $l_d$ domains, whereas alkanols with $n \ge n_{cutoff}$ preferentially localize within DPPC- and cholesterol-rich $l_o$ domains. This chain-length-dependent redistribution is accompanied by systematic reductions in the lateral pressure profile, membrane compressibility, and bending rigidity of the bilayer. The results provide a detailed molecular characterization of how alkanol chain length modulates membrane structure and mechanical response in laterally heterogeneous lipid membranes.</description>

      <title>Programming Nonlinear Interfacial Mechanics of Synthetic Cells: Lipid Geometry and DNA Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft interfaces formed by lipid membranes are fundamental to living cells, synthetic cells, and membrane-based soft materials. However, a quantitative framework linking molecular organization with nonlinear interfacial mechanics remains elusive. Here, we establish an analytical framework that captures the nonlinear elastic response of lipid-membrane-coated synthetic cells under micropipette aspiration. Incorporating both area stretching and curvature bending enables the model to quantitatively reproduce the complete pressure-displacement response within the small-deformation regime. This approach reduces interfacial mechanics to two parameters: the in-plane area-stretching modulus and an out-of-plane bending-related term.
  Using this unified framework, we experimentally demonstrate that nonlinear interfacial mechanics can be programmed by altering the molecular geometry and effective dimensionality of adsorbed elements. The lipid molecular shape and curvature-dependent packing regulate in-plane stiffness, while DNA nanostructures, the other adsorbed element, introduce an orthogonal control axis via dimensionality: isolated motifs primarily enhance area stretching, whereas three-dimensional network architectures markedly reinforce bending resistance. Together, these results establish a general molecular design principle for programming interfacial mechanics and provide a quantitative foundation for engineering mechanically tunable synthetic cells and soft interfaces.</description>

      <title>Active topological strings in renewing nematopolar fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter often simultaneously exhibits different kinds of orientational order and, in many cases of biological interest, undergoes continuous material renewal. In renewing nematopolar fluids we find stable topological strings, structures consisting of two nematic point defects connected by a defect line in the polar field. We identify the mechanism underlying string stabilization and unveil how string length is determined. In the presence of active stress, we observe active-string chaos. Our work identifies continuous material renewal as a generic mechanism underlying the stabilization of topological defect structures in systems with mixed order parameters. It could be used for orchestrating living matter during development and other biological processes.</description>

      <title>Structural and dynamic anomalous properties of TIP4P/2005 water at extreme pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water shows numerous thermodynamic, dynamic, and structural anomalies. Recent experiments [Eichler et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 134101 (2025)], based on measurements of shear and bulk viscosities of liquid water up to 1.6 GPa, have reported the existence of a minimum in the variation of the structural relaxation time {\tau}{\alpha} with pressure at room temperature. Here we investigate this and related properties with molecular dynamics simulations of the TIP4P/2005 water model, performed at extreme pressures commensurate with the experiments. Specifically, we compute dynamic (self-diffusion, shear and bulk viscosities, and structural relaxation time) and structural (oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function and structure factor, translational order parameter) properties down to 220 K and up to 2.7 GPa. We find good agreement with the experimental observations, and confirm the existence of a minimum in {\tau}{\alpha} . The microscopic information obtained from the simulations suggests that this anomaly is connected with the sudden reorganization of the hydrogen bond network induced by pressurization.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly of quasicrystals under cyclic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the self-assembly of two-dimensional dodecagonal quasicrystals driven by cyclic shear, effectively replacing thermal fluctuations with plastic rearrangements. Using particles interacting via a smoothed square-shoulder potential, we demonstrate that cyclic shearing drives initially random configurations into ordered quasicrystalline states. The resulting non-equilibrium phase diagram qualitatively mirrors that of thermal equilibrium, exhibiting square, quasicrystalline, and hexagonal phases, as well as phase coexistence. Remarkably, the shear-stabilised quasicrystal appears even where the zero-temperature equilibrium ground state favours square-hexagonal coexistence, suggesting that mechanical driving can stabilise quasicrystalline order in a way analogous to entropic effects in thermal systems. The structural quality of the self-assembled state is maximised near the yielding transition, even though the dynamics are slowest there. Yet, the system still quickly forms monodomain quasicrystals without any complex annealing protocols, unlike at equilibrium, where thermal annealing would be required. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that global orientational order decays slowly with system size, indicative of quasi-long-range order comparable to equilibrium hexatic phases. Overall, our results establish cyclic shear as an efficient pathway for the self-assembly of complex structures.</description>

      <title>Role of transfer films and interfacial cracking in metallic sliding wear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of wear particles in metallic sliding contacts remains debated. Classical views based on cold-welded junctions suggest that plastic yielding of the real contact area should lead to large wear coefficients, in apparent contradiction with the small values typically measured for metals. Here we argue that this discrepancy can be resolved if most junctions do not directly produce wear particles, but instead cause metal transfer and the formation of a weakly bound transfer film. Wear then occurs intermittently when fragments of this film detach due to crack propagation at the interface between the transfer film and the underlying bulk metal. We perform unlubricated reciprocating sliding experiments on nominally smooth stainless steel, brass, and aluminum. For steel on steel, the wear mass loss shows an initial stage with negligible mass change up to a sliding distance of $\sim 2.4 \ {\rm m}$, followed by a linear regime. Transfer-film formation in dissimilar-metal contacts is evidenced by optical imaging, net mass gain of the steel slider, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and the collected debris is flake-like. These observations support a transfer-film-controlled wear mechanism associated with cold-welded junctions.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic roughness evolution in film growth on weakly interacting substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin film deposition on weakly interacting substrates exhibits a unique growth mode characterized by initially strong island formation and rapidly increasing roughness, which reaches a maximum and subsequently decreases as the film returns to a smooth morphology. Here we show this rough-to-smooth growth mode experimentally for two molecular systems with substantially different geometries, namely, the effectively spherical buckminsterfullerene (C$_{60}$) and the disk-like 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN). This growth mode is explained by a geometrical model that captures the basic mechanisms of multilayer island growth, island coalescence, and formation of a continuous film. Additionally, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with minimal ingredients demonstrate that this mode generally occurs for weakly interacting substrates, providing quantitative estimates of parameters that characterize adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-substrate interactions. Both the model and simulations accurately describe the experimental data and highlight the generic nature of the phenomenon, independently of the details of the interactions and the molecular flux, which opens up a path for controlling nanoscale film roughness.</description>

      <title>A Local Structural Basis to Resolve Amorphous Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phases with distinct thermodynamic properties must differ in their underlying distributions of microscopic structures. While ordered phases are readily distinguished by unit cells and space groups, the local structural basis differentiating amorphous phases is less apparent. Here, using a new probabilistic data-driven framework applied to molecular simulation data on water, we identify local collective variables that discriminate low-density and high-density amorphous (LDA and HDA) ices and characterize pressure-induced transitions between these phases. As expected, descriptors related to local density capably distinguish LDA and HDA; however, phase identity is surprisingly encoded within the first coordination shell. Furthermore, LDA transitions to HDA by a simple redistribution of LDA- and HDA-like environments with no evident intermediate structures, in accordance with a first-order-like transition that contrasts with the gradual evolution observed in other amorphous systems such as metallic glasses. These findings are robust across force fields, which themselves exhibit structural differences, and exemplify how other systems lacking obvious distinguishing features can be characterized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the three-dimensional turbulence in a minimal model of an active fluid--the Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenburg equation. For small activity, we observe bacterial turbulence, while for large activity, we uncover hitherto unexplored regime of a turbulent flock where a global order coexists with turbulence. We present a simple closure model that predicts the turbulent flock and also qualitatively explains the transition to the bacterial turbulence regime via a transcritical bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Separating Energy and Entropy Contributions to the Hexatic-Liquid Transitions in Two-Dimensional Repulsive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, research on two-dimensional melting has established that both first-order and continuous hexatic-liquid transitions can occur, influenced by various factors in the potential energy and system details. The fundamental thermodynamic origins of this sensitivity remains elusive. Here, by decomposing the Helmholtz free energy across three representative repulsive systems, we reveal a universal competition between energy and entropy that dictates the melting pathway. The energetic contribution consistently imparts convexity to the free energy, whereas entropy imparts concavity. A first-order transition occurs when concave entropy dominates; otherwise, the transition is continuous. Further decomposition shows that vibrational entropy drives the concave total entropic curvature, while the configurational entropy's curvature switches from convex (first-order) to concave (continuous), mirroring defect proliferation measured by Shannon entropy. The convexity of the energy is dominated by the inherent potential, with minimal vibrational influence. Finally, we predict and verify that the first-order transition becomes continuous at zero temperature, where entropic effects vanish. Our work establishes the curvature of different thermodynamic quantities as a fundamental principle for understanding the nature of two-dimensional melting.</description>

      <title>The global attractor of the Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg equations of active turbulence and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg (TTSH) equations are one of the basic equations that are used to model turbulent behaviour in active matter, specifically the swarming of bacteria in suspension. They combine features of the incompressible Navier-Stokes, the Toner-Tu and Swift-Hohenberg equations, together with the important properties that they are linearly driven, and that the Laplacian diffusion is taken to be negative in combination with hyper-dissipation. We prove that the TTSH equations possess a finite-dimensional compact global attractor on the periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^d$ ($d=2,3$) and we establish explicit estimates for its Lyapunov dimension which agree with the heuristic prediction based on the Swift-Hohenberg length scale. The predominance of this length scale (as a vortex length scale) has been observed in both numerical and experimental studies of bacterial turbulence, so our methods and results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this phenomenon. We also carry out pseudospectral direct numerical simulations of these PDEs in dimension $d=2$ through which we obtain Lyapunov spectra for representative parameter values. We show that our numerical results are consistent with the analytically derived rigorous bounds.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of vortex liquid droplets in the iron pnictide superconductor CaKAs$_4$Fe$_4$ at $0.5T$_c$</title>

Abstract: Type-II superconductors under magnetic fields are in a quantum coherent non-dissipative state as long as vortices remain pinned. Dissipation appears when vortices depin, eventually driven by thermal fluctuations. This can be associated to a melting transition between a vortex solid and a vortex liquid. This transition is almost always observed very close to T$_c$ when probed by macroscopic experiments. However, it remains unclear how the vortex solid responds to thermal fluctuations at the scale of individual vortices far from the melting transition. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to visualize vortices in CaKAs$_4$Fe$_4$ (T$_c \approx$ 35 K). We find vortex liquid droplets-localized regions in space where vortices strongly fluctuate due to thermal exctiation-at temperatures as low as 0.5\,T$_c$. Our results show that the onset of dissipation at the local scale occurs at temperatures considerably below T$_c$ in type-II superconductors.</description>

      <title>Order Out of Noise and Disorder: Fate of the Frustrated Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on compact two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience the competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$ (closed manifolds), and bounded cylinder $S^1 \times [0,H]$ (manifold with boundary). Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction accompanied by spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry: order emerges from the combination of two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with the manifold topology determining the character of the emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures, specifically bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. The symmetry breaking pattern depends on topology: SO(3)$\to$SO(2) on the sphere, SO(2)$\times$SO(2)$\to$SO(2)$\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the torus, and SO(2)$\to\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the cylinder. Unlike conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise through type-A diffusive Nambu-Goldstone dynamics, while the reduced-dimensional structure persists. Unlike conventional self-organizing systems that require external driving or fine-tuned nonlinearities, our model demonstrates that geometry and topology alone can channel randomness into order. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems, providing a geometric framework for understanding how disorder generates emergent spatial order on curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Universal Negative Energetic Elasticity in Polymer Chains: Crossovers among Random, Self-Avoiding, and Neighbor-Avoiding Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity; despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</description>

Abstract: Curvature plays a central role in the proper function of many biological processes. With active matter being a standard framework for understanding many aspects of the physics of life, it is natural to ask what effect curvature has on the collective behaviour of active matter. In this paper, we use the classical theory of surfaces to explore the active motion of self-propelled agents confined to move on a smooth curved two-dimensional surface embedded in Euclidean space. Even without interactions and alignment, the motion is non-trivially affected by the presence of curvature, leading to effects akin, e.g.\ to gravitational lensing and tidal forces. Such effects can lead to intermittent trapping of particles and profoundly affect their flocking behaviour. We show that these effects are governed by a geometric torque that, in the absence of noise and interactions, compels particles to move along geodesics.</description>

      <title>Scaling the glassy dynamics of active particles: Tunable fragility and reentrance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of activity on dense amorphous assemblies is crucial for biological processes such as wound healing, embryogenesis, or cancer progression. Here, we study the effect of self-propulsion forces of amplitude $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$ in dense assemblies of soft repulsive particles by simulating a model particle system that interpolates between particulate active matter and biological tissues. We identify the fluid and glass phases of the three-dimensional phase diagram obtained by varying $f_0$, $\tau_p$, and the packing fraction $\phi$. The morphology of the phase diagram directly accounts for a non-monotonic evolution of the relaxation time with $\tau_p$, which is a direct consequence of the crossover in the dominant relaxation mechanism, from glassy to jamming. A second major consequence is the evolution of the glassy dynamics from sub-Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius. We show that this tunable glass fragility extends to active systems analogous observations reported for passive particles. This analogy allows us to apply a dynamic scaling analysis proposed for the passive case, in order to account for our results for active systems. Finally, we discuss similarities and differences between our results and recent findings in the context of computational models of biological tissues.</description>

Abstract: Embryonic healing in epithelial tissues is distinct from adult wound healing, as it lacks inflammatory responses or immune cell recruitments, making it ideal to test models of wound healing driven primarily by epithelial dynamics. Many models have been developed to describe this process, ranging from simple mechanistic models to more elaborate multiscale simulations. We review different classes of physical models, from discrete to continuum models, and how they address key questions about the mechanics, signaling, and coordination of cells during wound closure. We highlight tensions between model complexity and interpretability and discuss recent efforts to bridge gaps across scales. Finally, we identify directions for hybrid modeling and model-experiment integration that could push forward our understanding of epithelial repair in development and disease.</description>

      <title>Dissociation Line and Driving Force for Nucleation of the Multiple Occupied Hydrogen Hydrate from Computer Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we determine the dissociation temperature of the hydrogen (H$_2$) hydrate by computer simulation using two different methods. In both cases, the molecules of water and H$_2$ are modeled using the TIP4P/Ice and a modified version of the Silvera and Goldman models respectively, and the Berthelot combining rule for the cross water-H$_2$ interactions has been modified. The first method used in this work is the solubility method which consists in determining the solubility of H$_2$ in an aqueous phase when in contact with a H$_2$ hydrate (H--L$_{\text{w}}$) phase and when in contact with a pure H$_2$ phase (L$_{\text{w}}$--L$_{\text{H}_2}$) at different temperatures. At a given pressure value, both solubility curves intersect at the temperature ($T_3$) at which the three phases coexist in equilibrium. Following this approach, we determine the dissociation temperature of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$ finding a good agreement with the data previously reported in the literature. We also analyze the effect of the multiple occupancy of the D, or small, and H, or large, cages of the sII hydrate structure. We conclude that the $T_3$ value is barely affected by the occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$. From the analysis of the solubility curves and performing extra bulk simulations of the three phases involved in the equilibrium, we also determine the driving force for nucleation ($\Delta\mu^{\text{EC}}_{N}$) at $185\,\text{MPa}$ as a function of the supercooling degree and the H$_2$ hydrate occupancy. We determine that, thermodynamically, the most favored occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate consists of 1 H$_2$ molecule in the D cages and 3 in the H cages (named as 1-3 occupancy).</description>

      <title>Liquid-Gas Criticality of Hyperuniform Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In statistical physics, it is well established that the liquid-gas (LG) phase transition with divergent critical fluctuations belongs to the Ising universality class. Whether non-equilibrium effects can alter this universal behavior remains a fundamental open question. In this work, we theoretically prove that non-equilibrium hyperuniform (HU) fluids with additional center-of-mass conservation exhibit LG criticality different from the Ising universality class. As a specific case, we investigate a 2D HU fluid composed of active spinners, where phase separation is driven by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the critical point, the 2D HU fluid displays finite density fluctuations $S(q)\sim q^{\eta}$ with $\eta=0$, while the compressibility still diverges. The critical point is thus calm yet highly susceptible, in fundamental violation of the conventional fluctuation-dissipation relation. Consistently, we observe short-range pairwise correlation functions coexisting with quasi-long-range response functions at the critical point. Based on a generalized Model B and renormalization-group analysis, we prove that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical dimension $d_c$ from $4$ to $2$. Moreover, the critical point exhibits Gaussian density fluctuations and non-divergent energy fluctuations. Furthermore, the HU fluid undergoes non-conventional spinodal decomposition. The origin of the above anomalies lies in the non-equilibrium nature of the system which obeys a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation $2\mathrm{Im}~ \chi(q,\omega) ={\omega }C(q,\omega)/{k_B T_{\text{eff}}(q)}$ with a scale-dependent effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}(q) \propto q^2$. These findings establish a striking exception to conventional paradigms of critical phenomena and illustrate how non-equilibrium forces can fundamentally reshape universality classes.</description>

      <title>Pressure shifts in pulsatile shear: A microfluidic method to probe the normal stress response of complex fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A microfluidic approach to probing the first normal stress difference from single-point pressure measurements in transient shear flows is presented. Using an original experimental design, we examine the near-zero-mean pulsatile flow of polymeric solutions in a straight microchannel at low Reynolds and Womersley numbers. An important aspect of this work is that the enhanced fluid elastic stresses can be efficiently determined via the pressure shift measured from pressure-controlled pulsatile shear experiments. We find a scaling law that collapses pressure-shift data from viscoelastic fluids of different molecular weights onto a single master curve that can then be used to predict this phenomenology. Taken together, these results could help shed light on our understanding of the non-linear normal stress responses in time-dependent flows.</description>

      <title>InSpecLearn4SDL: Interpretable Spectral Features Predict Conductivity in Self-Driving Doped Conjugated Polymer Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To accelerate materials discovery using self-driving labs (SDLs), we present a machine learning pipeline that predicts the electrical conductivity of doped conjugated polymers using rapid, non-destructive optical spectroscopy. Our approach automates spectral featurization by combining a genetic algorithm with adaptive area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations, creating a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) that links optical response and processing parameters to conductivity. By incorporating SHAP-guided selection and domain-knowledge-based feature expansion, the model matches expert-curated performance while theoretically reducing experimental effort by $\sim 33\%$ by minimizing the need for costly direct conductivity measurements. Notably, the model recovers known physical descriptors in pBTTT and identifies informative tail-state regions correlated with polymer bleaching upon successful doping. This generic, interpretable, small-data-friendly methodology can be extended to other spectroscopic modalities, such as Raman or FTIR, providing a framework for autonomous decision-making in SDLs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: The topological origin of Bohm resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta \propto T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the ensemble of electron gyro-axes in a magnetized plasma as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the mean magnetic field. Unlike stochastic turbulence models, this framework predicts a coherent, explosive onset of resistivity that naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. We support this thesis with renormalization group theory and a novel analysis of Magnetospheric Multiscale mission data, which reveals an explosive phase space confinement consistent with collective phase slippage rather than chaotic scattering. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>
