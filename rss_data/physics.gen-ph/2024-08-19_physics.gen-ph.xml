      <title>Remove point-mass concept-remove singularities from GR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singularities in Newton's gravitation, in general relativity (GR), in Coulomb's law, and elsewhere in classical physics, stem from two ill conceived assumptions: a) there are point-like entities with finite masses, charges, etc., packed in zero volumes, and b) the non-quantum assumption that these point-likes can be assigned precise coordinates and momenta. In the case of GR, we argue that the classical energy-momentum tensor in Einstein's field equation is that of a collection of point particles and is prone to singularity.
  In compliance with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, we suggest to replace each constituent of the gravitating matter with a suitable quantum mechanical equivalent, here a Klien-Gordon (KG) or a Yukawa-ameliorated version of it, YKG field. KG and YKG fields are spatially distributed entities. They do not end up in singular spacetime points nor predict singular blackholes.
  On the other hand, YKG waves reach infinity as $\frac{1}{r}e^{-(\kappa\pm i k)r}$.
  They create the Newtonian $r^{-2}$ term as well as a non-Newtonian $r^{-1}$ force. The latter is capable of explaining the observed flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies, and is interpretable as an alternative gravity, a dark matter scenario, etc. There are ample observational data on flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies, coded in the Tully-Fisher relation, to support our propositions.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of one loop inflation in the light of CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one loop inflation stemming from the superstring theory and associated Yukawa coupling arising from supersymmetric interactions is examined with CMB. The Yukawa coupling can exist beyond standard model particle physics sector. The tensor to scalar ratio of the loop inflation is found consistent with the recent CMB results for the Yukawa coupling from cosmology. The newly derived constraint on the Yukawa coupling constant may play a crucial role in validating inflationary model originating from supersymmetry and may shed some light on the formation of dark matter or dark energy. The outcomes of the study may be helpful in the phenomenological realisation of string theory.</description>
