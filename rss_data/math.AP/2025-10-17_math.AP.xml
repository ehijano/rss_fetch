      <title>Time-harmonic scattering of plane waves from an infinite periodically inhomogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new radiation condition for an infinite inhomogeneous two-dimensional medium which is periodic in the vertical direction and remains invariant in the horizontal direction. The classical Rayleigh-expansion radiation condition does not apply to our case, because this would require the medium to be inhomogeneous in a half plane. We utilize the Floquet theory to derive upward/downward wave modes and define radiation conditions by expansions w.r.t. these modes. The downward radiation conditions leads to a downward Dirichlet-to-Neumann map which can be used to truncate the infinite inhomogeneous domain in the vertical direction. So we prove mapping properties of the upward/downward Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps based on the asymptotic behavior of high-order wave modes. Finally, we verify the strong ellipticity of the sesquilinear form corresponding to the new scattering problem and show the unique solvability for all wavenumbers with the exception of a countable set of numbers bounded below by a small positive constant.</description>

      <title>Exponential and algebraic decay in Euler--alignment system with nonlocal interaction forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large-time behavior of the pressureless Euler system with nonlocal velocity alignment and interaction forces, with the aim of characterizing the asymptotic convergence of classical solutions under general interaction potentials $W$ and communication weights. We establish quantitative convergence in three settings. In one dimension with $(\lambda,\Lambda)$-convex potentials, i.e., potentials satisfying uniform lower and upper quadratic bounds, bounded communication weights yield exponential decay, while weakly singular ones lead to sharp algebraic rates. For the Coulomb--quadratic potential $W(x)=-|x|+\frac12 |x|^2$, we prove exponential convergence for bounded communication weights and algebraic upper bounds for singular communication weights. In a multi-dimensional setting with uniformly $(\lambda,\Lambda)$-convex potentials, we show exponential decay for bounded weights and improved algebraic decay for singular ones. In all cases, the density converges (up to translation) to the minimizer of the interaction energy, while the velocity aligns to a uniform constant. A unifying feature is that the convergence rate depends only on the local behavior of communication weights: bounded kernels yield exponential convergence, while weakly singular ones produce algebraic rates. Our results thus provide a comprehensive description of the asymptotic behavior of Euler--alignment dynamics with general interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the non-linear wave at a buoy from shoreline data and applications to the tsunami inverse problem for piece-wise sloping bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the following inverse problem: given the run-up data of a tsunami wave, can we recover its initial shape? We study this problem within the framework of the non-linear shallow water equations, a model widely used to study tsunami propagation and inundation. Previously, it has been demonstrated that in the case of infinite sloping bathymetry, it is possible to recover the initial water displacement and velocity from shoreline readings \cite{Rybkin23,Rybkin24,Rybkin25}.
  We consider a finite sloping bathymerty. We show that it is possible to recover boundary conditions (water displacement and velocity) on a virtual buoy from the shoreline data. Further, we discuss stitching together the shallow water equations and the Boussinesq equation in a more complex piece-wise sloping bathymetry in order to recover the initial conditions, while incorporating the dispersion to our model.</description>

      <title>Propagation speed of traveling waves for diffusive Lotka-Volterra system with strong competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation speed of bistable traveling waves in the classical two-component diffusive Lotka-Volterra system under strong competition. From an ecological perspective, the sign of the propagation speed determines the long-term outcome of competition between two species and thus plays a central role in predicting the success or failure of invasion of an alien species into habitats occupied by a native species. Using comparison arguments, we establish sufficient conditions determining the sign of the propagation speed, which refine previously known results. In particular, we show that in the symmetric case, where the two species differ only in their diffusion rates, the faster diffuser prevails over a substantially broader parameter range than previously established. Moreover, we demonstrate that when the interspecific competition coefficients differ significantly, the outcome of competition cannot be reversed by adjusting diffusion or growth rates. These findings provide a rigorous theoretical framework for analyzing invasion dynamics, offering sharper mathematical criteria for invasion success or failure.</description>

      <title>Sobolev regularity for the perturbed fractional 1-Laplace equations in the subquadratic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the Sobolev regularity of solutions to perturbed fractional 1-Laplace equations. Under the assumption that weak solutions are locally bounded, we establish that the regularity properties are analogous to those observed in the superquadratic case. By introducing the threshold $\frac{p-1}{p}$, we divide the range of the parameter $s_p$ into two distinct scenarios. Specifically, for any $s_p\in \left(0, \frac{p-1}{p}\right]$ and $q\ge p$, we demonstrate that the solutions possess $W_{\rm loc}^{\gamma, q}$-regularity for all $\gamma\in \left(0, \frac{s_p p}{p-1}\right)$ and the $W_{\rm loc}^{1, q}$-regularity for any $s_p\in \left(\frac{p-1}{p}, 1\right)$ and $q\ge p$, respectively. Our analysis relies on the nonlocal finite-difference quotient method combined with a Moser-type iteration scheme, which provides a systematic approach to the regularity theory for such nonlocal and singular problems.</description>

      <title>Viscosity solutions posed on star-shaped network with Kirchhoff's boundary condition: Well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to establish the well-posedness of fully nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) posed on a star-shaped network, having nonlinear Kirchhoff's boundary condition at the vertex, and possibly degenerate. We obtain a comparison theorem, for discontinuous viscosity solutions, following the recent ideas obtained by Ohavi for second order problems, building test functions at the vertex solutions of Eikonal equations with well-designed coefficients. Another strong result obtained in this contribution is to show that any generalized Kirchhoff's viscosity solution introduced by Lions-Souganidis, is indeed a Kirchhoff's viscosity solution. In other terms, the values of the Hamiltonians are not required at the vertex in the analysis of these types of PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Parabolic PDEs on a fixed domain with evolving subdomains: function spaces and well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the necessary ingredients for the variational approach of initial boundary-value problems of parabolic partial differential equations on a fixed spatial domain containing evolving subdomains. In particular, we introduce function spaces for the variational solution that extend standard Sobolev-Bochner spaces to account for a coefficient associated with the time derivative that may be discontinuous across the evolving interface. We further show the density of smooth functions in these spaces by extending the mollification technique and the Reynolds transport theorem, and establish the corresponding "embedding" theory and an integration by parts formula. Finally, we prove the well-posedness of the space-time variational formulation in the natural setting using the Banach-Necas-Babuska theorem.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability of a class of explicit steady Euler flows in a disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a short proof of the $L^2$-orbital stability of a class of explicit steady Euler flows in a disk by establishing a quantitative estimate. The main idea is to exploit the conserved quantities of the Euler equation, including the kinetic energy, the enstrophy, and the moment of fluid impulse. Our result seems to suggest that more radial symmetry leads to stronger instability.</description>

      <title>On some Elliptic and Parabolic Problems Involving the Anisotropic $p(u)$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations driven by p(u) laplacian. This dependence necessitates the use of variable exponent Sobolev spaces specifically tailored to the anisotropic framework. For the elliptic case, we establish the existence of a weak solution by employing the theory of pseudomonotone operators in conjunction with suitable approximation techniques. In the parabolic setting, the existence of a weak solution is obtained via a time discretization scheme and Schauder fixed-point theorem, supported by a priori estimates and compactness arguments.</description>

      <title>Small-time approximate controllability of the logarithmic Schr\''dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Schr{\"o}dinger equations with logarithmic nonlinearity and bilinear controls, posed on $\mathbb{T}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove their small-time global $L^2$-approximate controllability. The proof consists in extending to this nonlinear framework the approach introduced by the first and third authors in \cite{beauchard-pozzoli2} to control the linear equation: it combines the small-time controllability of phases and gradient flows. Due to the nonlinearity, the required estimates are more difficult to establish than in the linear case. The proof here is inspired by WKB analysis. This is the first result of (small-time) global approximate controllability, for nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations, with bilinear controls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $s\in(0,1)$ and an open bounded set $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, we prove existence and uniqueness of absolute minimisers of the supremal functional $$E_\infty(u)=\|(-\Delta)^s u\|_{L^\infty(\mathbb R^n)},$$ where $(-\Delta)^s$ is the Fractional Laplacian of order $s$ and $u$ has prescribed Dirichlet data in the complement of $\Omega$. We further show that the minimiser $u_\infty$ satisfies the (fractional) PDE $$ (-\Delta)^s u_\infty=E_\infty(u_\infty)\,\mathrm{sgn}f_\infty \qquad\mbox{in }\Omega, $$ for some analytic function $f_\infty\in L^1(\Omega)$ obtained as the restriction of an $s$-harmonic measure $\mu$ in $\Omega$.</description>

Abstract: We study the time-harmonic Maxwell equations on bounded Lipschitz domains with an impedance boundary condition. The impedance coefficient can be matrix valued such that, in particular, a polarization dependent impedance is modeled. We derive a Fredholm alternative for this system. As a consequence, we obtain the existence of weak solutions for arbitrary sources when the frequency is not a resonance frequency. Our analysis covers the case of singular impedance coefficients.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation and stabilization for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations under the Geometric Control Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove global propagation of analyticity in finite time for solutions of semilinear Schr\"odinger equations with analytic nonlinearity from a region $\omega$ where the Geometric Control Condition holds. Our approach refines a recent technique introduced by Laurent and the author, which combines control theory techniques and Galerkin approximation, to propagate analyticity in time from a zone where observability holds. As a main consequence, we obtain unique continuation for subcritical semilinear Schr\"odinger equations on compact manifolds of dimension $2$ and $3$ when the solution is assumed to vanish on $\omega$. Furthermore, semiglobal control and stabilization follow only under the Geometric Control Condition on the observation zone. In particular, this answers in the affirmative an open question of Dehman, G\'erard, and Lebeau from $2006$ for the nonlinear case.</description>

      <title>The simultaneous effect of chemotaxis and alarm-taxis on the global existence and stability of a predator-prey system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines a fully parabolic predator-prey chemo-alarm-taxis system under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with a smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$. Under specific parameter conditions, it is shown that the system admits a unique, globally bounded classical solution. The convergence of the solution is established through the construction of an appropriate Lyapunov functional. In addition, numerical simulations are presented to validate the asymptotic behaviour of the solution. The results highlight the significant role of chemotaxis and alarm-taxis coefficients in determining the existence and stability of predator-prey models, as discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Stable Type I blow-up for the one-dimensional wave equation with time-derivative nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-time blow-up for the one-dimensional nonlinear wave equation with a quadratic time-derivative nonlinearity, \[ u_{tt}-u_{xx}=(u_t)^2,\qquad (x,t)\in\mathbb R\times[0,T). \] Building on the work of Ghoul, Liu, and Masmoudi \cite{ghoul2025blow} on the spatial-derivative analogue, we establish the non-existence of smooth, exact self-similar blow-up profiles. Instead we construct an explicit family of \emph{generalised self-similar} solutions, bifurcating from the ODE blow-up, that are smooth within the past light cone and exhibit type-I blow-up at a prescribed point \((x_0,T)\). We further prove asymptotic stability of these profiles under small perturbations in the energy topology. In particular, these profiles verify that the spatially homogeneous ODE blow-up is not asymptotically stable.</description>

      <title>Vortex lines interaction in the three-dimensional magnetic Ginzburg--Landau model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete our study of the three dimensional Ginzburg--Landau functional with magnetic field, in the asymptotic regime of a small inverse Ginzburg--Landau parameter $\varepsilon$, and near the first critical field $H_{c_1}$ for which the first vortex filaments appear in energy minimizers. Under a nondegeneracy condition, we show a next order asymptotic expansion of $H_{c_1}$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$, and exhibit a sequence of transitions, with vortex lines appearing one by one as the intensity of the applied magnetic field is increased: passing $H_{c_1}$ there is one vortex, then increasing $H_{c_1}$ by an increment of order $\log |\log\varepsilon|$ a second vortex line appears, etc. These vortex lines accumulate near a special curve $\Gamma_0$, solution to an isoflux problem. We derive a next order energy that the vortex lines must minimize in the asymptotic limit, after a suitable horizontal blow-up around $\Gamma_0$. This energy is the sum of terms where penalizations of the length of the lines, logarithmic repulsion between the lines and magnetic confinement near $\Gamma_0$ compete. This elucidates the shape of vortex lines in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Diameter bounds in 3d Type I Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a three dimensional compact Ricci flow that encounters a Type I singularity has uniformly bounded diameter up to the singular time, thus giving an affirmative answer - for Type I singularities - to a conjecture of Perelman. To achieve this, we introduce a concept of a neck-region for a Ricci flow, analogous to the neck-regions introduced by Jiang-Naber and Cheeger-Jiang-Naber, in the study of Ricci limit spaces. We then prove that the associated packing measure is, in a certain sense, Ahlfors regular, a result that holds in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Multiscaling asymptotic behavior of solutions to random high-order heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies high-order partial differential equations with random initial conditions that have both long-memory and cyclic behavior. The cases of random initial conditions with the spectral singularities, both at zero (representing classical long-range dependence) and at non-zero frequencies (representing cyclic long-range dependence), are investigated.
  Using spectral methods and scaling techniques, it is proved that, after proper rescaling and normalization, the solutions converge to Gaussian random fields. For each type of equation, spectral representations and covariance functions of limit fields are given. For odd-order equations, we apply the kernel averaging of solutions to obtain nonexplosive and nondegenerate limits. It is shown that the different limit fields are determined by the even or odd orders of the equations and by the presence or absence of a spectral singularity at zero. Several numeric examples illustrate the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is on surfaces with a constant ratio of principal curvatures. These CRPC surfaces generalize minimal surfaces but are much more challenging to construct. We propose a construction of a family of such surfaces containing a given minimal surface without flat points. This leads to a partial solution of Plateau's problem for CRPC surfaces. We obtain analogous results in isotropic geometry. This work illustrates a general approach to solving Euclidean problems by starting with their isotropic analogs. Besides, we apply the method of successive approximations and analytic majorization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10103v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the stochastic two-scale convergence method in the framework of Orlicz-Sobolev spaces, in order to deal with the homogenization of coupled stochastic-periodic problems in such spaces. One fundamental in this topic is the extension of compactness results for this method to the Orlicz setting. For the application, we show that the sequence of minimizers of a class of highly oscillatory minimizations problems involving integral functionals with convex and nonstandard growth integrands, converges to the minimizer of a homogenized problem.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the global stability of large solutions to the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain with Navier-slip boundary conditions. It is shown that the strong solutions converge to an equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^2$-norm provided the density is essentially uniform-in-time bounded from above. Moreover, we obtain that the density converges to its equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^\infty$-norm if additionally the initial density is bounded away from zero. Furthermore, we derive that the vacuum states will not vanish for any time provided vacuum appears (even at a point) initially. This is the first result concerning the global stability for large strong solutions of compressible Navier-Stokes equations with vacuum in 3D general bounded domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the global stability of large solutions to the compressible isentropic magnetohydrodynamic equations in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain with Navier-slip boundary conditions. It is shown that the solutions converge to an equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^2$-norm provided the density is essentially uniform-in-time bounded from above. Moreover, we also obtain that the density and magnetic field converge to their equilibrium states exponentially in the $L^\infty$-norm if additionally the initial density is bounded away from zero. These greatly improve the previous work in (J. Differential Equations 288 (2021), 1-39), where the authors considered the torus case and required the $L^6$-norm of the magnetic field to be uniformly bounded as well as zero initial total momentum and an additional restriction $2\mu&gt;\lambda$ for the viscous coefficients. This paper provides the first global stability result for large strong solutions of compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations in 3D general bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Stability and large-time behavior for the N-Dimensional Euler-FENE dumbbell model near an equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the N-dimensional FENE dumbbell model without velocity dissipation, focusing on the stability and decay of perturbations near the steady solution $(0,\pin)$. Due to the lack of velocity dissipation, the above problems are highly challenging. In fact, without coupling, the corresponding N-dimensional Euler equation near u=0 is well known to be unstable. To overcome this difficulty, we analyze the wave structure arising in the system governing perturbations around the steady state, which originates from the equilibrium configuration and the coupling effects. This wave structure enables us to establish the global stability in the $H^s$-type Sobolev norms. Also, we highlight the critical role of wave structure in the decay estimates of the Euler-FENE dumbbell model. By combining this property with the Fourier splitting method, we derive the decay rate, which is identical to that of the general FENE dumbbell with velocity dissipation.</description>

      <title>The Fujita exponent for a heat equation with mixed local and nonlocal nonlinearities on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with the problems of local and global solvability for a semilinear heat equation on the Heisenberg group involving a mixed local and nonlocal nonlinearity. The characteristic features of such equations, arising from the interplay between the geometric structure of the Heisenberg group and the combined nonlinearity, are analyzed in detail. The need to distinguish between subcritical and supercritical regimes is identified and justified through rigorous analysis. On the basis of the study, the author suggests precise conditions under which local-in-time mild solutions exist uniquely for regular, nonnegative initial data. It is proved that global existence holds under appropriate growth restrictions on the nonlinear terms. To complement these results, it is shown, by employing the capacity method, that solutions cannot exist globally in time when the nonlinearity exceeds a critical threshold. As a result, the Fujita exponent is formulated and identified as the dividing line between global existence and finite-time blow-up. In addition, lifespan estimates were obtained in the supercritical regime, providing insight into how the size of the initial data influences the time of blow-up.</description>

      <title>Maximal regularity of Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian in Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus of this work is on the homogeneous and non-homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian in bounded Lipschitz domains (BLD). Although it has been extensively studied by many authors, we would like to return to a number of fundamental questions and known results, such as the traces and the maximal regularity of solutions. First, to treat non-homogeneous boundary conditions, we rigorously define the notion of traces for non regular functions. This approach replaces the non-tangential trace notion that has dominated the literature since the 1980s. We identify a functional space E = \{v\in H^{1/2}(\Omega);\nabla v\in [H^1/2(\Omega)]'\} for which the trace operator is continuous from $E$ into $L^2(\Gamma)$. Second, we address the regularity of solutions to the Laplace equation with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. Using specific equivalent norms in fractional Sobolev spaces and Grisvard's results for polygons and polyhedral domains, we prove that maximal regularity $H^{3/2}$ holds in any BLD $\Omega$, for all right-hand sides in the dual of $H^{1/2}_{00}(\Omega)$. This conclusion contradicts the prevailing claims in the literature since the 1990s. Third, we describe some criteria which establish new uniqueness results for harmonic functions in Lipschitz domains. In particular, we show that if $u\in H^{1/2}(\Omega)$ or $u\in W^{1, 2N/(N+1)}(\Omega)$, is harmonic in $\Omega$ and vanishes on $\Gamma$, then $u= 0$. These criteria play a central role in deriving regularity properties. Finally, we revisit the classical Area Integral Estimate. Using Grisvard's work and an explicit function given by Necas, we show that this inequality cannot hold in its stated form. Since this estimate has been widely used to argue that $H^{3/2}$-regularity is unattainable for data in the dual of $H^{1/2}_{00}(\Omega)$, our counterexample provides a decisive clarification.</description>

Abstract: We consider the following nonlocal critical problem with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions, \begin{equation} \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  (-\Delta)^su=\lambda u+|u|^{2_s^*-2}u &amp;\text{in}\ \Omega,\\ \mkern+38.5mu u=0&amp; \text{on}\ \Sigma_{\mathcal{D}},\\ \mkern+24mu \displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=0 &amp;\text{on}\ \Sigma_{\mathcal{N}},
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation} where $(-\Delta)^s$, $s\in (1/2,1)$, is the spectral fractional Laplacian operator, $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$, $N&gt;2s$, is a smooth bounded domain, $2_s^*=\frac{2N}{N-2s}$ denotes the critical fractional Sobolev exponent, $\lambda&gt;0$ is a real parameter, $\nu$ is the outwards normal to $\partial\Omega$, $\Sigma_{\mathcal{D}}$, $\Sigma_{\mathcal{N}}$ are smooth $(N-1)$--dimensional submanifolds of $\partial\Omega$ such that $\Sigma_{\mathcal{D}}\cup\Sigma_{\mathcal{N}}=\partial\Omega$, $\Sigma_{\mathcal{D}}\cap\Sigma_{\mathcal{N}}=\emptyset$ and $\Sigma_{\mathcal{D}}\cap\overline{\Sigma}_{\mathcal{N}}=\Gamma$ is a smooth $(N-2)$--dimensional submanifold of $\partial\Omega$. By employing a $\nabla$-theorem we prove the existence of multiple solutions when the parameter $\lambda$ is in a left neighborhood of a given eigenvalue of $(-\Delta)^s$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Special Relativity, massless objects are characterized as either vacuum states or as radiation propagating at the speed of light. This distinction extends to General Relativity for asymptotically flat initial data sets (IDS) \((M^n, g, k)\), where vacuum is represented by slices of Minkowski space, and radiation is modeled by slices of \(pp\)-wave spacetimes. In contrast, we demonstrate that asymptotically hyperboloidal IDS with zero mass must embed isometrically into Minkowski space, with no possible IDS configurations modeling radiation in this setting. Our result holds under the most general assumptions. The proof relies on precise decay estimates for spinors on level sets of spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by $2N$ complex numbers $(\boldsymbol{\lambda}, \boldsymbol{c})$ where $\boldsymbol{\lambda}\in\mathbb{C}_+^N$ are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator, and $ \boldsymbol{c}\in\mathbb{C}^N\backslash \{0\}$ are the norming constants of the corresponding eigenfunctions. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues to be i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support in the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the expectation of the random measure associated to this random spectral data. Such expectation uniquely identifies, via the Zakharov-Shabat inverse spectral problem, a solution $\psi_\infty(x,t)$ of the fNLS equation. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution.
  We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss all the possible pairs $(u,c)\in C(M,\mathbb R)\times\mathbb R$ solving (in the sense of viscosity) the contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation \[ H (x, d_xu, u) = c,\quad x\in M \] of which $M$ is a closed manifold and the continuous Hamiltonian $H: (x,p,u)\in T^*M\times\mathbb R\rightarrow\mathbb R$ is convex, coercive in $p$ but merely non-decreasing in $u$. Firstly, we propose a comparison principle for solutions by using the dynamical information of Mather measures. We then describe the structure of $\mathfrak C$ containing all the $c\in\mathbb R$ makes previous equation solvable. We also propose examples to verify the optimality of our approach.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the diameter comparison, the global weighted volume comparison and the splitting theorem in weighted manifolds when the infinity-Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature has a lower bound in the spectrum sense. Our results extend Antonelli-Xu's spectral Bonnet-Myers and Bishop-Gromov theorems, and Antonelli-Pozzetta-Xu's spectral splitting theorem to weighted manifolds. Our results are also some supplements of Chu-Hao's spectral diameter and global volume comparisons, and Yeung's spectral splitting theorem in weighted manifolds.</description>

      <title>Adapting Noise to Data: Generative Flows from 1D Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for constructing generative models using one-dimensional noising processes. Beyond diffusion processes, we outline examples that demonstrate the flexibility of our approach. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework in which the 1D processes themselves are learnable, achieved by parameterizing the noise distribution through quantile functions that adapt to the data. Our construction integrates seamlessly with standard objectives, including Flow Matching and consistency models. Learning quantile-based noise naturally captures heavy tails and compact supports when present. Numerical experiments highlight both the flexibility and the effectiveness of our method.</description>
