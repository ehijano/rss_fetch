      <title>Two Types of $1/f$ Range in Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $1/f$ noise is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural systems. Since the advent of space exploration, the $1/f$ range has been consistently observed in \textit{in situ} solar wind measurements throughout the heliosphere, sparking decades of debate regarding its origin. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations near the Alfv\'en surface have revealed a systematic absence of the $1/f$ range in pristine solar wind, providing a unique opportunity to investigate its origin in solar wind turbulence. Despite numerous observations of the $1/f$ range at varying frequencies, no study has systematically examined its properties across different solar wind conditions. Here, we identify two distinct types of $1/f$ ranges in solar wind turbulence: the fast/Alfv\'enic wind type and the slow/mixed wind type. The fast/Alfv\'enic type appears to be an intrinsic feature of Alfv\'enic turbulence, while the slow/mixed type resembles classical flicker noise. For the fast/Alfv\'enic type, we find a near-perfect WKB evolution of the frequency-averaged fluctuation amplitude and an intriguing migration pattern in frequency space. For the slow/mixed type, we examine the solar cycle dependence of the $1/f$ noise using the OMNI-LRO dataset spanning solar cycles 22 to 25. We also analyze the autocorrelation function of the magnetic field vectors and identify a clear relationship between the $1/f$ range and the decline in correlation, as well as unexpected resonance peaks in the autocorrelation function.</description>

      <title>The effect of plasma-$\beta$ on the heating mechanisms during magnetic reconnection in partially ionized low solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection with different strength of magnetic fields from the solar photosphere to the upper chromosphere. The main emphasis is to identify dominant mechanisms for heating plasmas in the reconnection region under different plasma-$\beta$ conditions in the partially ionized low solar atmosphere. The numerical results show that more plasmoids are generated in a lower $\beta$ reconnection event. The frequent coalescence of these plasmoids leads to a significant enhancement of turbulence and compression heating, which becomes the dominant mechanism for heating plasma in a lower plasma-$\beta$ reconnection process. The average power density of the compression heating (Q$_{comp}$) decreases with increasing initial plasma-$\beta$ as a power function: Q$_{comp} \sim \beta_{0}^{-a}$, where the value $a$ is $1.9$ in the photosphere and decreases to about 1.29 in the upper chromosphere. In the photosphere and lower chromosphere, the joule heating contributed by electron-neutral collisions Q$_{en}=\eta_{en} J^2$ eventually dominates over the compression heating when the initial plasma-$\beta$ is larger than the critical value $\beta_{0-critical} = 8$. In the upper chromosphere, the ambipolar diffusion heating and the viscous heating will become equally important as the compression heating when the initial plasma-$\beta$ is larger than the critical value $\beta_{0-critical} = 0.5$. These results indicate that the compression heating caused by turbulent reconnection mediated with plasmoids is likely the major heating mechanism for the small-scale reconnection events with stronger magnetic fields such as active region EBs and UV bursts. However, the heating caused by the partial ionization effects can not be ignored for those reconnection events with weaker magnetic fields such as quiet Sun EBs and cold surges.</description>

      <title>On accretion in the polar V379 Vir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on optical and infrared survey data spanning $\approx 20$ years of observations, the long-term variability of the polar V379 Vir with a brown dwarf secondary has been studied. By modeling the spectral energy distribution, we constrain the white dwarf's mass to $M_1 = 0.61 \pm 0.05~M_{\odot}$ and its effective temperature to $T_{eff} = 10930 \pm 350~K$. Near-infrared photometry yields a donor radius of $R_2 = 0.095 \pm 0.018 R_{\odot}$ and temperature $T_{eff} = 1600 \pm 180 K$. Modeling of the cyclotron emission from the accretion spot, detected with the Spitzer infrared telescope, gives an accretion rate of $\dot{M} \approx 3 \times 10^{-13} M_{\odot}/yr$. This rate is consistent with polars in a low accretion state, but significantly higher than expected from wind-driven mass transfer.</description>

      <title>The largest Forbush decrease in 20 years: Preliminary analysis of SEVAN network observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a preliminary analysis of the largest Forbush Decrease (FD) observed in solar cycle 25 using SEVAN network data. Triggered by consecutive Earth-directed CMEs on May 30 and 31, 2025, this event produced two distinct FD minima and a prolonged recovery, with significant anisotropies in cosmic ray response across the network. The timing of interplanetary shock arrivals was confirmed by SSC signatures at 05:22 UTC on June 1 and 10:19 UTC on June 2, marking the onset of each FD phase. The depth and temporal structure of the FD varied across SEVAN detectors, providing insights into the complex heliospheric and magnetospheric dynamics during this multi-CME event.</description>

      <title>In pursuit of the low-energy Solar neutron flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of low-energy solar neutrons flux is crucial for probing solar energetic processes and neutron transport mechanisms in interplanetary space. This study investigates the role of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in modulating the low-energy solar neutrons. The neutron flux is modeled by incorporating a CME-width scaling factor into existing neutron fluence models. Our analysis, based on CME data from the SECHHI COR2 database during the DANSON experiment (2016-10-27 to 2017-03-17), identified narrow-width (20$^\circ$ $&lt;$ $\alpha$ $&lt;$ 80$^\circ$) and fast (v $&gt;$ 800 km/s) CMEs as key contributors to neutron production. The revised model predicts a neutron flux of 5 - 49 neutrons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1 AU for a neutron travel time of 1.66 hours, aligning with previous reports. Additionally, the estimated total flux of 2.45 MeV neutrons over a 4-hour period accounts for 10.23\% of DANSON's total flux. These findings suggest that CME-driven mechanisms may significantly influence the low-energy solar neutron flux. More observational efforts are needed to refine neutron flux estimates and improve background subtraction techniques for spaceborne neutron detectors.</description>

      <title>Counter-Streaming Velocities in a Quiescent Filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filaments/prominences are cold plasma (~ 10000 K) embedded in the solar corona, two orders of magnitude hotter. Filament plasma is structured by the magnetic field in thin elongated threads. Counter-streaming flows have been observed. The aim of this paper is to characterize these flows. For that, we use high spatial resolution observations of spectral data obtained with THEMIS in H-alpha and with IRIS in Mg II k lines on 29 September 2023. We best detect counter-streaming flows in both the blue and red wings of these spectral lines. They are forming long Doppler shifted strands slightly inclined on the filament axis. The blue/red shift alternates across the strands at the arc second scale. H-alpha spectral profiles with large widths are interpreted as formed by multi-strands with opposite velocity directions. The absorption in the core of Mg II k line is also broader than in the chromosphere. This corresponds also to counter-streaming velocities. We derive that a fraction of the filament plasma is moving at supersonic speed (of the order of 20 km/s ) with the assumption that the filament is optically thick. We conclude that the counter-directed Doppler shifts might not be magnetic field aligned flows but rather correspond to kink transverse oscillations of the magnetic field with independent motions in nearby strands.</description>

      <title>Detailed Chemical Abundance Analysis of Metal-Poor Turn-Off Stars: One with [Fe/H] &lt; -4 and Three with [Fe/H] &lt; -4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of four new extremely metal poor turn-off stars thanks to high-resolution spectra obtained with the Subaru/HDS spectrograph. We determined the abundances and upper limits of Li, C, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. Metallicities range from [Fe/H] = -3.3 to -4.4 dex. For one of the stars, we measure the lithium abundance Log(Li/H) = 2.1 {\pm} 0.2. Two stars of the sample have low [{\alpha}/Fe] abundances. The most metal-poor star of the sample with [Fe/H] = -4.42 dex has a high [Sr/Fe] abundance ratio [Sr/Fe] = 0.9 dex, a high value also found in HE 1327-2326. This star is the second-most iron-poor star observed with Subaru telescope, suggesting that more ultra metal-poor stars could be discovered using high-resolution spectrographs in the Northern Hemisphere.</description>

      <title>On the Penumbra-to-Umbra Ratio from 1660 to 1676</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspot engravings made in the Maunder minimum are used to evaluate the fine structure of sunspots. Based on 78 images of the full solar disk and 77 images of individual sunspots, we have evaluated the ratio of penumbral-to-umbral area (P/U) to be 4.2 $\pm$ 2.5 and 3.8 $\pm$ 2.3, respectively. These results are consistent with previous estimates before, during, and after the Maunder minimum, as well as with the P/U ratio observed in the largest sunspot groups in solar cycle 24. This suggests that the near-surface convection mode has most likely remained unchanged since the early seventeenth century. We also found that schematic sunspot drawings tend to underestimate the P/U ratio.</description>

      <title>The undetectable fraction of core-collapse supernovae in luminous infrared galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large fraction of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) in luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) remain undetected due to extremely high line-of-sight host galaxy dust extinction, and strong contrast between the SN and the galaxy background in the central regions of LIRGs, where the star formation is concentrated. This fraction of undetected CCSNe, unaccounted for by typical extinction corrections, is an important factor in determining CCSN rates, in particular at redshifts $z \gtrsim 1$, where LIRGs dominate the cosmic star formation. Our aim is to derive a robust estimate for the undetected fraction of CCSNe in LIRGs in the local Universe. Our study is based on the K-band multi-epoch SUNBIRD survey data set of a sample of eight LIRGs using the Gemini-North Telescope with the ALTAIR/NIRI laser guide star adaptive optics system. We used simulated SNe and a standard image subtraction method to determine limiting detection magnitudes for the data set. Subsequently, we used a Monte Carlo method to combine the limiting magnitudes with the survey cadence, and an adopted distribution of CCSN subtypes and their light curve evolution to determine SN detection probabilities. Lastly, we combined these probabilities with the intrinsic CCSN rates of the sample galaxies estimated based on their detailed radiative transfer modeling to derive the fraction of undetectable CCSNe in local LIRGs. For high angular resolution near-infrared surveys, we find an undetectable fraction of $66.0^{+8.6}_{-14.6}$\%, assuming that CCSNe with host extinctions up to $A_V$ = 16 mag are detectable, corresponding to the most obscured CCSN discovered in our data set. Alternatively, assuming a host extinction limit of $A_V$ = 3 mag, corresponding to typical optical surveys, we find an undetectable CCSN fraction of $89.7^{+2.6}_{-4.4}$\%.</description>

      <title>X-ray and Optical Analysis of the Prototype Polar AN UMa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a long-term optical and X-ray photometric study of AN UMa, one of the prototypical polar-type cataclysmic variables, tracing more than 34 years of its accretion history. Observations from both ground-based and space-based facilities have been analysed to investigate state transitions within the system. Throughout this period, significant changes in the light curve have been observed, corresponding to different mass accretion states. From four years of TESS photometry, we derive a revised photometric period that agrees with the spectroscopic period to within 1.2$\sigma$. These optical observations further suggest switching between two accretion poles. During intervals of high accretion, dips in the X-ray light curve indicate that the primary accretion pole is obscured by an accretion stream elevated above the orbital plane, a feature also evident in the TESS light curves. Additionally, periodogram analysis reveals a periodicity of $\approx$437 days, which may be related to long-term accretion state changes. Following a 16-year high state, AN UMa entered two short-lived low states, lasting 180 and 123 days, during which it faded to a magnitude of 19.2, as recorded by the ZTF and ATLAS surveys. Using the system's low-state brightness and the distance provided by Gaia, we estimate that the system may have a white dwarf with an effective temperature of $\approx$15000~K, and a donor of spectral type M4.7. This work provides a useful reference for future studies of polars with variable accretion geometries and highlights the importance of long-term, multi-wavelength monitoring in the study of magnetic cataclysmic variables.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Heating of Diffuse Coronal Plasma in a Solar Active Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar corona is much hotter than lower layers of the solar atmosphere-photosphere and chromosphere. The coronal temperature is up to 1MK in quiet sun areas, while up to several MK in active regions, which implies a key role of magnetic field in coronal heating. This means that understanding coronal heating requires reliable modeling of the underlying three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structure of an active region validated by observations. Here we employ synergy between 3D modeling, optically thick gyroresonant microwave emission, and optically thin EUV emission to (i) obtain and validate the best magneto-thermal model of the active region and (ii) disentangle various components of the EUV emission known as diffuse component, bright loops, open field regions, and "moss" component produced at the transition region. Surprisingly, the best thermal model corresponds to high-frequency energy release episodes, similar to a steady-state heating. Our analysis did not reveal significant deviations of the elemental abundances from the standard coronal values.</description>

      <title>Validate the bright Gaia celestial reference frame with new VLBI astrometry of radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist inconsistencies between the bright and faint Gaia Celestial Reference Frame 3 (Gaia-CRF3), which manifests as a systematic rotation and needs to be independently estimated then corrected in future data releases. We collected 64 radio stars with VLBI astrometry, of which 16 have new VLBI observations with reference epochs close to Gaia. We estimated the orientation and spin biases of the bright Gaia-CRF3 by comparing VLBI radio star astrometry with their Gaia DR3 counterparts. We also attempted to estimate orientation by utilizing the a priori magnitude-dependent spin parameters derived from Gaia internal estimation. Our independent estimation of the orientation at G&lt;10.5 is [-15\pm119, +330\pm139,+218\pm109] uas (J2016.0), and the spin ([+21\pm18, +52\pm20,-7\pm20] uas/yr) agrees with Gaia internal estimation within 1-sigma range. The orientation-only estimation suggests that the orientation bias of the bright Gaia-CRF3 may also be magnitude-dependent.</description>

      <title>Metal-polluted PopIII galaxies and How to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observing Population III (PopIII) galaxies, the hosts of first-generation stars, remains challenging even with the JWST. The current few candidates have been identified through the combination of a prominent HeII emission and the absence of metal lines, a well-known but extremely brief signature of metal-free systems. Here, we accurately model the evolution of the emission from PopIII galaxies to increase the number of candidates in JWST observations. To achieve this, we employ a locally calibrated galaxy-formation model that self-consistently follows the star formation and chemical evolution initiated by the first stars. We find that PopIII galaxies can emit metal lines in their ``self-polluted'' phase, while galaxies host only metal-free stars but the gas has been chemically-enriched by the first supernovae. In this phase, PopIII galaxies have $\rm [OIII]/H\beta \approx 1$, which opens the pool of candidates to more easily detectable sources. We predict that the high HeII emission of PopIII galaxies can last up to $\rm \approx 20 \, Myrs$ and that it is partly maintained in the ``hybrid'' phase, when PopIII and PopII stars co-exist in the host galaxy. We propose novel diagnostics involving UV metal lines to select PopIII candidates in high-z JWST surveys. In JADES, we identify 9 candidate galaxies with $&gt;25\%$ of their stellar mass in metal-free stars, showcasing the effectiveness of our method. Ultimately, the key to discovering PopIII galaxies could be to catch them during their first episodes of chemical enrichment.</description>

      <title>Current Galactic Chemical Evolution models fail to explain rising Na-abundances of young thick disc stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently identified an upturn in [Na/Fe] for the population of Solar-type stars in the Galactic thick disc ($-0.3 &lt; [\mathrm{Fe/H}] &lt; +0.3$ dex) at super-Solar metallicity in GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) data. Here, we investigate the cause of this unexplained Na enrichment between ([Fe/H] $\sim 0 - 0.6$ dex) using the OMEGA$+$ galactic chemical evolution code. We investigate the increase of [Na/Fe] with four combinations of nucleosynthetic yields from the literature, with source contributions from core-collapse supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and Type Ia supernovae. We focus on two possible causes for the Na-enhancement: the "metallicity effect" resulting from core-collapse supernovae at super-Solar metallicity and the contribution of metal-rich AGB stars. We adopt two sets of Type Ia supernova yields with one model assuming only Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, and another assuming only sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We find that the assumed Type Ia explosion has little effect on the [Na/Fe] Galactic chemical evolution modelling, and all Galactic chemical evolution models tested fail to reproduce the observed [\mathrm{Na/Fe}] enrichment in the young thick disc population at super-Solar metallicities. Our study indicates a possible "under-pollution effect" by SNe Ia, which are the dominant producers of iron, in the Galactic disc's Solar-type star population. These findings provide a step forward toward understanding the origin of the unexplained sodium enrichment at super-Solar metallicities in the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>Dark matter admixed relativistic stars: Structural properties and tidal Love numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of bosonic, self-interacting dark matter on structural properties and tidal deformabilities of compact stars. As far as the gravitational theory is concerned, we assume Einstein's gravity in four dimensions with a vanishing cosmological constant. Regarding matter content, we consider a state-of-matter to a linear form of equation-of-state (EoS), while for dark matter we assume a quartic scalar potential, which implies a certain non-linear EoS obtained long time ago. Adopting the two-fluid formalism we integrate the structure equations as well as the Riccati equation for the metric even perturbations imposing appropriate initial conditions at the center of the stars and matching conditions at their surface. We compute the stellar mass and radius, factor of compactness and dimensionless deformability varying several free parameters of the model studied here. Tidal deformability and the corresponding tidal Love number determine the imprint of the underlying EoS within the signals emitted during binary coalescences, and it is expected to be altered due to the presence of dark matter inside the objects. We find that in all cases considered here, the dimensionless deformability of the canonical stellar mass remains lower than the upper bound, $\Lambda_{1.4} &lt; 800$. We also look at the stability of these stars based on the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion under various conditions. It is observed that the presence of dark matter implies significantly lower highest stellar mass, and also smaller and more compact stars for a given stellar mass.</description>

      <title>Planetary Obliquity Excitation Through Pre-Main Sequence Stellar Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A planet's axial tilt ("obliquity") substantially affects its atmosphere and habitability. It is thus essential to comprehend the various mechanisms that can excite planetary obliquities, particularly at the primordial stage. Here, we explore planetary obliquity excitation induced by the early evolution of the host star. A young, distended star spins rapidly, resulting in a large gravitational quadrupole moment that induces nodal recession of the planet's orbit. As the star contracts and spins down, the nodal recession frequency decreases and can cross the planet's spin axis precession frequency. An adiabatic encounter results in the planet's capture into a secular spin-orbit resonance and excites the obliquity to large values. We find planets within $a \lesssim 1 \ \mathrm{AU}$ are most affected, but adiabatic capture depends on the initial stellar radius and spin rate. The overall picture is complicated by other sources of perturbation, including the disk, multiple planets, and tidal dissipation. Tides make it such that stellar oblateness-induced obliquity excitation is transient since tidal perturbations cause the resonance to break once high obliquities are reached. However, this early transient excitation is important because it can prime planets for long-term capture in a secular spin-orbit resonance induced by planet-planet interactions. Thus, although stellar oblateness-induced resonances are short-lived, they facilitate the prevalence of long-lived non-zero obliquities in exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The completeness of the open cluster census towards the Galactic anticentre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open clusters have long been used as tracers of Galactic structure. However, without a selection function to describe the completeness of the cluster census, it is difficult to quantitatively interpret their distribution. We create a method to empirically determine the selection function of a Galactic cluster catalogue. We test it by investigating the completeness of the cluster census in the outer Milky Way, where old and young clusters exhibit different spatial distributions. We develop a method to generate realistic mock clusters as a function of their parameters, in addition to accounting for Gaia's selection function and astrometric errors. We then inject mock clusters into Gaia DR3 data, and attempt to recover them in a blind search using HDBSCAN. We find that the main parameters influencing cluster detectability are mass, extinction, and distance. Age also plays an important role, making older clusters harder to detect due to their fainter luminosity function. High proper motions also improve detectability. After correcting for these selection effects, we find that old clusters are $2.97\pm0.11$ times more common at a Galactocentric radius of 13~kpc than in the solar neighbourhood -- despite positive detection biases in their favour, such as hotter orbits or a higher scale height. The larger fraction of older clusters in the outer Galaxy cannot be explained by an observational bias, and must be a physical property of the Milky Way: young outer-disc clusters are not forming in the outer Galaxy, or at least not with sufficient masses to be identified as clusters in Gaia DR3. We predict that in this region, more old clusters than young ones remain to be discovered. The current presence of old, massive outer-disc clusters could be explained by radial heating and migration, or alternatively by a lower cluster destruction rate in the anticentre.</description>

      <title>A complete census of planet-hosting binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the effect binarity can have on planet-formation is of crucial importance, as almost half of field stars reside in multiple systems. One effective way to assess this effect is to get an accurate picture of the population of planet-hosting binaries and compare its characteristics to that of field star binaries. We construct an extensive database, collected from intensive literature exploration, to achieve a complete census of all planet-hosting binaries known to date. Despite the heterogeneous character of the different surveys this database is built on, and the biases and selection effects that unavoidably affect any sample of planet-hosting binaries, we look for statistically significant trends and correlations within our sample. Our database provides the characteristics for 759 systems (among which 31 circumbinaries), which is an increase by a factor of 9 with respect to the previous complete census of planet-hosting binaries. Of the 728 S-type systems, 651 are binaries, 73 are triples and 4 are quadruples. The raw distribution of planet-hosting binary separations peaks around 500\,au instead of 50\,au for field binaries. By analyzing the distribution of on-sky angular separations as a function of distance $d_b$ to the systems we argue that the observed deficit of planet-hosting close-in binaries cannot be explained solely by observational biases. Likewise, by exploring how multiplicity fractions among planet-hosts vary with $d_b$ we suggest that the subsample of known planet-hosting binaries at $&lt;500\,$pc is not bias-dominated (but not bias-free). In this $&lt;500\,$pc domain, the multiplicity fraction of planet-hosting stars is $\sim22.5\%$, approximately half of the value for field stars, and the deficit of planet-hosting binaries extends to separations of $\sim500\,$au, giving an approximate estimate of the detrimental effect binarity has on planet-formation</description>

      <title>Analytical transit light curves for power-law limb darkening: a comprehensive framework via fractional calculus and differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete analytical framework for computing exoplanetary transit light curves with arbitrary power-law limb darkening profiles $I(\mu) \propto \mu^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ can be any real number greater than $-1/2$, including the physically important non-integer cases. While the groundbreaking work of Agol et al. (2020) provided exact analytical solutions for polynomial limb darkening through recursion relations, stellar atmosphere models often favor power-law forms with fractional exponents (particularly $\alpha = 1/2$) that remained analytically intractable until now. We solve this fundamental limitation through two complementary mathematical approaches: (1) Riemann-Liouville fractional calculus operators that naturally handle non-integer powers through exact integral representations, and (2) a continuous differential equation framework that generalizes discrete polynomial recursions to arbitrary real exponents. Our method provides exact analytical expressions for all half-integer powers ($\alpha = k/2$) essential for 4-term limb darkening law by Claret (2000), maintains machine precision even at geometric contact points where numerical methods fail, and preserves the computational speed advantages crucial for parameter fitting. We demonstrate that the square-root limb darkening ($\alpha = 1/2$) favored by recent stellar atmosphere studies can now be computed analytically with the same efficiency as traditional quadratic models, achieving 10--100$\times$ speed improvements over numerical integration while providing exact analytical derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $g$-mode oscillations in dark matter admixed neutron stars employing a relativistic mean field model to describe hadronic matter and a model for self-interacting fermionic dark matter motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. Following the construction of such admixed configurations, we derive the equilibrium and adiabatic speeds of sound therein, leading to a computation of the star's $g$-mode spectrum in the Cowling approximation. In particular, we explore the effect of dark matter self-interaction, the nucleon effective mass and dark matter fraction on the principal $g$-mode frequency, and its first overtone. We show that the effect on $g$-mode frequency depends predominantly on the dark matter fraction, and demonstrate an equation of state-independent constraint for the latter. Prospects of identifying the presence of dark matter in neutron stars using $g$-mode are discussed.</description>

      <title>Episodic mass loss in the very luminous red supergiant [W60] B90 in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into [W60] B90, one of the most luminous and extreme Red Supergiants (RSGs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), aiming to search for evidence of episodic mass loss. Our discovery of a bar-like nebular structure at 1 pc, reminiscent of the bar around Betelgeuse, raised the question of whether [W60] B90 also has a bow shock. We collected and analyzed proper motion data from Gaia, as well as new multi-epoch spectroscopic and imaging data, and archival time-series photometry in the optical and mid-infrared. We found [W60] B90 to be a walkaway star, with a supersonic peculiar velocity in the direction of the bar. We detected shocked emission between the bar and the star, based on the [S II]/H$\alpha$ &gt; 0.4 criterion, providing strong evidence for a bow shock. The 30-year optical light curve revealed semi-regular variability, showing three similar dimming events with $\Delta V \sim 1$ mag, a recurrence of $\sim$12 yr, and a rise time of 400 d. We found the mid-IR light curve to vary by 0.51 mag and 0.37 mag in the WISE1 and WISE2 bands, respectively, and by 0.42 mag and 0.25 mag during the last dimming event. During this event, optical spectroscopy revealed spectral variability (M3I to M4I), a correlation between the $T_{\rm eff}$ and the brightness, increased extinction, and, after the minimum, spectral features incompatible with the models. We also found a difference of &gt;300 K between the $T_{\rm eff}$ measured from the TiO bands in the optical and the atomic lines from our $J$-band spectroscopy. We inferred that [W60] B90 is a more massive analog of Betelgeuse in the LMC and the first extragalactic single RSG with a suspected bow shock. Its high luminosity $\log(L/L_{\odot})=5.32$, mass-loss rate, and mid-IR variability compared to other RSGs in the LMC, indicate that it is in an unstable evolutionary state undergoing episodes of mass loss.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between light curves of ellipsoidal variables with massive dark companions, contact binaries, and semidetached binaries using principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photometric methods for identifying dark companion binaries - binary systems hosting quiescent black holes and neutron stars - operate by detecting ellipsoidal variations caused by tidal interactions. The limitation of this approach is that contact and semidetached binaries can produce similarly looking light curves. In this work, we address the degeneracy of ellipsoidal light curves by studying the differences between synthetically generated light curves of dark companion, semidetached, and contact binary systems. We inject the light curves with various levels of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise to simulate the effects of instrumental noise and stellar spots. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition, we construct low-dimensional representations of the light curves. We find that the first two to five PCA components are sufficient to explain $99\%$ of variance in the data. The PCA representations are generally more informative than the Fourier representation for the same number of coefficients as measured by both the silhouette scores of the representations and the macro recalls of random forest classifiers trained on the representations. The random forest classifiers reach macro recalls from $0.97$ to $0.70$, indicating that the classes remain largely separable even under adverse conditions. We find that instrumental noise significantly impacts the class separation only when its standard deviation exceeds $10^{-3}$ mag, whereas the presence of spots can markedly reduce the class separation even when they contribute as little as $1\%$ of the light curve amplitude. We discuss the application of our method to real ellipsoidal samples, and we show that we can increase the purity of a sample of dark companion candidates by a factor of up to $27$ if we assume a prior purity of $1\%$, significantly improving the cost-efficiency of follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Zones of Tayler Instability in Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tayler instability (TI) of toroidal magnetic fields is a candidate mechanism for driving turbulence, angular momentum (AM) transport, and dynamo action in stellar radiative zones. Recently \cite{Skoutnev_2024} revisited the linear stability analysis of a toroidal magnetic field in a rotating and stably stratified fluid. In this paper, we extend the analysis to include both thermal and compositional stratification, allowing for general application to stars. We formulate an analytical instability criterion for use as a ``toggle switch" in stellar evolution codes. It determines when and where in a star the TI develops with a canonical growth rate as assumed in existing prescriptions for AM transport based on Tayler-Spruit dynamo. We implement such a ``toggle switch" in the MESA stellar evolution code and map out the stability of each mode of the TI on a grid of stellar evolution models. In evolved lower mass stars, the TI becomes suppressed in the compositionally stratified layer around the hydrogen burning shell. In higher mass stars, the TI can be active throughout their radiative zones, but at different wavenumbers than previously expected.</description>

      <title>The impact of wind accretion in Evolving Symbiotic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of geometric corrections to the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion scheme applied to evolving symbiotic systems. We model systems where 0.7 and 1 M$_\odot$ white dwarfs accrete material from Solar-like stars with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 M$_\odot$. The primary star is evolved using the MESA stellar evolution code, while the orbital dynamics of the system are calculated using REBOUND. The analysis focuses on systems evolving through the red giant branch and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phases that do not experience a Wind Roche Lobe Overflow phase. We compare three scenarios: no accretion, standard BHL accretion, and the improved wind accretion. The choice of accretion prescription critically influences the evolution of symbiotic systems. Simulations using the modified model did not reach the Chandrasekhar limit, suggesting that type Ia supernova progenitors require accretors originating from ultra-massive WDs. In contrast, the standard BHL model predicts WD growth to this limit in compact systems. This discrepancy suggests that population synthesis studies adopting the traditional BHL approach may yield inaccurate results. The revised model successfully reproduces the accretion properties of observed symbiotic systems and predicts transitions between different accretion regimes driven by donor mass-loss variability. These results emphasize the need for updated wind accretion models to accurately describe the evolution of symbiotic binaries.</description>

Abstract: We aim to determine the physical properties of OB stars from the multi-epoch VLT/FLAMES BLOeM spectroscopic survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We apply a pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of OB stars to the co-added, initial 9 epochs of the BLOeM survey, utilising grids of synthetic model spectra computed with the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND. 69 OB stars are excluded from the analysis owing to disk emission or significant contamination by secondaries in SB2 binaries. We determine physical properties of 778 OB stars, including Teff, log g, log L/Lsun and v_e sin i. There appears to be a bimodality in v_e sin i of single O stars, while v_e sin i distributions of OB stars are strikingly different for single (median 78 km/s) and binary (median 200 km/s) systems. Inferred temperatures are broadly in agreement with literature results for stars in common, plus results from a grid-based automization tool for a subset of O and early B stars, although uncertainties are larger for surface gravities. Rotational velocities are broadly in line with an independent tool applied to the same subset. We recover the anticipated lower mass cutoff at 8 Msun from the survey design using a Bayesian inference method coupled with SMC metallicity evolutionary models, with median masses of 12.6 Msun (19.8 Msun) for B-type (O-type) stars. Spectroscopic masses exceed evolutionary masses, albeit with large uncertainties in surface gravities. We also provide an updated catalogue of O stars in the SMC since half of the 159 BLOeM O stars are newly classified as O-type stars.</description>

      <title>Intense Hard X-ray Emissions in C-class Flares: A Statistical Study with ASO-S/HXI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12294</link>

Abstract: In the standard model of solar eruptive events, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares are associated with each other through magnetic reconnection initiated by erupting flux ropes. Observations also reveal an increasing association ratio between flares and CMEs with flare intensity. However, the fundamental relationship between flares and CMEs, and that between thermal and nonthermal processes, remains unknown. Here we investigate energetic C-class flares (ECFs) -- Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) C-class flares with hard X-ray (HXR) emissions above 30 keV -- using observations from Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory/Hard X-ray Imager (HXI), Solar Dynamic Observatory, and GOES. Among 1331 C-class flares detected by HXI, 127 ECFs (9.5%) were identified for statistical analysis of their properties and associations with CMEs and other flare-related features. Our statistical results reveal that ECFs have relatively shorter durations and harder spectra (the mean electron power-law index is 4.65), with no significant correlation between soft X-ray flux and nonthermal parameters (e.g., HXR peak flux). Among the 127 events, 53 (42%) were associated with type III bursts, 38 (30%) with jets, at least 13 (~11%) with 360 nm brightenings, and only 5 (~4%) with CMEs. Crucially, all five CME events were narrow CMEs associated with jets. The surprising correlation between these ECFs and CMEs suggests that noneruptive or confined magnetic field configurations in these flares may favor electron acceleration, resulting in harder X-ray spectra.We discuss the potential formation mechanisms and efficient electron acceleration processes in these atypical flares, providing valuable insights into nonstandard flare behavior.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters III: Probability of Binary Black Holes Hidden in Gaia Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03662</link>

Abstract: The Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered a few candidates of non-interacting single black holes (BHs) and visible stars, Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3, collectively called ``astrometric BH binaries''. This paper investigates whether any of these candidates harbor binary BHs (BBHs), namely, whether any such candidates are previously undiscovered ``astrimetric BBH triples''. Focusing on open star clusters, which are promising formation sites of astrometric BH binaries, we estimate the formation rate of astrometric BBH triples through gravitational $N$-body simulations. We find a competitively high formation efficiency of astrometric BBH triples ($\sim 10^{-6} {\rm M}_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$\% of astrometric BH binaries) in low-metallicity environments but no astrometric BBH triples in solar-metallicity environments. Most of the astrometric BBH triples in our simulations were dynamically stable for $10$ Gyrs, indicating that $\sim10$\% of astrometric BH binary candidates may indeed harbor inner BBHs if they originate from open star clusters in low-metallicity environments. Astrometric BBH triples can be distinguished from astrometric BH binaries through radial velocity follow-up of the tertiary star. According to the statistics of our simulated samples, a small percent of astrometric BH binary candidates should exhibit detectable radial-velocity modulations generated by inner BBHs. Such candidates preferentially exhibit ``outer'' orbital periods of $\gtrsim 10^3$ days and moderately high ``outer'' orbital eccentricities ($\gtrsim 0.7$). Our current result will strongly motivate the search for astrometric BBH triples in the upcoming Gaia Data Release 4 and Gaia Final Data Release.</description>

      <title>Probing fermionic asymmetric dark matter cores using global neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is possible for asymmetric dark matter (ADM) to accumulate in neutron star interiors and affect their global properties. Considering the effects of this accumulation, neutron star mass-radius measurements can deliver new insights into the cold dense matter equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we employ Bayesian parameter estimation using real and synthetic neutron star mass-radius data to infer constraints on the combined baryonic matter and fermionic ADM EoS, where the fermionic ADM forms a core in the neutron star interior. Using currently available mass-radius data, we find that the lower bound of the ratio between ADM effective self-repulsion strength ($g_\chi/m_\phi$) and particle mass ($m_\chi$) can be constrained at the 68\% (95\%) credible level to $10^{-6.59}$ ($10^{-7.77}$). We also find that, if neutron star mass-radius measurement uncertainties are reduced to the 2\% level, the constraints on the lower bound of the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ can be improved to $10^{-6.49}$ and $10^{-7.68}$ at the 68\% and 95\% credible levels, respectively. However, all other combinations, of $m_\chi$, $g_\chi$, and the ADM mass-fraction, $F_\chi$, (i.e., the ratio of the gravitational ADM mass to the gravitational mass of the neutron star) are unconstrained. Furthermore, in the pressure-energy density and mass-radius planes, the inferences which include the possibility of fermionic ADM cores are nearly identical with the inferences that neglect fermionic ADM for $F_\chi \leq 1.7\%$ and neutron star mass-radius uncertainties $\geq 2\%$. Therefore, we find that neutron star mass-radius measurements can constrain the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ and that neutron stars with ADM are indistinguishable from purely baryonic stars. This implies that neutron stars with ADM are equally as consistent with the available mass-radius data as neutron stars without ADM.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a variable yellow supergiant progenitor for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a progenitor candidate for the Type~IIb SN2024abfo using multi-epoch pre-explosion images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The progenitor exhibited a ~0.7 mag decline in F814W from 2001 to 2013, followed by significant brightening and color fluctuations in the g, r and z bands. This is the first time that substantial photometric variability has been found for the progenitor of a SN IIb. We suggest that the variability is caused by intrinsic changes in the progenitor star instead of varying obscuration by circumstellar dust. Our results show that the progenitor of SN2024abfo was likely a yellow supergiant star with an initial mass of 12--18 Msun for circumstellar reddening of E(B-V)_CSM &lt; 0.2 mag. Our study underscores the critical role of multi-epoch imaging surveys in revealing the final stages of core-collapse supernovae progenitors.</description>

      <title>Linear Thermal Instability of a Condensing Gas-Particle Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of a hot saturated gas coexisting with condensed particles in an optically thin medium. Such a situation may obtain downstream of a shock, at condensation fronts, or in vaporizing impacts. We show that the gas-particle mixture is subject to a thermal instability whereby a region of lower temperature and higher condensate density cools faster to condense faster. If the region of runaway condensation has a sound-crossing time shorter than its cooling time, then it accretes more mass, in gas and particles, from its higher pressure surroundings. Numerical integration of the linearized perturbation equations demonstrates that this radiation-condensation instability can create particle clumps and voids out of a secularly cooling gas. Provided radiation can escape to cool particle overdensities, thermal instability can help assemble chondrite parent bodies out of the vaporized debris of asteroid collisions, and form planetesimals generally.</description>

      <title>CORALIE radial-velocity search for companions around evolved stars (CASCADES) IV: New planetary systems around HD 87816, HD 94890, and HD 102888 and an update on HD 121056</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With around 200 detections of exoplanets around giant stars to date, our knowledge of the population of exoplanets orbiting evolved hosts more massive than the Sun remains limited. The CORALIE radial-velocity search for companions around evolved stars (CASCADES) was launched in 2006 with the aim of improving our understanding of the demographics of exoplanets around intermediate-mass stars, by studying them once they have evolved off the main sequence. We intend to refine the current sample of known exoplanets orbiting intermediate-mass (1.5 - 5 M$_\odot$) giant stars of spectral types G and early K. We searched for exoplanets orbiting the four stars HD 87816, HD 94890, HD 102888, and HD 121056. We used data obtained with the CORALIE spectrograph, mounted on the Leonhard Euler Swiss telescope located at La Silla Observatory in Chile. We gathered high-precision radial-velocity measurements over more than ten years for each of the aforementioned targets. We started by performing a search for periodic signals in the radial-velocity time series of the four targets by using periodograms. Following this, we fit for a Keplerian model using the significant peak with the highest power of the periodogram as the starting guess for the period. We then subtracted this model and repeated the procedure iteratively on the residuals until no significant peaks were found. Finally, to explore the posterior distribution of our models, the final solution was determined using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We report the discovery of five new massive planets around HD 87816, HD 94890, and HD 102888 as well as the presence of a distant, potentially substellar, companion around HD 102888. We confirm the presence of a previously announced exoplanet orbiting the HD 121056 multi-object system with a period of 89 days and propose an update to the period of the outer companion.</description>

      <title>Protostellar disks in their natural habitat -- the formation of protostars and their accretion disks in the turbulent and magnetized interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present simulations of the supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) in a simulation domain of volume $(256\,{\rm pc})^3$ within which we resolve the formation of protostellar accretion disks and their stellar cores to spatial scales of $\sim 10^{-4}$ au, using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We perform simulations with no magnetic fields, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and ambipolar diffusion, and compare the resulting first Larson cores and their associated structures, including the accretion disks, their location within the larger-scale structure and the streamers connecting these. We find that disks of sizes $10-100\,{\rm au}$ form early in the simulations without magnetic fields, while there are no disks larger than 10 au with ideal MHD. Ambipolar diffusion causes large disks to form in a subset of cases (two out of six cores), and generally reduces the strength of outflows, which are seen to play a central role. When they are able to carry away significant angular momentum, they prevent the formation of a rotationally supported disk. Magnetic fields strengths grow from $0.1 - 1$ mG in the protostellar core to more than 10 G in the first Larson core in all simulations with ideal MHD. The rotationally supported disks which form can have rotation speeds $&gt; 1$ km s$^{-1}$ even out to further than 100 au from the centre, become gravitationally unstable and form complex spiral substructures with Toomre $Q &lt; 1$. We conclude that the impact of magnetic fields and non-ideal MHD on the formation of protostellar disks is substantial in realistic formation scenarios from the turbulent ISM.</description>
