      <title>Enhancing Portfolio Optimization with Deep Learning Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work focuses on deep learning (DL) portfolio optimization, tackling challenges in long-only, multi-asset strategies across market cycles. We propose training models with limited regime data using pre-training techniques and leveraging transformer architectures for state variable inclusion. Evaluating our approach against traditional methods shows promising results, demonstrating our models' resilience in volatile markets. These findings emphasize the evolving landscape of DL-driven portfolio optimization, stressing the need for adaptive strategies to navigate dynamic market conditions and improve predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimal Option Portfolios for Student t Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explicit solution for optimal option portfolios under variance and Value at Risk (VaR) minimization when the underlying returns follow a Student t-distribution. The novelty of our paper is the departure from the traditional normal returns setting. Our main contribution is the methodology for obtaining optimal portfolios. Numerical experiments reveal that, as expected, the optimal variance and VaR portfolio compositions differ by a significant amount, suggesting that more realistic tail risk settings can lead to potentially more realistic portfolio allocations.</description>

      <title>Feasibility-First Satellite Integration in Robust Portfolio Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of thematic satellite allocations into core-satellite portfolio architectures is commonly approached using factor exposures, discretionary convictions, or backtested performance, with feasibility assessed primarily through liquidity screens or market-impact considerations. While such approaches may be appropriate at institutional scale, they are ill-suited to small portfolios and robustness-oriented allocation frameworks, where dominant constraints arise not from return predictability or trading capacity, but from fixed costs, irreversibility risk, and governance complexity. This paper develops a feasibility-first, non-predictive framework for satellite integration that is explicitly scale-aware. We formalize four nested feasibility layers (physical, economic, structural, and epistemic) that jointly determine whether a satellite allocation is admissible. Physical feasibility ensures implementability under concave market-impact laws; economic feasibility suppresses noise-dominated reallocations via cost-dominance threshold constraints; structural feasibility bounds satellite size through an explicit optionality budget defined by tolerable loss under thesis failure; and epistemic feasibility limits satellite breadth and dispersion through an entropy-based complexity budget. Within this hierarchy, structural optionality is identified as the primary design principle for thematic satellites, with the remaining layers acting as robustness lenses rather than optimization criteria. The framework yields closed-form feasibility bounds on satellite size, turnover, and breadth without reliance on return forecasts, factor premia, or backtested performance, providing a disciplined basis for integrating thematic satellites into small, robustness-oriented portfolios.</description>

      <title>Utility-Weighted Forecasting and Calibration for Risk-Adjusted Decisions under Trading Frictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting accuracy is routinely optimised in financial prediction tasks even though investment and risk-management decisions are executed under transaction costs, market impact, capacity limits, and binding risk constraints. This paper treats forecasting as an econometric input to a constrained decision problem. A predictive distribution induces a decision rule through a utility objective combined with an explicit friction operator consisting of both a cost functional and a feasible-set constraint system. The econometric target becomes minimisation of expected decision loss net of costs rather than minimisation of prediction error. The paper develops a utility-weighted calibration criterion aligned to the decision loss and establishes sufficient conditions under which calibrated predictive distributions weakly dominate uncalibrated alternatives. An empirical study using a pre-committed nested walk-forward protocol on liquid equity index futures confirms the theory: the proposed utility-weighted calibration reduces realised decision loss by over 30\% relative to an uncalibrated baseline ($t$-stat -30.31) for loss differential and improves the Sharpe ratio from -3.62 to -2.29 during a drawdown regime. The mechanism is identified as a structural reduction in the frequency of binding constraints (from 16.0\% to 5.1\%), preventing the "corner solution" failures that characterize overconfident forecasts in high-friction environments.</description>
