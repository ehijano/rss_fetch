      <title>Statistical Mechanics Calculations Using Variational Autoregressive Networks and Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical mechanics, computing the partition function is generally difficult. An approximation method using a variational autoregressive network (VAN) has been proposed recently. This approach offers the advantage of directly calculating the generation probabilities while obtaining a significantly large number of samples. The present study introduces a novel approximation method that employs samples derived from quantum annealing machines in conjunction with VAN, which are empirically assumed to adhere to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. When applied to the finite-size Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, the proposed method demonstrates enhanced accuracy compared to the traditional VAN approach and other approximate methods, such as the widely utilized naive mean field.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced spin selectivity by variable-range hopping along DNA double helix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We here present a variable-range hopping model to describe the chirality-induced spin selectivity along the DNA double helix. In this model, DNA is considered as a one-dimensional disordered system, where electrons are transported by chiral phonon-assisted hopping between localized states. Owing to the coupling between the electron spin and the vorticity of chiral phonons, electric toroidal monopole appears in the charge-to-spin conductances as a manifestation of true chirality. Our model quantitatively explains the temperature dependence of the spin polarization observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce fermionic machine learning (FermiML), a machine learning framework based on fermionic quantum computation. FermiML models are expressed in terms of parameterized matchgate circuits, a restricted class of quantum circuits that map exactly to systems of free Majorana fermions. The FermiML framework allows for building fermionic counterparts of any quantum machine learning (QML) model based on parameterized quantum circuits, including models that produce highly entangled quantum states. Importantly, matchgate circuits are efficiently simulable classically, thus rendering FermiML a flexible framework for utility benchmarks of QML methods on large real-world datasets. We initiate the exploration of FermiML by benchmarking it against unrestricted PQCs in the context of classification with random quantum kernels. Through experiments on standard datasets (Digits and Wisconsin Breast Cancer), we demonstrate that FermiML kernels are on-par with unrestricted PQC kernels in classification tasks using support-vector machines. Furthermore, we find that FermiML kernels outperform their unrestricted candidates on multi-class classification, including on datasets with several tens of relevant features. We thus show how FermiML enables us to explore regimes previously inaccessible to QML methods.</description>

      <title>KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.</description>

      <title>Storage Capacity Evaluation of the Quantum Perceptron using the Replica Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum perceptron implemented on a quantum circuit using a repeat until method. We evaluate this from the perspective of capacity, one of the performance evaluation measures for perceptions. We assess a Gardner volume, defined as a volume of coefficients of the perceptron that can correctly classify given training examples using the replica method. The model is defined on the quantum circuit. Nevertheless, it is straightforward to assess the capacity using the replica method, which is a standard method in classical statistical mechanics. The reason why we can solve our model by the replica method is the repeat until method, in which we focus on the output of the measurements of the quantum circuit. We find that the capacity of a quantum perceptron is larger than that of a classical perceptron since the quantum one is simple but effectively falls into a highly nonlinear form of the activation function.</description>

      <title>The replica-symmetric free energy for Ising spin glasses with orthogonally invariant couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (S-K) spin glass model with external field, where the random symmetric couplings matrix does not consist of i.i.d. entries but is instead orthogonally invariant in law. For sufficiently high temperature, we prove a replica-symmetric formula for the first-order limit of the model free energy. Our analysis is an adaptation of a conditional second-moment-method argument previously introduced by Bolthausen for studying the high-temperature regime of the S-K model, where one conditions on the iterates of an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for solving the TAP equations for the model magnetization. We apply this method using a memory-free version of AMP that is tailored to the orthogonally invariant structure of the model couplings.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rate and security of quantum communications between users placed at arbitrary points of a quantum communication network depend on the structure of the network, on its extension and on the nature of the communication channels. In this work we propose a strategy for the optimization of trusted-relays based networks that intertwines classical network approaches and quantum information theory. Specifically, by suitably defining a quantum communication efficiency functional, we identify the optimal quantum communication connections through the network by balancing security and the quantum communication rate. The optimized network is then constructed as the network of the maximal quantum communication efficiency connections and its performance is evaluated by studying the scaling of average properties as functions of the number of nodes and of the network spatial extension.</description>
