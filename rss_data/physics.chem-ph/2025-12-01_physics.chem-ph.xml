      <title>Electronic Transport Switching by Electric field Driven Tautomerism in Single and Fused Metal-free Benziporphyrins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity of many metal-free porphyrins (MFPs) to exhibit different H-bonded tautomers provides a platform for exploring the effects of reversible molecular changes on electronic transport. On-surface and molecular junction experiments have shown that tautomerism in single MFPs can be controlled by the magnitude of the current passing through them. Such conductance-based results confirm the potential for tautomeric switching but are not easily translated into device applications, where faster electric-field-gated switching is generally preferred. Previous work has focused on highly symmetric MFPs with four identical pyrrole rings, in which tautomers correspond to different H-N configurations of two protons. Here, we consider a synthesized metal-free benziporphyrin in which one pyrrole ring is replaced by a phenol moiety. This modification lowers the symmetry and increases the tautomer-dependence of the electronic state. The structural anisotropy of benziporphyrins also enhances their selective response to applied E-fields. Here, we use density functional theory and quantum electron-transport calculations to assess: (i) the statistical distribution of three distinct benziporphyrin tautomers under different applied E-fields, and (ii) the transport characteristics of each tautomer. We find that moderate E-fields can influence the tautomerism and that each tautomer exhibits distinct transport signatures, confirming that single metal-free benziporphyrins have potential to act as three-state molecular switches. By fusing two benziporphyrins, we show that the larger manifold of tautomeric states retains distinct transport signatures, opening the way to multistate molecular registers. Finally, we show that fused benziporphyrins can also act as molecular wires with enhanced conductance relative to a single unit.</description>

      <title>QuantumChem-200K: A Large-Scale Open Organic Molecular Dataset for Quantum-Chemistry Property Screening and Language Model Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of next-generation photoinitiators for two-photon polymerization (TPP) is hindered by the absence of large, open datasets containing the quantum-chemical and photophysical properties required to model photodissociation and excited-state behavior. Existing molecular datasets typically provide only basic physicochemical descriptors and therefore cannot support data-driven screening or AI-assisted design of photoinitiators. To address this gap, we introduce QuantumChem-200K, a large-scale dataset of over 200,000 organic molecules annotated with eleven quantum-chemical properties, including two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections, TPA spectral ranges, singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) energies, toxicity and synthetic accessibility scores, hydrophilicity, solubility, boiling point, molecular weight, and aromaticity. These values are computed using a hybrid workflow that integrates density function theory (DFT), semi-empirical excited-state methods, atomistic quantum solvers, and neural-network predictors. Using QuantumChem-200K, we fine tune the open-source Qwen2.5-32B large language model to create a chemistry AI assistant capable of forward property prediction from SMILES. Benchmarking on 3000 unseen molecules from VQM24 and ZINC20 demonstrates that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy over GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B, and the base Qwen2.5-32B model, particularly for TPA and ISC predictions central to photoinitiator design. QuantumChem-200K and the corresponding AI assistant together provide the first scalable platform for high-throughput, LLM-driven photoinitiator screening and accelerated discovery of photosensitive materials.</description>

      <title>A rigorous adiabatic approach to ultracold atom-molecule collisions in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the rigorous adiabatic coupled-channel formalism to ultracold nonreactive atom-molecule collisions in the presence of an external magnetic field. The wavefunction of the collision complex is expanded in adiabatic basis states obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for the adiabatic Hamiltonian (the total Hamiltonian of the collision complex minus the radial kinetic energy) on a grid of atom-molecule distances $R$. The resulting coupled-channel equations are solved using the diabatic-by-sector method. We show that the adiabatic approach provides accurate cross sections for cold and ultracold Mg ($^1$S) + NH ($^3\Sigma^-$) collisions in a magnetic field with ~2 times fewer channels than the standard diabatic basis. We further develop an efficient $R$-dependent basis truncation protocol (RBT), in which the elements of the log-derivative matrix are sampled and discarded as it is propagated from small to large $R$. While RBT can be applied in both the adiabatic and diabatic bases, we show that the adiabatic basis can be reduced to just the open channels at long range, leading to an overall computational gain of ~15-30 for the propagation part of the calculation. The gain is particularly significant in situations where substantial errors in the calculated cross sections ($&lt;$50\%) can be tolerated or long-range interactions are involved, making the adiabatic basis formulation a promising approach to strongly anisotropic collisions and chemical reactions in the presence of an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy with quantum entangled photons: Idler-referenced timing without pump detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photons have attracted increasing interest as resources for developing time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Theoretical studies suggest that their non-classical correlations enable time-resolved spectroscopy with monochromatic pumping and can selectively isolate specific Liouville pathways in nonlinear optical signals. In an earlier study, we proposed a fluorescence detection scheme that could, in principle, be implemented using existing single-photon detectors [Y. Fujihashi et al., arXiv:2502.02073 (2025)]. In that design, the time origin was defined by detecting the arrival of the pulsed laser used to pump the nonlinear crystal for spontaneous parametric down-conversion, a requirement that made the overall experiment cumbersome. This study theoretically examines an alternative protocol that defines the reference time based on the arrival of idler photons. We demonstrate that this idler-referenced scheme functions effectively when the entangled photons exhibit either negative or negligible frequency correlations. Eliminating the pump-timing channel simplifies the optical layout and lowers the experimental barrier to realizing time-resolved two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy with entangled photons. Although the photons may exhibit frequency correlations in isolation, their frequency-time degrees of freedom can behave as effectively uncorrelated when considered over the full measurement timescale. Therefore, fully exploiting non-classical correlations requires an entangled photon source whose temporal characteristics are carefully matched to the overall timescale of the experiment.</description>

      <title>Predicting complete basis set limit quasiparticle energies from triple-$\zeta$ calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple linear model to estimate the basis set incompleteness errors (BSIE) of (vertex-corrected) $GW$ QP energies based on the kinetic energy of the corresponding orbital only. We parametrise the model for $G_0W_0$, quasi-particle self-consistent $GW$ (qs$GW$), and vertex-corrected ($\Sigma^{BSE}@L^{BSE}$) QP energies on a large set of molecules containing 10 different elements for which we calculate complete basis set (CBS) limit extrapolated reference values with correlation-consistent basis sets ranging from triple- to hextuple-$\zeta$ (TZ/6Z). Based on these accurate reference values, we obtain model parameters for Gaussian-type and Slater-type orbital (GTO/STO) basis sets which allow for the extrapolation of QP energies calculated with TZ basis sets to the CBS limit with errors of 20 to 30 meV. Analysing extrapolation errors, we show the commonly used extrapolation method which assumes an inverse linear dependence of the BSIE on the inverse number of basis functions to be valid, but to produce larger errors, even when a quadruple-$\zeta$ calculation is used in the extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous double-layer restructuring in water-in-salt electrolytes at graphitic interfaces governs capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL) at carbon electrodes strongly influence electrochemical performance, yet remain poorly understood in super-concentrated aqueous electrolytes. Here we combine classical and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations to resolve the interfacial organisation of aqueous LiCl from dilute to water-in-salt (WiS) (1--$20~\mathrm{mol~kg^{-1}}$) concentrations at graphitic electrodes, and compare with electrochemical differential-capacitance measurements from which the potential of zero charge (PZC) is obtained. We uncover a concentration-driven restructuring of the EDL: below $6~\mathrm{mol~kg^{-1}}$, solvated Li$^+$ dominates the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), but at higher concentrations co-adsorption of Cl$^-$ through solvent-separated ion pairs enforces a near 1:1 Li:Cl ratio at the interface. This transition expands the effective EDL thickness, redistributes the interfacial potential drop, and drives a decrease in the PZC, matching the trend inferred from differential-capacitance measurements on electrolyte-graphite interfaces. Capacitance calculations reveal that while both EDL and quantum contributions vary strongly with concentration, their opposing trends make the total capacitance appear nearly constant for pristine few-layer graphite; for electrodes with smaller quantum capacitance, however, the concentration dependence of the EDL capacitance would be directly reflected in the total capacitance. Solvent-separated ion pairing is identified as the key driver of anomalous EDL behaviour in LiCl WiS electrolytes, establishing design considerations for tuning interfacial capacitance and stability in next-generation aqueous energy-storage systems.</description>

      <title>How Thermostats Influence Dynamics Across Time Scales: A Systematic Study from Fast Motions to Slow Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable dynamical properties from molecular dynamics simulations require careful control of thermostatting artifacts. We systematically assess how NVE, deterministic thermostats, velocity-rescale dynamics, and stochastic Langevin-type thermostats affect time-correlation functions across liquids of varying complexity. The analysis spans vibrational spectra, velocity and pressure autocorrelations, diffusion coefficients, shear viscosities, and Markov state models. Deterministic thermostats and velocity-rescale dynamics closely reproduce NVE reference data over all observables. In contrast, strongly coupled stochastic thermostats (tau less 1 ps) systematically distort dynamical properties. By constrast, moderate stochastic coupling (tau eq. 1 ps) restores near-NVE behavior while maintaining canonical sampling. Our results provide practical guidelines for selecting thermostat schemes when accurate dynamical properties or Markov models are required.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Model for the Chemistry of a Solvated Electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular simulations, machine-learning force fields can achieve ab initio accuracy at a lower cost but remain limited in the explicit modeling of electrons. In this work, we develop an electron-aware machine-learning force field, in which an excess electron of interest is modeled quantum mechanically, while the remaining short-range interactions and long-range Coulombic forces are machine-learned to reproduce a density functional theory calculation. We demonstrate the method on the solvated electron in bulk water and its reaction with a hydronium ion. We identify a proton transfer mechanism by which the excess proton recombines with the electron. We determine the forward reaction rates between 350 K and 450 K from first-passage survival functions, which yield an Arrhenius relationship with an activation energy of 3.2 kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$, in good agreement with experiment. From an enhanced sampling simulation, we determine the equilibrium constant, and thus the reaction free energy, which is also consistent with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Toward Unified Interphase Engineering: The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase in Batteries and Supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of next-generation electrochemical energy storage requires devices that combine the high energy density of batteries with the power capability and long cycle life of supercapacitors. However, the interfacial phenomena governing performance in these systems remain poorly unified. The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanoscale film formed by electrolyte decomposition, is well studied in batteries but its counterpart in supercapacitors has received limited systematic investigation despite growing experimental evidence. This review argues that SEI formation is a universal electrochemical process that occurs whenever electrode potentials drive electron transfer into electrolyte orbitals beyond their stability limits, independent of whether charge storage is Faradaic or non-Faradaic. Differences between battery SEIs and supercapacitor interphases arise mainly from operating conditions, not fundamental chemistry. Engineered interphases created through electrolyte additives, protective coatings, or surface functionalization suppress leakage currents, improve capacitance retention, and enable stable high-voltage operation. By identifying shared mechanisms and establishing transferable design rules, this unified framework provides a foundation for predictive interphase engineering that supports long-lived, high-performance energy-storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and resource advantages of quantum eigenvalue estimation with non-Hermitian transcorrelated electronic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In electronic structure calculations, the transcorrelated method enables a reduction of the basis set size by incorporating the electron-electron correlations directly into the Hamiltonian. However, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian, which makes many common quantum algorithms inapplicable. Recently, a quantum eigenvalue estimation algorithm was proposed for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra [FOCS 65, 1051 (2024)]. Here we investigate the cost of this algorithm applied to transcorrelated electronic Hamiltonians of second-row atoms and compare it to the cost of applying standard qubitization to non-transcorrelated Hamiltonians. We find that the ground state energy of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian in the STO-6G basis is more accurate than that of a standard Hamiltonian in the cc-pVQZ basis. The T gate counts of the two methods are comparable, while the qubit count of the transcorrelated method is 2.5 times smaller.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optical Quantum Communication with a Two-Dimensional Perovskite Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (2D-OIHP) quantum wells are emerging as promising light sources for quantum communication technologies, owing to their ability to generate polarization-encoded optical signals. In this work, we explore how nonlinear optical phenomena can be exploited for quantum information applications, demonstrating the versatility that arises from resonant coupling among excited states. By tracking changes in the ellipticities of signal photons on femtosecond timescales in four-wave-mixing experiments, we first establish a method for information encoding based on exciton spin dynamics and biexciton correlations. Using single-photon detection, we then implement the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol by mapping these polarization states onto binary sequences. While the polarizations of weak coherent pulses are typically manipulated with optical elements in traditional quantum key distribution approaches, the intrinsic electronic structure and spin relaxation processes within the 2D-OIHP system determine the characteristics of the signal photons in our method. As a demonstration, an ASCII message consisting of 56 bits is transmitted through the polarization states of photons emitted by 2D-OIHP quantum wells. These results show that the information transmission efficiency depends strongly on contributions from biexciton states, highlighting the potential of spin-dependent nonlinear optical processes for quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Ligand-like Molecules through Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization in Density Matrix Embedding Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate treatment of electron correlation in extended molecular systems remains computationally challenging using classical electronic structure methods. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a potential route to overcome these limitations; however, their practical deployment on existing quantum computers requires strategies that both reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise. In this work, we combine Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to compute ground-state energies of a set of natural ligand-like molecules in the minimal Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) basis set. DMET provides a systematic fragmentation of a molecule into embedded impurity subproblems, while SQD enables construction and classical diagonalization of reduced configuration spaces through quantum sampling enhanced by iterative configuration recovery. The resulting embedded Hamiltonians are solved on IBM's Eagle R3 superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Sherbrooke). The DMET-SQD energies obtained for all systems considered exhibit strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmark values within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). These results demonstrate that sample-based quantum methods, when integrated with a robust embedding framework, can reliably extend quantum computation towards simulation of chemically relevant molecular systems, showcasing potential applications in the field of drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Excited state preparation on a quantum computer through adiabatic light-matter coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to transform simulations of quantum many-body problems at the heart of electronic structure theory. Efficient quantum algorithms to compute the eigenstates of fermionic Hamiltonians, such as quantum phase estimation, rely critically on high-accuracy initial state preparation. While several state preparation algorithms have been proposed for fermionic ground states, the preparation of excited states remains a major challenge, limiting the applicability of quantum algorithms to photochemistry and photophysics. In this contribution, we describe a physically motivated adiabatic state preparation technique for low-lying excited states using the explicit coupling between electrons and photons. Our approach systematically converges to the first optically accessible excited state and can target different symmetry sectors by changing the photon polarization. We demonstrate the preparation of high-fidelity excited states for the Hubbard model and methylene molecule across a range of correlation regimes, and perform a successful hardware implementation for a model Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for the Formation of Active Sites in Single-Atom Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reactive dopant atoms embedded in inert host metal surfaces define the active sites in single-atom alloys (SAAs), yet SAA synthesis remains challenging. To address this, we elucidate how dopant adatoms deposited on Cu and Ag surfaces become incorporated into the metal and identify periodic trends from early to late transition metals (TMs) using density functional theory. Adatoms diffuse nearly freely across terraces, as diffusion barriers are small, whereas direct incorporation into terraces is unfavourable. In line with conventional wisdom, step edges and kink sites strongly facilitate dopant incorporation, confirming their critical role in alloy formation. Attachment of adatoms to steps and kinks from the lower terrace is favoured. Incorporation then proceeds either from this attached state or when adatoms approach a step edge from above, where reactions often proceed without barrier. Incorporation barriers are generally lower for early and central TMs, increase towards late TMs, and are slightly higher on Cu than on Ag surfaces. Repulsive interactions between Pd adatoms and dopants explain the experimental observation that a dopant-rich brim on the upper terrace of Cu surfaces inhibits incorporation from above. In contrast, attractive interactions, as found for Ru, anchor diffusing adatoms (even on terraces) and promote the formation of adatom islands, yet hinder incorporation next to the dopant and may impede the growth of embedded dopant clusters. By rationalising periodic trends and experimental observations, we show how specific surface sites and adatom--dopant interactions shape dopant incorporation, offering guidance on the surface environments most conducive to SAA synthesis for different dopant elements.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal interactions between condensates in chemically active mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of catalytically active droplets in multi-component conserved mixtures affected by noise. Working in the thin interface limit, we analytically determine the state diagram of the system, characterized by multiple dynamical regimes, and verify our findings using numerical simulations. In particular, we show the emergence of a non-reciprocal, chemically-mediated interaction between the droplets, which leads to the formation of (meta-)stable clusters of droplets of different species. We find that the clusters can display self-propulsion in a large part of the parameter space, including regions where the non-reciprocal interactions between the droplets are purely attractive. This surprising feature arises from the non-local nature of the chemical interactions, and points to locality violations as a general mechanism for energy dissipation and emergence of out-of-equilibrium steady states in active matter.</description>

      <title>Focused Sampling for Low-Cost and Accurate Ehrenfest Modeling of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An economic modeling approach for cavity quantum electrodynamics is provided by mean-field dynamics, wherein the optical field is described classically while a self-consistent interaction with quantum emitters is incorporated through the Ehrenfest theorem. However, conventional implementations of mean-field dynamics are known to suffer from a catastrophic leakage of zero-point energy, to lose accuracy in the short-cavity limit, and to require large numbers of trajectories to be sampled. Here, we address these three shortcomings within a single integrated approach. This approach builds on our recently-proposed modification of the Ehrenfest theorem, referred to as decoupled mean-field (DC-MF) dynamics, in combination with a focused sampling scheme that enforces zero-point energy at the single-trajectory level. The approach is shown to yield high accuracy in both short and long-cavity limits while reaching convergence within a minimal amount of trajectories.</description>

      <title>Excimer-Suppressed and Oxygen-Tolerant Photophysics of 'Arm-like' Substituted Pyrene Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pyrene-functionalized materials are extensively employed in photoluminescent applications, owing to their extended {\pi}-conjugation and favorable photophysical properties. However, their luminescent performance is often attenuated by {\pi}-{\pi} stacking-driven excimer formation and molecular oxygen quenching. To mitigate these undesirable effects, a novel class of 7-tert-butylpyren-2-ol derivatives with extended 'arm-like' substituents at the 1,3-positions have been synthesized and their luminescent properties in solution have been thoroughly investigated. While the 2- and 7-positions of the pyrene core are frequently modified with hydroxyl and tert-butyl groups, this work presents the first introduction of 'arm-like' substituents at the 1,3-positions. The stretched-out 'arm-like' substituents not only introduce steric bulk to suppress excimer formation but also change the symmetry class of pyrene and modulate electron density at its 1,2,3,7-positions. These effects tune pyrene's energy levels and result in moderate (0.4) to high (0.7) fluorescence quantum yields and shorter-lived fluorescence lifetimes ranging from ca. 20 to 40 ns. These shorter lifetimes lead to a reduction of the pyrene derivatives' susceptibility to energy scavenging by molecular oxygen. In addition, the specific form of the 'arms' are important. Alkyl-containing arms and alkenyl-containing arms exhibit different decay pathways, which is reflected by their disparate nonradiative rates. Thus, the introduction of 'arm-like' modifications represents a promising approach to modulate the photophysical behaviour of an important class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, highlighting their applicability in next-generation electronic and optoelectronic systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sampling for Efficient Learning of Coarse-Grained Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of larger systems and longer timescales that are otherwise infeasible with atomistic models. Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture many-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of mean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a bottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations sampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first, sufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and second, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To address these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of freedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the unbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time required to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition regions, while preserving the correct PMF. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the M\"uller-Brown potential and capped alanine, achieving notable improvements. Our findings support the use of enhanced sampling for force matching as a promising direction to improve the accuracy and reliability of CG MLPs.</description>

      <title>A Low Cost Relativistic Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Method Based on Cholesky Decomposition and Frozen Natural Spinors for Electronic Ionization, Attachment and Excitation Energy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient relativistic implementation of the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) theory up to third order, incorporating Cholesky decomposition (CD) and frozen natural spinor (FNS) techniques to address electronic ionization, attachment, and excitation problems in heavy-element systems. The exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian has been employed to balance accuracy with computational efficiency, and a state-specific frozen natural spinor (SS-FNS) extension has been developed to improve excited-state descriptions. The present implementation accurately reproduces canonical four-component third-order ADC results while significantly lowering computational demands. The efficiency and performance of the present implementation are demonstrated through calculations on larger systems, with the largest system successfully treated comprising more than 2600 basis functions.</description>

      <title>Introduction to modelling radical pair quantum spin dynamics with tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</description>
