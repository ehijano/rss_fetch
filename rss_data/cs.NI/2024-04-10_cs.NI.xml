      <title>Streamlined Transmission: A Semantic-Aware XR Deployment Framework Enhanced by Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of 6G, featuring compelling visions of digital twins and metaverses, Extended Reality (XR) has emerged as a vital conduit connecting the digital and physical realms, garnering widespread interest. Ensuring a fully immersive wireless XR experience stands as a paramount technical necessity, demanding the liberation of XR from the confines of wired connections. In this paper, we first introduce the technologies applied in the wireless XR domain, delve into their benefits and limitations, and highlight the ongoing challenges. We then propose a novel deployment framework for a broad XR pipeline, termed "GeSa-XRF", inspired by the core philosophy of Semantic Communication (SemCom) which shifts the concern from "how" to transmit to "what" to transmit. Particularly, the framework comprises three stages: data collection, data analysis, and data delivery. In each stage, we integrate semantic awareness to achieve streamlined transmission and employ Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) to achieve collaborative refinements. For the data collection of multi-modal data with differentiated data volumes and heterogeneous latency requirements, we propose a novel SemCom paradigm based on multi-modal fusion and separation and a GAI-based robust superposition scheme. To perform a comprehensive data analysis, we employ multi-task learning to perform the prediction of field of view and personalized attention and discuss the possible preprocessing approaches assisted by GAI. Lastly, for the data delivery stage, we present a semantic-aware multicast-based delivery strategy aimed at reducing pixel level redundant transmissions and introduce the GAI collaborative refinement approach. The performance gain of the proposed GeSa-XRF is preliminarily demonstrated through a case study.</description>

      <title>SUPPLY: Sustainable multi-UAV Performance-aware Placement Algorithm for Flying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used for a wide range of applications. Due to characteristics such as the ability to hover and carry cargo on-board, rotary-wing UAVs have been considered suitable platforms for carrying communications nodes, including Wi-Fi Access Points and cellular Base Stations. This gave rise to the concept of Flying Networks (FNs), now making part of the so-called Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) defined in 3GPP. In scenarios where the deployment of terrestrial networks is not feasible, the use of FNs has emerged as a solution to provide wireless connectivity. However, the management of the communications resources in FNs imposes significant challenges, especially regarding the positioning of the UAVs so that the Quality of Service (QoS) offered to the Ground Users (GUs) and devices is maximized. Moreover, unlike terrestrial networks that are directly connected to the power grid, UAVs typically rely on on-board batteries that need to be recharged. In order to maximize the UAVs' flying time, the energy consumed by the UAVs needs to be minimized. When it comes to multi-UAV placement, most state-of-the-art solutions focus on maximizing the coverage area and assume that the UAVs keep hovering in a fixed position while serving GUs. Also, they do not address the energy-aware multi-UAV placement problem in networking scenarios where the GUs may have different QoS requirements and may not be uniformly distributed across the area of interest. In this work, we propose the Sustainable multi-UAV Performance-aware Placement (SUPPLY) algorithm. SUPPLY defines the energy and performance-aware positioning of multiple UAVs in an FN. To accomplish this, SUPPLY defines trajectories that minimize UAVs' energy consumption, while ensuring the targeted QoS levels. The obtained results show up to 25% energy consumption reduction with minimal impact on throughput and delay.</description>

      <title>DDPG-E2E: A Novel Policy Gradient Approach for End-to-End Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The End-to-end (E2E) learning-based approach has great potential to reshape the existing communication systems by replacing the transceivers with deep neural networks. To this end, the E2E learning approach needs to assume the availability of prior channel information to mathematically formulate a differentiable channel layer for the backpropagation (BP) of the error gradients, thereby jointly optimizing the transmitter and the receiver. However, accurate and instantaneous channel state information is hardly obtained in practical wireless communication scenarios. Moreover, the existing E2E learning-based solutions exhibit limited performance in data transmissions with large block lengths. In this article, these practical issues are addressed by our proposed deep deterministic policy gradient-based E2E communication system. In particular, the proposed solution utilizes a reward feedback mechanism to train both the transmitter and the receiver, which alleviates the information loss of error gradients during BP. In addition, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture is developed to mitigate the curse of dimensionality problem when transmitting messages with large block lengths. Extensive simulations then demonstrate that our proposed solution can not only jointly train the transmitter and the receiver simultaneously without requiring the prior channel knowledge but also can obtain significant performance improvement on block error rate compared to state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic D2D-Assisted Federated Learning over O-RAN: Performance Analysis, MAC Scheduler, and Asymmetric User Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing studies on federated learning (FL) are mostly focused on system orchestration for static snapshots of the network and making static control decisions (e.g., spectrum allocation). However, real-world wireless networks are susceptible to temporal variations of wireless channel capacity and users' datasets. In this paper, we incorporate multi-granular system dynamics (MSDs) into FL, including (M1) dynamic wireless channel capacity, captured by a set of discrete-time events, called $\mathscr{D}$-Events, and (M2) dynamic datasets of users. The latter is characterized by (M2-a) modeling the dynamics of user's dataset size via an ordinary differential equation and (M2-b) introducing dynamic model drift}, formulated via a partial differential inequality} drawing concrete analytical connections between the dynamics of users' datasets and FL accuracy. We then conduct FL orchestration under MSDs by introducing dynamic cooperative FL with dedicated MAC schedulers (DCLM), exploiting the unique features of open radio access network (O-RAN). DCLM proposes (i) a hierarchical device-to-device (D2D)-assisted model training, (ii) dynamic control decisions through dedicated O-RAN MAC schedulers, and (iii) asymmetric user selection. We provide extensive theoretical analysis to study the convergence of DCLM. We then optimize the degrees of freedom (e.g., user selection and spectrum allocation) in DCLM through a highly non-convex optimization problem. We develop a systematic approach to obtain the solution for this problem, opening the door to solving a broad variety of network-aware FL optimization problems. We show the efficiency of DCLM via numerical simulations and provide a series of future directions.</description>

      <title>Exploring UAV Networking from the Terrain Information Completeness Perspective: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04505</link>

Abstract: Terrain information is a crucial factor affecting the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. As a tutorial, this article provides a unique perspective on the completeness of terrain information, summarizing and enhancing the research on terrain-based UAV deployment. In the presence of complete terrain information, two highly discussed topics are UAV-aided map construction and dynamic trajectory design based on maps. We propose a case study illustrating the mutually reinforcing relationship between them. When terrain information is incomplete, and only terrain-related feature parameters are available, we discuss how existing models map terrain features to blockage probabilities. By introducing the application of this model with stochastic geometry, a case study is proposed to analyze the accuracy of the model. When no terrain information is available, UAVs gather terrain information during the real-time networking process and determine the next position by collected information. This real-time search method is currently limited to relay communication. In the case study, we extend it to a multi-user scenario and summarize three trade-offs of the method. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis to assess the impact of three factors that have been overlooked in terrain-based UAV deployment.</description>
