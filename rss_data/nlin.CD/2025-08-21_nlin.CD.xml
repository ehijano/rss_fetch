      <title>Quantifying The Complex Spatiotemporal Chaos of Cardiac Fibrillation in Ionic Models Across Parameter Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the complexity of cardiac systems is fundamental to understanding the onset of rhythm disorders, from mild arrhythmias to life-threatening fibrillation. In this work, we investigate how chaos shows up and evolves in simplified cardiac models by calculating the Lyapunov exponent (LE) across different parameter sets. We show that both temporal and spatial LE estimators can be effectively applied to action potential duration (APD) data, even without full access to state variables. Specifically, the spatial-temporal algorithm and Wolf's algorithm are used in quantifying the complexity, with experiments demonstrating their distinct behaviors on various single-spiral patterns. We also identify the minimum data length and sampling density necessary to achieve robust and accurate estimation. Overall, our results suggest that these APD-based methods can be applied not only to simulation data but also to future clinical or experimental data, particularly when observations are limited, such as when only APD data are available for analysis.</description>

      <title>Geometric, topological and dynamical properties of conformally symplectic systems, normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds, and scattering maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms $f:M \rightarrow M$ transform a symplectic form $\omega$ on a manifold $M$ into a multiple of itself, $f^* \omega = \eta \omega$. We assume $\omega$ is bounded, as some of the results may fail otherwise.
  We show that there are deep interactions between the topological properties of the manifold, the dynamical properties of the map, and the geometry of invariant manifolds.
  We show that, when the symplectic form is not exact, the possible conformal factors $\eta$ are related to topological properties of the manifold. For some manifolds the conformal factors are restricted to be algebraic numbers.
  We also find relations between dynamical properties (relations between growth rate of vectors and $\eta$) and symplectic properties.
  Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIM) and their (un)stable manifolds are important landmarks that organize long-term dynamical behaviour. We prove that a NHIM is symplectic if and only if the rates satisfy certain pairing rules and if and only if the rates and the conformal factor satisfy certain (natural) inequalities.
  Homoclinic excursions to NHIMs are quantitatively described by scattering maps. These maps give the trajectory asymptotic in the future as a function of the trajectory asymptotic in the past. We prove that the scattering maps are symplectic even if the dynamics is dissipative. We also show that if the symplectic form is exact, then the scattering maps are exact, even if the dynamics is not exact. We give a variational interpretation of scattering maps in the conformally symplectic setting.
  We also show that similar properties of NHIMs and scattering maps hold in the case when $\omega$ is presymplectic. In dynamical systems with many rates (e.g., quasi-integrable systems near multiple resonances), pre-symplectic geometries appear naturally.</description>
