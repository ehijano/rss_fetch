      <title>The Initial Mass Function of Stars and Brown Dwarfs in the Upper Sco Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present infrared spectroscopy of 37 brown dwarf candidates in the Upper Sco association, 35 of which are classified as young and cool, making them likely members. This sample includes many of the faintest spectroscopically confirmed members ($K=16$-17 mag), which should have masses down to $\sim0.007$-0.01 $M_\odot$ for the range of ages in Upper Sco (7-14 Myr). Using my updated membership catalog for Upper Sco, I have estimated the initial mass function (IMF) for a field in the center of the association that encompasses $\sim80$\% of the known members. I have derived IMFs in the same manner for previous membership samples in three other star-forming populations, consisting of IC 348, Taurus, and Chameleon I. When using logarithmic mass bins, the substellar IMFs for Upper Sco and the other young regions are roughly flat down to the completeness limits of $\sim$0.01 $M_\odot$. These IMFs are broadly similar to mass functions recently measured for the solar neighborhood. Finally, I have used W1$-$W2 colors to search for excess emission from circumstellar disks among the late-type objects in my new census of Upper Sco. I measure an excess fraction of 52/200 for members with spectral types of M6.25-M9.5, which is similar to results from previous membership catalogs. For the L-type members, it is difficult to detect the small W2 excess emission produced by typical disks around brown dwarfs because of the large uncertainties in spectral types, which preclude accurate estimates of the photospheric colors. Thus, W2 photometry provides poor constraints on the presence of disks for the L-type members of Upper Sco.</description>

      <title>Magnetic evolution of complex solar active regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. This study investigates the magnetic evolution of solar active regions (ARs), with a particular focus on understanding how the magnetic morphology of simple and complex ARs changes throughout their lifetime. Methods. To analyse the magnetic evolution of ARs, we developed a Magnetic Evolution Method (MEM) that segments each region's lifetime into three phases: growth, main, and recovery. The method was applied to ARs observed between January 1996 and December 2020. Results. We found that complex active regions (CARs) have a mean lifetime of approximately 24 days, which is 8 days longer than that of simple active regions (SARs). Most CARs (94%) first appear with a simple magnetic structure and remain in this configuration for about 3 days (growth phase), before transitioning into complex structures for around 5 days (main phase), after which they typically revert to a simple state (recovery phase). The average lifetimes of SARs and CARs show no significant difference between solar cycles 23 and 24, suggesting that active region lifetimes are independent of the solar cycle. Conclusions. By tracking the full magnetic evolution of ARs, our study reveals that CARs typically become magnetically complex around three days after emergence and remain in that state for a limited but critical period. This temporal structure, uncovered using a novel method that follows ARs throughout their full development, provides important context for identifying the magnetic conditions associated with increased eruptive potential. The results offer a foundation for improving the forecasting of solar flares and magnetic clouds, and suggest that the magnetic evolution of ARs is largely independent of the solar cycle.</description>

      <title>The Sunspot Solar Observatory Data Archive: Continuing Operations at the Dunn Solar Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sunspot Solar Observatory Data Archive (SSODA) stores data acquired with the suite of instruments at the Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) from February 2018 to the present. The instrumentation at the DST continues to provide high cadence imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of the solar photosphere and chromosphere across a wavelength range from 3500\r{A} to 11,000\r{A}. At time of writing, the archive contains approximately 374 TiB of data across more than 520 observing days (starting on February 1, 2018). These numbers are approximate as the DST remains operational, and is actively adding new data to the archive. The SSODA includes both raw and calibrated data. A subset of the archive contains the results of photospheric and chromospheric spectropolarimetric inversions using the Hazel-2.0 code to obtain maps of magnetic fields, temperatures, and velocity flows. The SSODA represents a unique resource for the investigation of plasma processes throughout the solar atmosphere, the origin of space weather events, and the properties of active regions throughout the rise of Solar Cycle 25.</description>

      <title>Determination of Light Curve Parameters of Poorly Studied Eclipsing Variables Using Data from Tess and Other Sky Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group of poorly studied eclipsing variables (the classification of which is marked as uncertain and/or the period of brightness changes is uncertain) has been studied with the using of the photometric observations of the TESS mission and NSVS, ASAS-SN sky surveys. We also obtained some observations covering the brightness minima of our variables by our group using the telescopes at Astronomical Observatory on Kolonica Saddle (Slovakia) and Observatory and Planetarium in Hlohovec (Slovakia) during the "Variable-2024" astrocamp. The periods and classification were corrected. For NSV 575 and NSV 014 the periods were found for the first time, but it is doubtful that NSV 014 is an eclipsing variable, because there are no eclipses but the asymmetric wave is present, which indicates that the variable star can be re-classified as a low-amplitude pulsating one. Different methods were used for approximation of the light curves and further calculation of stellar system's parameters such as eclipse depths and durations, values of reflection effect and effect of ellipticity of stars. The initial period was estimated using the periodogram based on the trigonometrical polynomial fit of high order (up to 10). For better approximation of the complete eclipsing phase curve, the "New Algol Variable" (NAV) software was used. The methods of "asymptotic parabolas" and "wall-supported asymptotic parabolas" were used for calculation of moments of eclipses, which use only near-eclipse part of the observations instead of a complete curve. These methods were implemented in the software MAVKA among a larger set of features. For the variables NSV 489 and NSV 1884, our moments of eclipses and the ones found in the literature, were used for the O-C curves. For NSV 489, the period was adjusted taking into account the slope of the O-C diagram.</description>

      <title>Hot donors in cataclysmic variables: The case of EI Psc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: We present results of time-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry of the short-orbital period dwarf nova EI Psc.
  Aims: This study aims to determine fundamental system parameters of EI Psc, study properties of accretion structures in the system, and investigate its origin and current evolution state.
  Methods: We analyse newly obtained time-resolved spectroscopic and photometric observations as well as archival data. We used light curve modelling, Doppler tomography, and MESA evolutionary models to study the characteristics of EI Psc.
  Results: The system contains a relatively low temperature ($T_{\rm eff} = 6130\,\mathrm{K}$) white dwarf with mass of $M_{\mathrm WD} = 0.70(4)\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. The mass of the warm ($T_2 = 4440\,\mathrm{K}$) secondary is $M_2 = 0.13\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. The inclination of the system is $i= 44.5\deg(7)$. The mass accretion rate is $\approx$ $4\times10^{-13}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{year}^{-1}$. The long-term light curve of the system shows outbursts and superoutbursts. The quiescence light curve is double-humped and is formed by the combination of radiation from the Roche lobe filling the hot secondary and the hot spot. The radius of the outer disc is about two times smaller than the tidal truncation radius. Most of the disc's emission consists of emission lines and radiation from the hot spot at the stream-disc impact region.
  Conclusions: These types of systems are formed from progenitors with a low mass WD $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{WD}} \lesssim 0.6\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and relatively massive secondaries $1.1-1.5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ with initial orbital periods on a scale of days. The number of similar systems is expected to be significantly lower than the usual CVs due to a lower forming rate of their relatively massive progenitors.</description>

      <title>Deuterated water abundance in the young hot core RCW 120 S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the emission of water molecules cannot be observed from Earth, less abundant isotopologues, such as H$_2^{18}$O and HDO, are used to trace water in star-forming regions. The main aim of this study is to determine HDO abundance in the hot core RCW 120 S2. We performed observations of the hot core in the 200-255~GHz range using the nFLASH230 receiver on the APEX telescope. Two HDO lines were detected toward RCW 120 S2. Their intensities are described by excitation temperature $286\pm2$~K and gas number density $\geq 10^9$~cm$^{-3}$. The emission originates from the hot core rather than the warm dense envelope surrounding a central young stellar object. The HDO column density ranges from $(3.9-7.9)\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$ with a most probable value $5.6\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$. The HDO abundance relative to hydrogen nuclei is $1.5\times10^{-9}$. This HDO abundance value is among the lowest reported for hot cores. Combined with the non-detection of the H$_2^{18}$O line, we conclude that protostellar heating in RCW 120 S2 is still in its early stages.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Li abundances of Stars with and without Detected Planets from the High Resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the presence of planets affects the lithium (Li) abundance of their host stars is still an open question. To investigate the difference of the Li abundance between planet-host stars (HS) and isolated stars (IS) with no detected planets, we analyze a large sample of stars with temperatures ranging from 4600 to 6600 K and metallicity ranging from -0.55 to +0.50. The sample consists of 279 HS whose spectra were taken from the California-Kepler Survey (CKS), which followed up planets detected by Kepler, and 171 IS whose spectra were taken from the Keck archive. The non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects were taken into consideration. It is found that the distribution of Li abundances in both the HS and IS groups are generally consistent with each other. This suggests that the presence of Kepler-like planets does not have a significant impact on Li depletion. We also found that the non-LTE corrections can not be neglected for stars with A(Li) over ~ 2.5 dex.</description>

      <title>Falling Threads During Solar Filament Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass drainage is frequently observed in solar filaments. During filament eruptions, falling material most likely flows along magnetic field lines, which may provide important clues for the magnetic structures of filaments. Here we study three filament eruptions exhibiting significant mass draining, often manifested as falling threads at a constant speed ranging between 30--300 km/s. We found that most of the falling material lands onto the hooked segments of flare ribbons, only a small fraction lands inside the hooks, and almost none lands onto the straight segments of ribbons. Based on these observations we surmise that before eruptions most of the filament mass is entrained by field lines threading the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), which wrap around the filament field and whose footpoints are mapped by the hooked ribbons, and that the magnetic reconnection involving these field lines is the major cause of the mass drainage during eruptions. Additionally, the light curves of the hooked ribbons suggest that during eruptions the earlier (later) QSL boundary of filaments is threaded by mass-loaded (depleted) field lines. By assuming that the constant-speed motion is due to a drag force balancing the gravity, we proposed a simplified analytical model to estimate the density contrast of the falling material. The estimated density contrast is then fed into a numerical model, in which filament threads fall along vertical magnetic field lines through a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. The resultant falling speeds, however, are short of observed values, which calls for further investigations.</description>

      <title>The chemical yields of stars in the range 9-15 Msun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Limongi et al. (2024) we presented and discussed the main evolutionary properties and final fate of stars in the mass range 7-15 Msun. The evolutions of those models were computed by means of a medium size nuclear network that guaranteed a proper calculation of the nuclear energy generation and hence a good modeling of the physical evolution of these stars. In the present paper, we extend this study by computing the detailed chemical yields of stars in the mass range 9-15 Msun, i.e., those stars that explode as core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The explosive nucleosynthesis is then computed in the framework of the thermal bomb induced explosion by means of the HYPERION code (Limongi and Chieffi 2020). We find that: (1) the yields of the intermediate mass elements (i.e., O to P) show a steep decrease as the inital mass decreases; (2) the yields of s-weak component, i.e., those produced by the slow neutron captures from Ga to to the first neutron closure shell, decrease almost linearly as a function of the initial mass with respect to the ones produced by the more massive stars; (3) the global contribution of the stars in the mass range 9.22-13 Msun to the yields of a generation of massive stars averaged over a standard initial mass function is negligible for essentially all the isotopes. In spite of this, however, the models of stars in this mass range can be fundamental to interpret the observations of specific supernovae.</description>

      <title>The stellar population in the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on optically selected stellar candidates of SARAO MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum survey sources of the Galactic plane. Stellar counterparts to radio sources are selected by cross-matching the MeerKAT source positions with \textit{Gaia} DR3, using two approaches. The first approach evaluated the probability of chance alignments between the radio survey and \textit{Gaia} sources and used AllWISE infrared colour-colour information to select potential stellar candidates. The second approach utilized a Monte Carlo method to evaluate the cross-matching reliability probability, based on populations of known radio-emitting stars. From the combined approaches, we found 629 potential stellar counterparts, of which 169 have existing SIMBAD classifications, making it the largest Galactic plane radio-optical crossmatch sample to date. A colour-magnitude analysis of the sample revealed a diverse population of stellar objects, ranging from massive OB stars, main-sequence stars, giants, young stellar objects, emission line stars, red dwarfs and white dwarfs. Some of the proposed optical counterparts include chromospherically/coronally active stars, for example RS CVn binaries, BY Dra systems, YSOs and flare stars, which typically exhibit radio emission. Based on Gaia's low-resolution spectroscopy, some of the stars show strong H$\alpha$ emission, indicating they are magnetically active, consistent with them being radio emitters. While MeerKAT's sensitivity and survey speed make it ideal for detecting faint radio sources, its angular resolution limits accurate counterpart identification for crowded fields such as the Galactic Plane. Higher frequency, and, thereby, better spatial resolution, radio observations plus circular polarization would be required to strengthen the associations.</description>

      <title>Charting circumstellar chemistry of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. II. Abundances and spatial distributions of CS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars harbour a rich variety of molecules and are sites of complex chemistry. Our current understanding of the circumstellar chemical processes of carbon-rich AGB stars is predominantly based on observations of a single star, IRC+10216, often regarded as an archetypical carbon star. We aim to estimate stellar and circumstellar properties for five carbon stars, and constrain their circumstellar CS abundances. This study compares the CS abundances among the sources, informs circumstellar chemical models, and helps to assess if IRC+10216 is a good representative of the physics and chemistry of carbon star CSEs. We modelled the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and CO line emission to derive the stellar and outflow properties. Using these, we then retrieved CS abundance profiles with detailed radiative transfer modelling, imposing spatial and excitation constraints from ALMA and single-dish observations. We obtain good fits to the SEDs and CO lines for all sources and reproduce the CS line emission across various transitions and apertures, yielding robust estimates of the CS abundance profiles. Peak CS fractional abundances range from 1$\times$10$^{-6}$ - 4$\times$10$^{-6}$, with e-folding radii of 1.8$\times$10$^{16}$ - 6.8$\times$10$^{16}$ cm. We also derive reliable $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S ratios from CS isotopologue modelling. Our results refine previous single-dish CS abundance estimates and improve the relative uncertainty on the CS e-folding radius for IRAS 07454$-$7112 by a factor of $\sim$2.5. Chemical models reproduce our estimates of the CS radial extent, corroborating the CS photodissociation framework used therein. We find no significant differences between the derived CS abundance profiles for IRC+10216 and the rest of the sample, apart from the expected density-driven variations.</description>

      <title>Modeling the progenitors of low-mass post-accretion binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About half of the mass of all heavy elements with mass number A &gt; 90 is formed through the slow neutron capture process (s-process), occurring in evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with masses ~1-6 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$. The s-process can be studied by modeling the accretion of material from AGB stars onto binary barium (Ba), CH, and carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP)-s stars. Comparing observationally derived surface parameters and 1D-LTE abundance patterns of s-process elements to theoretical binary accretion models, we aim to understand the formation of post-accretion systems. We explore the extent of dilution of the accreted material and describe the impact of convective mixing on the observed surface abundances. We compute a new grid of 2700 accretion models for low-mass post-accretion systems. A maximum-likelihood comparison determines the best fit models for observational samples of Ba, CH, and CEMP-s stars. We find consistent AGB donor masses in the mass range of 2-3 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ across our sample of post-accretion binaries. We find the formation scenario for weak Ba stars is an AGB star transferring a moderate amount of mass ($\leq$0.5 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) resulting in a ~2.0-2.5 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ star. The strong Ba stars are best fit with lower final masses ~1.0-2.0 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$, and significant accreted mass ($\geq$0.5 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$). The CH and CEMP-s stars display lower final masses (~1.0 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) and small amounts of transferred material (~0.1 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$). We find that Ba stars generally accrete more material than CEMP-s and CH stars. We also find that strong Ba stars must accrete more than 0.50 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ to explain their abundance patterns, and in this limit we are unable to reproduce the observed mass distribution of strong Ba stars. The mass distributions of the weak Ba stars, CEMP-s, and CH stars are well reproduced in our modeling.</description>

      <title>Intermittency in Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections Observed by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermittency has been studied extensively in the fast and slow solar winds but to a far lesser extent in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). While ICMEs are often characterized by their relatively smooth, large-scale magnetic flux rope structures, a spectrum of fluctuations is nonetheless present at smaller scales. We have examined kurtosis and its scaling exponents at magnetohydrodynamic inertial scales in 49 ICMEs observed between 0.25 and 1 au by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, and compared the results to those obtained for the ICME sheath regions and ambient solar wind intervals. Kurtosis behaves similarly in all intervals studied and presents a universal behavior typical of intermittent time series. The ICMEs displayed a radially invariant level of intermittency, suggesting that they are relatively static, well-developed turbulent environments. In the sheath regions, the level of intermittency increased with distance, indicating that the turbulence is not yet fully developed at small heliocentric distances. In addition to intermittent fluctuations related to turbulence, the sheath regions may possess a population of non-turbulent structures that increase the absolute value of kurtosis.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Modeling of the Solar Wind Flow with Boundary Conditions Governed by Synchronic Photospheric Magnetograms. I. Multi-point Validation in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind (SW) is a vital component of space weather, providing a background for solar transients such as coronal mass ejections, stream interaction regions, and energetic particles propagating toward Earth. Accurate prediction of space weather events requires a precise description and thorough understanding of physical processes occurring in the ambient SW plasma. Ensemble simulations of the three-dimensional SW flow are performed using an empirically-driven magnetohydrodynamic heliosphere model implemented in the Multi-Scale Fluid-Kinetic Simulation Suite (MS-FLUKSS). The effect of uncertainties in the photospheric boundary conditions on the simulation outcome is investigated. The results are in good overall agreement with the observations from the Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, and OMNI data at Earth, specifically during 2020-2021. This makes it possible to shed more light on the properties of the SW propagating through the heliosphere and perspectives for improving space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>The stellar evolution perspective on the metallicity dependence of classical Cepheid Leavitt laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of metallicity on the Cepheid Leavitt law (LL) and, in turn, the Hubble constant, has been the subject of much recent debate. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of metallicity effects on Cepheid LLs based on synthetic Cepheid populations computed using Geneva models and the SYCLIST tool. We computed 296 co-eval populations in the age range of 5-300 Myr for metallicities representative of the Sun, the LMC, and the SMC ($Z \in [0.014, 0.006, 0.002]$). We computed LLs in fourteen optical-to-infrared passbands and five reddening-free Wesenheit magnitudes. All Cepheid populations take into account distributions of rotation rates and companion stars. We show excellent agreement between the predicted populations and key observational constraints from the literature. Our simulations predict a significant LL slope-metallicity dependence ($\beta_{\rm M} &gt; 0$) that renders LLs steeper at lower metallicity at all wavelengths. Importantly, $\beta_{\rm M} \ne 0$ implies that the intercept-metallicity dependence, $\alpha_{\rm M}$, depends on pivot period; an issue not previously considered. Comparison with $\alpha_{\rm M}$ measurements in individual passbands reported in the literature yields acceptable agreement on the order of agreement found among different observational studies. The wavelength dependence and magnitude of the disagreement suggests a possible origin in reddening-related systematics. Conversely, we report excellent agreement between our $\alpha_{\rm M} = -0.20 \pm 0.03$ mag dex$^{-1}$ and the value determined by the SH0ES distance ladder in the reddening-free H-band Wesenheit magnitude ($-0.217 \pm 0.046$), the currently tightest and conceptually simplest empirical constraint.</description>

      <title>The peculiar composition of the Sun is not related to giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly-differential spectroscopic studies have revealed that the Sun is deficient in refractory elements relative to solar twins. To investigate the role of giant planets on this signature, we present a high precision abundance analysis of HARPS spectra for 50 F- and G-type stars spanning -0.4&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;+0.5. There are 29 stars in the sample which host planets of masses &gt; 0.01 MJup. We derive abundances for 19 elements, and apply corrections to 14 of them for systematic errors associated with one dimensional (1D) model atmospheres, or the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), or both. We find that, among the solar twins in our sample, the Sun is Li poor in comparison to other stars at similar age, in agreement to previous studies. The sample shows a variety of trends in elemental abundances as a function of condensation temperature. We find a strong correlation in these trends with [Fe/H], with a marginally-significant difference in the gradients for stars with and without giants planets detected, that increases after applying 3D and non-LTE corrections. Our overall results suggests that the peculiar composition of the Sun is primarily related to Galactic chemical evolution rather than the presence of giant planets.</description>

      <title>Mass-feeding of jet-launching white dwarfs in grazing and common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose a scenario that allows white dwarfs (WDs) to launch relatively powerful jets when they enter a common envelope evolution (CEE) or experience a grazing envelope evolution (GEE) with a red giant branch star (RGB) or an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. In this, still a speculative scenario, the accretion for a time is mainly onto an accretion disk with a radius of ~ 1Ro that increases in mass. The accretion disk launches the powerful two opposite jets by releasing gravitational energy, up to several times super-Eddington, as its mass increases. The jets that the disk launches remove high-entropy gas from the disk's outskirts and the envelope that the WD inflates because of nuclear burning on its surface. The motivations to allow WDs to launch powerful jets are recent findings, from the morphologies of post-CEE planetary nebulae, that jets play a major role in the CEE and the accumulating evidence that jets power luminous red novae by jets, as their morphologies indicate. I strengthen my call to include jets in the simulation and modeling of the CEE, consider the GEE as a phase preceding the CEE in many (but not all) cases, and include jets as a major ingredient in modeling and stimulating all energetic luminous red novae.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Observations of Supra-Arcade Downflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their somewhat-frequent appearance in EUV imaging of off-limb flares, the origins of Supra-Arcade Downflows (SADs) remain a mystery. Appearing as dark, tendril-like downflows above growing flare loop arcades, SADs themselves are yet to be tied into the standard model of solar flares. The uncertainty of their origin is, in part, due to a lack of spectral observations, with the last published SAD spectral observations dating back to the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory / Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SOHO/SUMER) era in 2003. In this work, we present new observations of SADs within an M-class solar flare on April 2nd, 2022, observed by the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory. We measure Fe XXIV 192.02 Angstrom Doppler downflows and non-thermal velocities in the low-intensity SAD features, exceeding values measured in the surrounding flare fan. The ratio of temperature-sensitive Fe XXIV 255.11 Angstrom and Fe XXIII 263.41 Angstrom lines also allow the measurement of electron temperature, revealing temperatures within the range of the surrounding flare fan. We compare EIS line-of-sight Doppler velocities with plane-of-sky velocities measured by AIA, to construct the 3D velocity profile of four prominent SADs, finding evidence for their divergence above the flare loop arcade - possibly related to the presence of a high altitude termination shock. Finally, we detect 'stealth' SADs, which produce SAD-like Doppler signals, yet with no change in intensity.</description>

      <title>The Kick Velocity Distribution of Isolated Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to receive natal kicks at their formation in supernovae. In order to investigate the magnitude of these kicks, we analyze the proper motions and distance estimates -- either through parallax or dispersion measures -- of young isolated pulsars and infer their three-dimensional velocities relative to their local standard of rest. We find that the velocities based on parallax distances of pulsars younger than $10$ Myr follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of $\ln\left(v/\text{km}/\text{s}^{-1}\right)=5.60\pm0.12$ and a standard deviation of $0.68\pm0.10$, peaking at ${\sim}150$--$200$ km s$^{-1}$, which we adopt as our fiducial kick distribution. Using a previously established method that infers kick magnitudes through the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories, we also estimate the kick velocities of older pulsars, which we find to be consistent with our fiducial kick distribution. A log-normal fit to all pulsars with ages below $40$ Myr yields a more constraining (but possibly more prone to systematic errors) fit with mean and standard deviation of $5.67\pm0.10$ and $0.59\pm0.08$, respectively. Moreover, we (1) resolve the tension between our results and the Maxwellian distribution found by Hobbs et al. (2005), which has a ${\sim}50\%$ higher median velocity, by showing that their analysis is missing a Jacobian needed to correct for its logarithmic histogram bin sizes, and (2) argue that the bimodality found by others is not statistically significant and that previous results are consistent with our inferred kick distribution, effectively reconciling the literature on observed NS kicks.</description>

      <title>The Gaia spectroscopic catalogue of exoplanets and host stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complete, accurate, and precise catalogues of exoplanet host star (EHS) properties are essential to deriving high-quality exoplanet parameters. This paper aims at homogeneously parameterising EHS and their exoplanets, using Gaia and GSP-spec data. For 2573 EHS, we computed their L*, R*, and M*, with no prior assumption from stellar evolution models. Their Galactic positions, kinematic and orbital properties were derived. We re-scaled Mp and Rp of 3556 exoplanets, fully consistently with the stellar data. These new stellar Teff, L*, and R* are in rather good agreement with literature values but are more precise. In particular, R* are derived with typically less than 3% uncertainty; this reduces the uncertainty on Rp significantly and allows for a finer analysis of the decrease in the number of planets around the evaporation valley. Larger differences, however, were found for M*. We note that the EHS population is rather diverse in terms of the chemical and Galactic properties, although they are all found in the Solar vicinity, close to the Local spiral arm. Most EHS belong to the thin disc, but some older thick disc and halo members have also been identified. For the less massive planets, the average Rp increases with the metallicity of the host star. For giant planets, a dichotomy between dense and inflated planets is found. Denser planets tend to be more massive as the metallicity of the host star increases, while inflated planets are more massive for less metallic hosts. If confirmed, this bimodality implies that the diversity of giant exoplanets depends on their Galactic birth locus, with dense giant planets being more numerous than inflated ones when [M/H]&gt;~1.5 times Solar, as in the central Milky Way regions. The Gaia spectroscopic catalogue of exoplanets and their host stars is large, homogeneous, and precise. It would be a useful added-value for planetary studies.</description>

      <title>StarFlow: Leveraging Normalizing Flows for Stellar Age Estimation in SDSS-V DR19</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the ages of stars is crucial for unraveling the formation history and evolution of our Galaxy. Traditional methods for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic data often struggle with providing appropriate uncertainty estimations and are severely constrained by the parameter space. In this work, we introduce a new approach using normalizing flows, a type of deep generative model, to estimate stellar ages for evolved stars with improved accuracy and robust uncertainty characterization. The model is trained on stellar masses for evolved stars derived from asteroseismology and predicts the relationship between the carbon and nitrogen abundances of a given star and its age. Unlike standard neural network techniques, normalizing flows enable the recovery of full likelihood distributions for individual stellar ages, offering a richer and more informative perspective on uncertainties. Our method yields age estimations for 378,720 evolved stars and achieves a typical absolute age uncertainty of approximately 2 Gyr. By intrinsically accounting for the coverage and density of the training data, our model ensures that the resulting uncertainties reflect both the inherent noise in the data and the completeness of the sampled parameter space. Applying this method to data from the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, we have produced the largest stellar age catalog for evolved stars to date.</description>

      <title>Binary mass transfer in 3D -- Mass Transfer Rate and Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass transfer is crucial in binary evolution, yet its theoretical treatment has long relied on analytic models whose key assumptions remain debated. We present a direct and systematic evaluation of these assumptions using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations including the Coriolis force. We simulate streams overflowing from both the inner and outer Lagrangian points, quantify mass transfer rates, and compare them with analytic solutions. We introduce scaling factors, including the overfilling factor, to render the problem dimensionless. The donor-star models are simplified, with either an isentropic initial stratification and adiabatic evolution or an isothermal structure and evolution, but the scalability of this formulation allows us to extend the results for a mass-transferring system to arbitrarily small overfilling factors. We find that the Coriolis force -- often neglected in analytic models -- strongly impacts the stream morphology: breaking axial symmetry, reducing the stream cross section, and shifting its origin toward the donor's trailing side. Contrary to common assumptions, the sonic surface is not flat and does not always intersect the Lagrangian point: instead, it is concave and shifted, particularly toward the accretor's trailing side. Despite these structural asymmetries, mass transfer rates are only mildly suppressed relative to analytic predictions and the deviation is remarkably small -- within a factor of two (ten) for the inner (outer) Lagrangian point over seven orders of magnitude in mass ratio. We use our results to extend the widely-used mass-transfer rate prescriptions by Ritter(1988) and Kolb&amp;Ritter(1990), for both the inner and outer Lagrangian points. These extensions can be readily adopted in stellar evolution codes like MESA, with minimal changes where the original models are already in use.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar oscillation codes are software instruments that evaluate the normal-mode frequencies of an input stellar model. While inter-code comparisons are often used to confirm the correctness of calculations, they are not suitable for characterizing the numerical error of an individual code. To address this issue, we introduce a set of tools -- 'error measures' -- that facilitate this characterization. We explore the behavior of these error measures as calculation parameters, such as the number of radial grid points used to discretize the oscillation equations, are varied; and we summarize this behavior via an idealized error model. While our analysis focuses on the GYRE code, it remains broadly applicable to other oscillation codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way can be significantly affected by dark matter annihilation, producing population-level effects that are visible in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. We establish the dark HR diagram, where stars lie on a new stable $\textit{dark main sequence}$ with similar luminosities, but lower temperatures, than the standard main sequence. The dark matter density in these stars continuously replenishes, granting these stars immortality and solving multiple stellar anomalies. Upcoming telescopes could detect the dark main sequence, offering a new dark matter discovery avenue.</description>

Abstract: I find that the accretion disk around the neutron star (NS) that enters the core of a massive evolved star in the frame of the common-envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can penetrate the crust of the NS, mix neutron-rich crust material into the disk, and enrich the jets that the disk launches with the neutron-rich material. As the NS accretes at high rates from the core inside which it revolves, it forms an accretion disk with high density. In the CEJSN r-process scenario, the very high density in the accretion disk results in low electron fraction gas, enabling the r-process. Jets carry the r-process elements out. The new claim in this study is that the high-density accretion disk destroys part of the NS crust and entrains this mass. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mixes material from the deeper crust. The total neutron-rich mass that the disk mixes and the jets carry can be up to ~0.01Mo. Enriching the accretion disk with neutron-rich material ensures a low electron fraction as required by the r-process nucleosynthesis and the ejection of massive r-process ejecta, 0.01-0.03Mo. I strengthen the CEJSN r-process scenario, but do not claim it is the main r-process site. I only claim that two or more r-process sites contribute to r-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>

Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>
