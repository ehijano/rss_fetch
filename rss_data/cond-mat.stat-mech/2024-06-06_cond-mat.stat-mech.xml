      <title>Mpemba effects in open nonequilibrium quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the classical thermal Mpemba effect (where an initially hot system relaxes faster to the final equilibrium state than a cold one) to open quantum systems coupled to several reservoirs. We show that, in general, two different types of quantum Mpemba effects are possible. They may be distinguished by quantum state tomography. However, the existence of a quantum Mpemba effect (without determining the type) can already be established by measuring simpler observables such as currents or energies. We illustrate our general results for the experimentally feasible case of an interacting two-site Kitaev model coupled to two metallic leads.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transitions in two-dimensional Brownian Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a system of two-dimensional interacting Brownian particles at finite density. In the continuum limit, we uncover a hidden symmetry under area-preserving diffeomorphism transformations. This symmetry leads to the conservation of local vorticity. By calculating the generating functional within the saddle-point plus Gaussian fluctuations approximation, we reveal the emergence of a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. This emergent symmetry enables us to describe the dynamics of density fluctuations as a gauge theory. We solve the corresponding equations of motion for various local and non-local two-body potentials, demonstrating the presence of multiple dynamical regimes and associated dynamical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Active Brownian Particles with Dry Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a field theoretic approach to capture the motion of a particle with dry friction for one- and two-dimensional diffusive particles, and further expand the framework for two-dimensional active Brownian particles. Starting with the Fokker-Planck equation and introducing the Hermite polynomials as the corresponding eigen-functions, we obtain the actions and propagators. Using a perturbation expansion, we calculate the effective diffusion coefficient in the presence of both wet and dry frictions in a perturbative way via the Green-Kubo relation. We further compare the analytical result with the numerical simulation. Our result can be used to estimate the values of dry friction coefficient in experiments.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Inequivalence with Competing Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of competing interactions on ensemble inequivalence. We consider a one-dimensional Ising model with ferromagnetic mean-field interactions and short-range couplings which can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. Despite the relative simplicity of the model, our calculations in the microcanonical ensemble reveal a rich phase diagram. The comparison with the corresponding phase diagram in the canonical ensemble shows the presence of phase transition points and lines which are different in the two ensembles. As an example, in a region of the phase diagram where the canonical ensemble shows a critical point and a critical end point, the microcanonical ensemble has an additional critical point and also a triple point. The regions of ensemble inequivalence typically occur at lower temperatures and at larger absolute values of the competing couplings. The presence of two free parameters in the model allows us to obtain a fourth-order critical point, which can be fully characterized by deriving its Landau normal form.</description>

      <title>Topological phases in discrete stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support edge states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1d and 2d systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems or in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.</description>

      <title>Level statistics detect generalized symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Level statistics are a useful probe for detecting symmetries and distinguishing integrable and non-integrable systems. I show by way of several examples that level statistics detect the presence of generalized symmetries that go beyond conventional lattice symmetries and internal symmetries. I consider non-invertible symmetries through the example of Kramers-Wannier duality at an Ising critical point, symmetries with nonlocal generators through the example of a spin-$1$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain, and $q$-deformed symmetries through an example closely related to recent work on $q$-deformed SPT phases. In each case, conventional level statistics detect the generalized symmetries, and these symmetries must be resolved before seeing characteristic level repulsion in non-integrable systems. For the $q$-deformed symmetry, I discovered via level statistics a $q$-deformed generalization of inversion that is interesting in its own right and that may protect $q$-deformed SPT phases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to illustrate that generalized two-dimensional XY models (proposed by Romano and Zagrebnov) may also support a first-order phase transition. Two approaches are employed to accurately determine the critical parameter $q$ at which such a transition takes place. Furthermore, we show that the model is characterized by three distinct regions concerning both first-order and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions. Finally, the underlying mechanisms governing such transitions are presented, along with an estimation of the critical temperatures.</description>

      <title>Translation symmetry restoration under random unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite parts of a large, locally interacting many-body system prepared out-of-equilibrium eventually equilibrate. Characterising the underlying mechanisms of this process and its timescales, however, is particularly hard as it requires to decouple universal features from observable-specific ones. Recently, new insight came by studying how certain symmetries of the dynamics that are broken by the initial state are restored at the level of the reduced state of a given subsystem. This provides a high level, observable-independent probe. Until now this idea has been applied to the restoration of internal symmetries, e.g. U(1) symmetries related to charge conservation. Here we show that that the same logic can be applied to the restoration of space-time symmetries, and hence can be used to characterise the relaxation of fully generic systems. We illustrate this idea by considering the paradigmatic example of "generic" many-body dynamics, i.e. a local random unitary circuit. We show that, surprisingly, the restoration of translation symmetry in these systems only happens on time-scales proportional to the subsystem's volume. In fact, for large enough subsystems the time of symmetry restoration becomes initial-state independent (as long as the latter breaks the symmetry at time zero) and coincides with the thermalisation time. For intermediate subsystems, however, one can observe the so-called "quantum Mpemba effect", where the state of the system restores a symmetry faster if it is initially more asymmetric.</description>

      <title>Information Benchmark for Biological Sensors Beyond Steady States -- Mpemba-like sensory withdrawal effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological sensors rely on the temporal dynamics of ligand concentration for signaling. The sensory performance is bounded by the distinguishability between the sensory state transition dynamics under different environmental protocols. This work presents a comprehensive theory to characterize arbitrary transient sensory dynamics of biological sensors. Here the sensory performance is quantified by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the probability distributions of the sensor's stochastic paths. We introduce a novel benchmark to assess a sensor's transient sensory performance arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon in multi-state sensors: while an initial exposure to high ligand concentration may hinder a sensor's sensitivity towards a future concentration up-shift, certain sensors may show a boost in sensitivity if the initial high concentration exposure is followed by a transient resetting at a low concentration environment. The boosted performance exceeds that of a sensor starting from an initially low concentration environment. This effect, reminiscent of a drug withdrawal effect, can be explained by the Markovian dynamics of the multi-state sensor, similar to the Markovian Mpemba effect. Moreover, an exhaustive machine learning study of 4-state sensors reveals a tight connection between the sensor's performance and the structure of the Markovian graph of its states.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity and localization in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for investigating wave function spreading in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum systems using spread complexity and spread entropy. We consider a tight-binding chain with complex on-site potentials at the boundary sites. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken phase, the wave function is delocalized. We find that in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, it becomes localized on one edge of the tight-binding lattice. This localization is a realization of the non-Hermitian skin effect. Localization in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase is observed both in the lattice chain basis and the Krylov basis. Spread entropy, entropic complexity, and a further measure that we term the Krylov inverse participation ratio probe the dynamics of wave function spreading and quantify the strength of localization probed in the Krylov basis. The number of Krylov basis vectors required to store the information of the state reduces with the strength of localization. Our results demonstrate how measures in Krylov space can be used to characterize the non-hermitian skin effect and its localization phase transition.</description>

      <title>Operator dynamics and entanglement in space-time dual Hadamard lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body quantum dynamics defined on a spatial lattice and in discrete time -- either as stroboscopic Floquet systems or quantum circuits -- has been an active area of research for several years. Being discrete in space and time, a natural question arises: when can such a model be viewed as evolving unitarily in space as well as in time? Models with this property, which sometimes goes by the name space-time duality, have been shown to have a number of interesting features related to entanglement growth and correlations. One natural way in which the property arises in the context of (brickwork) quantum circuits is by choosing dual unitary gates: two site operators that are unitary in both the space and time directions. We introduce a class of models with $q$ states per site, defined on the square lattice by a complex partition function and paremeterized in terms of $q\times q$ Hadamard matrices, that have the property of space-time duality. These may interpreted as particular dual unitary circuits or stroboscopically evolving systems, and generalize the well studied self-dual kicked Ising model. We explore the operator dynamics in the case of Clifford circuits, making connections to Clifford cellular automata [J. Math. Phys. 49, 112104 (2008)] and in the $q\to\infty$ limit to the classical spatiotemporal cat model of many body chaos [Nonlinearity 34, 2800 (2021)]. We establish integrability and the corresponding conserved charges for a large subfamily and show how the long-range entanglement protocol discussed in the recent paper [Phys. Rev. B 105, 144306 (2022)] can be reinterpreted in purely graphical terms and directly applied here.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Quantum Generative Modeling by Quantum Hartley Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach for building quantum models based on the exponentially growing orthonormal basis of Hartley kernel functions. First, we design a differentiable Hartley feature map parametrized by real-valued argument that enables quantum models suitable for solving stochastic differential equations and regression problems. Unlike the naturally complex Fourier encoding, the proposed Hartley feature map circuit leads to quantum states with real-valued amplitudes, introducing an inductive bias and natural regularization. Next, we propose a quantum Hartley transform circuit as a map between computational and Hartley basis. We apply the developed paradigm to generative modeling from solutions of stochastic differential equations, and utilize the quantum Hartley transform for fine sampling from parameterized distributions through an extended register. Finally, we present tools for implementing multivariate quantum generative modeling for both correlated and uncorrelated distributions. As a result, the developed quantum Hartley models offer a distinct quantum approach to generative AI at increasing scale.</description>

      <title>Hidden collective oscillations in a disordered mean-field spin model with non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of introducing separable quenched disorder on a non-equilibrium mean-field spin model exhibiting a phase transition to an oscillating state in the absence of disorder, due to non-reciprocal interactions. In the disordered model, the magnetisation and its time derivative no longer carry the signature of the phase transition to an oscillating state. However, thanks to the separable (Mattis-type) form of the disorder, the presence of oscillations can be revealed by introducing a specific, disorder-dependent observable. We also introduce generalised linear and non-linear susceptibilities associated either with the magnetisation or with its time derivative. While linear susceptibilities show no sign of a phase transition, the third-order susceptibilities present a clear signature of the onset of an oscillating phase. In addition, we show that the overlap distribution also provides evidence for the presence of oscillations, without explicit knowledge of the disorder.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of self-similarity using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding self-similarity is a key step for understanding the governing law behind complex physical phenomena. Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a polyelectrolyte (PE) model based on a freely jointed chain (FJC) in which the beads are ionizable and the bonds are rigid. Electrostatic interactions considered are of the short range type up to next-nearest neighbours using a Debye-H\"uckel (DH) potential. Exact expressions for the conformational and protonation properties are obtained as a function of the pH using the transfer matrix method and the integration of the angular variables. For the finite cases with low N values, relevant differences arise on both the protonation curve and the end to end distance due to the end effects. However, when increasing N a rather rapid convergence is observed to the infinite chain limiting case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the skyrmion-crystal (SkX) formation and various multiple-$q$ phases encompassing the SkX phase are investigated by extensive Monte Carlo simulations on the frustrated $J_1$-$J_3$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg model with the weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy. Phase diagram in the temperature $T$ vs. magnetic-field $H$ plane are constructed, leading to a rich variety of multiple-$q$ phases. The anisotropy stabilizes the SkX state down to $T=0$ at intermediate fields, while in the lower-field range the SkX state becomes only metastable, and new multiple-$q$ states with a broken $C_3$ symmetry are instead stabilized. Implications to experiments are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on R\'enyi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha&gt;1$, while is a constant for $\alpha&lt;1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha&lt;1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha&gt;1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Modeling of physical systems must be based on their suitability to unavoidable physical laws. In this work, in the context of classical, isothermal, finite-time, and weak drivings, I demonstrate that physical systems, driven simultaneously at the same rate in two or more external parameters, must have the Fourier transform of their relaxation functions composing a positive-definite matrix to satisfy the Second Law of Thermodynamics. By evaluating them in the limit of near-to-equilibrium processes, I identify that such coefficients are the Casimir-Onsager ones. The result is verified in paradigmatic models of the overdamped and underdamped white noise Brownian motions. Finally, an extension to thermally isolated systems is made by using the time-averaged Casimir-Onsager matrix, in which the example of the harmonic oscillator is presented.</description>

      <title>Resetting as a swift equilibration protocol in an anharmonic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and characterize a method to accelerate the relaxation of a Brownian object between two distinct equilibrium states. Instead of relying on a deterministic time-dependent control parameter, we use stochastic resetting to guide and accelerate the transient evolution. The protocol is investigated numerically, and its thermodynamic cost is evaluated with the tools of stochastic thermodynamics. Remarkably, we show that stochastic resetting significantly accelerates the relaxation to the final state. This stochastic protocol exhibits energetic and temporal characteristics that align with the scales observed in previously investigated deterministic protocols. Moreover, it expands the spectrum of stationary states that can be manipulated, incorporating new potential profiles achievable through experimentally viable protocols.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of causal emergence based on effective information(EI) suggests that complex systems may exhibit a phenomenon called causal emergence(CE), where the macro-dynamics demonstrate a stronger causal effect than the micro-dynamics. However, a challenge in this theory is the dependence on the method used to coarse-grain the system. In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this and singular value decomposition. Our research not only reveals a strong correlation between the proximity of a Markov chain being dynamically reversible and EI in assessing causal effects across various scenarios but also demonstrates that EI is constrained by the logarithm of the approximate dynamical reversibility. Leveraging this concept, we present an innovative approach to quantifying CE that is agnostic to specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the inherent characteristics of Markov dynamics. Through empirical evaluations on examples of boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks, we validate our refined CE definition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such prediction with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. In particular, we are able to predict and confirm that the CFT imply an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution. We show how to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including, the central charge, the operator content, and the generalized temporal entropies. Our results also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</description>

      <title>AI without networks</title>

Abstract: Contemporary Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands on two legs: large training data corpora and many-parameter artificial neural networks (ANNs). The data corpora are needed to represent the complexity and heterogeneity of the world. The role of the networks is less transparent due to the obscure dependence of the network parameters and outputs on the training data and inputs. This raises problems, ranging from technical-scientific to legal-ethical. We hypothesize that a transparent approach to machine learning is possible without using networks at all. By generalizing a parameter-free, statistically consistent data interpolation method, which we analyze theoretically in detail, we develop a network-free framework for AI incorporating generative modeling. We demonstrate this framework with examples from three different disciplines - ethology, control theory, and mathematics. Our generative Hilbert framework applied to the trajectories of small groups of swimming fish outperformed state-of-the-art traditional mathematical behavioral models and current ANN-based models. We demonstrate pure data interpolation based control by stabilizing an inverted pendulum and a driven logistic map around unstable fixed points. Finally, we present a mathematical application by predicting zeros of the Riemann Zeta function, achieving comparable performance as a transformer network. We do not suggest that the proposed framework will always outperform networks as over-parameterized networks can interpolate. However, our framework is theoretically sound, transparent, deterministic, and parameter free: remarkably, it does not require any compute-expensive training, does not involve optimization, has no model selection, and is easily reproduced and ported. We also propose an easily computed method of credit assignment based on this framework, to help address ethical-legal challenges raised by generative AI.</description>

      <title>A topological mechanism for robust and efficient global oscillations in biological networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long and stable timescales are often observed in complex biochemical networks, such as in emergent oscillations. How these robust dynamics persist remains unclear, given the many stochastic reactions and shorter time scales demonstrated by underlying components. We propose a topological model that produces long oscillations around the network boundary, reducing the system dynamics to a lower-dimensional current in a robust manner. Using this to model KaiC, which regulates the circadian rhythm in cyanobacteria, we compare the coherence of oscillations to that in other KaiC models. Our topological model localizes currents on the system edge, with an efficient regime of simultaneously increased precision and decreased cost. Further, we introduce a new predictor of coherence from the analysis of spectral gaps, and show that our model saturates a global thermodynamic bound. Our work presents a new mechanism and parsimonious description for robust emergent oscillations in complex biological networks.</description>

      <title>Learning from higher-order statistics, efficiently: hypothesis tests, random features, and neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks excel at discovering statistical patterns in high-dimensional data sets. In practice, higher-order cumulants, which quantify the non-Gaussian correlations between three or more variables, are particularly important for the performance of neural networks. But how efficient are neural networks at extracting features from higher-order cumulants? We study this question in the spiked cumulant model, where the statistician needs to recover a privileged direction or "spike" from the order-$p\ge 4$ cumulants of $d$-dimensional inputs. Existing literature established the presence of a wide statistical-to-computational gap in this problem. We deepen this line of work by finding an exact formula for the likelihood ratio norm which proves that statistical distinguishability requires $n\gtrsim d$ samples, while distinguishing the two distributions in polynomial time requires $n \gtrsim d^2$ samples for a wide class of algorithms, i.e. those covered by the low-degree conjecture. Numerical experiments show that neural networks do indeed learn to distinguish the two distributions with quadratic sample complexity, while "lazy" methods like random features are not better than random guessing in this regime. Our results show that neural networks extract information from higher-ordercorrelations in the spiked cumulant model efficiently, and reveal a large gap in the amount of data required by neural networks and random features to learn from higher-order cumulants.</description>

      <title>Analytic thermodynamic properties of the Lieb-Liniger gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of the approximate analytic approaches describing the finite-temperature thermodynamic quantities of the Lieb-Liniger model of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact repulsive interactions. This paradigmatic model of quantum many-body-theory plays an important role in many areas of physics -- thanks to its integrability and possible experimental realization using, e.g., ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms confined to quasi-1D geometries. The thermodynamics of the uniform Lieb-Liniger gas can be obtained numerically using the exact thermal Bethe ansatz (TBA) method, first derived in 1969 by Yang and Yang. However, the TBA numerical calculations do not allow for the in-depth understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the thermodynamic behavior of the Lieb-Liniger gas at finite temperature. Our work is then motivated by the insights that emerge naturally from the transparency of closed-form analytic results, which are derived here in six different regimes of the gas and which exhibit an excellent agreement with the TBA numerics. Our findings can be further adopted for characterising the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous (e.g., harmonically trapped) 1D Bose gases within the local density approximation and for the development of improved hydrodynamic theories, allowing for the calculation of breathing mode frequencies which depend on the underlying thermodynamic equation of state. Our analytic approaches can be applied to other systems including impurities in a quantum bath, liquid helium-4, and ultracold Bose gas mixtures.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using quantum singular value transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering quantum information from a noisy quantum system is one of the central challenges in quantum information science and fundamental physics. The key to this goal is explicitly constructing a decoder. In this paper, we provide two explicit decoding quantum circuits that are both capable of recovering quantum information when a decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. The decoders are constructed by using the fixed-point amplitude amplification algorithm based on the quantum singular value transformation, which significantly extends an approach by Yoshida and Kitaev in a specific noise model to general situations. We also show that the proposed decoding circuits reduce the computational cost compared to a previously known explicit decoder. Our constructions not only show an intriguing intersection between decoders and quantum algorithms but also reveal the power of an algorithmic approach to recovering quantum information.</description>

      <title>The escape transition of a lattice star polymer grafted in a pore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polymers in confined spaces are compressed and have reduced conformational entropy, and will partially or fully escape from confinement if conditions are suitable. This is in particular the case for a polymer grafted in a pore. The escape of the polymer from the pore may be considered a partial translocation from the pore into bulk solution, and the resulting conformational readjustment of the polymer has characteristics of a thermodynamic phase transition. In this paper a lattice self-avoiding walk model of a star polymer grafted in a pore is examined numerically using the PERM algorithm. We show that the arms of the grafted lattice star escape one at a time as the length of the pore is reduced, consistent with earlier results in the literature. Critical points for the escape transitions are estimated for square and cubic lattice models and we also examine various properties of the model as it undergoes the escape transitions.</description>
