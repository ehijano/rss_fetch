      <title>Theoretical modeling of the dynamic range of an elastic nanobeam under tension with a geometric nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical description of the weakly nonlinear and mode-dependent dynamics of a nanoscale beam that is under intrinsic tension is developed. A full analysis of the dynamic range of the beam over a wide range of conditions is presented. The dynamic range is bounded from below by the amplitude of vibration due to thermal motion and it is bounded from above by large amplitude oscillations where the geometric nonlinearity plays a significant role due to stretching induced tension. The dynamics are analyzed using a beam with clamped boundaries, a string model, and a beam with hinged boundaries. The range of validity for the different models is quantified in detail. A hinged beam model is found to provide an accurate description, with insightful closed-form analytical expressions, over a wide range of conditions. The relative importance of bending and tension in the mode-dependent dynamics of the beam is determined. Bending is shown to be important for the higher modes of oscillation with the onset of its importance dependent upon the amount of intrinsic tension that is present. The theoretical predictions are directly compared with experimental measurements for the first ten modes of two nanoscale beams. We discuss the accuracy of these approaches and their use for the development of emerging micro and nanoscale technologies that exploit the multimodal dynamics of small elastic beams operating in the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Consistency analysis and nuclear data validation for two series of beryllium reflector critical benchmark experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron-induced nuclear reaction data on beryllium playing a crucial role in nuclear application. However, discrepancies have been observed in two closely related series of beryllium-reflector fast-spectrum critical benchmark experiments, HMF-058 and HMF-066, which are widely used in current nuclear data validation. In this work, we address these inconsistencies by improving the secondary angular distributions of the (n,n) and (n,2n) reactions of beryllium, thereby making the theoretical calculations (C) and experimental results (E) of these two series more consistent, and reducing the cumulative ${\chi^2}$ value from 7.58 using the ENDF/B-VII.1 to 4.52. All calculations based on the improved nuclear data agree with the experimental measurements within 1${\sigma}$ experimental uncertainty. Based on the latest comprehensive evaluation of uranium nuclear data, this consistency is slightly improved, and the cumulative ${\chi^2}$ value decreases to 4.36 once again. Despite these advances, systematic differences in the expected values of C/E between the two series still exist. The C/E values of the HMF-066 series are generally 230-330 pcm lower than those of the HMF-058 series, comparable to their experimental uncertainties of 200-400 pcm. Therefore, drawing a definitive conclusion about this systematic difference remains challenging. If the current improvement of differential nuclear data based on experimental data of ${^9}$Be is accurate, then the HMF-058 series experiments seem to be more reliable than the HMF-066 series.</description>

      <title>Wireless Multi-Port Sensing: Virtual-VNA-Enabled De-Embedding of an Over-the-Air Fixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a multi-port-backscatter-modulation technique to determine, over the air (OTA), the scattering parameters of a linear, passive, time-invariant multi-port device under test (DUT). A set of "not-directly-accessible" (NDA) antennas can be switched between being terminated by the DUT or by a specific, known, tunable load network. Waves can be radiated and captured via a distinct set of "accessible" antennas that couple OTA to the NDA antennas. First, we characterize the OTA fixture between the accessible antennas' ports and the DUT's ports. We achieve this based on our recently introduced "Virtual VNA" technique; specifically, we connect the NDA antennas to the tunable load network and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas' ports for various configurations of the tunable load network. Second, we connect the NDA antennas to the DUT and measure the scattering at the accessible antennas' ports. Third, we de-embed the OTA fixture to retrieve the DUT's scattering parameters. We experimentally validate our technique at 2.45 GHz for 1-port DUTs and 5-port DUTs, considering a rich-scattering OTA fixture inside a reverberation chamber. We systematically study the influence of the number of accessible antennas and various conceivable simplifications in terms of the system model as well as the properties of the tunable load network. Our wireless multi-port sensing technique can find applications in areas like RFID and wireless bioelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks hold promise for key distribution, private and distributed computing, and quantum sensing, among other applications. The scale of such networks for ground users is currently limited by one's ability to distribute entanglement between distant locations. This can in principle be carried out by transmitting entangled photons through optical fibers or satellites. The former is limited by fiber optic attenuation while the latter is limited by atmospheric extinction and diffraction. Here, we propose a hybrid network and protocol that outperform both ground- and satellite-based designs and lead to high-fidelity entanglement at a continental or even global scale.</description>

      <title>Vector-level Feedforward Control of LPBF Melt Pool Area Using a Physics-Based Thermal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing technique that has gained popularity thanks to its ability to produce geometrically complex, fully dense metal parts. However, these parts are prone to internal defects and geometric inaccuracies, stemming in part from variations in the melt pool. This paper proposes a novel vector-level feedforward control framework for regulating melt pool area in LPBF. By decoupling part-scale thermal behavior from small-scale melt pool physics, the controller provides a scale-agnostic prediction of melt pool area and efficient optimization over it. This is done by operating on two coupled lightweight models: a finite-difference thermal model that efficiently captures vector-level temperature fields and a reduced-order, analytical melt pool model. Each model is calibrated separately with minimal single-track and 2D experiments, and the framework is validated on a complex 3D geometry in both Inconel 718 and 316L stainless steel. Results showed that feedforward vector-level laser power scheduling reduced geometric inaccuracy in key dimensions by 62%, overall porosity by 16.5%, and photodiode variation by 6.8% on average. Overall, this modular, data-efficient approach demonstrates that proactively compensating for known thermal effects can significantly improve part quality while remaining computationally efficient and readily extensible to other materials and machines.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric multiferroics: from fundamentals to transformative applications -- a mini review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiferroics, combining ferroelectric and magnetic orders, enable magnetoelectric (ME) coupling for advanced applications. This mini review explores single-phase and composite multiferroics, examining phenomenological, microscopic, nanostruc-tured, and quantum mechanisms driving ME effects. Phenomenological models quantify coupling coefficients, while microscopic approaches reveal spin-lattice in-teractions, including frustrated spin states and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya contributions. Nanostructured systems, such as plasmonic skyrmion lattices and metasurfaces, en-hance ME effects for tunable birefringence and electromagnon amplification. Quan-tum heat engines utilize spin entanglement and topological protection in chiral chains and skyrmion lattices for efficient energy conversion. Applications include high-sensitivity magnetic sensors, tunable radio-frequency devices, energy-efficient MERAM, energy harvesters, quantum heat engines, and thermal diodes. Future re-search aims to optimize room-temperature ME coupling, scalability, coherence, and biocompatibility for innovations in sensing, quantum computing, and sustainable energy.</description>

      <title>Multifrequency system model for multiport time-modulated scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing scatterers in communication engineering, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and backscatter systems, requires physically consistent models for accurate performance prediction. A multiport model, which also accounts for structural scattering, has been developed for non-periodic scatterers. However, many emerging systems operate at multiple frequencies or generate intermodulation harmonics, particularly when incorporating space-time modulation (STM) or dynamic load control. These functionalities demand advanced modeling approaches capable of capturing scattering behavior across several frequencies and directions simultaneously. This article extends a multiport S-parameters-based model for predicting the scattering properties of multifrequency operating structures. The model extends the applicability of convenient S-matrix models to time-modulated multiport structures. Unlike known approaches, this model incorporates structural scattering, mutual coupling, the possibility of non-digital modulation, and non-periodic configurations, enabling precise analysis and optimization for a broad range of communication and sensing systems. Validation against experimental results for a space-time modulated scattering structure demonstrates the accuracy and practical applicability of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Technical Review on RF-Amplifiers for Quantum Computer Circuits: New Architectures of Josephson Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs) are key components in quantum information processing due to their ability to amplify weak quantum signals with near-quantum-limited noise performance. This is essential for applications such as qubit readout, quantum sensing, and communication, where signal fidelity and coherence preservation are critical. Unlike CMOS and HEMT amplifiers used in conventional RF systems, JPAs are specifically optimized for millikelvin (mK) cryogenic environments. CMOS amplifiers offer good integration but perform poorly at ultra-low temperatures due to high noise. HEMT amplifiers provide better noise performance but are power-intensive and less suited for mK operation. JPAs, by contrast, combine low power consumption with ultra-low noise and excellent cryogenic compatibility, making them ideal for quantum systems. The first part of this study compares these RF amplifier types and explains why JPAs are preferred in cryogenic quantum applications. The second part focuses on the design and analysis of JPAs based on both single Josephson junctions and junction arrays. While single-junction JPAs utilize nonlinear inductance for amplification, they suffer from gain compression, limited dynamic range, and sensitivity to fabrication variations. To overcome these challenges, this work explores JPA designs using Josephson junction arrays. Arrays distribute the nonlinear response, enhancing power handling, linearity, impedance tunability, and coherence while reducing phase noise. Several advanced JPA architectures are proposed, simulated, and compared using quantum theory and CAD tools to assess performance trade-offs and improvements over conventional designs.</description>

      <title>Rapid and precise distance measurement using balanced cross-correlation of a single frequency-modulated electro-optic comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-rapid, high-precision distance metrology is critical for both advanced scientific research and practical applications. However, current light detection and ranging technologies struggle to simultaneously achieve high measurement speed, accuracy, and a large non-ambiguity range. Here, we present a time-of-flight optical ranging technique based on a repetition-frequency-modulated femtosecond electro-optic comb and balanced nonlinear cross-correlation detection. In this approach, a target distance is determined as an integer multiple of the comb repetition period. By rapidly sweeping the comb repetition frequency, we achieve absolute distance measurements within 500 ns and real-time displacement tracking at single-pulse resolution (corresponding to a refresh rate of 172 MHz). Furthermore, our system attains an ultimate ranging precision of 5 nm (with 0.3 s integration time). Our method uniquely integrates nanometer-scale precision, megahertz-level refresh rates, and a theoretically unlimited ambiguity range within a single platform, while also supporting multi-target detection. These advances pave the way for high-speed, high-precision ranging systems in emerging applications such as structural health monitoring, industrial manufacturing, and satellite formation flying.</description>

      <title>From the up-converting multimodal luminescent thermometer to ratiometric visual power density meter based on Er3+,Yb3+ emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that thermally induced variations in the spectroscopic properties of Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ can be effectively harnessed for multimodal remote temperature sensing. As shown, Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ supports multiple ratiometric sensing modes based on the intensity ratios of (i) 2H11/2 -&gt; 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 -&gt; 4I15/2; (ii) 2H9/2 -&gt; 4I13/2 and 4S3/2 -&gt; 4I15/2; and (iii) green-to-red emission intensity ratio, achieving maximum relative sensitivities of 2.8% K-1, 3% K-1, and 1.8% K-1, respectively. The synergy between thermal changes observed in the green-to-red emission intensity ratio of Er3+ ions, combined with the efficient optical heating of Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ at elevated Yb3+ concentrations enables the development of a visual optical power density sensor, exhibiting relative sensitivities of SRx = 1.0% W-1 cm2 and SRy = 0.9% W-1 cm2 at 15 W cm-2 when quantified using CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a visual luminescent optical power density sensor. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Na3Sc2(PO4)3:Er3+, Yb3+ can be successfully applied for two-dimensional imaging of optical power density, thereby enabling spatial visualization of power distribution within an illuminated field.</description>

      <title>Dechanneling Population at Extreme Crystal Bending with 6.5 TeV Proton Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam measurements with bent crystals, installed in the Large Hadron Collider to assist multistage collimation system, provided information on hadron interactions with crystals in the multi-TeV energy range. In particular, the dechanneling population was observed through scans of deflected halo with collimators. Taking advantage of the fact that crystals with different values of curvature radii were present, the dependence of dechanneling on bending radius (R) was recorded. Dechanneling was found to be enhanced in crystals with smaller bending radius, because it is too close to the critical value R_c at the LHC energy of 6.5 TeV where channeling is lost. Data analysis and comparison to simulation results provided a better understanding of the phenomena and could be used to define specifications for more performing crystals in future upgrades of the crystal collimation system.</description>

      <title>Natural Hyperbolicity of Hexagonal Boron Nitride in the Deep Ultraviolet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic media enable unique optical phenomena including hyperlensing, negative refraction, enhanced photonic density of states (PDOS), and highly confined polaritons. While most hyperbolic media are artificially engineered metamaterials, certain natural materials with extreme anisotropy can exhibit hyperbolic dispersion. Here, we report the first observation of natural hyperbolic dispersion in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in the deep-ultraviolet (DUV) regime, induced by strong, anisotropic exciton resonances. Using imaging spectroscopic ellipsometry (ISE), we characterize the complex dielectric function along in-plane and out-of-plane directions down to 190 nm (6.53 eV), revealing a type-II hyperbolic window in the DUV regime. This hyperbolicity supports hyperbolic exciton polaritons (HEP) with high directionality and slow group velocity. Our findings establish hBN as a promising platform for nanophotonic applications in the technologically significant DUV spectral range.</description>

      <title>A fast and accurate method for inferring solid-state diffusivity in lithium-ion battery active materials: improving upon the classical GITT approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data collected using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and application of the Sand equation is a ubiquitous method for inferring the solid-state diffusivity in lithium-ion battery active materials. However, the experiment is notoriously time-consuming and the Sand equation relies on assumptions whose applicability can be questionable. We propose a novel methodology, termed Inference from a Consistent Model (ICM), which enables inference of solid-state diffusivity using the same physical model employed for prediction, and is applicable to more general and quick-to-measure data. We infer the diffusivity (as a function of inserted lithium concentration) by minimising the residual sum of squares between data and solutions to a spherically-symmetric nonlinear diffusion model in a single representative active material particle. Using data harvested from the NMC cathode of a commercial LG M50 cell we demonstrate that the ICM is robust, and yields more accurate diffusivity estimates, while relying on data that are five times faster to collect than that required by the classical approach. Moreover, there is good reason to believe that further speed ups could be achieved when other types of data are available. This work contributes towards developing faster and more reliable techniques in parameter inference for lithium-ion batteries, and the code required to deploy ICM is provided to facilitate its adoption in future research.</description>

Abstract: We show that optomechanical pressure sensors with characterized density and thickness can achieve uncertainty as low as 1.1 % via comparison with a secondary pressure standard. The agreement between the secondary standard and our optomechanical sensors is a necessary step towards using optomechanical devices as primary pressure sensors. Our silicon nitride and silicon carbide sensors are short-term and long-term stable, displaying Allan deviations compatible with better than 1 % precision and baseline drift significantly lower than the secondary standard. Our measurements also yield the in situ thin-film density of our sensors with 1 % total uncertainty or lower, aiding development of other optomechanical sensors. Our results demonstrate that optomechanical pressure sensors can achieve accuracy, precision, and drift sufficient to replace high performance legacy pressure gauges.</description>

Abstract: The family of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) emerging materials is rapidly evolving due to their low crystal symmetry and in-plane structural anisotropy. Among these, 2D tin sulfide (SnS) has gained significant attention because of its distinctive crystalline symmetry and the resulting extraordinary anisotropic physical properties. This perspective explores recent developments in anisotropic 2D SnS. In particular, it highlights advances in isolating high-quality SnS monolayers (1L-SnS) and in applying advanced techniques for anisotropic characterization. The discussion continues with an overview of the anisotropic optical and electronic properties of SnS, followed by recent progress in emerging electronic device applications, including energy conversion &amp; storage, neuromorphic (synaptic) systems, spintronics and quantum technologies. In addition to presenting significant research findings on SnS, this perspective outlines current limitations and discusses emerging opportunities and future prospects for its application in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>
