      <title>Moduli spaces of nilpotent displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the moduli problem of deformations of nilpotent displays by quasi-isogenies is representable, without using $p$-divisible groups. The main ingredients are Artin's criterion and the theory of truncated displays. This gives in particular a new proof for the representability of Rapoport-Zink spaces.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of the higher dimensional Voisin maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voisin constructed self-rational maps of Calabi-Yau manifolds obtained as varieties of $r$-planes in cubic hypersurfaces of adequate dimension. This map has been thoroughly studied in the case $r=1$, which is the Beauville-Donagi case. In this paper, we compute the action of $\Psi$ on holomorphic forms for any $r$. For $r=2$, we compute the action of $\Psi$ on the Chow group of $0$-cycles, and confirm that it is as expected from the generalized Bloch conjecture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a new class of enumerative invariants called $k$-leaky double Hurwitz descendants, generalizing both descendant integrals of double ramification cycles and the $k$-leaky double Hurwitz numbers introduced in previous work of Cavalieri, Markwig and Ranganathan. These numbers are defined as intersection numbers of the logarithmic DR cycle against $\psi$-classes and logarithmic classes coming from piecewise polynomials encoding fixed branch point conditions. We give a tropical graph sum formula for these new invariants, allowing us to show their piecewise polynomiality and a wall-crossing formula in genus zero. We also prove that in genus zero the invariants are always non-negative and give a complete classification of the cases where they vanish.</description>

      <title>The Beauville-Voisin-Franchetta conjecture and LLSS eightfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chow rings of hyper-K\"ahler varieties are conjectured to have a particularly rich structure. In this paper, we formulate a conjecture that combines the Beauville-Voisin conjecture regarding the subring generated by divisors and the Franchetta conjecture regarding generically defined cycles. As motivation, we show that this Beauville-Voisin-Franchetta conjecture for a hyper-K\"ahler variety $X$ follows from a combination of Grothendieck's standard conjectures for a very general deformation of $X$, Murre's conjecture (D) for $X$ and the Franchetta conjecture for $X^3$. As evidence, beyond the case of Fano varieties of lines on smooth cubic fourfolds, we show that this conjecture holds for codimension-2 and codimension-8 cycles on Lehn-Lehn-Sorger-van Straten eightfolds. Moreover, we establish that the subring of the Chow ring generated by primitive divisors injects into cohomology.</description>

      <title>Tropical toric maximum likelihood estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider toric maximum likelihood estimation over the field of Puiseux series and study critical points of the likelihood function using tropical methods. This problem translates to finding the intersection points of a tropical affine space with a classical linear subspace. We derive new structural results on tropical affine spaces and use these to give a complete and explicit description of the tropical critical points in certain cases. In these cases, we associate tropical critical points to the simplices in a regular triangulation of the polytope giving rise to the toric model.</description>

      <title>On the moduli description of ramified unitary Local models of signature (n-1,1)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a moduli description for the ramified unitary local model of signature (n-1,1) with any parahoric level structure when the residue field has characteristic not equals 2, confirming a conjecture of Smithling. As applications, we can present moduli descriptions for: (1) ramified unitary Pappas-Zhu local models with any parahoric level; (2) the irreducible components of their special fiber with maximal parahoric level; (3) integral model of ramified unitary Shimura varieties for any (quasi-)parahoric level.</description>

      <title>Irreducible components in Hochschild cohomology of flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple, simply-connected complex algebraic group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and $G/B$ the associated complete flag variety. The Hochschild cohomology $HH^\bullet(G/B)$ is a geometric invariant of the flag variety related to its generalized deformation theory and has the structure of a $\mathfrak{g}$-module. We study this invariant via representation-theoretic methods; in particular, we give a complete list of irreducible subrepresentations in $HH^\bullet(G/B)$ when $G=SL_n(\mathbb{C})$ or is of exceptional type (and conjecturally for all types) along with nontrivial lower bounds on their multiplicities. These results follow from a conjecture due to Kostant on the structure of the tensor product representation $V(\rho) \otimes V(\rho)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let G be a finite group acting linearly on the polynomial ring with invariant ring R. If the action is small, then a classical result of Auslander gives in dimension two a correspondence between linear representations of G and maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules. We establish a correspondence for all linear actions between representations and objects over the invariant ring by looking at quotient module schemes (up to modification) instead of the modules of covariants.</description>

      <title>Homology operations for gravity algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}$ be the moduli space of genus zero Riemann surfaces with $n+1$ marked points. In this paper we compute $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p)$ and $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1))$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and any prime $p$, where $\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1)$ denotes the sign representation of the symmetric group $\Sigma_n$. The interest in these homology groups is twofold: on the one hand classes in these equivariant homology groups parametrize homology operations for gravity algebras. On the other hand the homotopy quotient $(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1})_{\Sigma_n}$ is a model for the classifying space for $B_n/Z(B_n)$, the quotient of the braid group $B_n$ by its center.</description>

      <title>Strong-weak symmetry and quantum modularity of resurgent topological strings on local $\mathbb{P}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantizing the mirror curve to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold gives rise to quantum operators whose fermionic spectral traces produce factorially divergent formal power series in the Planck constant and its inverse. These are conjecturally captured by the Nekrasov-Shatashvili and standard topological string free energies, respectively, via the TS/ST correspondence. The resurgent structures of the first fermionic spectral trace of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ in both weak and strong coupling limits were solved exactly by the second author in [1]. Here, we take the perspective of the Stokes constants and their generating functions. We prove that a full-fledged strong-weak resurgent symmetry is at play, exchanging the perturbative/nonperturbative contributions to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic blocks in the factorization of the spectral trace. This relies on a global net of relations connecting the perturbative series and the discontinuities in the dual regimes, which is built upon the analytic properties of the $L$-functions with coefficients given by the Stokes constants and the $q$-series acting as their generating functions. Then, we show that the latter are holomorphic quantum modular forms for $\Gamma_1(3)$ and are reconstructed by the median resummation of their asymptotic expansions.</description>

      <title>Line bundles on the moduli space of Lie algebroid connections over a curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore algebro-geometric properties of the moduli space of holomorphic Lie algebroid ($ \mathcal{L} $) connections on a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g \,\geq\, 3$. A smooth compactification of the moduli space of $\mathcal{L}$-connections, such that underlying vector bundle is stable, is constructed; the complement of the moduli space inside the compactification is a divisor. A criterion for the numerical effectiveness of the boundary divisor is given. We compute the Picard group of the moduli space, and analyze Lie algebroid Atiyah bundles associated with an ample line bundle. This enables us to conclude that regular functions on the space of certain Lie algebroid connections are constants. Moreover, under some condition, it is shown that the moduli space of $\mathcal{L}$-connections does not admit non-constant algebraic functions. Rationally connectedness of the moduli spaces is explored.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Calabi-Yau varieties with $k$-liminal singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to describe certain nonlinear topological obstructions for the existence of first order smoothings of mildly singular Calabi-Yau varieties of dimension at least $4$. For nodal Calabi-Yau threefolds, a necessary and sufficient linear topological condition for the existence of a first order smoothing was given by the first author in 1986. Subsequently, Rollenske-Thomas generalized this picture to nodal Calabi-Yau varieties of odd dimension, by finding a necessary nonlinear topological condition for the existence of a first order smoothing. In a complementary direction, in our recent work, the linear necessary and sufficient conditions for nodal Calabi-Yau threefolds were extended to Calabi-Yau varieties in every dimension with $1$-liminal singularities (which are exactly the ordinary double points in dimension $3$ but not in higher dimensions). In this paper, we give a common formulation of all of these previous results by establishing analogues of the nonlinear topological conditions of Rollenske-Thomas for Calabi-Yau varieties with weighted homogeneous $k$-liminal hypersurface singularities, a broad class of singularities that includes ordinary double points in odd dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Let S be a K3 surface obtained as triple cover of a quadric branched along a genus 4 curve. Using the relation with cubic fourfolds, we show that S has finite dimensional motive, in the sense of Kimura. We also establish the Kuga-Satake Hodge conjecture for S, as well as Voisin'conjecture concerning zero-cycles. As a consequence, we obtain Kimura finite dimensionality, the Kuga-Sataka Hodge conjecture, and Voisin's conjecture for 2 (9-dimensional) irreducible components of the moduli space of K3 surfaces with an order 3 non-symplectic automorphism.</description>

We prove that if $n=pr$, then there are precisely two irreducible components, of dimensions $n^2+r-1$ and $n^2+n-2$. We also prove that the variety $\{ (x,y) \in GL_n(k) \times GL_n(k) \mid [x,y]=\zeta I \}$ is irreducible of dimension $n^2 +n/d$, where $\zeta$ is a root of unity of order $d$ with $d$ dividing $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lagrangian fibrations of hyperk\"ahler manifolds are induced by semi-ample line bundles which are isotropic with respect to the Beauville-Bogomolov-Fujiki form. For a non-isotrivial family of hyperk\"ahler manifolds over a complex manifold $S$ of positive dimension, we prove that the set of points in $S$, for which there is an isotropic class in the Picard lattice of the corresponding hyperk\"ahler manifold represented as a fiber over that point, is analytically dense in $S$. We also prove the expected openness and density of the locus of polarised hyperk\"ahler manifolds that admit a nef algebraic isotropic line bundle.</description>
