      <title>Raney extensions of frames: algebraic aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We draw from Raney duality and generalize the notion of canonical extension for distributive lattices to the context of frames. This is a generalization because for distributive lattices we are in the context of coherent spaces, whereas frames represent arbitrary spaces. We introduce Raney extensions of frames, pairs $(L,C)$ where $C$ is a coframe, $L\subseteq C$ is a frame that meet-generates it, and the inclusion $L\subseteq C$ preserves the frame operations as well as the strongly exact meets. We think of these as being algebraic versions of the embedding $\Omega(X)\subseteq \mathcal{U}(X)$ of a frame of opens into a lattice of saturated sets (upper sets in the specialization order). We show that a frame may have several Raney extensions, and all satisfy a generalization of the properties of density and compactness from the theory of canonical extensions. We show that every frame $L$ has the largest and the smallest Raney extension, and that these are, respectively, the coframe of fitted sublocales $\mathsf{S}_{\mathfrak{o}}(L)$ and the opposite of the frame $\mathsf{S}_{\mathfrak{c}}(L)$ of joins of closed sublocales. We thus show that these structures have universal properties which are dual of one another. For Raney extensions $(L,C)$ and $(M,D)$, we characterize the frame morphisms $f:L\to M$ which can be extended to a morphism of Raney extensions. We apply this result to obtain a characterization of morphisms of frames $f:L\to M$ which can be lifted to frame morphisms $\mathsf{S}_{\mathfrak{c}}(L)\to \mathsf{S}_{\mathfrak{c}}(M)$. We also show that the canonical extension of a locally compact frame is the free Raney extension over it such that it is algebraic (generated by its compact elements). We give a characterization of sobriety and of strict sobriety based on a variation of the compactness property of the extension $(\Omega(X),\mathcal{U}(X))$.</description>

      <title>A Computational Approach to the Homotopy Theory of DG categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a specific cylinder functor for semifree dg categories. This allows us to construct a homotopy colimit functor explicitly. These two functors are "computable", specifically, the constructed cylinder functor sends a dg category of finite type, i.e., a semifree dg category having finitely many generating morphisms, to a dg category of finite type. The homotopy colimit functor has a similar property. Moreover, using the cylinder functor, we give a cofibration category of semifree dg categories and that of dg categories of finite type, independently from the work of Tabuada. All the results similarly work for semifree dg algebras. We also describe an application to symplectic topology and provide a toy example.</description>

      <title>Normed modules and the categorization of Lebesgue integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the assignment of norms to $\Lambda$-modules over a finite-dimensional algebra $\Lambda$, resulting in the establishment of normed $\Lambda$-modules. Our primary contribution lies in constructing a new category $\mathscr{N}\!\!or^p$ related to normed modules along with its full subcategory $\mathscr{A}^p$. By examining the objects and morphisms in these categories, we establish a framework for understanding the categorization of Lebesgue integration.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Hereditary Orderings of Nakayama Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To determine an algebra is quasi-hereditary is a difficult problem. An effective method, Green-Schroll set, is introduced in this paper to tackle this problem. It is well known that an algebra is quasi-hereditary if and only if it admits a quasi-hereditary ordering of simple modules. Let $A$ be a Nakayama algebra. We prove a necessary and sufficient criterion to determine whether an ordering of simple modules is quasi-hereditary on $A$, and $A$ is quasi-hereditary if and only if its Green-Schroll set is nonempty. This seems to be the simplest characterization currently known, since it does not involve any algebraic concepts. A general iteration formula for the number $q(A)$ of all quasi-hereditary orderings of $A$ is given via Green-Schroll set. The $q$-ordering conjecture is proved to be true for $A$.</description>

      <title>Delooping generated groups in homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homotopy type theory is a logical setting based on Martin-L\"of type theory in which one can perform geometric constructions and proofs in a synthetic way. Namely, types can be interpreted as spaces (up to continuous deformation) and proofs as homotopy invariant constructions. In this context, the loop spaces of types with a distinguished element (more precisely, pointed connected groupoids), provide a natural representation of groups, what we call here internal groups. The construction which internalizes a given group is called delooping, because it is a formal inverse to the loop space operator. As we recall in the article, this delooping operation has a concrete definition for any group G given by the type of G-torsors. Those are particular sets together with an action of G, which means that they come equipped with an endomorphism for every element of G. We show that, when a generating set is known for the group, we can construct a smaller representation of the type of G-torsors, using the fact that we only need automorphisms for the elements of the generating set. We thus obtain a concise definition of (internal) groups in homotopy type theory, which can be useful to define deloopings without resorting to higher inductive types, or to perform computations on those. We also investigate an abstract construction for the Cayley group of a generated group. Most of the developments performed in the article have been formalized using the cubical version of the Agda proof assistant.</description>

      <title>A compositional account of motifs, mechanisms, and dynamics in biochemical regulatory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regulatory networks depict promoting or inhibiting interactions between molecules in a biochemical system. We introduce a category-theoretic formalism for regulatory networks, using signed graphs to model the networks and signed functors to describe occurrences of one network in another, especially occurrences of network motifs. With this foundation, we establish functorial mappings between regulatory networks and other mathematical models in biochemistry. We construct a functor from reaction networks, modeled as Petri nets with signed links, to regulatory networks, enabling us to precisely define when a reaction network could be a physical mechanism underlying a regulatory network. Turning to quantitative models, we associate a regulatory network with a Lotka-Volterra system of differential equations, defining a functor from the category of signed graphs to a category of parameterized dynamical systems. We extend this result from closed to open systems, demonstrating that Lotka-Volterra dynamics respects not only inclusions and collapsings of regulatory networks, but also the process of building up complex regulatory networks by gluing together simpler pieces. Formally, we use the theory of structured cospans to produce a lax double functor from the double category of open signed graphs to that of open parameterized dynamical systems. Throughout the paper, we ground the categorical formalism in examples inspired by systems biology.</description>

      <title>The Topos of Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer neural network has significantly out-shined all other neural network architectures as the engine behind large language models. We provide a theoretical analysis of the expressivity of the transformer architecture through the lens of topos theory. From this viewpoint, we show that many common neural network architectures, such as the convolutional, recurrent and graph convolutional networks, can be embedded in a pretopos of piecewise-linear functions, but that the transformer necessarily lives in its topos completion. In particular, this suggests that the two network families instantiate different fragments of logic: the former are first order, whereas transformers are higher-order reasoners. Furthermore, we draw parallels with architecture search and gradient descent, integrating our analysis in the framework of cybernetic agents.</description>
