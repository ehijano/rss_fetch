      <title>Bio-inspired site characterization -- towards soundings with lightweight equipment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equipment used for site investigation activities like drill rigs are typically large and heavy to provide sufficient reaction mass to overcome the soil's penetration resistance. The need for large and heavy equipment creates challenges for performing site investigations at sites with limited accessibility, such as urban centres, vegetated areas, locations with height restrictions and surficial soft soils, and steep slopes. Also, mobilization of large equipment to the project site is responsible for a significant portion of the carbon footprint of site investigations. Successful development of self burrowing technology can have enormous implications for geotechnical site investigation, ranging from performance of in situ tests to installation of instrumentation without the need of heavy equipment. During the last decade there has been an acceleration of research in the field of bioinspired geotechnics, whose premise is that certain animals and plants have developed efficient strategies to interact with geomaterials in ways that are analogous to those in geotechnical engineering. This paper provides a synthesis of advances in bioinspired site investigation related to the reduction of penetration resistance by means of modifying the tip shape, expanding a shaft section near the probe tip, applying motions to the tip like rotation and oscillation, and injecting fluids and generation of reaction forces with temporary anchors that enable self burrowing. Examples of prototypes that have been tested experimentally are highlighted. However, there are important research gaps associated with testing in a broader range of conditions, interpretation of results, and development of hardware that need to be addressed to develop field ready equipment that can provide useful data for geotechnical design.</description>

      <title>A physics-engineering-economic model coupling approach for estimating the socio-economic impacts of space weather scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing concern about our vulnerability to space weather hazards and the disruption critical infrastructure failures could cause to society and the economy. However, the socio-economic impacts of space weather hazards, such as from geomagnetic storms, remain under-researched. This study introduces a novel framework to estimate the economic impacts of electricity transmission infrastructure failure due to space weather. By integrating existing geophysical and geomagnetically induced current (GIC) estimation models with a newly developed geospatial model of the Continental United States power grid, GIC vulnerabilities are assessed for a range of space weather scenarios. The approach evaluates multiple power network architectures, incorporating input-output economic modeling to translate business and population disruptions into macroeconomic impacts from GIC-related thermal heating failures. The results indicate a daily GDP loss from 6 billion USD to over 10 billion USD. Even under conservative GIC thresholds (75 A/ph) aligned with thermal withstand limits from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), significant economic disruptions are evident. This study is limited by its restriction to thermal heating analysis, though GICs can also affect the grid through other pathways, such as voltage instability and harmonic distortions. Addressing these other failure mechanisms need to be the focus of future research.</description>

      <title>2D numerical simulation of lunar response to gravitational waves using finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies of the response of the Moon to gravitational waves have been carried out using analytical or semi-analytical models assuming ideal lunar structures. Such models are advantageous for their high-speed calculation but fail to account for the extremely heterogeneous subsurface and/or interior structures of the Moon. Numerical calculations are needed, but it is challenging to model the topography and lateral heterogeneity of the Moon. In addition, the computational cost is great especially when performing the GW simulation for a long time. As a first step towards overcoming the above difficulties, we employ a two-dimensional finite element method to numerically simulate the lunar response to gravitational waves. We verify our method by comparing our numerical results with those semi-analytical solutions. Based on such comparison, we also analyze the limitation of the two-dimensional simulation. Our work breaks a new way towards the precise simulation of realistic lunar response to gravitational waves in the future and lays down a solid foundation for three-dimensional numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>An Attention-based Framework with Multistation Information for Earthquake Early Warnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earthquake early warning systems play crucial roles in reducing the risk of seismic disasters. Previously, the dominant modeling system was the single-station models. Such models digest signal data received at a given station and predict earth-quake parameters, such as the p-phase arrival time, intensity, and magnitude at that location. Various methods have demonstrated adequate performance. However, most of these methods present the challenges of the difficulty of speeding up the alarm time, providing early warning for distant areas, and considering global information to enhance performance. Recently, deep learning has significantly impacted many fields, including seismology. Thus, this paper proposes a deep learning-based framework, called SENSE, for the intensity prediction task of earthquake early warning systems. To explicitly consider global information from a regional or national perspective, the input to SENSE comprises statistics from a set of stations in a given region or country. The SENSE model is designed to learn the relationships among the set of input stations and the locality-specific characteristics of each station. Thus, SENSE is not only expected to provide more reliable forecasts by considering multistation data but also has the ability to provide early warnings to distant areas that have not yet received signals. This study conducted extensive experiments on datasets from Taiwan and Japan. The results revealed that SENSE can deliver competitive or even better performances compared with other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Vehicle-Induced Distributed Acoustic Sensing Signals for Accurate Urban Near-Surface Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous seismic monitoring of the near-surface structure is crucial for urban infrastructure safety, aiding in the detection of sinkholes, subsidence, and other seismic hazards. Utilizing existing telecommunication optical fibers as Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) systems offers a cost-effective method for creating dense seismic arrays in urban areas. DAS leverages roadside fiber-optic cables to record vehicle-induced surface waves for near-surface imaging. However, the influence of roadway vehicle characteristics on their induced surface waves and the resulting imaging of near-surface structures is poorly understood. We investigate surface waves generated by vehicles of varying weights and speeds to provide insights into accurate and efficient near-surface characterization. We first classify vehicles into light, mid-weight, and heavy based on the maximum amplitudes of quasi-static DAS records. Vehicles are also classified by their traveling speed using their arrival times at DAS channels. To investigate how vehicle characteristics influence the induced surface waves, we extract phase velocity dispersion and invert the subsurface structure for each vehicle class by retrieving virtual shot gathers (VSGs). Our results reveal that heavy vehicles produce higher signal-to-noise ratio surface waves, and a sevenfold increase in vehicle weight can reduce uncertainties in phase velocity measurements from dispersion spectra by up to 3X. Thus, data from heavy vehicles better constrain structures at greater depths. Additionally, with driving speeds ranging from 5 to 30 meters per second in our study, differences in the dispersion curves due to vehicle speed are less pronounced than those due to vehicle weight. Our results suggest judiciously selecting and processing surface wave signals from certain vehicle types can improve the quality of near-surface imaging in urban environments.</description>
