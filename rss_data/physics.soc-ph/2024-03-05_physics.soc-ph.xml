      <title>Battery quality at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, the need for widespread electrification is now internationally recognized. As a result, global battery production is set to dramatically expand over the next decade. Unfortunately, however, batteries are both immensely difficult to produce at the gigawatt-hour scale and inordinately sensitive to minor manufacturing variation. As a result, the battery industry has already experienced a number of both highly-visible safety incidents and under-the-radar reliability issues -- a trend that will only worsen if left unaddressed. In this perspective, we highlight both the challenges and opportunities to enable battery quality at scale. We first describe the interplay between various battery failure modes and their numerous root causes. We then discuss the tensions at play to manage and improve battery quality during cell production. We hope our perspective brings greater visibility to the battery quality challenge to enable safe global electrification.</description>

      <title>An "Opinion Reproduction Number" for Infodemics in a Bounded-Confidence Content-Spreading Process on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of content on networks. To do this, we use a model in which content spreads through a bounded-confidence mechanism. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spread model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. To study the spread of content, we define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion will die off or propagate widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination using a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have large expected mean degree or large receptiveness to content. When the amount of content spread only slightly exceeds the critical opinion reproduction number (i.e., the infodemic threshold), there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness is larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Games Modeling of Anticipation in Dense Crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling pedestrian dynamics in dense crowds is a complex yet essential aspect of crowd management and urban planning. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a dense crowd crossed by a cylindrical intruder using a Mean-Field Game (MFG) model. By incorporating a discount factor to account for pedestrians' limited anticipation and information processing, we examine the model's ability to simulate two distinct experimental configurations: pedestrians facing the obstacle and pedestrians giving their back to the intruder. Through a comprehensive comparison with experimental data, we demonstrate that the MFG model effectively captures essential crowd behaviors, including anticipatory motion and collision avoidance.</description>

      <title>Control of cascading failures using protective measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascading failures, triggered by a local perturbation, can be catastrophic and cause irreparable damages in a wide area. Hence, blocking the devastating cascades is an important issue in real world networks. One of the ways to control the cascade is to use protective measures, so that the agents decide to be protected against failure. Here, we consider a coevolution of the linear threshold model for the spread of cascading failures and a decision-making game based on the perceived risk of failure. Protected agents are less vulnerable to failure and in return the size of the cascade affects the agent's decision to get insured. We find at what range of protection efficiency and cost of failure, the global cascades stop. Also we observe that in some range of protection efficiency, a bistable region emerges for the size of cascade and the prevalence of protected agents. Moreover, we show how savings or the ability of agents to repair can prevent cascades from occurring</description>

      <title>Network analysis using Krylov subspace trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</description>

      <title>Shipping traffic through the Arctic Ocean: spatial distribution, temporal evolution and its dependence on the sea ice extent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduction in sea ice cover with Arctic warming facilitates the transit of ships through routes that are remarkably shorter than the traditional shipping routes. Automatic Identification System (AIS), ideally designed to avoid vessel collisions, transmits on vessel navigation information (currently 27 types of messages) such as name, position or speed, is a powerful data source to monitor the progress of Arctic shipping as the ice cover decreases. Based on the analysis of an online platform collecting shipping AIS data, we quantified the spatial distribution of shipping through the Arctic Ocean, its intensity and the temporal evolution, in relation to the area released by the sea ice area. Shipping through the Arctic Ocean is distributed spatially following a heavy-tailed distribution, implying heavy traffic through a limited Arctic area, with an exponent that depends on the vessel category. Fishing is the category with the largest spatial spread, with the width of shipping routes correlated with the proximal sea ice area. The time evolution of these routes is characterized by increasing extended periods of shipping activity through the year. AIS data offers valuable information on the activity of the international fleet worldwide. In the context of the new international agreements, it is a valuable source to monitor shipping, fishing and the potential impact in marine life among other aspects. Here we have focused on the Arctic shipping in recent years, which is rapidly growing, particularly around the Northeastern and Northwest Passage coastal routes, providing an opportunity for the design of shorter shipping routes and reduced greenhouse gas emissions from transport of goods, but at a risk of impacts on the Arctic ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Counting the uncounted : estimating the unaccounted COVID-19 infections in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Undetected infectious populations have played a major role in the COVID-19 outbreak across the globe and estimation of this undetected class is a major concern in understanding the actual size of the COVID-19 infections. Due to the asymptomatic nature of some infections, many cases have gone undetected. Also, despite carrying COVID-19 symptoms, most of the infected population kept the infections hidden and stayed unreported, especially in a country like India. Based on these factors, we have added an undetected compartment to the already developed SEIR model [48] to estimate these uncounted infections. In this article, we have applied Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to estimate the undetected infectious populations in the 20 worst-affected Indian states as well as India as a whole. The analysis has been carried out for the first as well as second surge of COVID-19 infections in India. A ratio of the active undetected infectious to the active detected infectious population is calculated through the PINN analysis which gives a picture of the real size of the pandemic in India. The rate at which symptomatic infectious population goes undetected and are never reported is also estimated using the PINN method. Toward the end, an artificial neural network (ANN) based forecasting scenario of the pandemic in India is presented. The prediction is found to be reliable as the training of the neural network has been carried out using the unique features, obtained from the state-wide analysis of the newly proposed model as well as from the PINN analysis.</description>

      <title>Measuring Entanglement in Physical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The links of a physical network cannot cross, which often forces the network layout into non- optimal entangled states. Here we define a network fabric as a two-dimensional projection of a network and propose the average crossing number as a measure of network entanglement. We analytically derive the dependence of the crossing number on network density, average link length, degree heterogeneity, and community structure and show that the predictions accurately estimate the entanglement of both network models and of real physical networks.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Multivariate Extremes in Multilayer Inhomogeneous Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multilayer inhomogeneous random graph model (MIRG), whose layers may consist of both single-edge and multi-edge graphs. In the single layer case, it has been shown that the regular variation of the weight distribution underlying the inhomogeneous random graph implies the regular variation of the typical degree distribution. We extend this correspondence to the multilayer case by showing that the multivariate regular variation of the weight distribution implies the multivariate regular variation of the asymptotic degree distribution. Furthermore, in certain circumstances, the extremal dependence structure present in the weight distribution will be adopted by the asymptotic degree distribution. By considering the asymptotic degree distribution, a wider class of Chung-Lu and Norros-Reittu graphs may be incorporated into the MIRG layers. Additionally, we prove consistency of the Hill estimator when applied to degrees of the MIRG that have a tail index greater than 1. Simulation results indicate that, in practice, hidden regular variation may be consistently detected from an observed MIRG.</description>

      <title>Social and individual learning in the Minority Game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the roles of social and individual learning on outcomes of the Minority Game model of a financial market. Social learning occurs via agents adopting the strategies of their neighbours within a social network, while individual learning results in agents changing their strategies without input from other agents. In particular, we show how social learning can undermine efficiency of the market due to negative frequency dependent selection and loss of strategy diversity. The latter of which can lock the population into a maximally inefficient state. We show how individual learning can rescue a population engaged in social learning from such inefficiencies.</description>

      <title>Broken detailed balance and entropy production in directed networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of a complex network plays a crucial role in determining its dynamical properties. In this work, we show that the directed, hierarchical organisation of a network causes the system to break detailed balance and dictates the production of entropy through non-equilibrium dynamics. We consider a wide range of dynamical processes and show how different directed network features govern their thermodynamics. Next, we analyse a collection of 97 empirical networks and show that strong directedness and non-equilibrium dynamics are both ubiquitous in real-world systems. Finally, we present a simple method for inferring broken detailed balance and directed network structure from multivariate time-series and apply our method to identify non-equilibrium and hierarchical organisation in both human neuroimaging and financial time-series. Overall, our results shed light on the thermodynamic consequences of directed network structure and indicate the importance and ubiquity of hierarchical organisation and non-equilibrium dynamics in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing social cohesion with cooperative bots in societies of greedy, mobile individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing collective crises in social development necessitates a strong level of social cohesion, characterized by cooperation and close social connections. However, this cohesion is often challenged by selfish behaviors. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the dynamic of human-machine hybrid interactions introduces new complexities in fostering social cohesion. This study investigates the role of bots in influencing social cohesion within these hybrid interactions, aiming to identify strategies to enhance cohesion amidst human-bot interactions. By analyzing a hybrid population of individuals and simple cooperative bots, we find that bots can indeed promote social cohesion by disrupting frozen states in individual migrations and encouraging collective movement. However, challenges such as random bot exploration and the presence of defective bots pose risks to cohesion, underscoring the importance of carefully designed bot behaviors. Our findings illuminate the potential of simple bots to support societal self-organization and offer critical insights into enhancing social cohesion in the era of human-machine collaboration.</description>

      <title>Political Context of the European Vaccine Debate on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, fears grew that making vaccination a political (instead of public health) issue may impact the efficacy of this life-saving intervention, spurring the spread of vaccine-hesitant content. In this study, we examine whether there is a relationship between the political interest of social media users and their exposure to vaccine-hesitant content on Twitter. We focus on 17 European countries using a multilingual, longitudinal dataset of tweets spanning the period before COVID, up to the vaccine roll-out. We find that, in most countries, users' endorsement of vaccine-hesitant content is the highest in the early months of the pandemic, around the time of greatest scientific uncertainty. Further, users who follow politicians from right-wing parties, and those associated with authoritarian or anti-EU stances are more likely to endorse vaccine-hesitant content, whereas those following left-wing politicians, more pro-EU or liberal parties, are less likely. Somewhat surprisingly, politicians did not play an outsized role in the vaccine debates of their countries, receiving a similar number of retweets as other similarly popular users. This systematic, multi-country, longitudinal investigation of the connection of politics with vaccine hesitancy has important implications for public health policy and communication.</description>
