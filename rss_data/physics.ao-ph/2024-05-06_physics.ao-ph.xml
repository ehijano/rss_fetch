      <title>Hydrologic Cycle Weakening in Hothouse Climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrologic cycle has wide impacts on the ocean salinity and circulation, carbon and nitrogen cycles, and the ecosystem. Under anthropogenic global warming, previous studies showed that the intensification of the hydrologic cycle is a robust feature. Whether this trend persists in hothouse climates, however, is unknown. Here we show in climate models that mean precipitation first increases with rising surface temperature, but the precipitation trend reverses when the surface is hotter than ~320-330 K. This non-monotonic phenomenon is robust to the cause of warming, convection scheme, ocean dynamics, atmospheric mass, planetary rotation, gravity, and stellar spectrum. The weakening occurs because of the existence of an upper limitation of outgoing longwave emission and the continuously increasing shortwave absorption by H2O, and is consistent with atmospheric dynamics featuring the strong increase of atmospheric stratification and dramatic reduction of convective mass flux. These results have wide implications for the climate evolutions of Earth, Venus, and potentially habitable exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking of rotating convection due to Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects arising from variations in thermal expansivity are theoretically and numerically studied in the context of rotating Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection under 2D configuration. The thermal expansivity increases from top to bottom, and its variation is measured by a dimensionless factor $\epsilon$. Utilizing an asymptotic expansion with weak nonlinearity, we derive an amplitude equation, revealing that NOB effects amplify the magnitude of convection. An order-$\epsilon^2$ NOB correction leads to a symmetry breaking about the horizontal mid-plane, manifested in the strengthening of convection near the bottom and its weakening near the top, forming a bottom-heavy profiles. At order $\epsilon^3$, the conjunction of NOB effects and nonlinear advection leads to a horizontal symmetry breaking. The downward cold plumes become stronger and more concentrated compared to the upward warm plumes. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analyses in the weak nonlinear regime and confirm robust horizontal asymmetry and stronger downward plumes at very large Rayleigh numbers. This work advances our understanding of hydrothermal plumes in the subglacial oceans on icy moons as well as tracer transport from the seafloor to the ice shell.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal spectral transfers in fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by previous work on kinetic energy cascades in the ocean and atmosphere, we develop a spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool that can be used to study scales of variability in generalized dynamical systems. In particular, we use generalized time-frequency methods from signal analysis to broaden the applicability of frequency transfers from theoretical to practical applications such as the study of ocean or atmosphere data or simulation output. We also show that triad interactions in wavenumber used to study kinetic energy and enstrophy cascades can be generalized to study triad interactions in frequency or wavenumber-frequency. We study the effects of sweeping on the locality of frequency transfers and frequency triad interactions to better understand the locality of spatio-temporal frequency transfers. As an illustrative example, we use the spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool to study the results of a simulation of two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. This simulated fluid is forced at a well-defined wavenumber and frequency with dissipation occurring at both large and small scales, making this one of the first studies of "modulated turbulence" in two dimensions. Our results show that the spatio-temporal transfers we develop in this paper are robust to potential practical problems such as low sampling rates or nonstationarity in time series of interest. We anticipate that this method will be a useful tool in studying scales of spatio-temporal variability in a wide range of fluids applications as higher resolution data and simulations become more widely available.</description>
