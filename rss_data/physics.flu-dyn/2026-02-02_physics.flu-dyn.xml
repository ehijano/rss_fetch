      <title>Fluid transport by a single active filament in a three-dimensional two-phase flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-scale cilia play a vital role in mucociliary clearance (MCC) in the human respiratory airways. In this numerical study, we examine fluid transport driven by the active beating of a single filament immersed in a three-dimensional two-phase flow. The cilium is modeled as an elastic filament actuated by a time-varying basal angle. The two-phase flow is resolved using the Shan-Chen model in a lattice Boltzmann solver, while the two-way coupling between the filament and the fluid is treated by the immersed boundary method. Pathological conditions such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are associated with drastic alterations of MCC properties, including changes in periciliary layer (PCL) thickness and the viscosity ratio between the PCL and the mucus layer (ML). Here, we systematically investigate the effects of these parameters, along with filament bending stiffness, on the beating pattern and fluid transport. Within the parameter ranges investigated, a moderate PCL thickness and viscosity ratio, together with high bending stiffness, tend to yield higher net flow rate and transport efficiency. The underlying hydrodynamic mechanisms are characterized through analyses of the beating pattern, filament dynamics, energy partition, and flow-field evolution. Two competing mechanisms are identified: the drag-elastic force balance and the viscous diffusion of momentum. Furthermore, quantitative relationships are established between flow rate and beating pattern, expressed in terms of tip amplitude and beating asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Parametric vector flows for registration fields in bounded domains with applications to nonlinear interpolation of shock-dominated flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a registration procedure for parametric model order reduction (MOR) in two- and three-dimensional bounded domains. In the MOR framework, registration methods exploit solution snapshots to identify a parametric coordinate transformation that improves the approximation of the solution set through linear subspaces. For each training parameter, optimization-based (or variational) registration methods minimize a target function that measures the alignment of the coherent structures of interest (e.g., shocks, shear layers, cracks) for different parameter values, over a family of bijections of the computational domain $\Omega$. We consider diffeomorphisms $\Phi$ that are vector flows of given velocity fields $v$ with vanishing normal component on $\partial \Omega$; we rely on a sensor to extract appropriate point clouds from the solution snapshots and we develop an expectation-maximization procedure to simultaneously solve the point cloud matching problem and to determine the velocity $v$ (and thus the bijection $\Phi$); finally, we combine our registration method with the nonlinear interpolation technique of [Iollo, Taddei, J. Comput. Phys., 2022] to perform accurate interpolations of fluid dynamic fields in the presence of shocks. Numerical results for a two-dimensional inviscid transonic flow past a NACA airfoil and a three-dimensional viscous transonic flow past an ONERA M6 wing illustrate the many elements of the methodology and demonstrate the effectiveness of nonlinear interpolation for shock-dominated fields.</description>

      <title>Dancing rivulets in an air-filled Hele-Shaw cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of a thin fluid filament (a rivulet) flowing in an air-filled Hele-Shaw cell. Transverse and longitudinal deformations can propagate on this rivulet, although both are linearly attenuated in the parameter range we use. On this seemingly simple system, we impose an external acoustic forcing, homogeneous in space and harmonic in time. When the forcing amplitude exceeds a given threshold, the rivulet responds nonlinearly, adopting a peculiar pattern. We investigate the dance of the rivulet both experimentally using spatiotemporal measurements, and theoretically using a model based on depth-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The instability is due to a three-wave resonant interaction between waves along the rivulet, the resonance condition fixing the pattern wavelength. Although the forcing is additive, the amplification of transverse and longitudinal waves is effectively parametric, being mediated by the linear response of the system to the homogeneous forcing. Our model successfully explains the mode selection and phase-locking between the waves, it notably allows us to predict the frequency dependence of the instability threshold. The dominant spatiotemporal features of the generated pattern are understood through a multiple-scale analysis.</description>

      <title>Stability prediction of vortex induced vibrations of multiple freely oscillating bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vortex-induced vibration of multiple spring-mounted bodies free to move in the orthogonal direction of the flow is investigated. In a first step, we derive a Linear Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (L-ALE) method to solve the fluid-structure linear problem as well as a forced problem where a harmonic motion of the bodies is imposed. We then propose a low computational-cost impedance-based criterion to predict the instability thresholds. A global stability analysis of the fluid-structure system is then performed for a tandem of cylinders and the instability thresholds obtained are found to be in perfect agreement with the predictions of the impedance-based criterion. An extensive parametric study is then performed for a tandem of cylinders and the effects of mass, damping and spacing between the bodies are investigated. Finally we also apply the impedance-based method to a three-body system to show its validity to a higher number of bodies.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of an offshore wave measurement buoy in monochromatic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate measurement of waves underpins marine energy resource characterization, device design, and project development. Datawell wave buoys are widely deployed around the world and have long served as a trusted standard for wave measurements. We quantify the measurement performance, including wave elevation and energy flux estimation, of a Datawell DWR-MkIII buoy using prescribed monochromatic heave motions on a large-amplitude six-degree-of-freedom motion platform at the National Laboratory of the Rockies, assuming the buoy behaves as an ideal wave follower. Commanded motions were validated with an optical motion tracking system while buoy elevation and raw acceleration were recorded. Wave elevations were propagated to wave energy flux estimation using four methods, including one frequency-domain method and three time-domain methods. The Bayesian optimization was applied for design of experiments, and records from three test sites were also applied and evaluated in the present study. Results show two error regions within the nominal period range of 1.6s to 30s}. For wave periods between 5s and 25s, the buoy provides accurate wave height measurements. For short periods less than 5s, the 1.28Hz sampling frequency induces sub-Nyquist artifacts that bias elevation and can drive maximum energy flux estimation errors above 100%. For long periods exceeding 25s, the buoy reported elevation is underpredicted with error depending on period but relatively independent of wave height, with maximum wave height and wave energy flux errors reaching 64% and 87%, respectively. The analysis of field data also indicates that the currently recommended method for estimating wave energy flux may underestimate the wave energy flux.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Toroidal Vortices Display Internal Simply Connected Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. This work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices.</description>
