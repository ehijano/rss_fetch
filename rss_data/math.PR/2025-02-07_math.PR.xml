      <title>Capacity Constraints in Ball and Urn Distribution Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the distribution of indistinguishable balls into distinct urns with varying capacity constraints, a foundational issue in combinatorial mathematics with applications across various disciplines. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework that addresses both upper and lower capacity constraints under different distribution conditions, elaborating on the combinatorial implications of such variations. Through rigorous analysis, we derive analytical solutions that cater to different constrained environments, providing a robust theoretical basis for future empirical and theoretical investigations. These solutions are pivotal for advancing research in fields that rely on precise distribution strategies, such as physics and parallel processing. The paper not only generalizes classical distribution problems but also introduces novel methodologies for tackling capacity variations, thereby broadening the utility and applicability of distribution theory in practical and theoretical contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the fluctuation field $\{M_t(x)\}_{x\in\mathbb{R}}$ of stationary Hastings-Levitov$(0)$ exhibits logarithmic spatial correlations. Moreover, by studying the infinitesimal generator of the imaginary part of $M_t(0)$, we show that for some $\beta&gt;0$, $\max_{x\in[0,t]}\text{Im} M_t(x)&lt;\beta\log t$ with high probability, as $t\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Fourth-Moment Theorems for Sums of Multiple Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nualart &amp; Pecatti ([Nualart and Peccati, 2005, Thm 1]) established the first fourth-moment theorem for random variables in a fixed Wiener chaos, i.e. they showed that convergence of the sequence of fourth moments to the fourth moment of the standard Gaussian distribution is sufficient for weak convergence to the standard Gaussian. In this paper, we provide what we believe to be the first generalization to chaos expansions with more than a single term. Specifically, we show that a fourth-moment theorem holds for random variables consisting of sums of two multiple integrals of orders $p, q \in N$, where $p, q$ have different parities. Furthermore, we show that such random variables cannot themselves be Gaussian, again generalizing what is known for the fixed Wiener chaos setting. Finally, we show a fourth-moment theorem for variables with infinite Wiener chaos expansions when the terms in the expansions are independent and satisfy an additional regularity condition in terms of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator.</description>

      <title>SDEs with subcritical Lebesgue--H\"{o}lder drifts and driven by $\alpha$-stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the unique weak and strong solvability for time inhomogeneous stochastic differential equations with the drifts in subcritical Lebesgue--H\"{o}lder spaces $L^p([0,T];{\mathcal C}_b^{\beta}({\mathbb R}^d;{\mathbb R}^d))$ and driven by $\alpha$-stable processes for $\alpha\in (0,2)$. The weak well-posedness is derived for $\beta\in (0,1)$, $\alpha+\beta&gt;1$ and $p&gt;\alpha/(\alpha+\beta-1)$ through the Prohorov theorem, Skorohod representation and the regularity estimates of solutions for a class of fractional parabolic partial differential equations. The pathwise uniqueness and Davie's type uniqueness are proved for $\beta&gt;1- \alpha/2$ by using It\^{o}--Tanaka's trick. Moreover, we give a counterexample to the pathwise uniqueness for the supercritical Lebesgue--H\"{o}lder drifts to explain the present result is sharp.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the interacting partially directed self-avoiding walk attracted by a vertical wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we consider the interacting partially-directed self-avoiding walk (IPDSAW) attracted by a vertical wall. The IPDSAW was introduced by Zwanzig and Lauritzen (J. Chem. Phys., 1968) as a manner of investigating the collapse transition of a homopolymer dipped in a repulsive solvent. We prove in particular that a surface transition occurs inside the collapsed phase between (i) a regime where the attractive vertical wall does not influence the geometry of the polymer and (ii) a regime where the polymer is partially attached at the wall on a length that is comparable to its horizontal extension, modifying its asymptotic Wulff shape. The latter rigorously confirms the conjecture exposed by physicists in (Physica A: Stat. Mech. \\&amp;amp; App., 2002). We push the analysis even further by providing sharp asymptotics of the partition function inside the collapsed phase.</description>

      <title>Interactions between resource dependent branching processes and equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a supplement to the paper "Interactions between Human Populations and Related Problems of Optimal Transport" written by the same author in honour of Marc Hallin, Universit\'e Libre de Bruxelles, at the occasion of Hallin's $75$th birthday. It was announced in the main paper (Bruss (2024)) published in the Springer Festschrift entitled {\it Recent Advances in Econometrics and Statistics}. It contains the proofs which, given the space constraints required for the Festschrift, could not appear in the main paper. Moreover, we complement in the present supplement the main paper by brief comments on related problems which are likely to turn up in practice for problems of guiding human populations, namely problems of control and problems of optimal stopping.</description>

      <title>Stochastic equations for two-type continuous-state branching processes in varying environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-type continuous-state branching process in varying environments is constructed as the pathwise unique solution of a system of stochastic equations driven by time-space noises, where the pathwise uniqueness is derived from a comparison property of solutions. As an application of the main result, we give characterizations of some positive integral functionals of the process in terms of Laplace transforms.</description>

Abstract: We completely characterize the class of univariate distributions allowing for a Stein kernel and illustrate our result by means of some concrete distributions. Moreover, we apply our findings to prove a quantitative version of the central limit theorem with optimal rate $n^{-1/2}$ in total variation distance for i.i.d. random variables whose distribution belongs to that class.</description>

      <title>Coincidence of critical points for directed polymers for general environments and random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the directed polymer in a random environment (DPRE), two critical inverse-temperatures can be defined. The first one, $\beta_c$, separates the strong disorder regime (in which the normalized partition function $W^{\beta}_n$ tends to zero) from the weak disorder regime (in which $W^{\beta}_n$ converges to a nontrivial limit). The other, $\bar \beta_c$, delimits the very strong disorder regime (in which $W^{\beta}_n$ converges to zero exponentially fast). It was proved previously that $\beta_c=\bar \beta_c$ when the random environment is upper-bounded for the DPRE based on the simple random walk. We extend this result to general environment and arbitrary reference walk. We also prove that $\beta_c=0$ if and only the $L^2$-critical point is trivial.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on the equivalence between Weak and Strong Spatial Mixing in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak mixing in lattice models is informally the property that ``information does not propagate inside a system''. Strong mixing is the property that ``information does not propagate inside and on the boundary of a system''. In dimension two, the boundary of reasonable systems is one dimensional, so information should not be able to propagate there. This led to the conjecture that in 2D, weak mixing implies strong mixing. The question was investigated in several previous works, and proof of this conjecture is available in the case of finite range Gibbsian specifications, and in the case of nearest-neighbour FK percolation (under some restrictions). The present work gives a new proof of these results, extends the family of models for which the implication holds, and, most interestingly, provides a ``percolative picture'' of the information propagation.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous transition in 2D Potts: I. Order-Disorder Interface convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the planar q-state Potts model undergoes a discontinuous phase transition when q &gt; 4 and there are exactly q + 1 extremal Gibbs measures at the transition point: q ordered (monochromatic) measures and one disordered (free). We focus on the Potts model under the Dobrushin order-disorder boundary conditions on a finite $N\times N$ part of the square grid. Our main result is that this interface is a well defined object, has $\sqrt{N}$ fluctuations, and converges to a Brownian bridge under diffusive scaling. The same holds also for the corresponding FK-percolation model for all q &gt; 4. Our proofs rely on a coupling between FK-percolation, the six-vertex model, and the random-cluster representation of an Ashkin-Teller model (ATRC), and on a detailed study of the latter. The coupling relates the interface in FK-percolation to a long subcritical cluster in the ATRC model. For this cluster, we develop a ``renewal picture'' \`a la Ornstein-Zernike. This is based on fine mixing properties of the ATRC model that we establish using the link to the six-vertex model and its height function. Along the way, we derive various properties of the Ashkin-Teller model, such as Ornstein-Zernike asymptotics for its two-point function. In a companion work, we provide a detailed study of the Potts model under order-order Dobrushin conditions. We show emergence of a free layer of width $\sqrt{N}$ between the two ordered phases (wetting) and establish convergence of its boundaries to two Brownian bridges conditioned not to intersect.</description>

      <title>Stochastic SIR model with individual heterogeneity and infection-age dependent infectivity on large non-homogeneous random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an individual-based stochastic SIR epidemic model with infection-age dependent infectivity on a large random graph, capturing individual heterogeneity and non-homogeneous connectivity. Each individual is associated with particular characteristics (for example, spatial location and age structure), which may not be i.i.d., and represented by a particular node. The connectivities among the individuals are given by a non-homogeneous random graph, whose connecting probabilities may depend on the individual characteristics of the edge. Each individual is associated with a random varying infectivity function, which is also associated with the individual characteristics. We use measure-valued processes to describe the epidemic evolution dynamics, tracking the infection age of all individuals, and their associated characteristics. We consider the epidemic dynamics as the population size grows to infinity under a specific scaling of the connectivity graph related to the convergence to a graphon. In the limit, we obtain a system of measure-valued equations, which can be also represented as a PDE model on graphon, which reflects the heterogeneities in individual characteristics and social connectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions for a sequence of metric spaces equipped with vector-valued measures glued via an iterative operation to converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prohorov topology. We use this to show that under mild conditions multitype Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees, conditioned in some sense to be large, converge to a limiting compact metric space which we call a multitype L\'{e}vy tree. More precisely we condition on the size of the maximal subtree of vertices of the same type generated by the root to be large. Although under a different conditioning, our result can be seen as a generalization to the multitype setting, of the Continuum Random Tree defined by Aldous in (Aldous 1991, 1993).</description>

      <title>Probability Bracket Notation for Probability Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the Dirac Notation in Quantum Mechanics (QM), we propose the Bracket Notation (PBN) by defining a probability-bra (P-bra), P-ket, P-bracket, P-identity, etc. Using the PBN, many formulae, such as normalizations and expectations in systems of one or more random variables, can now be written in abstract basis-independent expressions, which are easy to expand by inserting a proper P-identity. The time evolution of homogeneous Markov processes can also be formatted in such a way. Our system P-kets are identified with probability vectors, and our system P-bra is comparable to the Doi state function or the Peliti standard bra. In the Heisenberg picture of the PBN, a random variable becomes a stochastic process, and the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations are obtained by inserting a time-dependent P-identity. Also, some QM expressions in the Dirac notation are naturally transformed into probability expressions in PBN by a special Wick rotation. Potential applications show the usefulness of the PBN beyond the constrained domain and range of Hermitian operators on Hilbert Spaces in QM all the way to IT.</description>

      <title>On random locally flat-foldable origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of random flat-foldable origami. Given a crease pattern, we consider a uniformly random assignment of mountain and valley creases, conditioned on the assignment being flat-foldable at each vertex. A natural method to approximately sample from this distribution is via the face-flip Markov chain where one selects a face of the crease pattern uniformly at random and, if possible, flips all edges of that face from mountain to valley and vice-versa. We prove that this chain mixes rapidly for several natural families of origami tessellations -- the square twist, the square grid, and the Miura-ori -- as well as for the single-vertex crease pattern. We also compare local to global flat-foldability and show that on the square grid, a random locally flat-foldable configuration is exponentially unlikely to be globally flat-foldable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of a class of dynamic co-evolving latent space networks. The model we study is subject to bi-directional feedback effects, meaning that at any given time, the latent process depends on its own value and the graph structure at the previous time step, and the graph structure at the current time depends on the value of the latent processes at the current time but also on the graph structure at the previous time instance (sometimes called a persistence effect). We construct the mean-field limit of this model, which we use to characterize the limiting behavior of a random sample taken from the latent space network in the limit as the number of nodes in the network diverges. From this limiting model, we can derive the limiting behavior of the empirical measure of the latent process and establish the related graphon limit of the latent particle network process. We also provide a description of the rich conditional probabilistic structure of the limiting model. The inherent dependence structure complicates the mathematical analysis significantly. In the process of proving our main results, we derive a general conditional propagation of chaos result, which is of independent interest. In addition, our novel approach of studying the limiting behavior of random samples proves to be a very useful methodology for fully grasping the asymptotic behavior of co-evolving particle systems. Numerical results are included to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On determinantal point processes with nonsymmetric kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03360v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determinantal point processes (DPPs for short) are a class of repulsive point processes. They have found some statistical applications to model spatial point pattern datasets with repulsion between close points. In the case of DPPs on finite sets, they are defined by a matrix called the DPP kernel which is usually assumed to be symmetric. While there are a few known examples of DPPs with nonsymmetric kernels, not much is known on how this affects their usual properties. In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt the results on $P_0$ matrices to the DPP setting in order to get necessary and sufficient conditions for the well-definedness of DPPs with nonsymmetric kernels. We also generalize various common results on DPPs. We then show how to use these results to construct attractive couplings of regular DPPs with symmetric kernels in order to model spatial marked point patterns with repulsion between points of the same mark and attraction between points of different marks.</description>

      <title>Student-t processes as infinite-width limits of posterior Bayesian neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic properties of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have been extensively studied, particularly regarding their approximations by Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit. We extend these results by showing that posterior BNNs can be approximated by Student-t processes, which offer greater flexibility in modeling uncertainty. Specifically, we show that, if the parameters of a BNN follow a Gaussian prior distribution, and the variance of both the last hidden layer and the Gaussian likelihood function follows an Inverse-Gamma prior distribution, then the resulting posterior BNN converges to a Student-t process in the infinite-width limit. Our proof leverages the Wasserstein metric to establish control over the convergence rate of the Student-t process approximation.</description>

      <title>Statistical guarantees for continuous-time policy evaluation: blessing of ellipticity and new tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the estimation of the value function for continuous-time Markov diffusion processes using a single, discretely observed ergodic trajectory. Our work provides non-asymptotic statistical guarantees for the least-squares temporal-difference (LSTD) method, with performance measured in the first-order Sobolev norm. Specifically, the estimator attains an $O(1 / \sqrt{T})$ convergence rate when using a trajectory of length $T$; notably, this rate is achieved as long as $T$ scales nearly linearly with both the mixing time of the diffusion and the number of basis functions employed.
  A key insight of our approach is that the ellipticity inherent in the diffusion process ensures robust performance even as the effective horizon diverges to infinity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Markovian component of the statistical error can be controlled by the approximation error, while the martingale component grows at a slower rate relative to the number of basis functions. By carefully balancing these two sources of error, our analysis reveals novel trade-offs between approximation and statistical errors.</description>

      <title>The Uniformly Rotated Mondrian Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First proposed by Rahimi and Recht, random features are used to decrease the computational cost of kernel machines in large-scale problems. The Mondrian kernel is one such example of a fast random feature approximation of the Laplace kernel, generated by a computationally efficient hierarchical random partition of the input space known as the Mondrian process. In this work, we study a variation of this random feature map by using uniformly randomly rotated Mondrian processes to approximate a kernel that is invariant under rotations. We obtain a closed-form expression for this isotropic kernel, as well as a uniform convergence rate of the uniformly rotated Mondrian kernel to this limit. To this end, we utilize techniques from the theory of stationary random tessellations in stochastic geometry and prove a new result on the geometry of the typical cell of the superposition of uniformly random rotations of Mondrian tessellations. Finally, we test the empirical performance of this random feature map on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its improved performance over the Mondrian kernel on a debiased dataset.</description>

Abstract: For the Abelian sandpile model on Sierpinski graphs, we investigate several statistics such as average height, height probabilities and looping constant. In particular, we calculate the expected average height of a recurrent sandpile on the finite iterations of the Sierpinski gasket and we also give an algorithmic approach for calculating the height probabilities of recurrent sandpiles under stationarity by using the connection between recurrent configurations of the Abelian sandpile Markov chain and uniform spanning trees. We also calculate the expected fraction of vertices of height $i$ for $i\in\{0,1,2,3\}$ of sandpiles under stationarity and relate the bulk average height to the looping constant on the Sierpinski gasket.</description>

      <title>On the Forgetting of Particle Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the forgetting properties of the particle filter when its state - the collection of particles - is regarded as a Markov chain. Under a strong mixing assumption on the particle filter's underlying Feynman-Kac model, we find that the particle filter is exponentially mixing, and forgets its initial state in $O(\log N )$ 'time', where $N$ is the number of particles and time refers to the number of particle filter algorithm steps, each comprising a selection (or resampling) and mutation (or prediction) operation. We present an example which shows that this rate is optimal. In contrast to our result, available results to-date are extremely conservative, suggesting $O(\alpha^N)$ time steps are needed, for some $\alpha&gt;1$, for the particle filter to forget its initialisation. We also study the conditional particle filter (CPF) and extend our forgetting result to this context. We establish a similar conclusion, namely, CPF is exponentially mixing and forgets its initial state in $O(\log N )$ time. To support this analysis, we establish new time-uniform $L^p$ error estimates for CPF, which can be of independent interest. We also establish new propagation of chaos type results using our proof techniques, discuss implications to couplings of particle filters and an application to processing out-of-sequence measurements.</description>

Abstract: We study the periodic Lorentz gas in the Boltzmann-Grad limit, whose convergence was rigorously established in the seminal work of Marklof-Str\"ombergsson. Extending the two dimensional results of Boca-Zaharescu to higher dimensions, we present a more detailed description of this convergence. More precisely, we derive the asymptotic formula of the distribution function of the free path length; and we explicitly compute the constant in the asymptotic formula for the Kolmogorov-Sinai (K-S) entropy of the billiard map.</description>

Abstract: We construct a transport map from Poisson point processes onto ultra-log-concave measures over the natural numbers, and show that this map is a contraction. Our approach overcomes the known obstacles to transferring functional inequalities using transport maps in discrete settings, and allows us to deduce a number of functional inequalities for ultra-log-concave measures. In particular, we provide the currently best known constant in modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for ultra-log-concave measures.</description>

      <title>A Kesten Stigum theorem for Galton-Watson processes with infinitely many types in a random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09629v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a Galton-Watson process $(Z_n)$ with infinitely many types in a random ergodic environment $\bar{\xi}=(\xi_n)_{n\geq 0}$. We focus on the supercritical regime of the process, where the quenched average of the size of the population grows exponentially fast to infinity. We work under Doeblin-type assumptions coming from a previous paper, which ensure that the quenched mean semi group of $(Z_n)$ satisfies some ergodicity property and admits a $\bar{\xi}$-measurable family of space-time harmonic functions. We use these properties to derive an associated nonnegative martingale $(W_n)$. Under a $L\log(L)^{1+\varepsilon}$-integrabilty assumption on the offspring distribution, we prove that the almost sure limit $W$ of the martingale $(W_n)$ is not degenerate. Assuming some uniform $L^2$-integrability of the offspring distribution, we prove that conditionally on $\{W&gt;0\}$, at a large time $n$, both the size of the population and the distribution of types correspond to those of the quenched mean of the population $\mathbb{E}[Z_n|\bar{\xi}, Z_0]$.
  We finally introduce an example of a process modelling a population with a discrete age structure. In this context, we provide more tractable criterions which guarantee our various assumptions are met.</description>

      <title>Hypocoercivity meets lifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unify the variational hypocoercivity framework established by D. Albritton, S. Armstrong, J.-C. Mourrat, and M. Novack, with the notion of second-order lifts of reversible diffusion processes, recently introduced by A. Eberle and F. L\"orler. We give an abstract, yet fully constructive, presentation of the theory, so that it can be applied to a large class of linear kinetic equations. As this hypocoercivity technique does not twist the reference norm, we can recover accurate and sharp convergence rates in various models. Among those, adaptive Langevin dynamics (ALD) is discussed in full detail and we show that for near-quadratic potentials, with suitable choices of parameters, it is a near-optimal second-order lift of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. As a further consequence, we observe that the Generalised Langevin Equation (GLE) is a also a second-order lift, as the standard (kinetic) Langevin dynamics are, of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. Then, convergence of (GLE) cannot exceed ballistic speed, i.e. the square root of the rate of the overdamped regime. We illustrate this phenomenon with explicit computations in a benchmark Gaussian case.</description>

Abstract: Consider an $ N \times N$ Hermitian one-dimensional random band matrix with band width $W &gt; N^{1 / 2 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0$. In the bulk of the spectrum and in the large $ N $ limit, we obtain the following results: (i) The semicircle law holds up to the scale $ N^{-1 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (ii) All $ L^2 $- normalized eigenvectors are delocalized, meaning their $ L^\infty$ norms are simultaneously bounded by $ N^{-\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon} $ with overwhelming probability, for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (iii) Quantum unique ergodicity holds in the sense that the local $ L^2 $ mass of eigenvectors becomes equidistributed with high probability. (iv) Universality of eigenvalue statistics, i.e., the local eigenvalue statistics of these band matrices are given by those of Gaussian unitary ensembles.</description>

Abstract: In this note we derive the exact probability that a specific state in a two-state Markov chain is visited exactly $k$ times after $N$ transitions. We provide a closed-form solution for $\mathbb{P}(N_l = k \mid N)$, considering initial state probabilities and transition dynamics. The solution corrects and extends prior incomplete results, offering a rigorous framework for enumerating state transitions. Numerical simulations validate the derived expressions, demonstrating their applicability in stochastic modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known for some time that the Nakamoto consensus as implemented in the Bitcoin protocol is not totally aligned with the individual interests of the participants. More precisely, it has been shown that block withholding mining strategies can exploit the difficulty adjustment algorithm of the protocol and obtain an unfair advantage. However, we show that a modification of the difficulty adjustment formula taking into account orphan blocks makes honest mining the only optimal strategy. Surprinsingly, this is still true when orphan blocks are rewarded with an amount smaller to the official block reward. This gives an incentive to signal orphan blocks. The results are independent of the connectivity of the attacker.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Transformer Derivative Estimates for Explicit Pathwise Learning Guarantees</title>

Abstract: An inherent challenge in computing fully-explicit generalization bounds for transformers involves obtaining covering number estimates for the given transformer class $T$. Crude estimates rely on a uniform upper bound on the local-Lipschitz constants of transformers in $T$, and finer estimates require an analysis of their higher-order partial derivatives. Unfortunately, these precise higher-order derivative estimates for (realistic) transformer models are not currently available in the literature as they are combinatorially delicate due to the intricate compositional structure of transformer blocks.
  This paper fills this gap by precisely estimating all the higher-order derivatives of all orders for the transformer model. We consider realistic transformers with multiple (non-linearized) attention heads per block and layer normalization. We obtain fully-explicit estimates of all constants in terms of the number of attention heads, the depth and width of each transformer block, and the number of normalization layers. Further, we explicitly analyze the impact of various standard activation function choices (e.g. SWISH and GeLU). As an application, we obtain explicit pathwise generalization bounds for transformers on a single trajectory of an exponentially-ergodic Markov process valid at a fixed future time horizon. We conclude that real-world transformers can learn from $N$ (non-i.i.d.) samples of a single Markov process's trajectory at a rate of ${O}(\operatorname{polylog}(N)/\sqrt{N})$.</description>

      <title>Functional worst risk minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00412</link>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend worst risk minimization, also called worst average loss minimization, to the functional realm. This means finding a functional regression representation that will be robust to future distribution shifts on the basis of data from two environments. In the classical non-functional realm, structural equations are based on a transfer matrix $B$. In section~\ref{sec:sfr}, we generalize this to consider a linear operator $\mathcal{T}$ on square integrable processes that plays the the part of $B$. By requiring that $(I-\mathcal{T})^{-1}$ is bounded -- as opposed to $\mathcal{T}$ -- this will allow for a large class of unbounded operators to be considered. Section~\ref{sec:worstrisk} considers two separate cases that both lead to the same worst-risk decomposition. Remarkably, this decomposition has the same structure as in the non-functional case. We consider any operator $\mathcal{T}$ that makes $(I-\mathcal{T})^{-1}$ bounded and define the future shift set in terms of the covariance functions of the shifts. In section~\ref{sec:minimizer}, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a minimizer to this worst risk in the space of square integrable kernels. Previously, such minimizers were expressed in terms of the unknown eigenfunctions of the target and covariate integral operators (see for instance \cite{HeMullerWang} and \cite{YaoAOS}). This means that in order to estimate the minimizer, one must first estimate these unknown eigenfunctions. In contrast, the solution provided here will be expressed in any arbitrary ON-basis. This completely removes any necessity of estimating eigenfunctions. This pays dividends in section~\ref{sec:estimation}, where we provide a family of estimators, that are consistent with a large sample bound. Proofs of all the results are provided in the appendix.</description>
