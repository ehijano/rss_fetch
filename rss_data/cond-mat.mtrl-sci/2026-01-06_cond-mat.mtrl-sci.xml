      <title>Physically-Constrained Autoencoder-Assisted Bayesian Optimization for Refinement of High-Dimensional Defect-Sensitive Single Crystalline Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical properties and functionalities of materials are dictated by global crystal structures as well as local defects. To establish a structure-property relationship, not only the crystallographic symmetry but also quantitative knowledge about defects are required. Here we present a hybrid Machine Learning framework that integrates a physically-constrained variational-autoencoder (pcVAE) with different Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods to systematically accelerate and improve crystal structure refinement with resolution of defects. We chose the pyrochlore structured Ho2Ti2O7 as a model system and employed the GSAS2 package for benchmarking crystallographic parameters from Rietveld refinement. However, the function space of these material systems is highly nonlinear, which limits optimizers like traditional Rietveld refinement, into trapping at local minima. Also, these naive methods don't provide an extensive learning about the overall function space, which is essential for large space, large time consuming explorations to identify various potential regions of interest. Thus, we present the approach of exploring the high Dimensional structure parameters of defect sensitive systems via pretrained pcVAE assisted BO and Sparse Axis Aligned BO. The pcVAE projects high-Dimensional diffraction data consisting of thousands of independently measured diffraction orders into a lowD latent space while enforcing scaling invariance and physical relevance. Then via BO methods, we aim to minimize the L2 norm based chisq errors in the real and latent spaces separately between experimental and simulated diffraction patterns, thereby steering the refinement towards potential optimum crystal structure parameters. We investigated and compared the results among different pcVAE assisted BO, non pcVAE assisted BO, and Rietveld refinement.</description>

      <title>A Chemically Grounded Evaluation Framework for Generative Models in Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for accelerating materials discovery, but their evaluation often overlooks the chemical validity and stability requirements crucial to real-world applications. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations are the gold standard for evaluating such properties but are computationally intensive and inaccessible to non-experts. We propose a chemically grounded, user-friendly evaluation framework that integrates DFT-based stability analysis with commonly used machine learning (ML) metrics. Through systematic experiments using both perturbative and generative methods, we demonstrate that conventional ML metrics can misrepresent chemical feasibility. To address this, we propose new insights on robust metrics and highlight the importance of simulation-informed evaluation for developing reliable generative models in materials science.</description>

      <title>Photogalvanic currents from first-principles real-time density-matrix dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photogalvanic effect is the generation of a second-order direct current by illumination of a non-centrosymmetric material. In this work, we develop a fully first-principles quantum kinetic theory based on density matrix formalism to calculate the photogalvanic current in all time regimes: transient and steady. Unlike past \textit{ab-initio} studies which focused only on the photo-excitation process, our first-principles theory framework encodes all quantum scatterings (intra/interband relaxation and electron-hole recombination) mediated by bosons (photons and phonons), and is thus predictive of photogalvanic currents in realistic materials. In particular, for the linear photogalvanic effect, we find electron scatterings mediated by phonons contribute significantly to the shift current for prototypical piezoelectrics like BaTiO$_3$. This explains the theoretical underestimation of the experimental photogalvanic current in previous \textit{ab-initio} work. For the circular photogalvanic effect, we present the first self-consistent theory of a steady injection current that incorporates realistic scattering mediated by phonons. New formulas for the photogalvanic currents are presented which elucidate their connection with fundamental quantum-geometric quantities such as the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. A phonon-based explanation is proposed for the bipolar transient photogalvanic current observed by the THz emission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Landscape of grain boundary migration in polycrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) migration is a pivotal process that significantly impacts the development of microstructures, thereby influencing the practical performance of polycrystalline materials. Recent advances in 3D experimental techniques have revealed conflicts between observed GB migration behaviors and classical theoretical models. These contradictions raise two fundamental questions, namely, whether GB migration is linearly related to curvature, and how GB energy affect GB migration? Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of GB migration dynamics in polycrystals and resolve these conflicts within a theoretical framework. Unexpectedly, in a polycrystalline system, the range of GB migration velocities shows little correlation with the magnitude of its curvature. The extent of the influence of GB energy on GB migration is revealed to mostly depend on GB step energy. Finally, a more general GB migration formula is derived to incorporate various driving forces beyond curvature.</description>

      <title>Efficient magnetization switching driven by orbital torque originating from light 3d-transition-metal nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect (OHE) in light transition metals offers a promising route to generate orbital torques for efficient magnetization control, providing an alternative to conventional spin Hall effect approaches that rely on heavy metals. We demonstrate perpendicular magnetization switching in [Co/Pt]3 multilayers driven by the OHE in a light 3d transition metal nitride, VN, with 111-texture of face-center cubic structure. Second harmonic Hall measurement reveals a large torque efficiency of -0.41 in the VN(7.5 nm)/[Co(0.35nm)/Pt(0.3 nm)]3, which significantly surpasses that in the control samples with Co, Py, and CoFeB ferromagnets, suggesting strong conversion of orbital current originating from VN to spin current by [Co/Pt]3 ferromagnet. Full switching by in-plane current is achieved with an in-plane magnetic field, while partial field-free switching occurs without it. The critical current density for the switching is found to be comparable to that of the W-based spin-orbit torque device. First-principles calculations confirm a large orbital Hall conductivity in VN, with a small spin Hall conductivity around the Fermi energy. Our results highlight the potential in the combination of light 3d transition metal nitrides and Co/Pt ferromagnetic multilayer with 111-texture to maximize the magnetization switching efficiency of orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Automatic calculation of symmetry-adapted tensors under spin-group symmetry. STENSOR, a new tool of the Bilbao Crystallographic Server</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present STENSOR, a new computational tool integrated into the Bilbao Crystallographic Server, designed for the automatic calculation of symmetry-adapted tensors under spin group symmetry. The program requires either a file containing the structural data of the magnetic compound or the generators of the oriented spin point group, together with the so-called generalized Jahn symbol associated to the tensor of interest. The user can propose any arbitrary tensor type or select a particular one from a predefined list. The program output returns the symmetry-adapted tensor under the spin point group and also under the magnetic point group, which is also calculated. The comparison of these two tensor forms allows to distinguish the coefficients that are due to spin-orbit coupling effects from those that have a non-relativistic origin and thus are usually more important. A couple of examples are given to illustrate the operation of the program.</description>

      <title>Structural, Bonding, and Optical Properties of B$_{18}$Ca$_2$ Clusters: Double-Ring Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and electronic properties of the doubly calcium-doped boron cluster B$_{18}$Ca$_2$ have been systematically investigated using density functional theory calculations. Basin-hopping searches reveal that B$_{18}$Ca$_2$ adopts a double-ring geometry as its global minimum, consisting of two fused B$_9$ rings symmetrically stabilized by calcium atoms located above and below the boron framework. Vibrational frequency calculations verify the dynamical stability of the low-lying structures, while infrared and UV-Vis spectra highlight strong Ca--B coupling and pronounced electronic delocalization within the boron scaffold. Atomic dipole-corrected Hirshfeld charge analysis indicates substantial charge transfer from Ca to the electron-deficient boron framework, with the donated electrons uniformly delocalized over the B$_{18}$ skeleton. Real-space bonding analyses based on the electron localization function (ELF), Interaction Region Indicator (IRI), and the Laplacian of the electron density reveal an extended multicenter bonding network characterized by global $\sigma$-delocalization and Ca-induced polarization effects rather than localized two-center Ca--B bonds. Together, these results establish B$_{18}$Ca$_2$ as a prototypical boron toroidal cluster and provide fundamental insights into the role of alkaline-earth doping in stabilizing complex boron nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Calorimetric Measurement of the Surface Energy of Enstatite, MgSiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface thermodynamics of minerals influence their properties and occurrence in both terrestrial and planetary systems. Using high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry, we report the first direct measurement of the surface energy of enstatite, MgSiO$_3$. Enstatite nanoparticles of different sizes were synthesized using the sol-gel method, characterized with X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, surface area measurements, and electron microscopy. The materials consist of crystallites with sizes of $\sim $10 - 20 nm, which are agglomerated into larger nanoparticles. Thus, both surface and interface terms contribute to the measured enthalpies. Analysis based on calorimetry and calculated surface and interface areas gives the surface enthalpy of enstatite as 4.79 $\pm$ 0.45 J m$^{-2}$. This value is comparable to that of forsterite (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and larger than those of many nonsilicate oxide materials. This large surface energy may present a barrier to the nucleation of enstatite in planetary atmospheres and other geochemical and planetary environments. The interfacial energy of enstatite appears to be close to zero. The transition enthalpy from bulk orthoenstatite to bulk clinoenstatite is 0.34 $\pm$ 0.93 kJ mol$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with earlier reports. The methodology developed here can be extended to other materials having complex structures and morphologies to separate surface and interfacial contributions to energetics.</description>

      <title>Predicting Coherent B2 Stability in Ru-Containing Refractory Alloys Through Thermodynamic Elastic Design Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium-based B2 intermetallics are promising for refractory superalloys but are limited by the trade-off between high thermodynamic stability and elastic precipitation strain. We present a physics-guided machine learning framework integrating high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT), Random Forest screening, and Symbolic Regression to navigate this design space. This approach resolves the paradox where stoichiometric compounds like RuHf fail to achieve theoretical solvus temperatures. By deriving a closed-form physical law, we quantify the strain penalty: a 1% lattice misfit reduces the solvus temperature by approximately 200 degrees C. This finding confirms that maximizing thermodynamic driving force alone is insufficient. We demonstrate that multi-component alloying is structurally necessary, identifying ternary additions such as Al and Ti as essential lattice-tuning agents that zero out the elastic penalty. This framework establishes a rigorous, constraint-based protocol for alloy design, enabling the precise engineering of zero-misfit, high-stability microstructures.</description>

      <title>Molecular simulation of methane hydrate growth confined into a silica pore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of a methane hydrate seed within a silica slit pore of fixed width has been studied using AllAtom Molecular Dynamics (AA-MD). An AA force field has been used to describe the molecules of the solid silica substrate, with a-quartz crystalline structure. The crystallisation of hydrates in confined geometries is not well understood yet, and the objective of this work is to study the hydrate growth inside a silica pore using molecular simulation. Both NVT and NpT ensembles were used in the AA-MD simulations to analyse the hydrate growth from an initial seed. Results showed that the boundary conditions imposed by the nanometric slit pore yielded a hydrate with structural defects, filling the accessible space between the silica walls. The water molecules which were not incorporated to the initial seed hydrate formed a high density water layer trapped between the silica walls and the crystallised hydrate. These results provide an interesting insight into the hydrate crystallisation process in confined geometries, resembling those found in natural hydrate deposits.</description>

      <title>Recent Progress in Ultrafast Dynamics of Transition-Metal Compounds Studied by Time-Resolved X-ray Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism have long served as indispensable tools for probing the electronic and magnetic properties of transition-metal compounds with elemental selectivity. In recent years, the emergence of femtosecond lasers has opened a new avenue for studying nonequilibrium dynamics in condensed matter. However, conventional optical techniques lack elemental and orbital specificity, making it difficult to disentangle the coupled charge, spin, and lattice responses in complex materials. The development of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL) and laboratory high-harmonic generation (HHG) sources has enabled the extension of X-ray absorption and scattering techniques into the femtosecond time domain. Time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and resonant soft X-ray scattering now provide direct, complementary access to element- and momentum-resolved ultrafast dynamics. This review summarizes recent progress in these techniques, focusing on pump-probe measurements of laser-induced demagnetization, spin-state transitions, and valence and structural changes in transition-metal compounds. We also discuss advances in tabletop HHG-based X-ray spectroscopy and its integration with large-scale XFEL facilities. These developments provide powerful routes for visualizing the nonequilibrium evolution of charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom, offering new insights into the ultrafast control of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Phonon-informed Crystal Structure Classification via Precision-Adaptive ResNet-based Confidence Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate description of crystal structures is a prerequisite for predicting the physicochemical properties of materials. However, conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization often encounters intrinsic bottlenecks when applied to complex multiphase systems, necessitating the integration of complementary optical measurement. In this study, we developed a multi-descriptor framework by integrating key parameters including space groups, Pearson symbols, and Wyckoff sequences, to categorize the dataset of over 19,000 crystals into several dozen structural prototypes. Then, an accuracy-adaptive ensemble network based on residual architectures was implemented to capture structural ``fingerprints" within phonon vibration modes and Raman spectra. The ensemble algorithm demonstrates exceptional robustness when processing various crystals of varying lengths and quality. This data-driven classification strategy not only overcomes the reliance of traditional characterization on ideal data but also provides a high-throughput tool for the automated analysis of material structures in large-scale experimental workflows.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous growth of perfectly circular domains of MoS2 monolayers using chemical vapour deposition technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very large-scale integration of devices in a circular pattern has several advantages over the commonly used rectangular grid layout. For the development of such integrated circuits on a 2D semiconductor platform, spontaneous growth of the material in the form of circular islands is desirable. Here, we report the natural formation of 1L-MoS2 circular islands of diameter as large as a few hundreds of micrometer on SiO2/Si substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique without the use of any seeding layer. The size of the circles is found to increase with the amount of sulphur used during growth. The study reveals that these circular islands are formed with a less-defective interior and a more-defective outer part that is dominated by a large density of grain boundaries and twists. Due to the lower defect density, the interior region yields much higher photoluminescence than the peripheral part. Field effect transistors (FETs) are fabricated on inner and outer portions of a circle to estimate the mobility and concentration of the background carriers in the two regions. The study shows that the maximum mobility is more than double in the interior than the outer part. While the carrier concentration remains practically unchanged in the two regions. The natural tendency to minimize the strain energy resulting from the mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficients of the monolayer and the substrate as well as the edge energy that originates from the boundary tension are thought to be the driving forces behind the formation of these circular domains.</description>

      <title>Sol-Gel-Derived NiO/ZnO Thin Films with Single and Heterostructure Layers for Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NiO/ZnO-based thin films, including single-layer and heterostructure configurations, were synthesized to investigate the influence of stacking order on their electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications. To improve the relatively low capacitive performance of ZnO compared to NiO, NaCl was introduced as a dopant. All films were deposited using a non-vacuum spin-coating method on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, chosen for their excellent electrical conductivity and stability as electrode materials. The surface morphology and structural parameters were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Optical properties were analyzed via UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealing direct band gaps in the range of 3.17-3.31 eV for ZnO and Na-ZnO, and wider gaps up to 3.81 eV for NiO. Electrochemical performance was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a three-electrode configuration with 1 M KOH as the electrolyte. Among the electrodes, the single-layer NiO film exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 1.391 Fg^{-1}. In contrast, the NiO/ZnO heterostructure demonstrated a synergistic effect, resulting in enhanced charge storage and achieving a maximum specific capacitance of 1.627 Fg^{-1} at a current density of 2.0 mA cm^{-2}. Furthermore, sodium doping significantly improved the capacitance of ZnO. Overall, the results highlight the potential of sol-gel-derived oxide heterostructures and doped thin films as cost-effective and scalable electrode materials for supercapacitors in portable electronics and energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Electrical Regulation of Transverse Spin Currents in Unconventional Magnetic Ferroeletrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify hexagonal YMnO$_3$ as a material realization of the elusive $\beta$-phase of unconventional magnetism, a noncollinear, noncoplanar antiferromagnetic state defined by intrinsic spin-momentum locking and a topological spin texture. First-principle calculations reveal that this unique electronic structure enables a perpendicular electric field to generate a transverse pure spin current, a response that occurs without requiring relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Symmetry analysis demonstrates that this spin current is intimately related to the material's ferroelectric polarization that breaks the inversion symmetry and is rigorously forbidden at domain walls where electrical polarization vanishes. This provides a blueprint for a non-volatile transistor where a gate voltage switches the spin current conductivity by controlling domain wall density, enabling all-electrical control for energy-efficient antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Structures Database from Symmetry-aided High-Throughput Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic structures encode the underlying symmetries of magnetic materials and play a central role in determining their physical properties. However, reliable magnetic structures are known for only limited compounds. Traditional methods based on first-principles calculations are fundamentally limited by the need to calculate a large space of input magnetic configurations. Here we introduce a symmetry-aided strategy based on Landau's phase transition theory. By utilizing the crystallographic space group and the Wyckoff positions of magnetic ions, we narrow down the initial magnetic configurations to a limited number of candidates via the analysis of irreducible representations. The magnetic ground state is subsequently determined by the lowest energy of those well-seleted magnetic configurations via first-principles calculations. Benchmarking calculations are performed on a subset of the MAGNDATA database with q=0 and fewer than 40 atoms per unit cell, comprising 260 materials. Our method correctly identifies the magnetic structure for 207 of these materials, corresponding to an accuracy of 80%. We further apply our highly efficient method to the compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), and establish a database containing 2,800 magnetic materials. As a demonstration of its utility, we apply our magnetic structure database to the systematic identification of 1,070 magnetic topological phases and 389 altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Charge Hopping Dynamics along a Disordered Chain in Quantum Environments: Comparative Study of Different Rate Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a computational study of charge hopping dynamics along a one dimensional chain with Gaussian site energy disorder and linearly coupled quantum bath. Time dependent square displacements are calculated directly from numerical solutions of Pauli master equations, for five different rate kernels: exact Fermi golden rule (FGR) rate expression, stationary phase interpolation (SPI) approximation, semiclassical (SC) approximation, classical Marcus rate expression, and Miller-Abrahams expression. All results demonstrate diffusive behavior in the steady state limit. The results based on the FGR rate expression show that the charge transport in quantum bath can be much more sensitive to the disorder than the prediction from the classical Marcus expression. While the SPI approximation captures this general trend reasonably well, the SC approximation tends to be unreliable at both quantitative and qualitative levels, and becomes even worse than the classical Marcus expression under certain conditions. These results offer useful guidance in the choice of approximate rate kernels for larger scale simulations, and also demonstrate significant but fragile positive effects of quantum environments on the charge hopping dynamics.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic lattice dynamics study of phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal indium iodides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium iodides, which adopt layered or molecular-crystal-like arrangements depending on composition, are expected to exhibit low lattice thermal conductivity because of their heavy constituent atoms and weak In-I bonding. In this work, we employed first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations to systematically investigate phonon transport in indium iodides from particle- and wave-like perspectives. The calculated lattice thermal conductivities of both materials remained below 1 W/m-K over a broad temperature range. Notably, the influence of wave-like phonon transport differed by composition: in InI3, the wave-like contribution became comparable to the particle-like Peierls contribution, whereas it remained negligible in InI. We also investigated the thermal transport properties of the experimentally reported high-pressure phase of InI3. Motivated by experimental indications of stacking faults and partial disorder in indium site occupancy within the rhombohedral phase, we constructed several ordered structural models with different stacking sequences. These stacking sequences exhibited no significant energetic preference and had similar lattice thermal conductivities, suggesting that in-plane thermal transport is largely governed by the vibrational properties of the In2I6 layers themselves rather than by the specific stacking sequence. These findings provide insight into phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal systems with structural complexity and contribute to a broader understanding of thermal transport mechanisms in layered and molecular-crystal-like materials.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals CrSBr alloys with tunable magnetic and optical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals magnets are attracting a lot of attention for their potential integration in spintronic and magnonic technologies. CrSBr is an A-type antiferromagnet that shows a coupling between its electronic band structure and magnetic properties. This property is appealing for applications and it also offers the possibility to investigate magnetic ground states and GHz magnons using visible optics techniques. Using Raman scattering and (magneto)-optical experiments, we describe the magnetic and optical properties of alloys of CrSBr$_{(1-x)}$Cl$_x$ with $x&lt;0.46$. Similar to CrSBr, these alloys are direct band gap semiconductors with a coupling of their electronic and magnetic properties. Exciton energies evolve weakly with composition and we describe the large changes in the saturation magnetic fields and their implications on the magnetic properties. We show that both the interlayer magnetic exchange and electronic interactions are modified by the halogen mixing, offering the possibility to tune magnon energies with alloy composition.</description>

      <title>Score-based diffusion models for accurate crystal-structure inpainting and reconstruction of hydrogen positions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI models, such as score-based diffusion models, have recently advanced the field of computational materials science by enabling the generation of new materials with desired properties. In addition, these models could also be leveraged to reconstruct crystal structures for which partial information is available. One relevant example is the reliable determination of atomic positions occupied by hydrogen atoms in hydrogen-containing crystalline materials. While crucial to the analysis and prediction of many materials properties, the identification of hydrogen positions can however be difficult and expensive, as it is challenging in X-ray scattering experiments and often requires dedicated neutron scattering measurements. As a consequence, inorganic crystallographic databases frequently report lattice structures where hydrogen atoms have been either omitted or inserted with heuristics or by chemical intuition. Here, we combine diffusion models from the field of materials science with techniques originally developed in computer vision for image inpainting. We present how this knowledge transfer across domains enables a much faster and more accurate completion of host structures, compared to unconditioned diffusion models or previous approaches solely based on DFT. Overall, our approach exceeds a success rate of 97% in terms of finding a structural match or predicting a more stable configuration than the initial reference, when starting both from structures that were already relaxed with DFT, or directly from the experimentally determined host structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray crystallography rarely captures chemical bonding between atoms of a structure in question. Most of the time distance-based heuristics are applied to establish the pairs of bonded atoms. One class of such heuristics depends on a set of bonding radii that estimate the idealised size of each chemical element in a bond. This publication describes an unsupervised workflow for deriving a bonding radii set from crystal structure data in the Crystallography Open Database.</description>

      <title>Charge disproportionation as a possible mechanism towards polar antiferromagnetic metal in molecular orbital crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar antiferromagnetic metals have recently garnered increasing interests due to their combined traits of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, the inherently incompatible nature of antiferromagnet, metallicity and polarity pose a significant challenge. We propose that charge disproportionation can lead to this novel state in negative charge transfer gap regime in molecular orbital crystal by molecular orbital analyses of first-principles DFT+$U$ electronic band structure for representative Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer perovskite oxides Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, corroborated by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculation. Due to the negative charge transfer nature of Co$^{4+}$ and imposed by strong interlayer coupling, localized molecular orbitals stemming from the hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals through the apical oxygen $p$ orbitals are preferably emergent within each bilayer unit, which develop antiferromagnetic ordering by invoking Hubbard repulsion. Charge disproportionation driven by Hund's physics, makes an occupation imbalance with broken inversion symmetry in the remaining $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals from distinct Co atoms within the bilayer unit, resulting in the polar metallicity. Meanwhile, this charge disproportionation scenario allows consequent conducting carriers to couple with interlayer local spins via Hund's coupling, giving rise to in-plane double-exchange ferromagnetism. Our molecular orbital formulation further provides a guide towards an effective Hamiltonian for modelling the unconventional synergy of metallicity, polarity and antiferromagnetism in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, which may be a unified framework widely applicable to double-layer Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced non-thermal lattice disorder in aluminium thin-film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast dynamics of photo-induced non-thermal lattice disorder in a polycrystalline aluminium thin film to elucidate transient short- and long-range lattice distortions, their thermalization and electron-phonon coupling timescales. Using a high-repetition-rate 95-keV ultrafast electron diffraction setup (UED), we measured the transient dynamics for the differential scattering signal in a momentum transfer, $q$, range longer than in conventional keV UED setups. Analysis of ten Bragg and six diffuse scattering revealed a prompt increase in the mean-square displacement (MSD), indicating rapid energy transfer from the excited electronic system to the lattice. The subsequent relaxation dynamics of the elastic scattering intensities exhibit a pronounced dependence on diffraction order. Lower-order reflections relax more rapidly, whereas higher-order reflections show significantly slower relaxation or near-plateau behaviour, indicating that lattice equilibration proceeds on multiple $q$-dependent timescales. Exponential fits to the MSD dynamics reveal oscillatory residuals, indicative of coherent non-thermal lattice motion. Power spectral density analysis of these residuals uncovers coherent lattice oscillations with a fundamental frequency of $\omega_0 = 0.192$ THz, corresponding to the acoustic breathing (A$_{1g}$) mode of aluminium. Higher frequency components are also observed, consistent with coherent phonon oscillations originating from a single zero-wavevector mode populated by multiple coherent phonons. While individual phonon branches are not directly resolved, the observed dependence on the lattice plane of the relaxation behaviour and oscillatory signatures are consistent with a mode-selective lattice response and non-thermal energy redistribution as described by non-thermal lattice models.</description>

      <title>FIR transmission and resistively detected cyclotron resonances in InSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an experimental setup to simultaneously acquire magneto-transmission spectra and measure the photoconductive response. The low-temperature ($T$=4.2 K) magneto-transmission data for weakly doped InSb in the frequency range 3-15 THz and magnetic fields up to 25 T, shows that the AC conductivity is governed by the classical Drude response. Moreover, the resulting light-induced voltage in this system, consisting of thermoelectric and resistive contributions, both contain features that are related to cyclotron resonances. The frequency dependence of this resonance is in good agreement with $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ perturbation theory and corresponds to transitions between the first and second Landau level with spin-up electrons. The obtained effective mass $m^{*}(B=0)=0.014m_{e}$, is in line with the value extracted from magneto-transmission experiments. Additionally, we can observe evidence of a fluence-dependent metal-insulator transition in the thermoelectric signal, which suggest that the electronic system becomes less sensitive to the light at higher frequencies.</description>

      <title>Predictive Design of Defect States in Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Telecommunication-Band Quantum Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect-based single-photon emitters (SPEs) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising platforms for integrated quantum photonics; however, the absence of identified emitters operating at telecom wavelengths remains a critical limitation for fiber-based quantum communication. Here, we investigate previously unexplored carbon- and silicon-based point defects in monolayer h-BN as SPE candidates using hybrid density functional theory, constrained excited-state relaxations, and a generating-function approach to photoluminescence. We compute zero-phonon-line (ZPL) energies, radiative lifetimes, Huang-Rhys (HR) factors, and photoluminescence lineshapes to screen optical performance. All defects are thermodynamically stable with negative formation energies, and five candidates exhibit moderate electron-phonon coupling (HR &lt; 5), indicating narrow emission linewidths. These emitters span a broad spectral range from the visible to the telecom regime, including near-infrared C-based centers and, most notably, the Si2BVN defect, which is identified as the first point defect in monolayer h-BN predicted to support single-photon emission in the telecom C band (1554 nm). Vacancy-containing complexes possess spin-1/2 ground states, enabling spin-photon interfaces compatible with integrated photonic and cavity-based platforms. The combined analysis of ZPL energies, electron-phonon coupling, and radiative lifetimes provides concrete targets for experimental realization of spin-active single-photon emitters in h-BN from the visible to telecom wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Competing phases and domain structures of ferroelectric perovskites: the benefit of epitaxial (110) growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain and domain engineering offer powerful routes to control phase and domain stability in ferroelectric thin films. While most studies have focused on (100)-oriented growth, the impact of lower-symmetry orientations remains underexplored. We address this gap in knowledge with first-principles based molecular dynamics simulation for the example of prototypical ferroelectric perovskites under (110) strain. Epitaxial (110) strains may indeed outperform the widely studied (100) orientation, as even modest strain values stabilize a diverse set of metastable nanoscale states with potential high functional tunability. In this regime, the films exhibit multidomain configurations with domain wall normal oriented along the clamped in-plane or the relaxed out-of-plane directions and heterophases in BaTiO$_3$ and KNbO$_3$. Besides, complex superdomain patterns and antiferroelectric-like domains are observed in PbTiO$_3$. These metastable nanoscale configurations may allow for large reversible responses.</description>

      <title>Dynamic stress response kernels for dislocations and cracks: unified anisotropic Lagrangian formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastodynamic cohesive-zone models for defects such as cracks or dislocations (such as the Geubelle-Rice model for cracks, or the Dynamic Peierls Equation for flat-core dislocations), feature the same stress-response convolution kernel in space and time. It accounts for in-plane elastic wave propagation, while its associated instantaneous radiative term accounts for radiative losses in the surrounding medium. These objects are well-known for isotropic elasticity, with their space-time representations involving generalized functions. For anisotropic elasticity they were unknown. The paper presents a derivation using the Stroh formalism. Their Fourier representation rests exclusively on the so-called prelogarithmic Lagrangian factor $L(v)$, while their space-time form involves its derivative $p(v)=L'(v)$, the prelogarithmic impulsion function. A straightforward consequence is the reformulation of the stress in the Weertman model of steadily-moving dislocations in terms of $L(v)$. Special care being paid to the causality constraint, the theory covers indifferently subsonic, intersonic and supersonic regimes of motion. The theory proposed is suitable to phase-field-type Fourier-based numerical codes for planar systems of defects in anisotropic elastodynamics.</description>

      <title>Investigating the impact of copper-PEDOT:PSS matrix towards non-enzymatic electrochemical creatinine detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical creatinine sensors offer great promise towards rapid, reagent-free and point-of-care (POC) kidney-function monitoring. However, challenges related to analyte binding, data reproducibility, sensitivity, fouling and device degradation deter its widespread implementation. Here, we show how a carbon electrode modified with a combination of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) can rapidly and accurately detect creatinine (CT) in artificial urine media employing electrochemical techniques. Applying redox potential sweeps (vs Ag/AgCl) using copper sulfate (CuSO4) solution on such sensor facilitates the CuNP embedding process inside the conjugated polymer matrix which has been further validated by supporting techniques. We predicted and validated the formation and contribution of two Cu-CT coordination complexes corresponding to Cu(I) and Cu(II) states, which are responsible for CT detection. The fabricated CT sensor exhibits high selectivity against major artificial urine interferents and is stable for a month showing minimal degradation (0.53%) in peak current value. Such sensors can be utilized to detect and monitor different stages of renal failure in real-time patient samples.</description>

      <title>Morphology dependent decomposition and pore evolution during oxidation of Cr$_2$AlC coatings revealed by correlative tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative 3D characterization of materials degradation in oxidizing environments remains limited. Here, we apply a correlative tomography-based mass balance framework to Cr$_2$AlC, a coating candidate for accident tolerant nuclear fuel claddings and turbine blades, and show that decomposition and pore evolution during oxidation, quantified by integrating volumetric, structural and compositional data, are strongly governed by grain morphology. The oxidation of sputtered Cr$_2$AlC coatings with equiaxed and columnar grain morphologies was analyzed. While Cr$_7$C$_3$ formed in both coating morphologies, pores formed exclusively in columnar coatings. The expected Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume was estimated by mass-balance calculations assuming that Al-deintercalation enables oxide scale and Al-O-C-N precipitate formation, leading to complete transformation of the Al-deintercalated Cr$_2$AlC into Cr$_7$C$_3$. In equiaxed coatings, the predicted carbide volume agreed with tomography within 3 $\pm$ 3 %, confirming Al-deintercalation-driven Cr$_7$C$_3$ formation. Despite the smaller molar volume of Cr$_7$C$_3$ relative to Cr$_2$AlC, absence of pores imply that transformation shrinkage is likely accommodated by coating thickness reduction. In columnar coatings, the predicted Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume exceeds the measured value by 22 $\pm$ 4 %, and the pore volume expected from transformation shrinkage alone is 13-16 % lower than measured, indicating partial Al deintercalation and clustering of pre-existing defects. This combined methodology provides a general route to quantitatively resolve degradation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Predictive Model for Shock Response of Energetic Materials Using Conditional U-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping microstructure to properties is central to materials science. Perhaps most famously, the Hall-Petch relationship relates average grain size to strength. More challenging has been deriving relationships for properties that depend on subtle microstructural features and not average properties. One such example is the initiation of energetic materials under dynamical loading, dominated by energy localization on microstructural features such as pores, cracks, and interfaces. We propose a conditional convolutional neural network to predict the shock-induced temperature field as a function of shock strength, for a wide range of microstructures, and obtained via two different simulation methods. The proposed model, denoted MISTnet2, significantly extends prior work that was limited to a single shock strength, model, and type of microstructure. MISTnet2 can contribute to bridging atomistics with coarse-grain simulations and enable first principles predictions of detonation initiation and safety of this class of materials.</description>

      <title>Transverse Photoresistivity from Photothermal Current Deflection in Metal Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry in centrosymmetric systems has motivated the search for photocurrent responses beyond second order. In particular, electric field-induced nonlinear responses may also enable intrinsic polarization-sensitive optical detectors. Despite numerous efforts, clear methods are still needed to remove experimental artifacts, separating intrinsic from extrinsic effects, and disentangling linear responses from their higher-order counterparts. Here, we provide a systematic study of fabrication and measurement techniques to remove external artifacts in photoelectronic responses. This reveals a previously hidden photothermoelectric response in the transverse photoresistivity of symmetric thin films of simple metals. We identify its origin in thermal gradients producing current deflection and determine the device design and measurement parameters to minimize extrinsic effects that arise in photoinduced electronic responses.</description>

      <title>New RVE concept and FFT methods in micromechanics of composites subjected to body force with compact support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider static linear elastic composite materials (CMs) with periodic structure. The core of the proposed methodology is the generation of a novel dataset using specially designed body force fields with compact support (BFCS), enabling a new RVE concept that reduces the infinite periodic medium to a finite domain without boundary artifacts. This functionally reduced RVE is used for translated averaging of direct numerical simulations (DNS) results, efficiently computed via a newly developed FFT-based solver for BFCS loading. The resulting dataset captures localized field responses and is used to train machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN) models to learn effective nonlocal surrogate operators. These operators accurately predict macroscopic responses while reflecting microstructural features and nonlocal interactions. By accounting for field localization while simultaneously eliminating influences from finite sample size and boundary effects, it provides a physically grounded and data-driven framework for constructing accurate surrogate models for the homogenization of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Autonomous battery research: Principles of heuristic operando experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unravelling the complex processes governing battery degradation is critical to the energy transition, yet the efficacy of operando characterisation is severely constrained by a lack of Reliability, Representativeness, and Reproducibility (the 3Rs). Current methods rely on bespoke hardware and passive, pre-programmed methodologies that are ill-equipped to capture stochastic failure events. Here, using the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's multi-modal toolkit as a case study, we expose the systemic inability of conventional experiments to capture transient phenomena like dendrite initiation. To address this, we propose Heuristic Operando experiments: a framework where an AI pilot leverages physics-based digital twins to actively steer the beamline to predict and deterministically capture these rare events. Distinct from uncertainty-driven active learning, this proactive search anticipates failure precursors, redefining experimental efficiency via an entropy-based metric that prioritises scientific insight per photon, neutron, or muon. By focusing measurements only on mechanistically decisive moments, this framework simultaneously mitigates beam damage and drastically reduces data redundancy. When integrated with FAIR data principles, this approach serves as a blueprint for the trusted autonomous battery laboratories of the future.</description>

      <title>The hidden sustainability bottleneck in high-entropy alloy design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of the enormous number of possible compositions, comparable to the number of stars in the universe, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) constitute a virtually inexhaustible materials space with highly versatile properties. Among these systems, HEAs are often proposed as potential substitutes for critical elements such as rare earths or platinum group metals. However, random or incremental exploration strategies are neither practical nor efficient at this scale. Targeted materials selection guided by sustainability considerations is therefore essential, yet identifying sustainable HEA compositions remains highly challenging. Here, we perform a comprehensive sustainability assessment of 30,201 equimolar HEA compositions and identify a resilient shortlist (approximately 5\%) that consistently exhibits favorable sustainability profiles across multiple evaluation schemes. Our analysis integrates complementary criteria including carbon footprint, environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, production compatibility, and resource availability. The resulting sustainability-based ranking provides a strategic roadmap for HEA research, enabling experimental efforts to be focused on compositions that are not only functionally promising but also scalable and resource-responsible. By aligning materials discovery with sustainability and supply constraints, this framework supports more efficient use of experimental resources while contributing to long-term industrial sustainability goals.</description>

      <title>Terahertz magneto-photocurrents in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ probe its topological surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ultrafast magneto-photocurrents in a three-dimensional topological insulator. For this purpose, we excite (In$_r$Bi$_{1-r}$)$_2$Se$_3$ thin films with a femtosecond laser pulse in the presence of an external magnetic field $B_{\text{ext}}$ up to 0.3 T parallel to the film plane. The resulting in-plane photocurrent is measured by detecting the emitted terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulse. It scales linearly with $B_{\text{ext}}$ and is perpendicular to $B_{\text{ext}}$. Strikingly, for $r\ge$4%, we observe an abrupt photocurrent reduction, which is strongly correlated with the Indium-induced quenching of the topological surface states. The rise time, decay time and amplitude of the THz magneto-photocurrent can consistently be explained by a scenario in which optically excited spin-polarized electrons propagate toward the film surface where the accumulated spin is converted into an in-plane charge current due to spin-velocity locking. Our results are highly relevant for contact-free probing of spin-charge conversion in systems with paramagnetic rather than spontaneous magnetic order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular magnets, although analogous to familiar macroscopic magnets, offer a platform for next generation magnetic storage technologies with far higher data densities and prospective applications in quantum information science. When exposed to an external magnetic field, single molecule magnets enter a frustrated magnetic configuration that is exceptionally sensitive to low energy excitations. Energy deposited by a dark matter particle can trigger the relaxation of a metastable molecule, releasing Zeeman energy that subsequently propagates through neighboring molecules. This magnetic avalanche encodes the energy deposited in the initial excitation. By combining concepts from chemistry, condensed matter physics, and particle physics, we show that dysprosium and manganese molecules can achieve more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity to dark photon and QCD axion models, respectively, compared with existing detection methods.</description>

      <title>Family of High-Chern-Number Orbital Magnets in Twisted Rhombohedral Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing Chern insulators with Chern numbers greater than one remains a major goal in quantum materials research. Such platforms promise multichannel dissipationless chiral transport and access to correlated phases beyond the conventional C = 1 paradigm. Here, we discover a family of high-Chern-number orbital magnets in twisted monolayer-multilayer rhombohedral graphene, denoted (1+n) with n = 3, 4, and 5. Magnetotransport measurements show pronounced anomalous Hall effects at one and three electrons per moir\'e unit cell when they are polarized away from the moir\'e interface. Across the (1+n) systems, we observe a clear topological hierarchy C = n, revealed by the St\v{r}eda trajectories and the quantized Hall resistance. Our experimental observations are supported by self-consistent mean-field calculations. Moreover, we realize both electrical and magnetic switching of the high-Chern-number states by flipping the valley polarization. Together, these results establish a tunable hierarchy of orbital Chern magnets in twisted rhombohedral graphene, offering systematic control of Chern number and topology through layer engineering in pristine graphene moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Strain-triggered high-temperature superconducting transition in two-dimensional carbon allotrope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driving non-superconducting materials into a superconducting state through specific modulation is a key focus in the field of superconductivity. Pressure is a powerful method that can switch a three-dimensional (3D) material between non-superconducting and superconducting states. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, strain engineering plays a similar role to pressure. However, purely strain-induced superconductivity in 2D systems remains exceedingly scarce. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting. Surprisingly, the electron-phonon coupling in strained THO-graphene is enhanced strong enough to pair electrons and realize superconductivity, with the highest superconducting transition temperature reaching 45 K. This work not only provides a notable example of controlling metal-superconductor transition in 2D system just via strain, but also sets a new record of superconducting transition temperature for 2D elemental superconductors.</description>

      <title>Dilatancy-induced surface deformation in dense cohesive granular media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When granular materials with interstitial liquid bridges are sheared in a split-bottom cell, a localized shear band develops, accompanied by a surface elevation. Cohesion, governed by the surface tension of the interstitial liquid, enhances dilatancy in dense cohesive packings, leading to expansion within the shear band and the emergence of a surface elevation. Surface deformation is observed not only in cohesive systems with high particle density and large liquid surface tension, but also in those with lower values of these parameters. The equivalent Bond number arises as a key control parameter for the surface deformation, shaping both the evolution of the surface profile and the packing density. At higher shear rates, inertial effects dominate dilatancy, resulting in less pronounced surface deformation.</description>

      <title>AutoPot: Automated and massively parallelized construction of Machine-Learning Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning potentials (MLIPs) have been a breakthrough for computational physics in bringing the accuracy of quantum mechanics to atomistic modeling. To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.
  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols.</description>

      <title>Analog Weight Update Rule in Ferroelectric Hafnia, using pico-Joule Programming Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an effort to compete with the brain's efficiency at processing information, neuromorphic hardware combines artificial synapses and neurons using mixed-signal circuits and emerging memories. In ferroelectric resistive weights, the strength of the synaptic connection between two neurons is stored in the device conductance. During learning, programming pulses are applied to the synaptic weight, which reconfigures the ferroelectric domains and adjusts the conductance. One strategy to lower the energy cost during the training phase is to lower the duration of the programming pulses. However, the latter cannot be shorter than the self-loading time of the resistive weights, limited by intrinsic parasitics in the circuits. In this work, ferroelectric resistive weights are fabricated using a process compatible with CMOS Back-End-Of-Line integration, based on hafnia/zirconia nanolaminates. By laterally scaling the device area under 100 $\mu$m$^2$, the self-loading time becomes sufficiently short to enable 20 ns programming, which corresponds to a maximum of 3 picoJoules per pulse. Further, in this work, the weight update rule with 20 ns pulses is experimentally measured not only for different amplitudes but also for different initial conductance states. We find that the final weight is determined by the pulse amplitude, independent of the initial weight value.</description>

Abstract: We report on a high-fidelity digital quantum simulation of Wigner localisation in a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) electron system using a 6-qubit segment of the state-of-the-art \textbf{IBM\,Heron\,2} quantum processor. By mapping the Coulomb interaction Hamiltonian onto a 6-qubit ring lattice, we reconstruct the ground-state energy landscape for a 2-electron Wigner dimer across fifteen interaction regimes in the range $U \in [5, 75]$. This study serves as a rigorous \textbf{benchmarking} exercise, translating foundational experimental models originally developed for electrons on liquid helium into the domain of modern quantum computing. Leveraging the enhanced gate fidelity and tunable coupler architecture of the Heron 2, we demonstrate that the digital simulation accurately captures the energy minimisation trends associated with Wigner dimer formation, achieving a relative error below 7\% in the strong-interaction limit. Our results provide a crucial \textbf{proof-of-principle} validation for using superconducting quantum hardware to probe strongly correlated phases of matter with high precision, establishing a baseline for future simulations beyond the classical limit.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Ohm's Law by Disorders in Low-Dimensional Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ohm's law provides a fundamental framework for understanding charge transport in conductors and underpins the concept of electrical scaling that has enabled the continuous advancement of modern CMOS technologies. As transistors are scaled to even smaller dimensions, device channels inevitably enter low-dimensional regimes to achieve higher performance. Low-dimensional materials such as atomically thin oxide semiconductors, 2D van der Waals semiconductors, and 1D carbon nanotubes, have thus emerged as key candidates for extending Moore's law. Here, we reveal the fundamental distinction between three-dimensional and low-dimensional conductors arising from disorder-induced electron localization, which leads to the breakdown of Ohm's law and lateral linear scaling. We develop a quantitative model that captures the role of the disordered region, a unique characteristic intrinsically to low-dimensional transistors. Furthermore, the disorder-induced localization framework consistently explains experimental observations in atomically thin In2O3 field-effect transistors across variations in channel length, temperature, thickness, and post-annealing conditions. This work establishes a unified physical picture for understanding and optimizing disorder-driven electronic transport in low-dimensional transistors.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Thermodynamic, Elastic, and Optical properties of LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) low Tc Superconductors through First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) compounds crystallize in a tetragonal layered ThCr2Si2-type structure and belong to a family of low critical temperature superconductors. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations implemented in the CASTEP code, we systematically investigated their structural, mechanical, elastic, electronic, vibrational, thermophysical, and optical properties for the first time. The optimized structural parameters show good agreement with available experimental data. The Born stability criteria and negative formation energies confirm the mechanical and thermodynamic stability of these materials. Poisson and Pugh ratios indicate a ductile nature, while low Debye and melting temperatures together with low Vickers hardness suggest that the compounds are relatively soft. The electronic band structures and density of states reveal metallic behavior. Charge density distribution and Mulliken population analysis indicate mixed covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding. The calculated Fermi surfaces contain both hole-like and electron-like sheets, suggesting possible multiband characteristics. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms the dynamical stability of LaRh2Al2 and LaRh2Ga2, while LaRh2In2 shows dynamical instability associated with a possible structural phase transition. Optical property analysis indicates that these superconductors may be promising candidates for high-density optical data storage applications. The estimated electron-phonon coupling constant of about 0.56 indicates that LaRh2X2 compounds are weakly coupled low critical temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Alignment-Dependent Gapless Chiral Split Magnons in Altermagnetic Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, an emerging class of magnetic materials, exhibit exotic chiral split magnons that are of great interest for both fundamental physics and spintronic applications. However, detecting and manipulating these magnons is challenging due to their THz frequency response. Here, we report the discovery of gapless chiral split magnons confined within altermagnetic domain walls. Unlike in conventional ferromagnets or antiferromagnets, their spectrum is highly sensitive to the domain wall orientation relative to the crystal axis. These magnons inherit the chiral splitting of their bulk counterparts and are detectable in the microwave regime, offering a distinctive signature for identifying altermagnets. We further show that the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction drives hybridization of magnons with opposite chiralities, enabling unidirectional strong magnon-magnon coupling. Moreover, we demonstrate that spin-orbit torque can control the domain wall orientation, providing a practical means to manipulate these chiral magnons. Our findings open pathways for novel magnonic nanocircuitry based on altermagnetic domain walls.</description>

      <title>Common sublattice-pure van Hove singularities in the kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials offer a versatile platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, where van Hove singularities (VHSs) play a pivotal role in driving electronic instabilities, exhibiting distinct behaviors depending on electron filling and interaction settings. In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.</description>

      <title>Generating unconventional spin-orbit torques with patterned phase gradients in tungsten thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key aim in spintronics is to achieve current-induced magnetization switching via spin-orbit torques without external magnetic fields. For this, the focus of recent work has been on introducing controlled lateral gradients across ferromagnet/heavy-metal devices, giving variations in thickness, composition, or interface quality. However, the small gradients achievable with common growth techniques limit both the impact of this approach and understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. Here, spin-orbit torques are patterned on a mesoscopic length scale in tungsten thin films using direct-write laser annealing. Through transmission electron microscopy, resistivity, and second harmonic measurements, the continuous transformation of the crystalline phase of W films from the highly spin-orbit coupled, high resistivity $\beta$ phase to the minimally spin-orbit coupled, low resistivity $\alpha$ phase is tracked with increasing laser fluence. Gradients with different steepness are patterned in the tungsten phase to create spin-orbit torque channels and, when interfaced with CoFeB, tungsten wires with a sufficiently strong gradient can switch the magnetization without an applied magnetic field. Therefore, exploiting the unique microstructure of mixed-phase W allows precise control of the local electronic current density and direction, as well as local spin-orbit torque efficiency, providing a new avenue for the design of efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Band-Edge Carrier Trapping Limits Light Emission in WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit bright photoluminescence, a desirable property for light-emitting diodes and single-photon emitters. Because the emission intensity is heavily influenced by factors such as defect density and oxidation, it is critical to understand how they affect photoluminescence efficiency. However, due to the time-consuming process of identifying individual monolayers, studies of high-quality exfoliated TMDs have been limited to only a few samples. Here, we present an investigation of excited-state lifetimes and spectra for over 200 WSe$_2$ exfoliated monolayers at room temperature. We find a linear correlation between photoluminescence lifetime and intensity across hundreds of monolayers and within individual monolayers. Results from intentional photooxidation experiments indicate that this correlation is due to photoinduced band-edge carrier traps, which introduce a nonradiative decay pathway that competes with exciton emission. Our work highlights the importance of controlling such traps, as they are the primary limitation of bright photoluminescence.</description>

      <title>Probing the dynamics and configurations of single molecule junctions via Seebeck coefficient spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single molecule junctions exhibit dynamic structural configurations that strongly influence their electronic and thermoelectric properties. Here, we combine conductance (G) and Seebeck coefficient (S) measurements using the novel AC based scanning tunnelling microscope break junction technique to probe the real-time evolution of oligo(phenylene ethynylene) molecular junctions. We show that most junctions undergo configuration changes that lead to notable changes in S while G remains nearly constant. Density functional theory and quantum transport simulations link these observations to variations in contact geometry and charge transfer at the molecule electrode interface. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous G and S measurements enable direct access to the dynamic reconfiguration of single molecule junctions and offer design insights for thermoelectric molecular devices and new routes for increasing single molecule junction stability.</description>

      <title>Emergent Anomalous Hall Effect in the Eu-Based Compound with a Diamond Network: The Centrosymmetric Cubic Antiferromagnet EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The centrosymmetric cubic compound EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$, in which magnetic Eu ions form a diamond network, undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at T$_N$ = 3.3 K and exhibits metamagnetic transitions at H$_{m1}$ = 1.7 T and H$_{m2}$ = 2.8 T for H || [100] at 1.9 K. Between these fields, the magnetization shows a step-like behavior, defining an intermediate field-induced phase (Phase~II). We investigated the electronic transport in Phase~II and found that both the resistivity and Hall resistivity are markedly enhanced, while remaining nearly field independent within the phase. Phase~II appears for all field directions, although its transport response shows moderate directional dependence. These features differ from the strongly orientation-selective behavior often observed in skyrmion-lattice phases of several 4f-electron compounds, suggesting that Phase II may host a field-induced spin texture with a topological character distinct from that of a conventional skyrmion lattice.</description>

      <title>Multiple nodal superconducting phases and order-parameter evolution in pressurized UTe$_2$</title>

Abstract: Spin-triplet superconductivity (SC) offers a unique avenue for realizing non-Abelian Majorana zero modes and thus the fault-tolerant topological quantum computation, and has attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\langle \Delta_{z}\rangle/\langle\Delta_{x(y)}\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Photocarrier Mean Free Path via Speckled Laser Pump -- Transient Fourier Microscopy Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean free path of photocarriers is a crucial parameter for material design, device optimization, and new optoelectronics applications. Currently, this parameter remains unknown for many materials, and experimental means available for its measurement are considerably lacking. Meanwhile, it remains an unclear issue whether the mean free path of the photogenerated high-energy hot carriers is significantly different from that of the localequilibrium-state carriers near the Fermi surface or around the band edge. Based on the concept of transient grating Fourier transform and utilizing a virtual lock-in amplification technique, we proposed and demonstrated an efficient experimental technique for measuring the mean free path of photocarriers. This method has facilitated direct observation of the photocarrier transport behavior across the transition between diffusive and ballistic motion, from which we surprisingly find that the mean free path of photogenerated hot carriers in Silicon membrane and GaAs quantum well can reach micron scale, more than an order of magnitude larger compared to the electrically-measured one. This work provides new ideas for characterization of photoelectronic devices under operating status and is expected to greatly enhance the understanding of the photocarrier transport process in opto-electronic or photonic materials.</description>

      <title>Emergent Spin Supersolids in Frustrated Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the emergence of spin supersolids in frustrated quantum magnets, establishing a material-based platform for supersolidity beyond its original context in solid helium. A spin supersolid is characterized by the coexistence of longitudinal spin order that breaks lattice translational symmetry and transverse spin order associated with the spontaneous breaking of a spin U(1) symmetry. Extensive experimental investigations, together with advanced numerical studies, have now revealed a coherent and internally consistent picture of these phases, substantially deepening our understanding of supersolidity in quantum magnetic materials. Beyond their fundamental interest as exotic quantum states, potential applications in highly efficient demagnetization cooling have been supported by a giant magnetocaloric effect observed in candidate materials. Moreover, the possible dissipationless spin supercurrents could open promising perspectives for spin transport and spintronic applications. In this Review, we summarize recent progress on emergent spin supersolids in frustrated triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnets. We survey experimental evidence from thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements and compare these results with theoretical studies of minimal models addressing global phase diagrams, ground state properties, and collective excitations. In addition, we discuss characteristic spin-transport phenomena and outline future directions for exploring spin supersolids as functional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Photonic Interactions with Semiconducting Barrier Discharges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting Barrier Discharges (SeBDs) generate uniform ionization waves in air at atmospheric pressure. In this work, we investigate how externally applied irradiation synchronized with the discharge can mimic photoconductive-type coupling between the plasma and the semiconductor surface. By illuminating the Si-SiO$_2$ interface with nanosecond pulsed irradiation at wavelengths from 532 nm to 1064 nm, and using fast imaging, optical emission spectroscopy, and current-voltage measurements, we demonstrate that the photoexcitation of charge carriers in silicon enhances the plasma emission and increases the reduced electric field, with no detectable change in the electrical energy. The magnitude and thresholds of these responses depend on wavelength. By comparing the SeBD to a MOS photodetector, this behaviour can be explained by the absorption length. This length determines whether carriers are photogenerated inside the depletion region at the SiO$_2$-Si interface, where they are efficiently separated and undergo impact-ionization amplification, or deeper in the silicon bulk where carrier separation is weaker and free-carrier absorption diminishes the quantum efficiency. These results focus on the microscopic processes governing the plasma-semiconductor coupling and demonstrate how the optoelectronic properties of silicon can influence surface ionization waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted a theoretical analysis of specific C36 and O@C36 Fullerene isomers, namely those with (D3h, C1, Cs, C2, D2) symmetries, in the gaseous phase using the DFT method at B3LYP/6-31G* level. We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h &lt; C36-C1 &lt; C36-Cs &lt; C36-C2 &lt; C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Study of Dispersion-Corrected Electronic and Optical Properties of syn- and anti- B18H22 Clusters with/without Sulfur Doping for Tunable Optoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed quantum chemical investigation of the electronic and excited-state properties of syn- and anti-isomers of the borane cluster B18H22 and their sulfur-doped derivatives.
  Using the PB86/def2-SVP level of theory with dispersion corrections, the research examines how sulfur substitution and non-covalent interactions influence cluster stability, electronic structure, spectra, and optoelectronic potential. Comparative analysis of the syn- and anti-isomers reveals the impact of molecular conformation on frontier molecular orbitals and related energetic and photophysical properties. Sulfur doping is shown to enhance charge delocalization, stabilize excited states, and improve thermal stability, which form key factors for tunable laser applications.
  The inclusion of advanced dispersion correction methods proves essential for accurately capturing many-body interactions that govern electronic behavior. By elucidating the interplay between structural features, substitution patterns, and computational modeling, the work provides valuable insights into structure-property relationships critical for designing borane-based materials with tailored optoelectronic and thermal characteristics. In addition to doping and dispersion effects, functionals' effects were examined through comparison amidst various ones with different asymptotic exchange on excitation and gap energies. In summary, the computational methodology combined good DFT/Basis/dispersion set to accurately predict geometries, IR/UV spectra, NMR chemical shifts, dipole moments, polarizability and excited-state properties, thereby offering a comprehensive theoretical understanding of syn-, anti- isomers of B18H22 and its sulfur doped variants.</description>

      <title>Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing a combination of dynamical mean field theory and density functional theory (DMFT/DFT), it has been theoretically proposed that PuB$_6$ is a strongly correlated topological insulator characterized by nontrivial $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ topological invariants and metallic surface states (\textit{X. Deng et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 176404 (2013)}). Here, we demonstrate through low-temperature magneto-transport measurements and first-principles calculations that PuB$6$ exhibits characteristics of a topological Kondo insulating state. These features include a transition in electrical resistivity from high-temperature, thermally activated behavior with a narrow gap at the Fermi level ($\Delta{\rho} \sim$ 20 meV) to a distinctive low-temperature plateau, as well as a surface-to-volume dependence of electrical resistivity at low temperatures. The topological nature of PuB$_6$ is further supported by the theoretical calculations, which show that GGA+$U$ is capable of capturing electronic, topological, and lattice properties of PuB$_6$ with much lower computational cost than DMFT.</description>

Abstract: Interfaces between molecules and 2D materials exhibit energy-driven functionalities, wherein charge transfer directs molecular motion. Unlike equilibrium systems, where molecular assemblies settle into static configurations, continuous energy input can drive transient, collective molecular rearrangements. Here, we reveal ultrafast spectroscopic fingerprints of a collective rotational response of molecules on a 2D material following photoexcitation. Our results suggest that photoinduced charge transfer reshapes the interfacial energy potential, giving rise to macroscopic, unidirectional molecular rotation and the formation of a homochiral molecular arrangement. Using a multiplexed ultrafast photoemission spectroscopy approach, we simultaneously track, electronic states, atomic positions, and orbital wavefunctions with femtosecond and sub-{\aa}ngstr\"om resolution. Multimodal valence and core electron emission analysis disentangles the intertwined electronic-structural dynamics of the molecule and the 2D material, revealing the dynamic modulation of charge distribution and intermolecular forces that drive collective molecular motion. Our findings open a pathway for designing energy-driven molecular systems with tunable interfacial dynamics, with potential applications in chiral engineering and active matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon is fundamental to science and technology due to its diverse bonding configurations, structural versatility, and essential role in defining the mechanical, chemical, electronic, and quantum properties of materials. However, direct three-dimensional (3D) imaging of individual carbon atoms remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we use twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as a model system and demonstrate ptychographic atomic electron tomography (pAET) for determining the 3D atomic coordinates of individual carbon atoms with a precision of 0.11 angstrom. The resulting 3D atomic model uncovers chiral lattice distortions driven by van der Waals interactions that exhibit meron-like and skyrmion-like structural textures. These findings provide direct insight into the interplay between 3D chiral lattice deformation and electronic properties in moire-engineered carbon systems. Beyond TBG, pAET offers a versatile approach for 3D atomic-scale imaging of carbon-based and other light-element materials that are central to advances in physics, chemistry, materials science, and nanotechnology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, spin dependent electron transport in Fe/Mo$_x$Cr$_{1-x}$S$_2$/Fe magnetic tunnel junction is studied. Spin transport for different thicknesses (1, 3, 5, and 7 layers) of the spacer MoS2 and for two different surface orientations of the Fe electrode, the Fe(001) and Fe(111) surface and with substitutional doping of 3d transition metal Cr at Mo site in MoS2 is investigated. The electronic structure of the heterostructure shows the presence of metal-induced states in the semiconducting MoS2 at the Fe/MoS2/Fe interface. The I-V characteristics of the junctions for the monolayer and three layer MoS2 spacer show linear behaviour due to the metallic nature of the junction. The tunnelling nature of the junction is observed for the thicker junctions with five-layer and seven layer spacers. With the introduction of magnetic impurity Cr, the tunnelling magnetoresistance for 7-layer junction is reduced. The Cr-defect states are observed below the conduction band, and the Cr-doped devices are stable up to a bias of 0.5V. Spin-transport through close-packed Fe(111) surface as electrode show low GMR value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</description>

Abstract: Foundational machine learning interatomic potentials that can accurately and efficiently model a vast range of materials are critical for accelerating atomistic discovery. We introduce universal potentials based on the graph atomic cluster expansion (GRACE) framework, trained on several of the largest available materials datasets. Through comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that the GRACE models establish a new Pareto front for accuracy versus efficiency among foundational interatomic potentials. We further showcase their exceptional versatility by adapting them to specialized tasks and simpler architectures via fine-tuning and knowledge distillation, achieving high accuracy while preventing catastrophic forgetting. This work establishes GRACE as a robust and adaptable foundation for the next generation of atomistic modeling, enabling high-fidelity simulations across the periodic table.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of A Crystal Plasticity Flow Rule From Discrete Dislocation Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum-scale material deformation models, such as crystal plasticity, can significantly enhance their predictive accuracy by incorporating input from lower-scale (i.e., mesoscale) models. The procedure to generate and extract the relevant information is however typically complex and ad hoc, involving decision and intervention by domain experts, leading to long development times. In this study, we develop a principled approach for calibration of continuum-scale models using lower scale information by representing a crystal plasticity flow rule as a Gaussian process model. This representation allows for efficient parameter space exploration, guided by the uncertainty embedded in the model through a process known as Bayesian optimization. We demonstrate a semi-autonomous Bayesian optimization loop which instantiates discrete dislocation dynamics simulations whose initial conditions are automatically chosen to optimize the uncertainty of a model crystal plasticity flow rule. Our self-guided computational pipeline efficiently generated a dataset and corresponding model whose error, uncertainty, and physical feature sensitivities were validated with comparison to an independent dataset four times larger, demonstrating a valuable and efficient active learning implementation readily transferable to similar material systems.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Nonrelativistic Charge-Spin Conversion in X-Type Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials with spin splitting have attracted considerable attention for their symmetry-enabled anisotropic spin textures that sustain a zero net magnetization, thereby facilitating efficient spin-current generation. In this work, the highly efficient generation of nonrelativistic spin currents is demonstrated to be facilitated by the distinctive Fermi surface geometry of X-type collinear antiferromagnets. As a prototype conducting X-type antiferromagnet, the Fermi surface of $\beta-\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{PO}_5$ exhibits a distinct $d$-wave altermagnetic characteristic, which compresses into a nearly X-shaped configuration. This results in highly efficient spin currents, achieving a charge-spin conversion efficiency of up to 90%. Moreover, the spin current polarization is controlled by the orientation of the N\'eel vector. When the N\'eel vector tilts to the out-of-plane direction, an in-plane injected charge current can generate a special spin current component with both spin polarization and propagation along the out-of-plane direction, whose charge-spin conversion efficiency substantially exceeds that of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials. The highly efficient charge-spin conversion in X-type antiferromagnets provides a novel and highly effective spin source system for the development of low-power spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</description>

      <title>Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) Diagrams to rationalize the nucleation and quenchability of metastable $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ is a promising solid-state electrolyte with the highest ionic conductivity among its polymorphs. However, its formation presents a thermodynamic paradox: the $\alpha$-phase is the equilibrium phase at high temperature and transforms to the stable $\gamma$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ polymorph when cooled to room temperature; however, $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ can be synthesized and quenched in a metastable state via rapid heating at relatively low temperatures. The origin of this synthesizability and anomalous stability has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this paradox by establishing a comprehensive time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram, constructed from a computational temperature-size phase diagram and experimental high-time-resolution isothermal measurements. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that at the nanoscale, the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized by its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier across a wide temperature range. This size-dependent stabilization is directly visualized using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation. This work presents a generalizable framework that integrates thermodynamic and kinetic factors for understanding nucleation and phase transformation mechanisms, providing a rational strategy for the targeted synthesis of functional metastable materials.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Partially Coherent Nature of Transport in IGZO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin-film transistors based on amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) are promising candidates for enabling further DRAM scaling and 3D integration, which are critical for advanced computing. Despite extensive research, the charge transport mechanism in these disordered semiconductors remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate charge transport in the archetypical AOS material, indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), across a range of compositions and temperatures using thin-film transistors and Hall bar structures. Our results show that the electrons involved in transport exhibit partially spatial coherence and non-degenerate conduction. Under these conditions, transport is dominated by electron transfer across insulating gaps between locally coherent regions, rather than by degenerate percolative transport above a mobility edge, or by localized-state hopping, both of which are widely assumed in the literature. While fluctuation-induced tunnelling has previously been invoked to describe low-temperature transport in oxide transistors, we show that such behavior originates from partially coherent electronic states and develop a field-effect-aware fluctuation-induced tunnelling (FEAFIT) framework that explicitly accounts for gate modulation of the tunneling landscape. The FEAFIT model accurately predicts experimental data across all compositions, temperatures, and gate voltages, enabling extraction of fundamental transport parameters. These tunnelling parameters are then correlated with electron coherence dimensions and the degree of energetic disorder obtained from first-principles calculations. Our findings advance the fundamental understanding of charge transport in AOS-based transistors and provide a foundation for further performance improvements</description>

      <title>Melting curve of correlated iron at Earth's core conditions from machine-learned DFT+DMFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable constraints on iron's melting curve at Earth's inner-core boundary require accurate finite-temperature electronic correlations, yet DFT+DMFT calculations remain too costly for large-scale thermodynamic sampling. Here, we develop a machine-learning accelerator for charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT by training E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks to predict the local self-energy and Fermi level from atomic environments, providing an efficient warm start to the DMFT self-consistency loop. Using high-throughput data for Fe, FeO, and NiO, we obtain a 2-4 times reuduction in DMFT iterations. Leveraging this improvement, we generate correlated energies and forces for Fe at core pressures, train a neural-network interatomic potential, and determine the melting curve via two-phase coexistence simulations. We obtain a predicted melting temperature of 6225 K at 330 GPa.</description>

Abstract: CrX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I) have the same crystal structure and Hamiltonian but different ligand spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant $\lambda_X$, providing excellent material platform exploring for exotic two-dimensional (2D) spin orders. Their microscopic mechanism underlying 2D spin physics remain unestablished, along with experimental corroboration of Kitaev exchange interaction, central to realizing topological quantum spin liquids. Finding direct evidence for Kitaev interaction and determining its value has been an essential but formidable challenge in Kitaev physics. Here we report the direct Kitaev interaction signature in magnetic anisotropy measured by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We present measured values of Heisenberg $J$, Kitaev $K$, and off-diagonal symmetric $\Gamma$ exchange interactions in CrX$_3$ determined using FMR and exact diagonalization. $K$ and $\Gamma$ exhibit dominant dependencies on $\lambda_X$, indicating its central role in 2D magnetism. Our study provides a foundation for designing 2D magnetic materials exhibiting novel behaviors by tuning intrinsic material parameters such as SOC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the conditions for surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space subjected to large deformations and a magnetic field. After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios. Graphical results are provided throughout.</description>

      <title>Higher critical currents yet faster vortex creep in EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing coherent artificial pinning centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic properties of type-II superconductors depend on vortices -- magnetic flux lines whose motion introduces dissipation that can be mitigated by pinning from material defects. The material disorder landscape is tuned by the choice of materials growth technique and incorporation of impurities that serve as vortex pinning centers. For example, metal organic deposition (MOD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) produce high-quality superconducting films with uncorrelated versus correlated disorder, respectively. Here, we study vortex dynamics in PLD-grown EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing varying concentrations of BaHfO$_3$ inclusions and compare our results with those of MOD-grown (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films. Despite both systems exhibiting behavior consistent with strong pinning theory, which predicts the critical current density $J_c$ based on vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical inclusions, we find striking differences in the vortex dynamics owing to the correlated versus uncorrelated disorder. Specifically, we find that the EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films grown without inclusions exhibit surprisingly slow vortex creep, comparable to the slowest creep rates achieved in (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ films containing high concentrations of BaHfO$_3$. Whereas adding inclusions to (Y,Gd)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is effective in slowing creep, BaHfO$_3$ increases creep in EuBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ even while concomitantly improving $J_c$. Lastly, we find evidence of variable range hopping and that $J_c$ is maximized at the BaHfO$_3$ concentration that hosts creep of large vortex bundles or a Bose glass state.</description>

      <title>Probing the band structure of the strongly correlated antiferromagnet NiPS3 across its phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NiPS3 is an exfoliable van-der-Waals intralayer antiferromagnet with zigzag-type spin arrangement. It is distinct from other TMPS3 (TM: transition metal) materials by optical excitations into a strongly correlated state that is tied to the magnetic properties. However, the related, fundamental band structure across the antiferromagnetic phase transition has not been probed yet. Here, we use angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with {\mu}m resolution in combination with DFT+U calculations for that purpose. We identify a characteristic band shift across TN. It is attributed to bands of mixed Ni and S character related to the superexchange interaction of Ni 3t2g orbitals. Moreover, we find a structure above the valence band maximum with little angular dispersion that could not be reproduced by the calculations. The discrepancy suggests the influence of many-body interactions beyond the DFT+U approximations in striking contrast to the results on MnPS3 and FePS3, where these calculations were sufficient for an adequate description.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity Photonic Crystal Biosensors using Topological Light Trapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic crystals (PCs) with localized optical cavity modes arising from topological domain-wall line defects are simulated for optical biosensing by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. These consist of a square lattice of square silicon blocks with a significant photonic band gap (PBG). Optical transmission through the PBG at specific frequencies occurs by defect-mediated optical tunneling. Biofluid flows perpendicular to light propagation, through a channel containing the PC, defined by silica side-walls and an underlying silica substrate. Replacing the silicon blocks with thin silicon strips throughout the domain-wall region, analyte binding coincides with regions of maximal field intensity. As a result, the sensitivity is improved by almost 16 times higher than the previous designs. We analyze optical mode hybridization of two nearby domain walls and its close relation to the transmission-levels and correlations in frequency shifts of nearby optical resonances in response to analyte-bindings. We illustrate three high-sensitivity chips each with three domain-wall defects, all of which can distinguish three analyte-bindings and their combinations completely in a single spectroscopic measurement. In a photonic crystal, consisting of silicon squares embedded in a water background and a 5-micron lattice spacing, the biosensor sensitivity to a thin analyte binding layer is nearly 3000 nm/RIU, and to the overall background biofluid is over 8000 nm/RIU.</description>

Abstract: Spin currents can carry either spin angular momentum or its associated magnetic moment, which are no longer strictly proportional in multiband systems. Using a multiband $k \cdot p$ model, we compute the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity tensors of elemental Bi. The magnetic-moment tensor emerges about two orders of magnitude larger and far less anisotropic than the angular-momentum tensor, while quasiparticle damping activates otherwise longitudinal components. The magnetic-moment spin Hall angle exceeds unity, demonstrating that a clear distinction between the two currents is indispensable for multiband systems.</description>

      <title>Integrable Model of a Superconductor with non-Fermi liquid and Mott Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Coupled imbibition and evaporation of droplets deposited on a nanoporous layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquids in nanoscale hydrophilic pores generate capillary pressures so large that they could theoretically climb kilometers against gravity. However, droplets on thin nanoporous layers form imbibition fronts stopping at millimeters or less due to evaporation competing with capillary flow. Such droplet infiltration dynamics is of growing interest for studying confined fluids and for applications such as water harvesting, printing, chemical delivery, actuation, and sensing. Here, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the spontaneous imbibition and evaporation of sessile droplets into thin mesoporous layers, focusing on their dependence on imposed relative humidity (RH). Theoretically, we provide a unified analytical approach for the dynamics of the wetted annulus ("halo") around the droplet, accounting for arbitrary halo dimensions and confinement-induced thermodynamic shifts (Kelvin effect). Experimentally, we study water droplets on oxidized porous silicon layers (pore diameter 3-4 nm, thickness 5 $\mu$m), systematically investigating how halo and droplet dynamics depend on RH. We show that halo formation timescales diverge at a critical RH due to the Kelvin effect, as illustrated by comparing RH-dependent evaporation rates in the halo (confined liquid) and in the droplet (bulk liquid). Our analysis also reveals an apparent divergence of the imbibition coefficient, unexplained by standard capillary models, suggesting a key role for Kelvin-driven vapor transport along the porous surface. The complex couplings revealed by our study call for caution in interpreting halo dynamics data. Our results also highlight RH as a powerful control parameter for tuning droplet imbibition behavior and infiltration patterns.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Transfer Framework Unifies High-Velocity Impact and Failure Across Materials, Geometries, and Scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials that dissipate energy efficiently under high-speed impacts, from micrometeoroid strikes on spacecraft to ballistic penetration in protective systems, are essential for maintaining structural integrity in extreme environments. Yet, despite decades of study, predicting and comparing impact performance across materials, geometries, and length scales remains challenging because conventional projectile-impact models often rely on conservation-based or empirically partitioned descriptions that assume the projectile-target interaction is a closed system. Here, we relax this assumption and directly observe the momentum and energy transferred out of the projectile during impact. We find that the momentum transferred to the target consistently reaches its maximum at the ballistic-limit velocity, demonstrated through a coordinated suite of micro-projectile impact experiments spanning varied projectile diameters, target thicknesses, and impact velocities, and further supported by targeted macroscale tests. This behavior is reinforced across a broad range of independent studies encompassing metals, polymers, composites, sandwich panels, and reinforced concrete, with thicknesses ranging from nanometers to hundreds of millimeters and projectiles of spherical, blunt, ogive, and conical shape, under both normal and oblique impacts. Together, these observations reveal a consistent impact behavior across all available data: maximum momentum transfer occurs at the ballistic limit. Extending this bound into the energy absorption landscape addresses an entrenched misconception in the field by revealing that specific energy absorption inherently inflates the performance of thinner targets due to geometric normalization, rather than reflecting genuine material enhancement.</description>

Abstract: The process of preparing heterogeneous catalysts on porous supports includes a drying stage, in which the porous material, impregnated with an aqueous solution of the catalyst precursor, is dried, and the precursor is precipitated on the pore walls. The precipitate distribution throughout the support volume strongly influences the catalyst performance and durability within industrial reactors. This paper presents a mathematical model for simulating the precipitation distribution during the drying of a porous sphere. Examples of calculations are given demonstrating the influence of some parameters on the distribution by space and by pore size.17</description>

      <title>Ellipsometric Identification of Transition from Layered Metal-dielectric Film to Hyperbolic Metamaterial</title>

Abstract: Hyperbolic Metamaterials (HMMs) continue to be intriguing due to their applications in super resolution imaging and spontaneous emission control. One of the successful realizations of HMMs is a layered metal-dielectric film. Despite the extensive knowledge in thin film technology and the promises of HMM's applications, the scale up and practical utilization of HMMs have not yet occurred. A general design approach is needed to predict the transition of a layered structure into an HMM. In this work, effective medium approximation and transfer matrix method are combined to determine the transition and validated by spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on a predefined HMM structure made of silver and alumina. Four interdependent design parameters are explored: thicknesses of metal and dielectric layers, transition wavelength, and minimum number of periods required for a layered metal-dielectric film to display hyperbolic dispersion. The findings are presented as a practical engineering design chart, similar to a state diagram, that can be extended to other combinations of materials.</description>

      <title>Effects of thermal annealing and film thickness on the structural and optical properties of indium-tin-oxide thin films</title>

Abstract: Indium-tin oxide (ITO) is a crucial functional layer for the optoelectronic applications, such as non-volatile color display thin films based on the ITO/phase-change material (PCM)/ITO/reflective metal multilayer structures on a silicon substrate. In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, thermally induced crystallization may alter the optical properties of ITO layers as well. But the potential change in color of the ITO layers is not considered so far. In this work, we investigate the structural and optical properties of ITO thin film films via X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. After thermal annealing at 250 {\deg}C, the ITO thin films of 15-100 nm get crystallized with strong changes in refractive index n and extinction coefficient k in the visible light range. However, for the 5-nm ITO thin film, crystallization is only observed after thermal annealing at 350 {\deg}C and the change in color is limited upon phase transition. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 {\deg}C) and ITO film thickness (5-100 nm). Our work suggests that the intrinsic change in colors of ITO layers should also be considered for the PCM-based reconfigurable display application.</description>
