      <title>On the Potential of Large Language Models to Solve Semantics-Aware Process Mining Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be valuable tools for tackling process mining tasks. Existing studies report on their capability to support various data-driven process analyses and even, to some extent, that they are able to reason about how processes work. This reasoning ability suggests that there is potential for LLMs to tackle semantics-aware process mining tasks, which are tasks that rely on an understanding of the meaning of activities and their relationships. Examples of these include process discovery, where the meaning of activities can indicate their dependency, whereas in anomaly detection the meaning can be used to recognize process behavior that is abnormal. In this paper, we systematically explore the capabilities of LLMs for such tasks. Unlike prior work, which largely evaluates LLMs in their default state, we investigate their utility through both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Concretely, we define five process mining tasks requiring semantic understanding and provide extensive benchmarking datasets for evaluation. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with challenging process mining tasks when used out of the box or with minimal in-context examples, they achieve strong performance when fine-tuned for these tasks across a broad range of process types and industries.</description>

      <title>Birdie: Natural Language-Driven Table Discovery Using Differentiable Search Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language (NL)-driven table discovery identifies relevant tables from large table repositories based on NL queries. While current deep-learning-based methods using the traditional dense vector search pipeline, i.e., representation-index-search, achieve remarkable accuracy, they face several limitations that impede further performance improvements: (i) the errors accumulated during the table representation and indexing phases affect the subsequent search accuracy; and (ii) insufficient query-table interaction hinders effective semantic alignment, impeding accuracy improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Birdie, using a differentiable search index. It unifies the indexing and search into a single encoder-decoder language model, thus getting rid of error accumulations. Birdie first assigns each table a prefix-aware identifier and leverages a large language model-based query generator to create synthetic queries for each table. It then encodes the mapping between synthetic queries/tables and their corresponding table identifiers into the parameters of an encoder-decoder language model, enabling deep query-table interactions. During search, the trained model directly generates table identifiers for a given query. To accommodate the continual indexing of dynamic tables, we introduce an index update strategy via parameter isolation, which mitigates the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Birdie outperforms state-of-the-art dense methods by 16.8% in accuracy, and reduces forgetting by over 90% compared to other continual learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of Analysis of Transitive Relations using Query-Driven, Ground-and-Solve, and Fact-Driven Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logic rules allow analysis of complex relationships, especially including transitive relations, to be expressed easily and clearly. Rule systems allow queries using such rules to be done automatically. It is well known that rule systems using different inference methods can have very different efficiency on the same rules and queries. In fact, different variants of rules and queries expressing the same relationships can have more drastically different efficiency in the same rule system. Many other differences can also cause differences in efficiency. What exactly are the differences? Can we capture them exactly and predict efficiency precisely? What are the best systems to use?
  This paper analyzes together the efficiency of all three types of well-known inference methods -- query-driven, ground-and-solve, and fact-driven -- with optimizations, and compares with optimal complexities for the first time, especially for analyzing transitive relations. We also experiment with rule systems widely considered to have best performances for each type. We analyze all well-known variants of the rules and examine a wide variety of input relationship graphs. Our results include precisely calculated optimal time complexities; exact explanations and comparisons across different inference methods, rule variants, and graph types; confirmation with detailed measurements from performance experiments; and answers to the key questions above.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report provides insights into the challenges, emerging topics, and opportunities related to human-data interaction and visual analytics in the AI era. The BigVis 2024 organizing committee conducted a survey among experts in the field. They invite the Program Committee members and the authors of accepted papers to share their views. Thirty-two scientists from diverse research communities, including Databases, Information Visualization, and Human-Computer Interaction, participated in the study. These scientists, representing both industry and academia, provided valuable insights into the current and future landscape of the field.
  In this report, we analyze the survey responses and compare them to the findings of a similar study conducted four years ago. The results reveal some interesting insights. First, many of the critical challenges identified in the previous survey remain highly relevant today, despite being unrelated to AI. Meanwhile, the field's landscape has significantly evolved, with most of today's vital challenges not even being mentioned in the earlier survey, underscoring the profound impact of AI-related advancements.
  By summarizing the perspectives of the research community, this report aims to shed light on the key challenges, emerging trends, and potential research directions in human-data interaction and visual analytics in the AI era.</description>

      <title>VDDP: Verifiable Distributed Differential Privacy under the Client-Server-Verifier Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite differential privacy (DP) often being considered the de facto standard for data privacy, its realization is vulnerable to unfaithful execution of its mechanisms by servers, especially in distributed settings. Specifically, servers may sample noise from incorrect distributions or generate correlated noise while appearing to follow established protocols. This work analyzes these malicious behaviors in a general differential privacy framework within a distributed client-server-verifier setup. To address these adversarial problems, we propose a novel definition called Verifiable Distributed Differential Privacy (VDDP) by incorporating additional verification mechanisms. We also explore the relationship between zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and DP, demonstrating that while ZKPs are sufficient for achieving DP under verifiability requirements, they are not necessary. Furthermore, we develop two novel and efficient mechanisms that satisfy VDDP: (1) the Verifiable Distributed Discrete Laplacian Mechanism (VDDLM), which offers up to a $4 \times 10^5$x improvement in proof generation efficiency with only 0.1-0.2x error compared to the previous state-of-the-art verifiable differentially private mechanism; (2) an improved solution to Verifiable Randomized Response (VRR) under local DP, a special case of VDDP, achieving up a reduction of up to 5000x in communication costs and the verifier's overhead.</description>

      <title>Color: A Framework for Applying Graph Coloring to Subgraph Cardinality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph workloads pose a particularly challenging problem for query optimizers. They typically feature large queries made up of entirely many-to-many joins with complex correlations. This puts significant stress on traditional cardinality estimation methods which generally see catastrophic errors when estimating the size of queries with only a handful of joins. To overcome this, we propose COLOR, a framework for subgraph cardinality estimation which applies insights from graph compression theory to produce a compact summary that captures the global topology of the data graph. Further, we identify several key optimizations that enable tractable estimation over this summary even for large query graphs. We then evaluate several designs within this framework and find that they improve accuracy by up to 10$^3$x over all competing methods while maintaining fast inference, a small memory footprint, efficient construction, and graceful degradation under updates.</description>

      <title>MedPix 2.0: A Comprehensive Multimodal Biomedical Data set for Advanced AI Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02994v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing interest in developing Artificial Intelligence applications in the medical domain, suffers from the lack of high-quality data set, mainly due to privacy-related issues. Moreover, the recent rising of Large Multimodal Models (LMM) leads to a need for multimodal medical data sets, where clinical reports and findings are attached to the corresponding CT or MR scans. This paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the data set MedPix 2.0. Starting from the well-known multimodal data set MedPix, mainly used by physicians, nurses and healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual curing procedure where noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB database. Along with the data set, we developed a GUI aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance, and obtaining the raw data that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning LMMs. To enforce this point, we also propose a CLIP-based model trained on MedPix 2.0 for scanning modality and location classification tasks. MedPix 2.0 is available on GitHub</description>

      <title>Using Read Promotion and Mixed Isolation Levels for Performant Yet Serializable Execution of Transaction Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theory that can determine the lowest isolation level that can be allocated to each transaction program in an application in a mixed-isolation-level setting, to guarantee that all executions will be serializable and thus preserve all integrity constraints, even those that are not explicitly declared. This extends prior work applied to completely known transactions, to deal with the realistic situation where transactions are generated by running programs with parameters that are not known in advance. Using our theory, we propose an optimization method that allows for high throughput while ensuring that all executions are serializable. Our method is based on searching for application code modifications that are semantics-preserving while improving the isolation level allocation. We illustrate our approach to the SmallBank benchmark.</description>

      <title>SoK: The Gap Between Data Rights Ideals and Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As information economies burgeon, they unlock innovation and economic wealth while posing novel threats to civil liberties and altering power dynamics between individuals, companies, and governments. Legislatures have reacted with privacy laws designed to empower individuals over their data. These laws typically create rights for "data subjects" (individuals) to make requests of data collectors (companies and governments). The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) exemplifies this, granting extensive data rights to data subjects, a model embraced globally. However, the question remains: do these rights-based privacy laws effectively empower individuals over their data? This paper scrutinizes these approaches by reviewing 201 interdisciplinary empirical studies, news articles, and blog posts. We pinpoint 15 key questions concerning the efficacy of rights allocations. The literature often presents conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of rights-based frameworks, but it generally emphasizes their limitations. We offer recommendations to policymakers and Computer Science (CS) groups committed to these frameworks, and suggest alternative privacy regulation approaches.</description>

      <title>SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved.
  In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</description>
