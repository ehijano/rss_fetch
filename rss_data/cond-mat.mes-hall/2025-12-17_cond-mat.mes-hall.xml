      <title>Proximity-tuned Magnetic and Transport Anomalies in All-epitaxial Fe5-xGeTe2/WSe2 Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures combining two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets and semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer highly promising opportunities for tailoring 2D magnetism through interfacial proximity effects, enabling unique physical phenomena inaccessible in 3D systems and achieving functionalities beyond conventional spintronics. However, current fabrication of vdW heterostructures still relies heavily on the manual stacking of exfoliated 2D flakes, leading to critical challenges in scalability, interfacial quality, thickness control and device integration. This work reports on the realization of all-epitaxial, high-quality Fe5-xGeTe2(FGT)/WSe2 heterostructures exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and room-temperature ferromagnetism. The FGT/WSe2 system demonstrates temperature-driven magnetic transitions, higher-order PMA contributions and large anisotropic magnetoresistance, highlighting sublattice-specific contributions to magnetic and transport properties. Notably, the FGT/WSe2 heterostructures display unconventional physical phenomena, including thickness- and temperature-dependent sign reversal of exchange bias, a reversed thickness trend in the unconventional Hall effect, and a non-monotonic PMA-thickness dependence. These anomalies indicate pronounced interfacial contributions arising from proximity effects enhanced by epitaxial interface quality. Collectively, this study provides deep insights into the magnetic and transport properties of FGT/WSe2 vdW heterostructures, establishing a scalable platform for exploring emergent 2D physics and advancing next-generation 2D spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Thermal response functions and second sound in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of second sound, and more broadly the ballistic transport of heat, is of central importance in heat dissipation from electronic devices at very short length and time scales. Specifically, there is an interest in the practical implications of violations of Fourier's law. Recently, we have developed a simulation approach based on thermal-response functions that is appropriate for elucidating physics beyond the diffusive regime, including time-dependent sources and second-sound propagation. The methods are applied to free-standing graphene simulated using molecular-dynamics (MD) with empirical potentials. The simulations predict a strong second-sound signal at T=300K for length scales of at least L=68.1nm. It is demonstrated that the second-sound dissipation time is determined primarily by decoherence that emerges from the details of the phonon band structure. It is also shown that the decay time for second sound depends sensitively on the length scale that characterizes the thermal excitation. This is in contrast with theories based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), where second-sound dissipation is determined primarily by the resistive anharmonic phonon scattering rate. Calculations using the linearized BTE are also presented, along with analysis of second sound based on the BTE. This approach results in significantly longer lifetimes for second sound in comparison to our MD simulation results. Predictions for the response due to time-dependent sources are also presented, including insight into how time-dependent sources could be tuned to result in weak or strong temperature oscillations, and how time-dependent experiments might probe the spectra associated with second sound. Results are discussed in the context of second sound in graphite in the temperature range from 100-200K.</description>

      <title>Spiral-induced Anomalous Hall Effect from Odd-parity Spin-nodal Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin spirals represent a fundamental class of noncollinear yet coplanar magnetic structures that give rise to diverse emergent phenomena reflecting spin chirality. We investigate metallic systems hosting commensurate spin spirals and uncover an unconventional anomalous Hall effect (AHE) induced by spiral magnetism. The spin spiral introduces odd-parity spin splitting with polarization perpendicular to the helical plane, forming spin-nodal lines in the electronic structure. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, we find that these nodal lines become gapped by finite magnetization, concentrating the Berry curvature near the gap and generating a distinctive AHE. We identify the interplay among the spin-orbit coupling, helical plane orientation, and magnetization direction as the key ingredient for this spiral-induced AHE, which is expected to occur across a wide range of materials hosting commensurate spin spirals.</description>

      <title>Improved diffusive approximation of Markov jump processes close to equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive approximations of Markov jump processes often fail to accurately capture large fluctuations. This is confounding, as the rare events triggered by these large fluctuations, such as the failure of electronic memories, are often the object of interest. In this paper we present an improved diffusive approximation, extending a method previously limited to equilibrium systems. Using new tools from stochastic thermodynamics, we prove its validity to linear order in departures from equilibrium and demonstrate its superior accuracy over the Kramers-Moyal expansion in predicting both steady-state and transient properties, including the error rate of a non-equilibrium electronic memory.</description>

      <title>Probing spatially resolved spin density correlations with trapped excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly growing class of atomically thin and tunable van der Waals materials is intensely investigated both in the context of fundamental science and for new technologies. There is in this connection a widespread need for new ways to probe the electronic properties of these layered materials, since their two-dimensional (2D) character make conventional probes less efficient. Here, we show how excitons trapped in a moir\'e lattice can be used as an optical probe for spatially resolved electron spin density correlations in such materials. The electrons in the material of interest virtually tunnel to the moir\'e lattice where they scatter on the excitons after which they tunnel back. This gives rise to an effective spin-dependent and spatially localised potential felt by the electrons, which in turn leads to energy shifts that can be measured spectroscopically in the exciton spectrum. Using second order perturbation theory combined with a solution to the exciton-electron scattering problem, we show that the electrons mediate an interaction between two excitons resulting in an energy shift proportional to their two-point spin density-density correlation function evaluated at the exciton positions. We then discuss two specific applications of our setup. First, we show that quantum phase transitions between different in-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders in a 2D lattice give rise to large and measurable shifts in the exciton spectrum in the critical regions. Second, we analyse how different pairing symmetries of superconducting phases can be probed. This demonstrates that our scheme opens up new ways to probe electron spin density correlations, which is a key property of many quantum phases predicted to exist in the new 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Terahertz response of confined electron-hole pair: crossover between strong and weak confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze theoretically THz response of an electron-hole pair confined in a semiconductor nanoparticle. We show that the interplay of particle confinement and electron-hole Coulomb interaction leads to significant renormalizations and energy shifts in THz linear conductivity of the nanocrystal. We develop and evaluate models in the strong and the weak confinement regime in order to correctly address the effect of Coulomb interaction. In the weak confinement regime, we find solutions of the problem in a form similar to the Wannier wavefunction whose spatial extent is reduced as a consequence of the confinement. The resulting states are scalable down to the strong confinement regime, enabling a theoretical description of the exciton response for arbitrarily sized nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Hybrid acousto-optical spin control in quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical degrees of freedom very weakly couple to spins in semiconductors. The inefficient coupling between phonons and single electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) hinders their integration into on-chip acoustically coupled quantum hybrid systems. We propose a hybrid acousto-optical spin control method that circumvents this problem and effectively introduces acoustic spin rotation to QDs, complementing their rich couplings with external fields and quantum registers. We show that combining continuous-wave detuned optical coupling to a trion state and acoustic modulation results in spin rotation around an axis defined by the acoustic field. The optical field breaks spin conservation, allowing phonons to drive transitions between disrupted spin states when at resonance with the Zeeman frequency. Our method is compatible with pulse sequences that mitigate quasi-static noise effects, which makes trion recombination the primary limitation to gate fidelity under cooled nuclear-spin conditions. Numerical simulations indicate that spin rotation fidelity can be very high, if the trion lifetime is long and Zeeman splitting is sufficiently large, with a currently feasible 50~ns lifetime and 44~GHz splitting giving 99.9\% fidelity. Applying our advancement could enable acoustic QD spin state transfer to diverse solid-state systems and transduction between acoustic, optical, and microwave domains, all within an on-chip integration-ready setting.</description>

      <title>Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor junctions as thermoelectric bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a superconducting thermoelectric bolometer made of a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction. Our detector has the advantage of being passive, as it directly transduces input power to a voltage without the need to modulate an external bias. We characterize the device via numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating of both sides of the junction. While estimating noise contributions, we found novel expressions due to the temperatures of both sides being different than the bath temperature. Numerical simulations show a Noise Equivalent Power ${\rm NEP}\sim 4\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm W}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for an input power of $\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm W}$, a response time of $\tau_{th}\sim 200\, {\rm ns}$ and an integration time to obtain a Signal-to-Noise Ratio ${\rm SNR}=1$ of $\tau_{\rm SNR=1}\sim 100\,\mu{\rm s}$ for an input power $\sim 10^{-13}\,{\rm W}$. Therefore, the device shows promise for large-array cosmological experiment applications, also considering its advantages for fabrication and heat budget.</description>

      <title>Spin-Selective Thermoelectric Transport in a Triangular Spin Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin-resolved thermoelectric transport in a triangular ladder geometry hosting antiferromagnetic spin alignment, where lattice topology and magnetic ordering jointly enable highly efficient spin-selective energy conversion. The inherent geometric frustration of the ladder, together with intrinsic spin-filtering mechanisms, is shown to promote a pronounced separation between spin channels. Implementing spin-dependent onsite modulations, such as binary asymmetric potentials, induces pronounced spin splitting in the transmission spectrum, enabling controlled spin-selective transport and highlighting the role of lattice engineering in tailoring spin-dependent thermoelectric response. Additional control is achieved through modulation of the hopping amplitudes, which activates multiple transport pathways and allows fine tuning of spin-dependent conduction. A detailed evaluation of charge and spin thermoelectric coefficients reveals a strong enhancement of the thermoelectric performance, with the dimensionless figure of merit ZT reaching large values in optimized parameter regimes. Notably, the spin figure of merit systematically surpasses its charge counterpart, underscoring the decisive role of lattice geometry and antiferromagnetic order in amplifying spin thermoelectric efficiency. Our findings provide a versatile theoretical platform for designing low-dimensional spin-caloritronic devices with enhanced functionality.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable spin qubits in strain-engineered graphene p-n junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain engineering enables quantum confinement in pristine graphene without degrading its intrinsic mobility and spin coherence. Here, we extend previously proposed strain-induced charge-qubit architectures by incorporating spin degrees of freedom through Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and Zeeman fields, enabling spin-qubit operation in single-layer graphene (SLG). In a graphene p-n junction, a strain-induced nanobubble generates a pseudo-magnetic field that forms double quantum dots with gate-tunable level hybridization. Tight-binding quantum transport simulations and a four-band model reveal two distinct avoided crossings: spin-conserving gaps at zero detuning and spin-flip gaps at finite detuning, the latter increasing with SOC strength while the former decreases. Time-domain simulations confirm detuning-dependent Rabi oscillations corresponding to these two operational regimes. These results demonstrate that strain-induced confinement combined with tunable SOC provides a viable mechanism for coherent spin manipulation in pristine graphene, positioning strained SLG as a promising platform for scalable spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Theory of thermomagnonic torques in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of thermomagnonic torques in insulating altermagnets and predict a spin-splitter magnonic torque arising from the spin Seebeck effect. Additionally, we predict an anisotropic entropic torque. We study the effects of these torques on magnetic-texture dynamics and identify various anisotropic responses to temperature gradients. In particular, we predict spin-current-induced domain-wall precession, which can slow domain-wall motion for certain temperature-gradient directions. We also predict a temperature-gradient-driven anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect that enables fast skyrmion motion in response to thermal gradients. Our findings will be useful for spintronic applications such as magnetic racetrack memories and will serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in insulating altermagnets with magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>False Vacuum Decay in Flat-Band Ferromagnets: Role of Quantum Geometry and Chiral Edge States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical control of quantum matter is a challenging, yet promising direction for probing strongly correlated states. Motivated by recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$ that demonstrated optical control of magnetization, we propose a protocol for probing magnetization dynamics in flat-band ferromagnets. We investigate the nucleation and dynamical growth of magnetic bubbles prepared on top of a false vaccum in both itinerant ferromagnets and spin-polarized Chern insulators. For ferromagnetic metals, we emphasize the crucial role of a non-trivial quantum geometry in the magnetization dynamics, which in turn also provides a probe for the quantum metric. Furthermore, for quantum Hall ferromagnets, we show how properties of chiral edge modes localized at domain-wall boundaries can be dynamically accessed. Our work demonstrates the potential for nonequilibrium protocols to control and probe strongly correlated phases, with particular relevance for twisted MoTe$_2$ and graphene-based flat-band ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Unreasonable effectiveness of unsupervised learning in identifying Majorana topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In unsupervised learning, the training data for deep learning does not come with any labels, thus forcing the algorithm to discover hidden patterns in the data for discerning useful information. This, in principle, could be a powerful tool in identifying topological order since topology does not always manifest in obvious physical ways (e.g., topological superconductivity) for its decisive confirmation. The problem, however, is that unsupervised learning is a difficult challenge, necessitating huge computing resources, which may not always work. In the current work, we combine unsupervised and supervised learning using an autoencoder to establish that unlabeled data in the Majorana splitting in realistic short disordered nanowires may enable not only a distinction between `topological' and `trivial', but also where their crossover happens in the relevant parameter space. This may be a useful tool in identifying topology in Majorana nanowires.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Rate Performance of Potassium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries dominate battery research and industry due to their long research history and high energy density. However, increasing demand and limited lithium resources have raised lithium prices and battery costs, motivating interest in alternative chemistries. Potassium-ion batteries have recently attracted attention because potassium is more abundant and potentially lower cost, although the technology remains at an early stage and requires further insight for development. In this work, recently developed methods for rigorous analysis of electrode rate performance are applied to published rate-performance data from a wide range of potassium-ion batteries. Using specific capacity (mAh per g) versus charge and discharge rate curves, performance parameters are extracted to evaluate the applicability of the key model underlying these methods and to analyze opportunities for potassium-ion batteries. Relationships between these parameters and electrode properties are used to interpret performance trends and compare potassium-ion batteries with established technologies. The analysis shows that the model effectively fits potassium-ion battery rate-performance data and allows reliable extraction of performance parameters. While potassium-ion batteries generally exhibit lower specific capacities than lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, their upper limit of rate performance is found to exceed that of lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and related two-dimensional material electrodes, despite the larger atomic size and mass of potassium.</description>

Abstract: The anisotropic Rabi model (ARM), which features tunable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) and anti-Jaynes-Cummings (AJC) interactions, has remained challenging to realize fully. We present a circuit QED implementation that provides static control over the ARM parameters. By simultaneously coupling a qubit to a resonator's voltage and current antinodes, we geometrically tune the interaction from pure JC to pure AJC. This control enables novel quantum measurement capabilities, including dispersive shift cancellation and Purcell-suppressed readout. Our work establishes a direct platform for exploring the ARM's full parameter space and its applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Dirac fermion and anomalous oscillator strength of zeroth Landau level transition</title>

Abstract: Dirac fermions, characterized by their linear dispersion and relativistic nature, have emerged as a prominent class of quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. While the Dirac equation, initially developed in the context of high-energy physics, provides a remarkable framework for describing the electronic properties of these materials, the inherent symmetry constraints of condensed matter often lead to deviations from the idealized paradigm. In particular, three-dimensional Dirac fermions in solids often exhibit anisotropic behavior, challenging the notion of perfect symmetry inherent in the Dirac equation. Here, we report the observation of isotropic massive Dirac fermions in LaAlSi through Landau level spectroscopy. The presence of three-dimensional massive Dirac fermions across the Fermi energy is demonstrated by quantized and semiclassical analyses of the magnetic field evolution of Landau level transitions. The isotropic topological nature, Fermi velocity, and Dirac mass are evidenced by the identical magneto-infrared response among the Faraday and three Voigt geometries. Furthermore, we observe an unusually large oscillator strength in the zeroth Landau level transition of the Dirac fermion, compared to transitions with higher indices. This phenomenon, supported by model calculations, can be attributed to the combined effects of the partial excitation of Dirac fermion and the resonant dielectric coupling with the Weyl plasma. Our work provides a strategy for realizing ideal quasiparticle excitations and their coupling effects in condensed matter systems, offering a platform for exploring relativistic physics.</description>

      <title>Polarization- and wave-vector selective optical metasurface with near-field coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are a powerful tool for manipulating light using small structures on the nanoscale. In most meta-surfaces, near-field couplings are treated as unfavorable perturbations. Here, we experimentally investigate a structure consisting of sinusoidally modulated silicon waveguides where near-field coupling of local resonances leads to negative coupling, i.e. a negative coupling constant. This gives rise to wave-vector dependent eigenstates of elliptical, linear and circular polarizations. In particular, fully circular polarization states are not only present at a single point in momentum-space (k-space), but along a line. This circular polarization line, as well as a linear polarization line, emanates from a polarization degeneracy at the Dirac point. We experimentally validate the existence of these eigenstates and demonstrate the energy-, polarization- and wave-vector-dependence of this metasurface. By tuning the incident k-vector, certain polarization-energy eigenstates are strongly reflected allowing for uses in angle-tunable polarization filters and light sources.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Protocols Stabilize Charging in Noisy Ising Quantum Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable charging protocols are crucial for advancing quantum batteries toward practical use. We investigate a transverse-field Ising chain as a quantum battery, focusing on the combined role of qubit interactions in the battery model and finite charging time. This interplay yields smoother and more controllable charging compared to sudden protocols or non-interacting batteries. Introducing stochastic noise reveals a strong dependence on the charging trajectory. Protocols that weakly excite the system gain energy under noise but lose extractable work. In contrast, protocols that strongly excite many modes show the opposite trend: noise reduces stored energy yet improves efficiency, defined as the ratio of ergotropy to stored energy. These findings demonstrate that finite-time ramps stabilize charging and highlight that noise can either hinder or enhance quantum-battery performance depending on the protocol.</description>

      <title>Electrodrying in nanopores: from fundamentals to iontronic and memristive applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iontronics is a burgeoning paradigm that employs ions in solution as information carriers for sensing and computing, e.g., in neuromorphic devices. The fundamentally different working principle as compared to electronics requires novel approaches and concepts to control the impedance of nanoscale fluidic circuit elements, such as nanopores. For instance, previous research has focused on voltage-induced pore wetting as a means to trigger conduction in nanopores. The present study explores the opposite counter-intuitive mechanism: using voltage to dry hydrophobic nanopores and, therefore, to turn off conduction. This "electrodrying" concept affords exquisite, bidirectional control over the conductance of nanopores additionally showing hysteresis in the current-voltage curve that is the fingerprint of memristors. Using an analytical model and free-energy molecular dynamics simulations, we explain the physical mechanism underlying electrodrying and provide clear design criteria for solid-state and biological nanopores with bidirectional control over conductance. The electrical behaviour of electrodrying nanopores shows two unique features: i) the hysteresis loop is shifted from the origin, accounting for the fifth, previously unreported memristor type and ii) negative differential resistance is observed over a broad voltage range in which the non-conductive state is favoured by electrodrying. These properties are demonstrated in a short-term memory task and in an iontronic oscillator circuit to showcase their potential in neuromorphic applications and iontronic devices. Finally, we validate our predictions through experiments on engineered dipolar hydrophobic CytK nanopores, whose voltage-dependent conductance substantiates the electrodrying concept.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coulomb Blockade in Orbital Resolved Phosphorus Triple-Donor Molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-donor architecture in silicon offers a promising direction towards scalable solid-state qubits and quantum technologies operating at practical conditions. However, the overlap of multiple donor wave-functions develops a complex internal electronic configuration with several discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete-correlated states is essential for understanding inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards their practical implementations in quantum-technologies. We have experimentally demonstrated quantum Coulomb blockade mediated systematic filling of several electrons into orbital-resolved molecular states within multi-phosphorous-donor molecules accompanied by a correlated decrement in charging energies for higher hybridized orbitals due to expanded Bohr radii and electron delocalization. Corresponding, first-principle density functional theory calculations offer microscopic insight into the orbital configurations, while the rate equation simulations of quantum Coulomb blockade faithfully reproduce the experimental stability diagrams. This comprehensive characterization advances and discusses the role of donor-molecules in silicon in scalable building blocks for quantum technologies operable at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Beyond symmetry protection: Robust feedback-enforced edge states in non-Hermitian stacked quantum spin Hall systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that, in the simplest time-reversal-symmetric setting, strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb Z_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are rendered with negligible gain while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes -- without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.</description>

      <title>Inverse determination of light-matter coupling in disordered systems from transmittance spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum inverse problems in one-dimensional (1D) electronic disordered systems strongly coupled to optical cavities. More specifically, we consider the Anderson and the Aubry-Andre-Harper models connected to electronic reservoirs and embedded in a single-mode optical cavity. The light-matter interaction enables photon-assisted hopping processes that significantly modify the transmittance spectrum. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we implement an inversion-based approach capable of accurately extracting the electron-photon coupling strength directly from transmittance spectra. While cavity coupling acts as a minor perturbation within the Anderson model, yielding broad yet precise parameter estimates, its influence is markedly different in the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model. The latter exhibits a sharp metal-insulator transition in 1D, thus resulting in more pronounced cavity-induced spectral changes. This renders even more accurate inverse solutions, offering unparalleled precision in the characterization of low-dimensional disordered systems. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the quantum inverse problem provides a robust diagnostic tool for quantum materials, particularly effective for systems exhibiting metal-insulator transitions.</description>

      <title>Cooling mechanical motion with polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling between light and matter gives rise to polaritons. Further coupling polaritons to phonons leads to the formation of hybrid polaromechanical systems. Recent experiments have achieved the strong coupling between polaritons and phonons in two configurations, namely, the magnon-photon-phonon and exciton-photon-phonon systems, which enables the control of mechanical motion via manipulating polaritons. Here, we present a polaromechanical cooling theory and explicitly show how two polaritons can be used to simultaneously cool two mechanical modes. The unique advantage of our protocol lies in the fact that the continuous tunability of the polariton frequencies over a wide range allows for the cooling of any two mechanical modes with their frequency difference falling within this range. We further discuss how to extend the theory to cool multiple mechanical modes. The protocol is designed for cooling mechanical motion in various emerging polaromechanical platforms, such as magnon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaromechanical systems, which is the first step towards quantum states generation in these hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Disordered Potentials under Spatially Uniform SU(2) Gauge Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin $1/2$ particle propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a generalized spin-orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.</description>
