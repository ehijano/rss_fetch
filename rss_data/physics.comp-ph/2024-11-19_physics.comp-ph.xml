      <title>NeuralMag: an open-source nodal finite-difference code for inverse micromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NeuralMag, a flexible and high-performance open-source Python library for micromagnetic simulations. NeuralMag leverages modern machine learning frameworks, such as PyTorch and JAX, to perform efficient tensor operations on various parallel hardware, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. The library implements a novel nodal finite-difference discretization scheme that provides improved accuracy over traditional finite-difference methods without increasing computational complexity. NeuralMag is particularly well-suited for solving inverse problems, especially those with time-dependent objectives, thanks to its automatic differentiation capabilities. Performance benchmarks show that NeuralMag is competitive with state-of-the-art simulation codes while offering enhanced flexibility through its Python interface and integration with high-level computational backends.</description>

      <title>KAN/MultKAN with Physics-Informed Spline fitting (KAN-PISF) for ordinary/partial differential equation discovery of nonlinear dynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning for scientific discovery is increasingly becoming popular because of its ability to extract and recognize the nonlinear characteristics from the data. The black-box nature of deep learning methods poses difficulties in interpreting the identified model. There is a dire need to interpret the machine learning models to develop a physical understanding of dynamic systems. An interpretable form of neural network called Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) or Multiplicative KAN (MultKAN) offers critical features that help recognize the nonlinearities in the governing ordinary/partial differential equations (ODE/PDE) of various dynamic systems and find their equation structures. In this study, an equation discovery framework is proposed that includes i) sequentially regularized derivatives for denoising (SRDD) algorithm to denoise the measure data to obtain accurate derivatives, ii) KAN to identify the equation structure and suggest relevant nonlinear functions that are used to create a small overcomplete library of functions, and iii) physics-informed spline fitting (PISF) algorithm to filter the excess functions from the library and converge to the correct equation. The framework was tested on the forced Duffing oscillator, Van der Pol oscillator (stiff ODE), Burger's equation, and Bouc-Wen model (coupled ODE). The proposed method converged to the true equation for the first three systems. It provided an approximate model for the Bouc-Wen model that could acceptably capture the hysteresis response. Using KAN maintains low complexity, which helps the user interpret the results throughout the process and avoid the black-box-type nature of machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mold: overcoming the time constraints of molecular dynamics on general-purpose hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been intimately linked to that of computing hardware. For decades following the creation of MD, simulations have improved with computing power along the three principal dimensions of accuracy, atom count (spatial scale), and duration (temporal scale). Since the mid-2000s, computer platforms have however failed to provide strong scaling for MD as scale-out CPU and GPU platforms that provide substantial increases to spatial scale do not lead to proportional increases in temporal scale. Important scientific problems therefore remained inaccessible to direct simulation, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that present significant complexity, accuracy, and efficiency challenges. While bespoke MD-only hardware solutions have provided a path to longer timescales for specific physical systems, their impact on the broader community has been mitigated by their limited adaptability to new methods and potentials. In this work, we show that a novel computing architecture, the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine, completely alters the scaling path by delivering unprecedentedly high simulation rates up to 1.144M steps/second for 200,000 atoms whose interactions are described by an Embedded Atom Method potential. This enables direct simulations of the evolution of materials using general-purpose programmable hardware over millisecond timescales, dramatically increasing the space of direct MD simulations that can be carried out.</description>

      <title>Magnetized ICF implosions: Non-axial magnetic field topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores 4 different magnetic field topologies for application to spherical inertial confinement fusion implosions: axial, mirror, cusp and closed field lines. A mirror field is found to enhance the impact of magnetization over an axial field; this is because the mirror field more closely follows the hot-spot surface. A cusp field, while simple to generate, is not found to have any benefits over the tried-and-tested axial field. Closed field lines are found to be of the greatest benefit to hot-spot performance, with the simulated design undergoing a 2x increase in ion temperature before alpha-heating is considered. The plasma properties of the simulation with closed field lines are radically different from the unmagnetized counterpart, with electron temperatures in excess of 100 keV, suggesting that a fundamental redesign of the capsule implosion is possible if this method is pursued.</description>

      <title>Star Log-extended eMulation: a method for efficient computation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10556v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a novel hybrid method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for the first time. This new method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known phenomenological equations of state (EOS) with fixed parameters and with a freely-varying parametric Quarkyonic EOS. Our results produce a significant computational speed-up of $\approx 3 \times 10^4$ compared to high fidelity (HF) calculations using standard Runge-Kutta methods, providing an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS from neutron star mergers. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods developed in this work will be openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.</description>

      <title>Effect of Hubbard U corrections on the electronic and magnetic properties of 2D materials: A high-throughput study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic investigation of the role of Hubbard U corrections in electronic structure calculations of two-dimensional (2D) materials containing 3d transition metals. Specifically, we use density functional theory (DFT) with the PBE and PBE+U approximations to calculate the crystal structure, band gaps, and magnetic parameters of 638 monolayers. Based on a comprehensive comparison to experiments we first establish that inclusion of the U correction worsens the accuracy for the lattice constant. Consequently, PBE structures are used for subsequent property evaluations. The band gaps show significant dependence on the U-parameter. In particular, for 134 (21%) of the materials the U parameter leads to a metal-insulator transition. For the magnetic materials we calculate the magnetic moment, magnetic exchange coupling, and magnetic anisotropy parameters. In contrast to the band gaps, the size of the magnetic moments shows only weak dependence on U. Both the exchange energies and magnetic anisotropy parameters are systematically reduced by the U correction. On this basis we conclude that the Hubbard U correction will lead to lower predicted Curie temperatures in 2D materials. All the calculated properties are available in the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB).</description>

      <title>Pseudotransitions in a dilute Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the ground state and thermodynamic properties of a spin-pseudospin chain representing a model of a one-dimensional dilute magnet with two types of nonmagnetic charged impurities. For this purpose, a method utilizing the transfer-matrix properties is employed. Despite the wide variety of intriguing frustrated phase states, we show that the model showcases pseudotransitions solely between simple charge and magnetic quasiorders. These pseudotransitions are characterized by distinct features in the thermodynamic and magnetic quantities, resembling first- and second-order phase transitions. In addition to pseudotransitions for the ``pure'' system, similar to those observed in other one-dimensional spin models, this study also reveals the presence of ``second-order'' pseudotransitions for the dilute case. We show that the nature of these discovered pseudotransitions is associated with the phase separation in the chain into regions of (anti)ferromagnetic and charge-ordered phases. The ability to compare the results of an exact transfer-matrix calculation with a simple phenomenological description within the framework of Maxwell construction contributes to a deeper understanding of both the physical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the analytical methods used.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Active-Orbital-Based and Adaptive CC($P$;$Q$) Approaches to Excited Electronic States: Application to Potential Cuts of Water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first study using active-orbital-based and adaptive CC($P$;$Q$) approaches to describe excited electronic states. These CC($P$;$Q$) methodologies are applied, alongside their completely renormalized (CR) coupled-cluster (CC) and equation-of-motion (EOM) CC counterparts, to recover the ground- and excited-state potential cuts of the water molecule along the O-H bond-breaking coordinate obtained in the parent CC/EOMCC calculations with a full treatment of singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT/EOMCCSDT). We demonstrate that the active-orbital-based and adaptive CC($P$;$Q$) approaches closely approximate the CCSDT/EOMCCSDT data using significantly reduced computational costs while improving the CR-CC and CR-EOMCC energetics in stretched regions of the O-H bond-breaking potentials.</description>

      <title>Toward a Better Understanding of the Photothermal Heating of High-Entropy-Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical approach, for the first time, to investigate optical and photothermal properties of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles with a focus on FeCoNi-based alloys. We systematically analyze the absorption spectra of spherical nanoparticles composed of pure metals and alloys in various surrounding media. Through comparison with experimental data, we select appropriate dielectric data for the constituent elements to accurately compute absorption spectra for FeCoNi-based high-entropy-alloy nanoparticles. Then, we predict the temperature rise over time within a substrate comprised of Fe nanoparticles exposed to solar irradiation and find quantitative agreement with experimental data for FeCoNi nanoparticles reported in previous studies. The striking similarity between the optical and photothermal behaviors of FeCoNi nanoparticles and their pure iron counterparts suggests that iron nanoparticles can effectively serve as a model for understanding the optical and thermal response of FeCoNi-based alloy nanoparticles. These findings offer a simplified approach for theoretical modeling of complex high-entropy alloys and provide valuable insights into their nanoscale optical behavior.</description>

      <title>Optimal reduction of an epidemic outbreak size via temporary quarantine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of an epidemic spread is crucial for effective control measures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantines were implemented to minimize infections while mitigating social and economic impacts, raising the question of how to maximize quarantine efficiency. Previous research on periodic quarantines using the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and similar models identified optimal duration for periodic quarantines. However, the question of the optimal initiation time for a single quarantine remains unanswered. Here, we use the SIR model in order to determine the optimal quarantine initiation time, by computing the optimal susceptible fraction at the onset of the quarantine, which minimizes the total outbreak size. Our analysis extends from a well-mixed scenario to strongly-heterogeneous social networks. We show that the optimal quarantine initiation time is closely related to the so-called "herd immunity" threshold, occurring at the onset of epidemic decline. Importantly, providing a methodology for identifying the optimal quarantine initiation time across different network structures, entails significant implications for epidemic control.</description>

      <title>A new paradigm for wall-modeled large eddy simulations using the volume-filtering framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we apply the framework of volume-filtering for particle-laden flows, to large eddy simulations (LES) of wall-bounded flows leading to a new perspective on wall-modeled LES (WMLES) that we refer to as volume-filtered WMLES (VF-WMLES). In contrast to existing wall-models, the VF-WMLES framework does not rely on temporal averaging, does not make a priori assumptions on the pressure gradient, and can be used with a uniform spatial filter, which avoids the appearance of commutation closures in spatial derivatives of the filtered momentum and continuity equation. Volume-filtering is well-defined, even close to the wall, and it is shown that a non-zero slip and penetration velocity at the wall is a direct consequence of volume-filtering the flow. With the VF-WMLES concept, new wall models can be directly assessed in a priori and a posteriori studies by comparing the predicted slip and penetration velocities at the wall with the velocities from explicitly volume-filtered direct numerical simulations (DNS). Based on the VF-WMLES concept, we derive an LES modeling strategy that is based on the recently proposed PC-IBM, a modeling framework based on volume-filtering allowing to couple the flow with arbitrarily shaped solid boundaries using relatively coarse Cartesian fluid meshes. The proposed VF-WMLES is validated with two cases, a turbulent channel flow and a turbulent flow over periodic hills, and shown to accurately predict the mean velocity profiles for both cases.</description>

Abstract: Accurately determining the geographic origin of mineral samples is pivotal for applications in geology, mineralogy, and material science. Leveraging the comprehensive Raman spectral data from the RRUFF database, this study introduces a novel machine learning framework aimed at geolocating mineral specimens at the country level. We employ a one-dimensional ConvNeXt1D neural network architecture to classify mineral spectra based solely on their spectral signatures. The processed dataset comprises over 32,900 mineral samples, predominantly natural, spanning 101 countries. Through five-fold cross-validation, the ConvNeXt1D model achieved an impressive average classification accuracy of 93%, demonstrating its efficacy in capturing geospatial patterns inherent in Raman spectra.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Component, Multi-Physics Computational Model for Solving Coupled Cardiac Electromechanics and Vascular Haemodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circulatory system, comprising the heart and blood vessels, is vital for nutrient transport, waste removal, and homeostasis. Traditional computational models often isolate individual biophysical processes, such as cardiac electromechanics and blood flow dynamics, failing to capture the system's integrated nature. This paper presents an innovative approach that couples a 3D electromechanical model of the heart with a 3D fluid mechanics model of vascular blood flow. Our file-based partitioned coupling scheme allows these models to run independently while sharing essential data through intermediate files. We validate this approach using two solvers: one for cardiac electromechanics and the other for vascular blood flow. Developed by separate research groups, these solvers emphasise different dynamical scales and utilise distinct discretisation schemes. Numerical simulations using idealised and realistic anatomies show that the implemented coupling scheme is reliable and requires minimal additional computation time relative to advancing individual time steps in the heart and blood flow models. Notably, the coupled model predicts muscle displacement differently than the standalone heart model, highlighting the influence of detailed vascular blood flow on cardiac function. This study presents a paradigm case of how to build virtual human models and digital twins by productive collaboration between teams with complementary expertise.</description>

      <title>Local stability guarantees for data-driven quadratically nonlinear models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Navier Stokes equations (NSEs) are partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the nonlinear convective motion of fluids and they are computationally expensive to simulate because of their high nonlinearity and variables being fully coupled. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are simpler models for evolving the flows by capturing only the dominant behaviors of a system and can be used to design controllers for high-dimensional systems. However it is challenging to guarantee the stability of these models either globally or locally. Ensuring the stability of ROMs can improve the interpretability of the behavior of the dynamics and help develop effective system control strategies. For quadratically nonlinear systems that represent many fluid flows, the Schlegel and Noack trapping theorem (JFM, 2015) can be used to check if ROMs are globally stable (long-term bounded). This theorem was subsequently incorporated into system identification techniques that determine models directly from data. In this work, we relax the quadratically energy-preserving constraints in this theorem, and then promote local stability in data-driven models of quadratically nonlinear dynamics. First, we prove a theorem outlining sufficient conditions to ensure local stability in linear-quadratic systems and provide an estimate of the stability radius. Second, we incorporate this theorem into system identification methods and produce a-priori locally stable data-driven models. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Human Expertise in Weighted Ensemble Simulations through Deep Learning based Information Bottleneck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Workflow-Centric Approach to Generating FAIR Data Objects for Computationally Generated Microstructure-Sensitive Mechanical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From a data perspective, the materials mechanics field is characterized by sparsity of available data, mainly due to the strong microstructure-sensitivity of properties like strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue limit. This requires testing specimens with different thermo-mechanical histories, even when the composition is similar. Experimental data on mechanical behavior is rare, as mechanical testing is destructive and requires significant material and effort. Furthermore, mechanical behavior is typically characterized in simplified tests under uniaxial loading conditions, whereas a complete characterization requires multiaxial testing. To address this data sparsity, simulation methods like micromechanical modeling can contribute to microstructure-sensitive data collections. This work introduces a novel data schema integrating both metadata and mechanical data, following the workflows of the material modeling processes by which the data has been generated. Each workflow run produces unique data objects by incorporating user, system, and job-specific information correlated with mechanical properties. This approach can be applied to any type of workflow as long as it is well-defined. This integrated format provides a sustainable way of generating Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data objects. The metadata elements focus on key features required to characterize microstructure-specific data, simplifying the collection of purpose-specific datasets by search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Petrov-Galerkin model reduction for thermochemical nonequilibrium gas mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-specific thermochemical collisional models are crucial to accurately describe the physics of systems involving nonequilibrium plasmas, but they are also computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale, multi-dimensional simulations. Historically, computational cost has been mitigated by using empirical and physics-based arguments to reduce the complexity of the governing equations. However, the resulting models are often inaccurate and they fail to capture the important features of the original physics. Additionally, the construction of these models is often impractical, as it requires extensive user supervision and time-consuming parameter tuning. In this paper, we address these issues through an easily-implementable and computationally-efficient model reduction pipeline based on the Petrov-Galerkin projection of the nonlinear kinetic equations. Our approach is justified by the observation that kinetic systems in thermal nonequilibrium tend to exhibit low-rank dynamics that rapidly drive the state towards a low-dimensional subspace. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear nature of the governing equations, we observe that the dynamics of these systems evolve on subspaces that can be accurately identified using the linearized equations about thermochemical equilibrium, which significantly reduce the cost associated with the construction of the model. The approach is demonstrated on a rovibrational collisional model for the O$_2$-O system, and a vibrational collisional model for the combined O$_2$-O and O$_2$-O$_2$ systems. Our method achieves high accuracy, with relative errors of less than 1% for macroscopic quantities (i.e., moments) and 10% for microscopic quantities (i.e., energy levels population), while also delivering excellent compression rates and speedups, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>HamLib: A library of Hamiltonians for benchmarking quantum algorithms and hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13126v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to characterize and benchmark computational hardware, software, and algorithms, it is essential to have many problem instances on-hand. This is no less true for quantum computation, where a large collection of real-world problem instances would allow for benchmarking studies that in turn help to improve both algorithms and hardware designs. To this end, here we present a large dataset of qubit-based quantum Hamiltonians. The dataset, called HamLib (for Hamiltonian Library), is freely available online and contains problem sizes ranging from 2 to 1000 qubits. HamLib includes problem instances of the Heisenberg model, Fermi-Hubbard model, Bose-Hubbard model, molecular electronic structure, molecular vibrational structure, MaxCut, Max-$k$-SAT, Max-$k$-Cut, QMaxCut, and the traveling salesperson problem. The goals of this effort are (a) to save researchers time by eliminating the need to prepare problem instances and map them to qubit representations, (b) to allow for more thorough tests of new algorithms and hardware, and (c) to allow for reproducibility and standardization across research studies.</description>

      <title>All-Electron Molecular Tunnel Ionization Based on the Weak-Field Asymptotic Theory in the Integral Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunnel ionization (TI) underlies many important ultrafast processes, such as high-harmonic generation and strong-field ionization. Among the existing theories for TI, many-electron weak-field asymptotic theory (ME-WFAT) is by design capable of accurately treating many-electron effects in TI. An earlier version of ME-WFAT relied on an accurate representation of the asymptotic tail of the orbitals, which hindered its implementation in Gaussian-basis-set-based quantum chemistry programs. In this work, we reformulate ME-WFAT in the integral representation, which makes the quality of the asymptotic tail much less critical, hence greatly facilitating its implementation in standard quantum chemistry packages. The integral reformulation introduced here is therefore much more robust when applied to molecules with arbitrary geometry. We present several case studies, among which is the CO molecule where some earlier theories disagree with experiments. Here, we find that ME-WFAT produces the largest ionization probability when the field points from C to O, as experiments suggest. An attractive feature of ME-WFAT is that it can be used with various types of multielectron methods whether of density functional [Phys. Rev. A 106, 052211 (2022)] or multiconfiguration types, this in turn facilitates tunnel ionization calculation in systems exhibiting a strong multireference character.</description>

      <title>Tensor-involved peridynamics: A unified framework for isotropic and anisotropic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce tensor involved peridynamics, a unified framework for simulating both isotropic and anisotropic materials. While traditional peridynamics models effectively simulate isotropic materials, they face challenges with anisotropic materials and are prone to instability caused by zero energy modes. Our novel model extend the linear bond based peridynamics framework by incorporating the elastic tensor into the micrmodulus function, thereby ensuring stability for anisotropic materials without the need for additional corrections. For isotropic materials. the model mantains compatibility with conventional bond based peridynamics, assuming Possion's rations of 1/4 in 3D and 1/3 in 2D.Numerical experiments confirm the model's stability and accuracy across various scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a damage model for isotropic materials. validating its performance in predicting crack propagation paths in a 2D plate. The results show superior alignment with experimental date compared to traditional model.</description>

      <title>Deep Multimodal Representation Learning for Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL), a technique most prominently used in natural language and computer vision, has been used to train informative representation spaces for galaxy spectra and images in a self-supervised manner. Following this idea, we implement CL for stars in the Milky Way, for which recent astronomical surveys have produced a huge amount of heterogeneous data. Specifically, we investigate Gaia XP coefficients and RVS spectra. Thus, the methods presented in this work lay the foundation for aggregating the knowledge implicitly contained in the multimodal data to enable downstream tasks like cross-modal generation or fused stellar parameter estimation. We find that CL results in a highly structured representation space that exhibits explicit physical meaning. Using this representation space to perform cross-modal generation and stellar label regression results in excellent performance with high-quality generated samples as well as accurate and precise label predictions.</description>

      <title>gSeaGen code by KM3NeT: an efficient tool to propagate muons simulated with CORSIKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration has tackled a common challenge faced by the astroparticle physics community, namely adapting the experiment-specific simulation software to work with the CORSIKA air shower simulation output. The proposed solution is an extension of the open-source code gSeaGen, allowing for the transport of muons generated by CORSIKA to a detector of any size at an arbitrary depth. The gSeaGen code was not only extended in terms of functionalities but also underwent a thorough redesign of the muon propagation routine, resulting in a more accurate and efficient simulation. This paper presents the capabilities of the new gSeaGen code as well as prospects for further developments.</description>
