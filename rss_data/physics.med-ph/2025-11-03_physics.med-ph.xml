      <title>Ultra-High Dose-Rates, the FLASH Effect, and Hydrogen Peroxide Yields: Do Experiments and Simulations Really Disagree?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation chemistry of model systems irradiated with ultra-high dose-rates (UHDR) is key to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the sparing of healthy tissue, which is called the FLASH effect. It is envisioned to be used for efficient treatment of cancer by FLASH radiotherapy. However, it seems that even the most simple model systems, water irradiated with varying dose-rates (DR), pose a challenge. This became evident, as differences within measured and predicted hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) yields (g-values) for exposure of liquid samples to conventional DR and UHDR were reported. Many of the recently reported values contradict older experiments and current Monte-Carlo simulations(MCS). In the present work, we aim to identify possible reasons of these discrepancies and propose ways to overcome this issue. Hereby a short review of recent and classical literature concerning experimental and simulational studies is performed. The studies cover different radiation sources, from gamma rays, high-energy electrons, heavy particles (protons and ions) with low and high linear energy transfer (LET), and samples of hypoxic &amp; oxygenated water, with cosolutes such as bovine-serum albumine (BSA). Results are for additional experimental parameters, such as solvent, sample container and analysis methods used to determine the respective g-values of H2O2. Similarly the parameter of the MCS by the step-by-step approach, or the independent-reaction time (IRT) method are discussed. Here, UHDR induced modification of the radical-radical interaction and dynamics, not governed by diffusion processes, may cause problems. Approaches to test these different models are highlighted to allow progress: by making the step from a purely descriptive discourse of the effects observed, towards testable models, which should clarify the reasons of how and why such a disagreement came to light in the first place.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mechanical Stimuli in Functionally Graded Bone Scaffolds Through Porosity Gradients: A Finite Element Analysis Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving an optimal biomechanical environment within bone scaffolds is critical for promoting tissue regeneration, particularly in load-bearing anatomical sites where rigid fixation can induce stress shielding and compromise healing. Functionally graded (FG) scaffolds, which incorporate controlled variations in porosity or material properties, have attracted significant attention as a strategy to mitigate stress shielding by promoting more favourable load transfer. In this study, the effects of porosity gradient magnitude (i.e., max-to-min ratio of porosity), gradient resolution, scaffold material properties, and fixation plate rigidity on the distribution of mechanical stimuli within FG scaffolds were systematically investigated. Finite element analyses (FEA) were conducted on a femoral segmental defect model stabilised with a bone plate, and multiple porosity gradient strategies were compared against a corresponding uniform scaffold composed of body-centred cubic (BCC) unit cells. Scaffolds composed of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), bioactive glass (45S5 Bio-glass), and polylactic acid (PLA) were evaluated to capture a range of material stiffnesses. Introducing porosity gradients consistently enhanced the mean octahedral shear strain within the scaffold, particularly in regions adjacent to the fixation plate affected by stress shielding. The magnitude of mechanical stimulus improvement increased with both greater porosity gradient magnitudes and higher gradient resolution. These improvements were more pronounced in stiffer materials, such as Ti-6Al-4V, emphasising the critical interplay between scaffold material properties and architectural design. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring both porosity profiles and material selection to optimise scaffold mechanics for bone regeneration.</description>

      <title>Dark-Field X-Ray Imaging Significantly Improves Deep-Learning based Detection of Synthetic Early-Stage Lung Tumors in Preclinical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer screening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack LDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer detection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of 26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI) radiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar microstructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly improve early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning segmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of euthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular boundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A U-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI, or a combination of ATTN and DFI channels. Results show that the DFI-only model achieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51 percent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus 92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent sensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially improves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation radiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose alternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is unavailable.</description>

      <title>PF-DAformer: Proximal Femur Segmentation via Domain Adaptive Transformer for Dual-Center QCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions. This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.</description>

      <title>Near-perfect efficiency in X-ray phase microtomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray microtomography at synchrotron sources is fundamentally limited by the high radiation dose applied to the samples, which restricts investigations to non-native tissue states and thereby compromises the biological relevance of the resulting data. The limitation stems from inefficient indirect detection schemes that require prolonged exposures. Efforts to extract additional contrast through multimodal techniques, like modulation-based imaging, worsen the problem by requiring multiple tomographic scans. In addition, the techniques suffer from low modulator pattern visibility, which reduces measurement efficiency and sensitivity. We address both the detection efficiency and modulation visibility challenges using a novel setup that combines an X-ray waveguide, a structured phase modulator, and a photon-counting detector. Our approach simultaneously achieves near-theoretical limits in both visibility (95%) and quantum efficiency (98%), thereby enabling dose-efficient multimodal microtomography at single-micrometer resolution. This advance will enable new classes of experiments on native-state biological specimens with the potential to advance biomedical research, disease diagnostics, and our understanding of tissue structure in physiological environments.</description>

      <title>Spatially Regularized Super-Resolved Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (SR$^2$-CSD) of Diffusion MRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) is widely used to estimate the white matter fiber orientation distribution (FOD) from diffusion MRI data. Its angular resolution depends on the maximum spherical harmonic order ($l_{max}$): low $l_{max}$ yields smooth but poorly resolved FODs, while high $l_{max}$, as in Super-CSD, enables resolving fiber crossings with small inter-fiber angles but increases sensitivity to noise. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce Spatially Regularized Super-Resolved CSD (SR$^2$-CSD), a novel method that regularizes Super-CSD using a spatial FOD prior estimated via a self-calibrated total variation denoiser. We evaluated SR$^2$-CSD against CSD and Super-CSD across four datasets: (i) the HARDI-2013 challenge numerical phantom, assessing angular and peak number errors across multiple signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels and CSD variants (single-/multi-shell, single-/multi-tissue); (ii) the Sherbrooke in vivo dataset, evaluating spatial coherence of FODs; (iii) a six-subject test-retest dataset acquired with both full (96 gradient directions) and subsampled (45 directions) protocols, assessing reproducibility; and (iv) the DiSCo phantom, evaluating tractography accuracy under varying SNR levels and multiple noise repetitions. Across all evaluations, SR$^2$-CSD consistently reduced angular and peak number errors, improved spatial coherence, enhanced test-retest reproducibility, and yielded connectivity matrices more strongly correlated with ground-truth. Most improvements were statistically significant under multiple-comparison correction. These results demonstrate that incorporating spatial priors into CSD is feasible, mitigates estimation instability, and improves FOD reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution positron emission tomography by intensity modulation: Proof of concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We proposed a new approach, which is inspired by the method of super-resolution (SR) structured illumination microscopy (SIM) for overcoming the resolution limit in microscopy due to diffraction of light, for increasing the resolution of clinical positron emission tomography (PET) beyond its instrumentation limit. We implemented the key idea behind SR-SIM by using a rotating intensity modulator in front of a stationary PET detector ring. Its function is to modulate down high-frequency signals of the projection data that originally were above the system's bandwidth and unobservable to appear as aliased lower-frequency ones that are detectable. We formulated a model that relates an image whose resolution is above the instrumentation limit to several thus obtained limited-resolution measurements at various rotational positions of the modulator. We implemented an ordered-subsets expectation-maximization algorithm for inverting the model. Using noise-free data produced by an analytic projector, we showed this approach can resolve 0.9 mm sources when applied to a PET system that employs 4.2 mm width detectors. With noisy data, the SR performance remains promising. In particular, 1.5 mm sources were resolvable, and the visibility and quantification of small sources and fine structures were improved despite the sensitivity loss incurred by the modulator. These observations remain valid when using more realistic Monte-Carlo simulation data. More studies are needed to better understand the theoretical aspects of the proposed method and to optimize the design of the modulator and the reconstruction algorithm.</description>
