      <title>Microscopic description of the liquid-gas coexistence curve for Morse fluids in the immediate vicinity of the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10725v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work is aimed at investigating the behavior of Morse fluids in the immediate vicinity of the critical point within the framework of a cell model. This region is of both fundamental and practical importance, yet presents analytical challenges due to the significant influence of order parameter fluctuations. An analytical procedure is developed to construct the upper part of the liquid-gas coexistence curve and calculate its diameter, incorporating the non-Gaussian (quartic) distribution of fluctuations. An explicit expression is derived for the temperature-dependent analytical term appearing in the expression for the rectilinear diameter. The numerical evaluation of the relevant quantities is carried out using Morse potential parameters representative of sodium. The coexistence curve is constructed both with and without the inclusion of the analytical temperature-dependent term in the calculation. A specific condition is identified under which the agreement between the presented binodal branches and Monte Carlo simulation data from other study, extrapolated to the immediate vicinity of the critical point, is improved. It is shown that better agreement is achieved when the analytical term is included in the calculation of the liquid branch and omitted in the gas branch. The proposed analytical approach may provide useful insight for the theoretical study of critical phenomena in more complex fluid systems.</description>

      <title>A Non-Markovian Route to Coherence in Heterogeneous Diffusive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal coherence-persistent alignment across time-can arise between agents with fundamentally distinct dynamics, a behavior that classical diffusion models (e.g., Brownian motion, fractional Brownian motion, generalized Langevin equation) are inherently limited in capturing, particularly under strong heterogeneity. We introduce the Coupled Memory Graph Process (CMGP), where dynamic interplay between internal memory and directed coupling enables synchronized behavior even in the absence of reciprocity. An active particle with long-range memory remains temporally coherent with a subdiffusive partner, despite mismatched scaling laws and asymmetric information flow. Bayesian optimization identifies a broad parameter regime supporting this phenomenon, characterized by a high State Persistence Index SPI. These results uncover a minimal mechanism for emergent coordination-a form of ghost coherence-that remains inaccessible to classical stochastic models, with implications for viscoelastic environments and heterogeneous active systems.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality dependence of diffusion-entropy scaling: Sensitivity to the diffusion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While entropy quantifies the volume of the accessible phase space, diffusion characterizes the rate of its exploration, capturing distinct yet interconnected aspects of a system's dynamics. In this Letter, we employ computer simulations to independently compute D and S for Lennard-Jones (LJ) liquid and water in two and three dimensions, and for water also in one dimension, across a broad range of thermodynamic states. We observe that the ratio of diffusion coefficients between two states exhibits a nearly perfect exponential dependence on their entropy difference. For LJ liquids, the prefactor of the exponential shows a strong dimensionality dependence, consistent in trend but quantitatively different from theoretical predictions. In contrast, water displays a remarkably weak dimensionality dependence, deviating from theoretical expectations, which we attribute to the dominant role of jump diffusion. Surprisingly, the exponential diffusion-entropy relationship persists even when translational and rotational contributions to entropy are considered separately, underscoring the robustness of the D-S relation across different degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Emergent Thermalization Thresholds in Unitary Dynamics of Inhomogeneously Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the avalanche scenario for many-body localization (MBL) instability, we reverse the conventional set-up and ask whether a large weakly-disordered chain can thermalize a smaller, strongly-disordered chain when the composite system evolves unitarily. Using transport as a dynamical probe, we identify three distinct thermalization regimes as a function of the disorder strength of the smaller chain: (i) complete thermalization with self-averaging at weak disorder, (ii) realization-dependent thermalization with strong sample-to-sample fluctuations at intermediate disorder, and (iii) absence of thermalization at strong disorder. We find that the non-self-averaging regime broadens with the size of the weakly-disordered chain, revealing a nuanced interplay between disorder and system size. These results highlight how inhomogeneous disorder can induce emergent thermalization thresholds in closed quantum systems, providing direct access to disorder regimes where thermalization or its absence can be reliably observed.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable many-body dynamics from space-time duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advances, both theoretical and experimental, in our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. Given this problem's high complexity, it is surprising that a substantial amount of this progress can be ascribed to exact analytical results. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results in quantum many-body dynamics. Dual-unitary circuits constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified, allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. Dual-unitarity is a specific fruitful implementation of the more general idea of space-time duality in which the roles of space and time are exchanged to access relevant dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A differential equation for a class of correlation kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new differential equation is derived for an object ${\widehat S}(E,E^\prime,x)$, which when integrated over the appropriate range in $x$, yields the kernel $K(E,E^\prime)$ with which $n$-point correlation functions can be computed in a wide class of models. When $E{=}E^\prime$, the equation reduces to the equation for the diagonal resolvent ${\widehat R}(E,x)$ of the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian ${H}{=}{-}\hbar^2\partial_x^2{+}u(x)$ that is familiar from the classic work of Gel'fand and Dikii, and which appears in many areas of physics. This more general equation may also prove to be useful in a wide range of applications. Some special cases relevant to random matrix theory are explored using analytical and numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Delayed Active Swimmer in a Velocity Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled active particles exhibit delayed responses to environmental changes, modulating their propulsion speed through intrinsic sensing and feedback mechanisms. This adaptive behavior fundamentally determines their dynamics and self-organization in active matter systems, with implications for biological microswimmers and engineered microrobots. Here, we investigate active Brownian particles whose propulsion speed is governed by spatially varying activity landscapes, incorporating a temporal delay between environmental sensing and speed adaptation. Through analytical solutions derived for both short-time and long-time delay regimes, we demonstrate that steady-state density and polarization profiles exhibit maxima at characteristic delays. Significantly, we observe that the polarization profile undergoes sign reversal when the swimming distance during the delay time exceeds the characteristic diffusion length, providing a novel mechanism for controlling particle transport without external fields. Our theoretical predictions, validated through experimental observations and numerical simulations, establish time delay as a crucial control parameter for particle transport and organization in active matter systems. These findings provide insights into how biological microorganisms might use response delays to gain navigation advantages and suggest design principles for synthetic microswimmers with programmable responses to heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic expressions for steady-state distribution and static responses in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental questions in population dynamics is how biological populations respond to environmental perturbations. In population dynamics, the mean fitness and the fraction of a trait in the steady state are important because they indicate how well the trait and the population adapt to the environment. In this study, we examine the parallel mutation-reproduction model, which is one of the simplest models of an evolvable population. As an extension of the Markov chain tree theorem, we derive diagrammatic expressions for the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution of the population. For the parallel mutation-reproduction model, we consider self-loops, which represent trait reproduction and are excluded from the Markov chain tree theorem for the linear master equation. To generalize the theorem, we introduce the concept of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests, which generalize spanning trees with loops. We demonstrate that the weights of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests yield the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution. Our results provide exact expressions for the static responses and the steady-state distribution. Additionally, we discuss approximations of these expressions in cases where reproduction or mutation is dominant. We provide numerical examples to illustrate these approximations and exact expressions.</description>

      <title>Universality of noise-induced transitions in nonlinear voter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the universality classes of phase transitions in a variety of nonlinear voter models. By mapping several models with symmetric absorbing states onto a canonical model introduced in previous studies, we confirm that they exhibit a Generalized Voter (GV) transition. We then propose a canonical mean-field model that extends the original formulation by incorporating a noise term that eliminates the absorbing states. This generalization gives rise to a phase diagram featuring two distinct types of phase transitions: a continuous Ising transition and a discontinuous transition we call Modified Generalized Voter (MGV). These two transition lines converge at a tricritical point. We map diverse noisy nonlinear voter models onto this extended canonical form. Using finite-size scaling techniques above and below the upper critical dimension, we show that the continuous transition of these models belongs to the Ising universality class in their respective dimensionality. We also find universal behavior at the tricitical point. Our results provide a unifying framework for classifying phase transitions in stochastic models of opinion dynamics with both nonlinearity and noise.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive exploration of interaction networks reveals a connection between entanglement and network structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are typically studied assuming translational symmetry in the interaction network. Recent experimental advances in various platforms for quantum simulators have enabled the realization of irregular interaction networks, which are intractable to implement with conventional crystal lattices. Another hallmark of these advances is the ability to observe the time-dependent behaviour of quantum many-body systems. However, the relationship between irregular interaction networks and quantum many-body dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the connection between the structure of the interaction network and the eigenstate entanglement of the quantum Ising model by exploring all possible interaction networks up to seven spins. We find that the eigenstate entanglement depends on the structure of the Hilbert space diagram, particularly the structure of the equienergy subgraph. We further reveal a correlation linking the structure of the Hilbert space diagram to the number of unconstrained spin pairs. Our results demonstrate that the minimum eigenstate entanglement of the quantum Ising model is governed by the specific structure of the interaction network. We anticipate that our findings provide a starting point for exploring quantum many-body systems with arbitrary interactions and finite system size. Moreover, our approach may be applicable to other quantum many-body systems, such as the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable dissipative dynamics and one-form strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting two-dimensional spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting "gamma-matrix" spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. We however identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.</description>

Abstract: As a simplified description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of buckled dimers on the Si(001) surface, we consider the anisotropic 2D Ising model and study the freezing of spatial correlations during a cooling quench across the critical point. Depending on the cooling rate, we observe a crossover from 1D to 2D behavior. For rapid cooling, we find effectively 1D behavior in the strongly coupled direction, for which we provide an exact analytic solution of the non-equilibrium dynamics. For slower cooling rates, we start to see 2D behavior where our numerical simulations show an approach to the usual Kibble-Zurek scaling in 2D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that unconventional relaxation dynamics of special initial states in one-dimensional arrays of Rydberg atoms produce non-generic decay of the initial-state survival probability (SP) at very early times. Using the PXP hamiltonian as a minimal model of the Rydberg blockade, we prove that the early-time SP for states exhibiting quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) decays at a characteristic rate, whose finite-size scaling is determined solely by scars. We numerically investigate the effects of both revival-enhancing and ergodicity-restoring deformations of the PXP hamiltonian and find results consistent with the limiting cases of integrable and ergodic dynamics, respectively. We moreover argue that such unconventional early relaxation of scarred initial states is characteristic of a whole class of QMBS models. Since the SP can be easily measured experimentally, our findings enable us to probe the presence of scars at time scales much shorter than that of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Learning transitions in classical Ising models and deformed toric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a learning transition, having signatures in the long distance behavior of conditional correlation functions, in the two-dimensional classical Ising model. This transition, which arises when learning local energy densities, extends all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model for learning also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our methods can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Simulation of 1D Long-Range Interacting Systems at Any Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method can be applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transition and underlying symmetry breaking via entanglement entropy scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement takes a key role in quantum physics while how much information it can extract from many-body systems is still an open question, particularly for quantum criticalities and emergent symmetries. In this work, we systematically study the entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative (DEE) near quantum phase transitions in various quantum many-body systems. An exact one-parameter scaling relation between the DEE and system size at the critical point has been derived for the first time, which successfully obtains the critical exponent via data collapse. What's more, we find that the EE peaks at the (emergent) symmetry-enhanced first-order transition which reflects higher symmetry breaking. This work provides a new paradigm for quantum many-body research from the perspective of EE and DEE.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant electromagnetic responses in superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge invariance is essential for making physically meaningful predictions. In superconductors, mean-field Hamiltonians that explicitly break $U(1)$ symmetry often yield gauge-dependent results. While this issue has been resolved for linear responses in conventional superconductors, a unified framework that also covers unconventional superconductors and nonlinear responses has yet to be established. In this study, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework that enables gauge-invariant calculations of electromagnetic responses at arbitrary orders in external fields, applicable to both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Our construction generalizes the consistent-fluctuation-of-the-order-parameter (CFOP) approach to full photon vertices and admits a diagrammatic representation of the response kernel in terms of Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Atomistic mechanisms of viscosity in 2D liquid-like fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in fluid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its microscopic mechanisms at the individual particle kinetic level remain a subject of ongoing research, specially in dense systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple fluids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in the dense liquid-like regime in all the 2D fluids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D fluids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D fluids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.</description>

      <title>Antifragility and response to damage in the synchronization of oscillators on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework to assess the impact of damage, defined as the reduction of weight in a specific link, on identical oscillator systems governed by the Kuramoto model and coupled through weighted networks. We analyze how weight modifications in a single link affect the system when its global function is to achieve the synchronization of coupled oscillators starting from random initial phases. We introduce different measures that allow the identification of cases where damage enhances synchronization (antifragile response), deteriorates it (fragile response), or has no significant impact. Using numerical solutions of the Kuramoto model, we investigate the effects of damage on network links where antifragility emerges. Our analysis includes lollipop graphs of varying sizes and a comprehensive evaluation and all the edges of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. The approach is general and can be applied to study antifragility in other oscillator systems with different coupling mechanisms, offering a pathway for the quantitative exploration of antifragility in diverse complex systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete time quasi-crystal in Rydberg atomic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete time quasi-crystals are non-equilibrium quantum phenomena with quasi-periodic order in the time dimension, and are an extension of the discrete time-crystal phase. As a natural platform to explore the non-equilibrium phase of matter, the Rydberg atomic array has implemented the quantum simulation of the discrete-time crystal phase, associated with quantum many-body scar state. However, the existence of discrete time quasi-crystal on the Rydberg cold atom experiment platform has yet to be conceived. Here, we propose a method to generate the discrete time quasi-crystal behavior by coupling two discrete time-crystals, where associated two external driving frequencies have the maximum incommensurability. While we analysis its robustness and compute the phase diagram of corresponding observables. We significantly calculate the entanglement entropy between two parts of the system. Remarkably, we find the emergence of the aperiodic response is indeed caused by interaction between systems via Rydberg blockade effect. Our method thus offers the possibilities to explore the novel phases in quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lifshitz points in an altermagnetic metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.</description>
