      <title>Geophysical flows over topography, a playground for laboratory experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physicists face major challenges in modelling multi-scale phenomena that are observed in geophysical flows (e.g. in the Earth's oceans and atmosphere, or liquid planetary cores). In particular, complexities arise because geophysical fluids are rotating and subject to density variations, but also because the fluid boundaries have complex geometries (e.g. the ocean floor) with wavelengths ranging from metres to thousands of kilometres. Dynamical models of planetary fluid layers are thus often constrained by observations, whose interpretation necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics. To this end, geophysical studies often combine cutting-edge experiments across a wide range of parameters, together with theory and numerical simulations, to derive predictive scaling laws applicable for planetary settings. In this review, we discuss experimental efforts that have contributed to our understanding of geophysical flows with topography. More specifically, we focus on (i) the flow response to mechanical (orbital) forcings in the presence of a large-scale (ellipsoidal) topography, (ii) some effects of small-scale topography onto bulk flows and boundary-layer dynamics, and (iii) the interaction between convection and roughness. The geophysical context is briefly introduced for each case, and some experimental perspectives are drawn.</description>

      <title>Interface reconstruction of adhering droplets for distortion correction using glare points and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow within adhering droplets subjected to external shear flows has a significant influence on the stability and eventual detachment of the droplets from the surface. Most commonly, the velocity field inside adhering droplets is measured by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV), which requires a correction step for distortion caused by refraction of light at the gas-liquid interface. Current methods for distortion correction based on ray tracing are limited to low external flow velocities. However, the ray-tracing method can be extended to arbitrarily deformed droplet shapes if the instantaneous three-dimensional droplet interface is availble. In the present work, a previously introduced method for the image-based reconstruction of gas-liquid interfaces by means of deep learning is adapted to determine the instantaneous interface of adhering droplets in external shear flows. In this regard, a purposefully developed optical measurement technique based on the shadowgraphy method is employed that encodes additional three-dimensional (3D) information of the interface in the images via glare points from lateral light sources. On the basis of the images recorded in the experiments, the volumetric shape of the droplet is reconstructed by a neural network that was trained on the spatio-temporal dynamics of the gas-liquid interface from a synthetic dataset obtained by numerical simulation. The results for experiments with adhering droplets at different velocities of external flow demonstrate that the combination of the learned droplet geometry with the depth encoding through the glare points facilitates a robust and flexible reconstruction. The proposed method reconstructs the instantaneous three-dimensional interface of adhering droplets at both high resolution and spatial accuracy and thereby enables the distortion correction of PIV measurements at high external flow velocities.</description>

      <title>Investigation of coalescence and pinch-off processes of a self-rewetting drop interacting with a liquid layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-rewetting fluids (SRFs), such as long-chain aqueous alcohols, are a special class of liquids with surface tension that is anomalously dependent quadratically on temperature, resulting in thermocapillary flows that differ significantly from those in normal fluids (NFs). This study focuses on investigating the behavior of SRF drops interacting with a liquid layer under nonuniform heating conditions. In this regard, we employ a robust central moment-based lattice Boltzmann method with a phase-field model expressed in an axisymmetric formulation to capture three-dimensional effects efficiently. We investigate the coalescence and pinch-off processes in SRFs and compare them to those in NFs. Our simulations reveal that SRFs undergo pinch-off earlier than NFs. We also observe that increasing the Ohnesorge number Oh suppresses the pinch-off process, highlighting the relative role of viscous forces, which is modulated by gravity effects or the Bond number Bo. Furthermore, we explore how varying the dimensionless linear and quadratic sensitivity coefficients of surface tension on temperature, M1 and M2, respectively, and the dimensionless heat flux Q influence the coalescence/pinch-off behavior. Interestingly, contrary to the behavior in NFs, in SRFs increasing M2, or Q reduces the time required to pinch-off and widens the region in the Oh-Bo regime map where pinch-off occurs, when compared to the unheated cases. These differences are shown to be due to the variations in the thermocapillary forces on the interface. Overall, we find that under nonuniform heating, the SRFs enhance the pinch-off process compared to NFs across a wider range of conditions.</description>

      <title>Turbulence modeling over riblets via domain transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical and experimental studies have demonstrated the drag-reducing potential of carefully designed streamwise-elongated riblets in lowering skin-friction drag. To support the systematic design of such surface corrugations, recent efforts have integrated simplified versions of the governing equations with innovative methods for representing the effects of rough boundaries on flow dynamics. Notably, the statistical response of the eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearized Navier-Stokes equations has been shown to effectively capture the ability of riblets in suppressing turbulence, quantify the influence of background turbulence on the mean velocity, and reproduce established drag-reduction trends. In this paper, we enhance the flexibility and computational efficiency of this simulation-free approach by implementing a domain transformation for surface representation, along with a perturbation analysis on a small geometric parameter of the riblets. While domain transformation complicates the differential equations, it provides accurate boundary representations and facilitates the analysis of complex riblet shapes at high Reynolds numbers by enabling perturbation analysis to simplify the dimensional complexity of the governing equations. Our method successfully predicts drag reduction trends for semi-circular riblets, consistent with existing literature. We further utilize our framework to investigate flow mechanisms influenced by riblets and extend our study to channel flows with friction Reynolds numbers up to 2003. Our findings reveal the emergence of Kelvin-Helmholtz rollers over large and sharp semi-circular riblets, contributing to the degradation of drag reduction in these geometries. Additionally, we examine the impact of riblets on near-wall flow structures, focusing on their suppression of streamwise-elongated structures in flows over large riblets.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional reconstructions of capillary flows and objects using Spatio-Temporal Phase Shifting Profilometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental technique to characterize the free surface of capillary flows adapted from the Spatio-Temporal Phase Shifting Profilometry (ST-PSP) method introduced by Ri et al. (Journal of Optics, 2019) for solid bodies. The present study is focused on various regimes of capillary flows over inclined surfaces, including drops, rivulets, meanders, and braided films. A calibration process is carried out using a solid wedge to determine the optical distances required for the phase-to-height relationship. The optimal dye concentration necessary for accurately reconstructing the free surface of a dyed water flow is explored. The ST-PSP method is then applied to profile different liquid flows and objects, achieving large signal-to-noise ratios across all experiments. Notably, the analysis of a sessile droplet shows a promising correlation between the ST-PSP results and side-view visualizations, as evidenced by the accurate recovery of its apparent contact angle. Furthermore, free surface reconstructions of rivulet flows exhibit good agreement with the theoretical predictions of Duffy and Moffatt (The Chemical Engineering Journal and the Biochemical Engineering Journal, 1995). These results suggest that the ST-PSP method is highly effective for obtaining accurate height maps of capillary flows and objects, making it a valuable tool for validating theoretical models in the future.</description>

      <title>Predicting the dynamics of a gas pocket during breaking wave impacts using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03641v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility and accuracy of a machine learning model to predict the dynamics of a gas pocket that is formed when a breaking wave impacts on a solid wall. The proposed ML model is based on the convolutional long short-term memory structure and is trained with experimental data. In particular, it takes as input two high-speed camera snapshots before impact and produces as output six scalars that describe the dynamics of the gas pocket. The experiments are performed in a wave flume, where we use solitons -- in combination with a bathymetry profile -- to generate wave breaking close to a solid wall which is instrumented with dynamic pressure sensors. By varying the water depth $h_\ell$ and the parameter $\alpha = A/h_\ell$, where $A$ is the soliton wave amplitude, we are able to generate a family of unique breaking waves with different gas pocket sizes and wave kinematics. In this so-called phase space of wave generation ($h_\ell$, $\alpha$), we perform experiments on 67 different wave states that form our dataset. Experimentally, we find that the frequency of oscillation of the gas pocket can be attributed to the initial volume of gas plus a geometric correction and that the maximum and minimum pressures are qualitatively well captured by the one-dimensional Bagnold model. In terms of the ML model, we compare its performance to the experimental data and find that the model quantitatively reproduces the trends found in the experiments -- in particular for the maximum and minimum pressure in the gas pocket and the frequency of oscillation.</description>

      <title>A mixing length model for arbitrary geometry: the case of parallel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological model for the mixing length used in turbulence models. It has the advantage of naturally accounting for the object's geometry while satisfying the standard symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations. We employ the model to study channel flow and pipe flow. We calibrate the three model parameters to recover the damping in the viscous sub-layer, the log-law of the wall, and the outer region behaviors. Our model compares favorably to friction factor measurements in the pipe flow at high Reynolds numbers and gives analytical predictions of the mixing length for several canonical flows.</description>

      <title>Modelling anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard equation with the lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard equation is often used to model the formation of faceted pyramids on nanoscale crystal surfaces. In comparison to the isotropic Cahn-Hilliard model, the nonlinear terms associated with strong anisotropic coefficients present challenges for developing an effective numerical scheme. In this work, we propose a multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method to solve the anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard equation. To this end, we reformulate the original equation into a nonlinear convection-diffusion equation with source terms. Then the modified equilibrium distribution function and source terms are incorporated into the computations. Through Chapman-Enskog analysis, it successfully recovers the macroscopic governing equation. To validate the proposed approach, we perform numerical simulations, including cases like droplet deformation and spinodal decomposition. These results consistent with available works, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate that the model adheres to the energy dissipation law, further highlighting the effectiveness of the developed lattice Boltzmann method.</description>

      <title>Ribbing patterns in inertial rotary drag-out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report pattern formation in an otherwise non-uniform and unsteady flow arising in high-speed liquid entrainment conditions on the outer wall of a wide rotating drum. We show that the coating flow in this rotary drag-out undergoes axial modulations to form an array of roughly vertical thin liquid sheets which slowly drift from the middle of the drum towards its side walls. Thus, the number of sheets fluctuate in time such that the most probable rib spacing varies ever so slightly with the speed, and a little less weakly with the viscosity. We propose that these axial patterns are generated due to a primary instability driven by an adverse pressure gradient in the meniscus region of the rotary drag-out flow, similar to the directional Saffman-Taylor instability, as is well-known for ribbing in film-splitting flows. Rib spacing based on this mechanistic model turns out to be proportional to the capillary length, wherein the scaling factor can be determined based on existing models for film entrainment at both low and large Capillary numbers. In addition, we performed Direct Numerical Simulations, which reproduce the experimental phenomenology and the associated wavelength. We further include two numerical cases wherein either the liquid density, or the liquid surface tension are quadrupled while keeping all other parameters identical with experiments. The rib spacings of these cases are in agreement with the predictions of our model.</description>

      <title>Stabilising effect of generic anomalous diffusion independent of the Rayleigh number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the influence of a generic anomalous diffusion model on mass convection in a fluid-saturated porous medium, focusing on superdiffusive regimes. A mathematical model is developed, and tability analyses - both linear and nonlinear - are performed. Results demonstrate that the specific form of the time function describing anomalous diffusion significantly affects system stability, allowing stability to persist beyond the classical Rayleigh-B\'enard neutral threshold. Furthermore, transient perturbation growth is observed under certain conditions, followed by eventual decay. The paper systematically examines various memory functions, including power-law, exponential, and logarithmic forms, highlighting their impact on the dynamics of disturbances. The findings underscore the importance of anomalous diffusion in modulating stability and provide new insights into the transient behaviours induced by non-Fickian mass transport.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Optimal Stern Shape with Convolutional Neural Network-based Pressure Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hull form designing is an iterative process wherein the performance of the hull form needs to be checked via computational fluid dynamics calculations or model experiments. The stern shape has to undergo a process wherein the hull form variations from the pressure distribution analysis results are repeated until the resistance and propulsion efficiency meet the design requirements. In this study, the designer designed a pressure distribution that meets the design requirements; this paper proposes an inverse design algorithm that estimates the stern shape using deep learning. A convolutional neural network was used to extract the features of the pressure distribution expressed as a contour, whereas a multi-task learning model was used to estimate various sections of the stern shape. We estimated the stern shape indirectly by estimating the control point of the B-spline and comparing the actual and converted offsets for each section; the performance was verified, and an inverse design is proposed herein</description>

      <title>Method of data forward generation with partial differential equations for machine learning modeling in fluid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) for fluid mechanics has become attractive topic. High-fidelity data is one of most critical issues for the successful applications of AI in fluid mechanics, however, it is expensively obtained or even inaccessible. This study proposes a high-efficient data forward generation method from the partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, the solutions of the PDEs are first generated either following a random field (e.g. Gaussian random field, GRF, computational complexity O(NlogN), N is the number of spatial points) or physical laws (e.g. a kind of spectra, computational complexity O(NM), M is the number of modes), then the source terms, boundary conditions and initial conditions are computed to satisfy PDEs. Thus, the data pairs of source terms, boundary conditions and initial conditions with corresponding solutions of PDEs can be constructed. A Poisson neural network (Poisson-NN) embedded in projection method and a wavelet transform convolutional neuro network (WTCNN) embedded in multigrid numerical simulation for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is respectively proposed. The feasibility of generated data for training Poisson-NN and WTCNN is validated. The results indicate that even without any DNS data, the generated data can train these two models with excellent generalization and accuracy. The data following physical laws can significantly improve the convergence rate, generalization and accuracy than that generated following GRF.</description>

      <title>Low-Order Flow Reconstruction and Uncertainty Quantification in Disturbed Aerodynamics Using Sparse Pressure Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel machine-learning framework for reconstructing low-order gust-encounter flow field and lift coefficients from sparse, noisy surface pressure measurements. Our study thoroughly investigates the time-varying response of sensors to gust-airfoil interactions, uncovering valuable insights into optimal sensor placement. To address uncertainties in deep learning predictions, we implement probabilistic regression strategies to model both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Epistemic uncertainty, reflecting the model's confidence in its predictions, is modeled using Monte Carlo dropout, as an approximation to the variational inference in the Bayesian framework, treating the neural network as a stochastic entity. On the other hand, aleatoric uncertainty, arising from noisy input measurements, is captured via learned statistical parameters, which propagates measurement noise through the network into the final predictions. Our results showcase the efficacy of this dual uncertainty quantification strategy in accurately predicting aerodynamic behavior under extreme conditions while maintaining computational efficiency, underscoring its potential to improve online sensor-based flow estimation in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Optimization for the Evolve-Filter-Relax regularization of convection-dominated flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical stabilization techniques are often employed in under-resolved simulations of convection-dominated flows to improve accuracy and mitigate spurious oscillations. Specifically, the Evolve-Filter-Relax (EFR) algorithm is a framework which consists in evolving the solution, applying a filtering step to remove high-frequency noise, and relaxing through a convex combination of filtered and original solutions. The stability and accuracy of the EFR solution strongly depend on two parameters, the filter radius $\delta$ and the relaxation parameter $\chi$. Standard choices for these parameters are usually fixed in time, and related to the full order model setting, i.e., the grid size for $\delta$ and the time step for $\chi$. This paper makes two significant improvements to the standard EFR framework by proposing: (i) time-dependent parameters, (ii) data-driven adaptive optimization of the parameters in time, considering a fully-resolved simulation as a reference. In particular, we propose three different classes of Optimized-EFR strategies, aiming to optimize one or both parameters. Moreover, we investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed optimization algorithms considering different objective functions, both local (point-valued) and global (such as the kinetic energy). The new Optimized-EFR strategies are tested in the under-resolved simulation of a turbulent flow past a cylinder at $Re=1000$. The new Optimized-EFR results are more accurate than the standard EFR solution while maintaining a similar computational time. In particular, we show that using a global objective function and including the $H^1$ velocity seminorm is crucial to accurately match the reference flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Numerical wetting benchmarks -- advancing the plicRDF-isoAdvector unstructured Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method</title>

Abstract: The numerical simulation of wetting and dewetting of geometrically complex surfaces benefits from unstructured numerical methods because they discretize the domain with second-order accuracy. A recently developed unstructured geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method, the plicRDF-isoAdvector method, is chosen to investigate wetting processes because of its volume conservation property and high computational efficiency. The present work verifies and validates the plicRDF-isoAdvector method for wetting problems. We present four verification studies. The first study investigates the accuracy of the interface advection near walls. The method is further investigated for the spreading of droplets on a flat and a spherical surface, respectively, for which excellent agreement with the reference solutions is obtained. Furthermore, a 2D capillary rise is considered, and a benchmark comparison based on results from previous work is performed. The benchmark suite, input data, and Jupyter Notebooks used in this study are publicly available to facilitate further research and comparison with other numerical codes.</description>

      <title>An unstructured geometrical un-split VOF method for viscoelastic two-phase flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since viscoelastic two-phase flows arise in various industrial and natural processes, developing accurate and efficient software for their detailed numerical simulation is a highly relevant and challenging research task. We present a geometrical unstructured Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method for handling two-phase flows with viscoelastic liquid phase, where the latter is modeled via generic rate-type constitutive equations and a one-field description is derived by conditional volume averaging of the local instantaneous bulk equations and interface jump conditions. The method builds on the plicRDF-isoAdvector geometrical VOF solver that is extended and combined with the modular framework DeboRheo for viscoelastic computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A piecewise-linear geometrical interface reconstruction technique on general unstructured meshes is employed for discretizing the viscoelastic stresses across the fluid interface. DeboRheo facilitates a flexible combination of different rheological models with appropriate stabilization methods to address the high Weissenberg number problem.</description>

      <title>Chemical Timescale Effects on Detonation Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of detonation-containing flows have emerged as crucial tools for designing next-generation power and propulsion devices. As these tools mature, it is important for the combustion community to properly understand and isolate grid resolution effects when simulating detonations. To this end, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of the numerical convergence of unsteady detonation simulations, with focus on isolating the impacts of chemical timescale modifications on convergence characteristics in the context of operator splitting. With the aid of an adaptive mesh refinement based flow solver, the convergence analysis is conducted using two kinetics configurations: (1) a simplified three-step model mechanism, in which chemical timescales in the detonation are modified by adjusting activation energies, and (2) a detailed hydrogen mechanism, in which chemical timescales are adjusted through ambient pressure modifications. The convergence of unsteady self-sustained detonations in one-dimensional channels is then analyzed with reference to steady-state theoretical baseline solutions using these mechanisms. The goal of the analysis is to provide a detailed comparison of the effects of grid resolution on both macroscopic (peak pressures and detonation wave speeds) and microscopic (detonation wave structure) quantities of interest, drawing connections between the deviations from steady-state baselines and minimum chemical timescales. This work uncovers resolution-dependent unsteady detonation regimes, and highlights the important role played by not only the chemical timescales, but also the ratio between chemical timescale and induction time in the detonation wave structure on simulation convergence properties.</description>

      <title>The onset of nonpenetrative convection in a suddenly cooled layer of fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditions for the onset of nonpenetrative convection in a horizontal Boussinesq fluid layer subject to a step change in temperature are studied using propagation theory. A wide range of Prandtl numbers and two different kinematic boundary conditions are considered. It is shown that for high Rayleigh numbers, critical conditions for the onset of convective motion reproduce exactly those for the unsteady Rayleigh-B\'enard instability. Present results extend those of previous research and show a tendency of the rigid-rigid and free-rigid critical curves to converge for low Prandtl numbers. Comparison between present and previously reported results on critical conditions for the onset of instabilities and onset time using different methods yields good agreement on a middle to high Prandtl number range. A ratio of 10 between experimentally measured and theoretically predicted onset times is suggested for stress-free bounded systems.</description>

      <title>Inconsistencies in Unstructured Geometric Volume-of-Fluid Methods for Two-Phase Flows with High Density Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric flux-based Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) methods are widely considered consistent in handling two-phase flows with high density ratios. However, although the conservation of mass and momentum is consistent for two-phase incompressible single-field Navier-Stokes equations without phase-change, discretization may easily introduce small inconsistencies that result in very large errors or catastrophic failure. We apply the consistency conditions derived for the unstructured Level Set / Front Tracking method to flux-based geometric VOF methods, and implement our discretization into the plicRDF-isoAdvector geometrical VOF method. We find that computing the mass flux by scaling the geometrically computed fluxed phase-specific volume destroys the equivalence between the scaled volume fraction equation and the mass conservation equation, depending on the choice for the temporal and convective term discretization schemes. We propose two solutions. First, based on the analysis of discretization errors, we suggest a consistent combination of the temporal discretization scheme and the interpolation scheme for the momentum convection term. Second, similar to our previous work on the unstructured Level Set / Front Tracking method, we solve an auxiliary mass conservation equation with a geometrical calculation of the face-centered density. We prove the equivalence between these two approaches mathematically and verify and validate their numerical stability for density ratios in the range $[1,10^6]$ and viscosity ratios in the range $[10^2,10^5]$.</description>
