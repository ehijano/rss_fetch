      <title>Speech Slytherin: Examining the Performance and Efficiency of Mamba for Speech Separation, Recognition, and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is too early to conclude that Mamba is a better alternative to transformers for speech before comparing Mamba with transformers in terms of both performance and efficiency in multiple speech-related tasks. To reach this conclusion, we propose and evaluate three models for three tasks: Mamba-TasNet for speech separation, ConMamba for speech recognition, and VALL-M for speech synthesis. We compare them with transformers of similar sizes in performance, memory, and speed. Our Mamba or Mamba-transformer hybrid models show comparable or higher performance than their transformer counterparts: Sepformer, Conformer, and VALL-E. They are more efficient than transformers in memory and speed for speech longer than a threshold duration, inversely related to the resolution of a speech token. Mamba for separation is the most efficient, and Mamba for recognition is the least. Further, we show that Mamba is not more efficient than transformer for speech shorter than the threshold duration and performs worse in models that require joint modeling of text and speech, such as cross or masked attention of two inputs. Therefore, we argue that the superiority of Mamba or transformer depends on particular problems and models.

      <title>A Streaming Multi-Channel End-to-End Speech Recognition System with Realistic Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently multi-channel end-to-end (ME2E) ASR systems have emerged. While streaming single-channel end-to-end ASR has been extensively studied, streaming ME2E ASR is limited in exploration. Additionally, recent studies call attention to the gap between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) tests and doing realistic evaluations. This paper focuses on two research problems: realizing streaming ME2E ASR and improving OOD generalization. We propose the CUSIDE-array method, which integrates the recent CUSIDE methodology (Chunking, Simulating Future Context and Decoding) into the neural beamformer approach of ME2E ASR. It enables streaming processing of both front-end and back-end with a total latency of 402ms. The CUSIDE-array ME2E models are shown to achieve superior streaming results in both ID and OOD tests. Realistic evaluations confirm the advantage of CUSIDE-array in its capability to consume single-channel data to improve OOD generalization via back-end pre-training and ME2E fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Speech-Copilot: Leveraging Large Language Models for Speech Processing via Task Decomposition, Modularization, and Program Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Speech-Copilot, a modular framework for instruction-oriented speech-processing tasks that minimizes human effort in toolset construction. Unlike end-to-end methods using large audio-language models, Speech-Copilot builds speech processing-specific toolsets by analyzing pre-collected task instructions and breaking tasks into manageable sub-tasks. It features a flexible agent based on large language models that performs tasks through program generation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Dynamic-SUPERB benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse speech-processing tasks. Key contributions include: 1) developing an innovative framework for speech processing-specific toolset construction, 2) establishing a high-performing agent based on large language models, and 3) offering a new perspective on addressing challenging instruction-oriented speech-processing tasks. Without additional training processes required by end-to-end approaches, our method provides a flexible and extendable solution for a wide range of speech-processing applications.</description>

      <title>The feasibility of sound zone control using an array of parametric array loudspeakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric array loudspeakers (PALs) are known for producing highly directional audio beams, a feat more challenging to achieve with conventional electro-dynamic loudspeakers (EDLs). Due to their intrinsic physical mechanisms, PALs hold promising potential for spatial audio applications such as virtual reality (VR). However, the feasibility of using an array of PALs for sound zone control (SZC) has remained unexplored, mainly due to the complexity of the nonlinear demodulation process inherent in PALs. Leveraging recent advancements in PAL modeling, this work proposes an optimization algorithm to achieve the acoustic contrast control (ACC) between two target areas using a PAL array. The performance and robustness of the proposed ACC-based SZC using PAL arrays are investigated through simulations, and the results are compared with those obtained using EDL arrays. The results show that the PAL array outperforms the EDL array in SZC performance and robustness at higher frequencies and lower signal-to-noise ratio, while being comparable under other conditions. This work paves the way for high-contrast acoustic control using PAL arrays.</description>

      <title>Advancing Continual Learning for Robust Deepfake Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of new spoofing attacks poses an increasing challenge to audio security. Current detection methods often falter when faced with unseen spoofing attacks. Traditional strategies, such as retraining with new data, are not always feasible due to extensive storage. This paper introduces a novel continual learning method Continual Audio Defense Enhancer (CADE). First, by utilizing a fixed memory size to store randomly selected samples from previous datasets, our approach conserves resources and adheres to privacy constraints. Additionally, we also apply two distillation losses in CADE. By distillation in classifiers, CADE ensures that the student model closely resembles that of the teacher model. This resemblance helps the model retain old information while facing unseen data. We further refine our model's performance with a novel embedding similarity loss that extends across multiple depth layers, facilitating superior positive sample alignment. Experiments conducted on the ASVspoof2019 dataset show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Improving Neural Biasing for Contextual Speech Recognition by Early Context Injection and Text Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research suggests that automatic speech recognition (ASR) models can benefit from additional contexts (e.g., contact lists, user specified vocabulary). Rare words and named entities can be better recognized with contexts. In this work, we propose two simple yet effective techniques to improve context-aware ASR models. First, we inject contexts into the encoders at an early stage instead of merely at their last layers. Second, to enforce the model to leverage the contexts during training, we perturb the reference transcription with alternative spellings so that the model learns to rely on the contexts to make correct predictions. On LibriSpeech, our techniques together reduce the rare word error rate by 60% and 25% relatively compared to no biasing and shallow fusion, making the new state-of-the-art performance. On SPGISpeech and a real-world dataset ConEC, our techniques also yield good improvements over the baselines.</description>

      <title>Leave No Knowledge Behind During Knowledge Distillation: Towards Practical and Effective Knowledge Distillation for Code-Switching ASR Using Realistic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) often rely on large speech foundation models for generating high-quality transcriptions. However, these models can be impractical due to limited computing resources. The situation is even more severe in terms of more realistic or difficult scenarios, such as code-switching ASR (CS-ASR). To address this, we present a framework for developing more efficient models for CS-ASR through knowledge distillation using realistic speech-only data. Our proposed method, Leave No Knowledge Behind During Knowledge Distillation (K$^2$D), leverages both the teacher model's knowledge and additional insights from a small auxiliary model. We evaluate our approach on two in-domain and two out-domain datasets, demonstrating that K$^2$D is effective. By conducting K$^2$D on the unlabeled realistic data, we have successfully obtained a 2-time smaller model with 5-time faster generation speed while outperforming the baseline methods and the teacher model on all the testing sets. We have made our model publicly available on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/andybi7676/k2d-whisper.zh-en).</description>

      <title>Qwen2-Audio Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the latest progress of Qwen-Audio, a large-scale audio-language model called Qwen2-Audio, which is capable of accepting various audio signal inputs and performing audio analysis or direct textual responses with regard to speech instructions. In contrast to complex hierarchical tags, we have simplified the pre-training process by utilizing natural language prompts for different data and tasks, and have further expanded the data volume. We have boosted the instruction-following capability of Qwen2-Audio and implemented two distinct audio interaction modes for voice chat and audio analysis. In the voice chat mode, users can freely engage in voice interactions with Qwen2-Audio without text input. In the audio analysis mode, users could provide audio and text instructions for analysis during the interaction. Note that we do not use any system prompts to switch between voice chat and audio analysis modes. Qwen2-Audio is capable of intelligently comprehending the content within audio and following voice commands to respond appropriately. For instance, in an audio segment that simultaneously contains sounds, multi-speaker conversations, and a voice command, Qwen2-Audio can directly understand the command and provide an interpretation and response to the audio. Additionally, DPO has optimized the model's performance in terms of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. According to the evaluation results from AIR-Bench, Qwen2-Audio outperformed previous SOTAs, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, in tests focused on audio-centric instruction-following capabilities. Qwen2-Audio is open-sourced with the aim of fostering the advancement of the multi-modal language community.</description>

      <title>ecVoice: Audio Text Extraction and Optimization of Video Based on Idioms Similarity Replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Text Extraction of the Audio from the Video plays an important role in multimedia editing and processing. As a popular open source toolkit, Whisper performs fast in human voice recognition. However, the recognition performance is dependent on the computing resource, which makes the low computing memory running Whisper become difficult. Our paper presents an available solution to extract the human voice from the video and gain the high quality text generation from the voice. The generated voice can be used in video language translation and translated voice simulation. To improve the extraction and transform quality of human voice, we present ecVoice, a method using the idioms similarity computation and analysis to improve the quality of audio text extraction. Relative experiments are held to verify that the ecVoice can improve the idiom grammar correction rate to 90\% on average. The method is simple but fast which means this method will cause less bad influence of consuming computing resources when improving the voice recognition rate. Our method and solution can significantly enhance the Whisper recognition with low computing memory.</description>

      <title>Empowering Whisper as a Joint Multi-Talker and Target-Talker Speech Recognition System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-talker speech recognition and target-talker speech recognition, both involve transcription in multi-talker contexts, remain significant challenges. However, existing methods rarely attempt to simultaneously address both tasks. In this study, we propose a pioneering approach to empower Whisper, which is a speech foundation model, to tackle joint multi-talker and target-talker speech recognition tasks. Specifically, (i) we freeze Whisper and plug a Sidecar separator into its encoder to separate mixed embedding for multiple talkers; (ii) a Target Talker Identifier is introduced to identify the embedding flow of the target talker on the fly, requiring only three-second enrollment speech as a cue; (iii) soft prompt tuning for decoder is explored for better task adaptation. Our method outperforms previous methods on two- and three-talker LibriMix and LibriSpeechMix datasets for both tasks, and delivers acceptable zero-shot performance on multi-talker ASR on AishellMix Mandarin dataset.</description>

      <title>CUSIDE-T: Chunking, Simulating Future and Decoding for Transducer based Streaming ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) is very important for many real-world ASR applications. However, a notable challenge for streaming ASR systems lies in balancing operational performance against latency constraint. Recently, a method of chunking, simulating future context and decoding, called CUSIDE, has been proposed for connectionist temporal classification (CTC) based streaming ASR, which obtains a good balance between reduced latency and high recognition accuracy. In this paper, we present CUSIDE-T, which successfully adapts the CUSIDE method over the recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) ASR architecture, instead of being based on the CTC architecture. We also incorporate language model rescoring in CUSIDE-T to further enhance accuracy, while only bringing a small additional latency. Extensive experiments are conducted over the AISHELL-1, WenetSpeech and SpeechIO datasets, comparing CUSIDE-T and U2++ (both based on RNN-T). U2++ is an existing counterpart of chunk based streaming ASR method. It is shown that CUSIDE-T achieves superior accuracy performance for streaming ASR, with equal settings of latency.</description>

      <title>Classification of Heart Sounds Using Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Network and LSTM-CNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and cost-effective method for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities with high accuracy and reliability using low-cost systems in clinics. The primary limitation of automatic diagnosing of cardiac diseases is the rarity of correct and acceptable labeled samples, which can be expensive to prepare. To address this issue, two methods are proposed in this work. The first method is a unique Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MBDCN) architecture inspired by human auditory processing, specifically designed to optimize feature extraction by employing various sizes of convolutional filters and audio signal power spectrum as input. In the second method, called as Long short-term memory-Convolutional Neural (LSCN) model, Additionally, the network architecture includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network blocks to improve feature extraction in the time domain. The innovative approach of combining multiple parallel branches consisting of the one-dimensional convolutional layers along with LSTM blocks helps in achieving superior results in audio signal processing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art techniques. The overall classification accuracy of heart sounds with the LSCN network is more than 96%. The efficiency of this network is significant compared to common feature extraction methods such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and wavelet transform. Therefore, the proposed method shows promising results in the automatic analysis of heart sounds and has potential applications in the diagnosis and early detection of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning of Audio Spectrogram Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods have emerged as a solid alternative to the standard full fine-tuning approach. They only train a few extra parameters for each downstream task, without sacrificing performance and dispensing with the issue of storing a copy of the pre-trained model for each task. For audio classification tasks, the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model shows impressive results. However, surprisingly, how to efficiently adapt it to several downstream tasks has not been tackled before. In this paper, we bridge this gap and present a detailed investigation of common PETL methods for the adaptation of the AST model to audio/speech tasks. Furthermore, we propose a new adapter design that exploits the convolution module of the Conformer model, leading to superior performance over the standard PETL approaches and surpassing or achieving performance parity with full fine-tuning by updating only 0.29% of the parameters. Finally, we provide ablation studies revealing that our proposed adapter: 1) proves to be effective in few-shot efficient transfer learning, 2) attains optimal results regardless of the amount of the allocated parameters, and 3) can be applied to other pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Audio Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of audio playback devices and fast data transmission, the demand for high sound quality is rising for both entertainment and communications. In this quest for better sound quality, challenges emerge from distortions and interferences originating at the recording side or caused by an imperfect transmission pipeline. To address this problem, audio restoration methods aim to recover clean sound signals from the corrupted input data. We present here audio restoration algorithms based on diffusion models, with a focus on speech enhancement and music restoration tasks. Traditional approaches, often grounded in handcrafted rules and statistical heuristics, have shaped our understanding of audio signals. In the past decades, there has been a notable shift towards data-driven methods that exploit the modeling capabilities of DNNs. Deep generative models, and among them diffusion models, have emerged as powerful techniques for learning complex data distributions. However, relying solely on DNN-based learning approaches carries the risk of reducing interpretability, particularly when employing end-to-end models. Nonetheless, data-driven approaches allow more flexibility in comparison to statistical model-based frameworks, whose performance depends on distributional and statistical assumptions that can be difficult to guarantee. Here, we aim to show that diffusion models can combine the best of both worlds and offer the opportunity to design audio restoration algorithms with a good degree of interpretability and a remarkable performance in terms of sound quality. We explain the diffusion formalism and its application to the conditional generation of clean audio signals. We believe that diffusion models open an exciting field of research with the potential to spawn new audio restoration algorithms that are natural-sounding and remain robust in difficult acoustic situations.</description>

      <title>Emilia: An Extensive, Multilingual, and Diverse Speech Dataset for Large-Scale Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, speech generation models have made significant progress by using large-scale training data. However, the research community struggle to produce highly spontaneous and human-like speech due to the lack of large-scale, diverse, and spontaneous speech data. This paper present Emilia, the first multilingual speech generation dataset from in-the-wild speech data, and Emilia-Pipe, the first open-source preprocessing pipeline designed to transform in-the-wild speech data into high-quality training data with annotations for speech generation. Emilia starts with over 101k hours of speech in six languages and features diverse speech with varied speaking styles. To facilitate the scale-up of Emilia, the open-source pipeline Emilia-Pipe can process one hour of raw speech data ready for model training in a few mins, which enables the research community to collaborate on large-scale speech generation research. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of Emilia. Demos are available at: https://emilia-dataset.github.io/Emilia-Demo-Page/.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Real Electric Guitar Tones and Effects to Improve Robustness in Guitar Tablature Transcription Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guitar tablature transcription (GTT) aims at automatically generating symbolic representations from real solo guitar performances. Due to its applications in education and musicology, GTT has gained traction in recent years. However, GTT robustness has been limited due to the small size of available datasets. Researchers have recently used synthetic data that simulates guitar performances using pre-recorded or computer-generated tones and can be automatically generated at large scales. The present study complements these efforts by demonstrating that GTT robustness can be improved by including synthetic training data created using recordings of real guitar tones played with different audio effects. We evaluate our approach on a new evaluation dataset with professional solo guitar performances that we composed and collected, featuring a wide array of tones, chords, and scales.</description>

      <title>AI-based Drone Assisted Human Rescue in Disaster Environments: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this survey we are focusing on utilizing drone-based systems for the detection of individuals, particularly by identifying human screams and other distress signals. This study has significant relevance in post-disaster scenarios, including events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, military conflicts, wildfires, and more. These drones are capable of hovering over disaster-stricken areas that may be challenging for rescue teams to access directly. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, are frequently deployed for search-and-rescue missions during disaster situations. Typically, drones capture aerial images to assess structural damage and identify the extent of the disaster. They also employ thermal imaging technology to detect body heat signatures, which can help locate individuals. In some cases, larger drones are used to deliver essential supplies to people stranded in isolated disaster-stricken areas. In our discussions, we delve into the unique challenges associated with locating humans through aerial acoustics. The auditory system must distinguish between human cries and sounds that occur naturally, such as animal calls and wind. Additionally, it should be capable of recognizing distinct patterns related to signals like shouting, clapping, or other ways in which people attempt to signal rescue teams. To tackle this challenge, one solution involves harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze sound frequencies and identify common audio signatures. Deep learning-based networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be trained using these signatures to filter out noise generated by drone motors and other environmental factors. Furthermore, employing signal processing techniques like the direction of arrival (DOA) based on microphone array signals can enhance the precision of tracking the source of human noises.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Direction of Sound In A Reverberant Noisy Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a new method for estimating the direction of sound in a reverberant environment from basic principles of sound propagation. The method utilizes SNR-adaptive features from time-delay and energy of the directional components after acoustic wave decomposition of the observed sound field to estimate the line-of-sight direction under noisy and reverberant conditions. The effectiveness of the approach is established with measured data of different microphone array configurations under various usage scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sound Field Synthesis with Acoustic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a practical framework to synthesize the broadband sound-field on a small rigid surface based on the physics of sound propagation. The sound-field is generated as a composite map of two components: the room component and the device component, with acoustic plane waves as the core tool for the generation. This decoupling of room and device components significantly reduces the problem complexity and provides accurate rendering of the sound-field.
  We describe in detail the theoretical foundations, and efficient procedures of the implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is established through rigorous validation under different environment setups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SpeechBrain is an open-source Conversational AI toolkit based on PyTorch, focused particularly on speech processing tasks such as speech recognition, speech enhancement, speaker recognition, text-to-speech, and much more. It promotes transparency and replicability by releasing both the pre-trained models and the complete "recipes" of code and algorithms required for training them. This paper presents SpeechBrain 1.0, a significant milestone in the evolution of the toolkit, which now has over 200 recipes for speech, audio, and language processing tasks, and more than 100 models available on Hugging Face. SpeechBrain 1.0 introduces new technologies to support diverse learning modalities, Large Language Model (LLM) integration, and advanced decoding strategies, along with novel models, tasks, and modalities. It also includes a new benchmark repository, offering researchers a unified platform for evaluating models across diverse tasks</description>

      <title>Improving Speech Enhancement by Integrating Inter-Channel and Band Features with Dual-branch Conformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent speech enhancement methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer have been demonstrated to efficaciously capture time-frequency (T-F) information on spectrogram. However, the correlation of each channels of speech features is failed to explore. Theoretically, each channel map of speech features obtained by different convolution kernels contains information with different scales demonstrating strong correlations. To fill this gap, we propose a novel dual-branch architecture named channel-aware dual-branch conformer (CADB-Conformer), which effectively explores the long range time and frequency correlations among different channels, respectively, to extract channel relation aware time-frequency information. Ablation studies conducted on DNS-Challenge 2020 dataset demonstrate the importance of channel feature leveraging while showing the significance of channel relation aware T-F information for speech enhancement. Extensive experiments also show that the proposed model achieves superior performance than recent methods with an attractive computational costs.</description>
