      <title>Skyrmion stacking in stray field-coupled ultrathin ferromagnetic multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the energy landscape of ferromagnetic multilayer
  heterostructures that feature magnetic skyrmions -- tiny whirls of
  spins with non-trivial topology -- in each magnetic layer. Such
  magnetic heterostructures have been recently pursued as possible
  hosts of room temperature stable magnetic skyrmions suitable for the
  next generation of low power information technologies and
  unconventional computing. The presence of stacked skyrmions in the
  adjacent layers gives rise to a strongly coupled nonlinear system,
  whereby the induced magnetic field plays a crucial stabilizing
  role. Starting with the micromagnetic modeling framework, we derive
  a general reduced energy functional for a fixed number of ultrathin
  ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular magnetocrystalline
  anisotropy. We next investigate this energy functional in the regime
  in which the energy is dominated by the intralayer exchange
  interaction and formally obtain a finite-dimensional description
  governed by the energy of a system of one skyrmion per layer as a
  function of the position, radius and the rotation angle of each of
  theses skyrmions. For the latter, we prove that energy minimizers
  exist for all fixed skyrmion locations. We then focus on the
  simplest case of stray field-coupled ferromagnetic bilayers and
  completely characterize the energy minimizers. We show that the
  global energy minimizers exist and consist of two stray
  field-stabilized N\'eel skyrmions with antiparallel in-plane
  magnetization components. We also calculate the energy of two
  skyrmions of equal radius as a function of their separation
  distance.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Solitonic Collisions in Mechanical Metamaterials</title>

Abstract: Interactions between solitary waves have been pivotal to understanding nonlinear phenomena across various disciplines. The dynamics of rarefaction solitary waves holds great potential, yet their fundamental characteristics and interactions remain only partially understood through experimental means in mechanical metamaterials. Previous studies highlighted their existence and proposed applications, such as waveguides, impact mitigation, and energy harvesting. Challenges, including energy dissipation and a lack of precise measurement techniques, have hindered deeper exploration, most notably of solitonic collisions. In this work, we provide a definitive platform for examining pure rarefaction solitons propagating through a strain-softening mechanical lattice, addressing these challenges. Employing a theoretical framework based on the Boussinesq approximation and multiple-scale analysis, we predict soliton behavior, including phase shifts resulting from head-on collisions. These theoretical insights are corroborated through numerical simulations and systematic experiments designed to generate and measure pure rarefaction solitons with high precision. Both symmetric and asymmetric collisions are examined, revealing practically elastic interaction behaviors and amplitude-dependent phase shifts. Furthermore, collision dynamics, such as speed and phase shifts during rarefaction soliton collisions, from the experimental results show agreement with theoretical and numerical models. These results validate our experimental platform and findings, underscoring the potential of mechanical rarefaction solitons as robust, controllable wave packets. This suggests a robust paradigm for exploring nonlinear wave interactions in mechanical systems, opening new application avenues in mechanical metamaterials, such as wave-based computing and advanced signal processing.</description>
