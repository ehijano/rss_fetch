      <title>Confinement-induced field-linked states of ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the existence of stable bound states between pairs of ultracold diatomic molecules with the aid of a static electric field and 1D harmonic confinement. We focus on collisions of NaK-NaK identical fermions, for which we find that currently achievable experimental parameters allow the observation of these confinement-induced field-linked bound states as scattering resonances. The bound state is highly stable with lifetimes estimated to be tens of seconds long. With the diatomic molecules bound at distances a fraction of the dipolar length scale, these complexes allow for explorations of polyatomic chemistry and Fermi gas superfluid pairing.</description>

      <title>The SWaP plot: Visualising the performance of portable atomic clocks as a function of their size, weight and power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision timekeeping is fundamental to modern technologies such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), communication networks, financial transactions, and power grid management. Over the past 50 years, microwave atomic clocks have been the standard for timing precision. The new generation of optical atomic clocks have demonstrated orders of magnitude better performance, and are now transitioning from research to practical applications. We provide a web resource that tracks the performance of these optical atomic clocks, measured in terms of their Allan deviation at various integration times, against their SWaP requirements via an interactive plot. The most current data and additional resources are available online, providing a continuously updated reference for those interested in precision timing.</description>

      <title>A Simple approach for precision calculation of Bethe logarithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we propose a simple approach for the precision calculation of Bethe logarithm. The leading contributions are obtained using specific operators, while the remaining terms are eliminated by adjusting the parameter $\lambda$. Through the use of dimensional regularization, singular divergences are algebraically canceled. Compared to the standard form of Bethe logarithm, our approach significantly reduces the complexity of constructing pseudostates in numerical evaluations. Using this approach we obtain a very highly precise result of Bethe logarithm for the ground state of the hydrogen, achieving 49 significant digits. And for multi-electron systems this approach appears simplicity and efficiency as well.</description>

      <title>Variational Calculation of the Hyperfine Stark Effect in Atomic $^{87}$Rb, $^{133}$Cs, and $^{169}$Tm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electronically variational approach to the calculation of atomic hyperfine structure transition energies under the influence of static external electric fields is presented. The method avoids the calculation of intermediate atomic states entirely and requires only the wavefunctions of the electronic states involved in the respective hyperfine levels. These wavefunctions are obtained through relativistic general-excitation-rank configuration interaction theory. The method also enables for calculations on atoms with the most complicated of shell structures.
  The initial applications include $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs where very good agreement of the approach with literature results is established. For $^{169}$Tm that is used in the development of atomic clocks the differential static electric dipole polarizability between ground levels $J=\frac{7}{2}$ and $J=\frac{5}{2}$ is calculated to be $\Delta\alpha = -0.23 \pm 0.11$ \au The hyperfine Stark coefficient for the hyperfine levels belonging to the ground term with $J=\frac{7}{2}$ is found to be $k = (1.3 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-13}$ [Hz/((V/m)$^2$)]. This coefficient is several orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding coefficients in $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology via Floquet-Engineered Two-axis Twisting and Turn Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The core of quantum metrology lies in utilizing entanglement to enhance measurement precision beyond standard quantum limit. Here, we utilize the Floquet-engineered two-axis twisting (TAT) and turn dynamics to generate non-Gaussian states for quantum metrology. By employing both analytically semi-classical and quantum approaches, we find that the desired $N$-particle non-Gaussian state can be produced within a remarkably short time $t_\mathrm{opt}\propto \ln{N}/{N}$, and its quantum Fisher information $F^\mathrm{opt}_\mathrm{Q}\propto N^2$ approaches the Heisenberg limit. Moreover, using the Floquet-engineered anti-TAT-and-turn, we may implement an efficient interaction-based readout protocol to extract the signal encoded in this non-Gaussian state. This Floquet-engineered anti-TAT-and-turn approach offers a viable method to achieve effective time-reversal dynamics for improving measurement precision and resilience against detection noise, all without the need to invert the sign of the nonlinear interaction. This study paves the way for achieving entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology via rapid generation of cat-like states at high particle numbers through continuous Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust High-Precision Atomic Gravimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic gravimeters are the most accurate sensors for measuring gravity, however, a significant challenge is how to achieve high precision even in the presence of noises. Here, we develop a protocol for achieving robust high-precision atomic gravimetry based upon adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation. Our protocol incorporates a sequence of interferometry measurements taken with short to long interrogation times and offers several key advantages. Firstly, it enables a high dynamic range without the need to scan multiple fringes for pre-estimation, making it more efficient than the conventional frequentist method. Secondly, it enhances robustness against noises, allowing for a significant measurement precision improvement in noisy environments. The enhancement can be more than $5$ times for a transportable gravimeter and up to an order of magnitude for a state-of-the-art fountain gravimeter. Notably, by optimizing the interferometry sequence, our approach can improve the scaling of the measurement precision ($\Delta g_{est}$) versus the total interrogation time ($\tilde{T}$) to $\Delta g_{est} \propto \tilde{T}^{-2}$ or even better, in contrast to the conventional one $\Delta g_{est} \propto \tilde{T}^{-0.5}$. Our approach offers superior precision, increased dynamic range, and enhanced robustness, making it highly promising for a range of practical sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Quadrature amplitude modulation for electronic sideband Pound-Drever-Hall locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique is routinely used to stabilize the frequency of a laser to a reference cavity. The electronic sideband (ESB) locking scheme, a PDH variant, helps bridge the frequency difference between the quantized frequencies enforced by the cavity and the laser frequency of interest. Here we use quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), a technique used in digital signal communication, to engineer the high-quality phase-modulated radio-frequency (rf) signal required for ESB locking scheme. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the effects of in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) impairments on the ESB error signal for ultra-narrow linewidth lasers. We design and implement two baseband-sampling software-defined radio variants for implementing QAM that compensate for these I/Q impairments. Using these variants, we engineer high-quality phase-modulated radio-frequency (rf) signals with a large phase modulation index of 1.01 radians, a maximum modulation frequency of 3 MHz, a tunable carrier wave frequency range of 450 MHz to 4 GHz, and I/Q errors of less than 2.25 % over the entire carrier wave frequency range.</description>

      <title>GRASIAN: Shaping and characterization of the cold hydrogen and deuterium beams for the forthcoming first demonstration of gravitational quantum states of atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A low energy particle confined by a horizontal reflective surface and gravity settles in gravitationally bound quantum states. These gravitational quantum states (GQS) were so far only observed with neutrons. However, the existence of GQS is predicted also for atoms. The GRASIAN collaboration pursues the first observation of GQS of atoms, using a cryogenic hydrogen beam. This endeavor is motivated by the higher densities, which can be expected from hydrogen compared to neutrons, the easier access, the fact that GQS were never observed with atoms and the accessibility to hypothetical short range interactions. In addition to enabling gravitational quantum spectroscopy, such a cryogenic hydrogen beam with very low vertical velocity components - a few cm s$^{-1}$, can be used for precision optical and microwave spectroscopy. In this article, we report on our methods developed to reduce background and to detect atoms with a low horizontal velocity, which are needed for such an experiment. Our recent measurement results on the collimation of the hydrogen beam to 2 mm, the reduction of background and improvement of signal-to-noise and finally our first detection of atoms with velocities &lt; 72 m s$^{-1}$ are presented. Furthermore, we show calculations, estimating the feasibility of the planned experiment and simulations which confirm that we can select vertical velocity components in the order of cm s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>QED Corrections in Unstable Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-energy and vacuum polarization effects in quantum electrodynamics (QED) are calculated for the supercritical Coulomb field, where Dirac energy levels become embedded in the negative-energy continuum. In this regime, the quantum vacuum becomes unstable, resulting in spontaneous electron-positron pair creation. By calculating the imaginary part of the QED correction, we gain access to an unexplored channel of vacuum instability: radiative spontaneous pair creation. Our results show that this radiative channel is greatly enhanced in the vicinity of the threshold of the supercritical regime, providing evidence for nonperturbative effects with respect to the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. We therefore conjecture that the total probability of spontaneous pair creation could differ significantly from the predictions of Dirac theory, especially near the supercritical threshold.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry breaking of superradiance in a dipolar BEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01586v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dicke superradiance occurs when two or more emitters cooperatively interact via the electromagnetic field. This collective light scattering process has been extensively studied across various platforms, from atoms to quantum dots and organic molecules. Despite extensive research, the precise role of direct interactions between emitters in superradiance remains elusive, particularly in many-body systems where the complexity of interactions poses significant challenges. In this study, we investigate the effect of dipole-dipole interaction between 18,000 atoms in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) on the superradiance process. In dipolar BECs, we simplify the complex effect of anisotropic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction with Bogoliubov transformation. We observe that anisotropic Bogoliubov excitation breaks the mirror symmetry in decay modes of superradiance.</description>

      <title>On the limitations of the semi-classical picture in high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent progress in the quantum optical formulation of the process of high harmonic generation has reached a point where the successful semi-classical model shows its limitations. So far the light source which drives the process was considered to be provided by a laser, in agreement with the classical picture. However, quantum optics allows to consider light fields beyond the classical realm, such as bright squeezed vacuum of photon number states. Both field states have vanishing mean electric field amplitudes, but can still lead to the generation of high harmonic radiation for sufficiently high intensities. This poses new questions about the range of validity of the semi-classical picture, and allows to extend the domain of questions which could possibly be asked.</description>

      <title>Modulation transfer protocol for Rydberg RF receivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a modulation transfer protocol to increase the detection sensitivity of a Rydberg RF receiver to fields out of resonance from the transition between Rydberg levels. This protocol is based on a phase modulation of the control field used to create the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) signal. The nonlinear wave-mixing of the multi-component coupling laser and the probe laser transfers the modulation to the probe laser, which is used for RF-field detection. The measurements compare well with semi-classical simulations of atom-light interaction and show an improvement in the RF bandwidth of the sensor and an improved sensitivity of the response to weak fields.</description>
