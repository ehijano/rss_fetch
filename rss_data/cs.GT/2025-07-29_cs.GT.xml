      <title>Flexible Bidding in Service-Oriented Combinatorial Spectrum Forward Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional combinatorial spectrum auctions mainly rely on fixed bidding and matching processes, which limit participants' ability to adapt their strategies and often result in suboptimal social welfare in dynamic spectrum sharing environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approximately truthful combinatorial forward auction scheme with a flexible bidding mechanism aimed at enhancing resource efficiency and maximizing social welfare. In the proposed scheme, each buyer submits a combinatorial bid consisting of the base spectrum demand and adjustable demand ranges, enabling the auctioneer to dynamically optimize spectrum allocation in response to market conditions. To standardize the valuation across heterogeneous frequency bands, we introduce a Spectrum Equivalent Mapping (SEM) coefficient. A greedy matching algorithm is employed to determine winning bids by sorting buyers based on their equivalent unit bid prices and allocating resources within supply constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed flexible bidding mechanism significantly outperforms existing benchmark methods, achieving notably higher social welfare in dynamic spectrum sharing scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm-to-Contract Framework without Demand Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider costly tasks that add up to the success of a project, and must be fitted by an agent into a given time-frame. This is an instance of the classic budgeted maximization problem, which admits an approximation scheme (FPTAS). Now assume the agent is performing these tasks on behalf of a principal, who is the one to reap the rewards if the project succeeds. The principal must design a contract to incentivize the agent. Is there still an approximation scheme? In this work, our ultimate goal is an algorithm-to-contract transformation, which transforms algorithms for combinatorial problems (like budgeted maximization) to tackle incentive constraints that arise in contract design. Our approach diverges from previous works on combinatorial contract design by avoiding an assumption of black-box access to a demand oracle.
  We first show how to "lift" the FPTAS for budgeted maximization to obtain the best-possible multiplicative and additive FPTAS for the contract design problem. We establish this through our "local-global" framework, in which the "local" step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of the demand problem. The "global" step then utilizes the local one to find the approximately optimal contract. We apply our framework to a host of combinatorial constraints including multi-dimensional budgets, budgeted matroid, and budgeted matching constraints. In all cases we achieve an approximation essentially matching the best approximation for the purely algorithmic problem. We also develop a method to tackle multi-agent contract settings, where the team of working agents must abide to combinatorial feasibility constraints.</description>

      <title>Fairness under Equal-Sized Bundles: Impossibility Results and Approximation Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods under cardinality constraints, where each agent must receive a bundle of fixed size. This models practical scenarios, such as assigning shifts or forming equally sized teams. Recently, variants of envy-freeness up to one/any item (EF1, EFX) were introduced for this setting, based on flips or exchanges of items. Namely, one can define envy-freeness up to one/any flip (EFF1, EFFX), meaning that an agent $i$ does not envy another agent $j$ after performing one or any one-item flip between their bundles that improves the value of $i$.
  We explore algorithmic aspects of this notion, and our contribution is twofold: we present both algorithmic and impossibility results, highlighting a stark contrast between the classic EFX concept and its flip-based analogue. First, we explore standard techniques used in the literature and show that they fail to guarantee EFFX approximations. On the positive side, we show that we can achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee when agents share a common ranking over item values, based on the well-known envy cycle elimination technique. This idea also leads to a generalized algorithm with approximation guarantees when agents agree on the top $n$ items and their valuation functions are bounded. Finally, we show that an algorithm that maximizes the Nash welfare guarantees a 1/2-EFF1 allocation, and that this bound is tight.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Study of Dashboard Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualization dashboards are increasingly used in strategic settings like auctions to enhance decision-making and reduce strategic confusion. This paper presents behavioral experiments evaluating how different dashboard designs affect bid optimization in reverse first-price auctions. Additionally, we assess how dashboard designs impact the auction designer's ability to accurately infer bidders' preferences within the dashboard mechanism framework. We compare visualizations of the bid allocation rule, commonly deployed in practice, to alternatives that display expected utility. We find that utility-based visualizations significantly improve bidding by reducing cognitive demands on bidders. However, even with improved dashboards, bidders systematically under-shade their bids, driven by an implicit preference for certain wins in uncertain settings. As a result, dashboard-based mechanisms that assume fully rational or risk-neutral bidder responses to dashboards can produce significant estimation errors when inferring private preferences, which may lead to suboptimal allocations in practice. Explicitly modeling agents' behavioral responses to dashboards substantially improves inference accuracy, highlighting the need to align visualization design and econometric inference assumptions in practice.</description>

      <title>Ultracoarse Equilibria and Ordinal-Folding Dynamics in Operator-Algebraic Models of Infinite Multi-Agent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an operator algebraic framework for infinite games with a continuum of agents and prove that regret based learning dynamics governed by a noncommutative continuity equation converge to a unique quantal response equilibrium under mild regularity assumptions. The framework unifies functional analysis, coarse geometry and game theory by assigning to every game a von Neumann algebra that represents collective strategy evolution. A reflective regret operator within this algebra drives the flow of strategy distributions and its fixed point characterises equilibrium. We introduce the ordinal folding index, a computable ordinal valued metric that measures the self referential depth of the dynamics, and show that it bounds the transfinite time needed for convergence, collapsing to zero on coarsely amenable networks. The theory yields new invariant subalgebra rigidity results, establishes existence and uniqueness of envy free and maximin share allocations in continuum economies, and links analytic properties of regret flows with empirical stability phenomena in large language models. These contributions supply a rigorous mathematical foundation for large scale multi agent systems and demonstrate the utility of ordinal metrics for equilibrium selection.</description>

      <title>Oranits: Mission Assignment and Task Offloading in Open RAN-based ITS using Metaheuristic and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS), where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach. First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm, namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and 12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient task processing in dynamic ITS environments.</description>

      <title>Finding Personalized Good-Enough Solutions to Unsatisfiable Stable Roommates Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching). Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute "good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Strategic Filtering for Content Moderation: Free Speech or Free of Distortion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) on social media platforms is vulnerable to incitements and manipulations, necessitating effective regulations. To address these challenges, those platforms often deploy automated content moderators tasked with evaluating the harmfulness of UGC and filtering out content that violates established guidelines. However, such moderation inevitably gives rise to strategic responses from users, who strive to express themselves within the confines of guidelines. Such phenomena call for a careful balance between: 1. ensuring freedom of speech -- by minimizing the restriction of expression; and 2. reducing social distortion -- measured by the total amount of content manipulation. We tackle the problem of optimizing this balance through the lens of mechanism design, aiming at optimizing the trade-off between minimizing social distortion and maximizing free speech. Although determining the optimal trade-off is NP-hard, we propose practical methods to approximate the optimal solution. Additionally, we provide generalization guarantees determining the amount of finite offline data required to approximate the optimal moderator effectively.</description>

      <title>The Min Max Average Cycle Weight Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When an old apartment building is demolished and rebuilt, how can we fairly redistribute the new apartments to minimize envy among residents? We reduce this question to a combinatorial optimization problem called the *Min Max Average Cycle Weight* problem. In that problem we seek to assign objects to agents in a way that minimizes the maximum average weight of directed cycles in an associated envy graph. While this problem reduces to maximum-weight matching when starting from a clean slate (achieving polynomial-time solvability), we show that this is not the case when we account for preexisting conditions, such as residents' satisfaction with their original apartments. Whether the problem is polynomial-time solvable in the general case remains an intriguing open problem.</description>

      <title>Core Safety Values for Provably Corrigible Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate* utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness, low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step, self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal, the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF, which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs. Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Liquidity Provisioning for Prediction Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Decentralized Finance (DeFi), automated market makers typically implement liquidity provisioning protocols. These protocols allow third-party liquidity providers (LPs) to provide assets to facilitate trade in exchange for fees. This paper introduces a general framework for liquidity provisioning for cost-function prediction markets with any finite set of securities. Our framework is based on the idea of running several market makers "in parallel"; we show formally that several notions of parallel market making are equivalent to ours. The most general protocol therefore allows LPs to submit an arbitrary cost function, which specifies their liquidity over the entire price space, and determines the deposit required. We justify the need for this flexibility by demonstrating the inherent high dimensionality of liquidity. We also give several restricted protocols which are more computationally feasible.
  Furthermore, we show that our protocol recovers several existing DeFi protocols in the 2- asset case. Our work also contributes to the DeFi literature by giving a fully expressive protocol for any number of assets.</description>

      <title>Expectation in Stochastic Games with Prefix-independent Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic two-player games model systems with an environment that is both adversarial and stochastic. In this paper, we study the expected value of bounded quantitative prefix-independent objectives in the context of stochastic games. We show a generic reduction from the expectation problem to linearly many instances of the almost-sure satisfaction problem for threshold Boolean objectives. The result follows from partitioning the vertices of the game into so-called value classes where each class consists of vertices of the same value. Our procedure further entails that the memory required by both players to play optimally for the expectation problem is no more than the memory required by the players to play optimally for the almost-sure satisfaction problem for a corresponding threshold Boolean objective.
  We show the applicability of the framework to compute the expected window mean-payoff measure in stochastic games. The window mean-payoff measure strengthens the classical mean-payoff measure by computing the mean payoff over windows of bounded length that slide along an infinite path. We show that the decision problem to check if the expected window mean-payoff value is at least a given threshold is in UP $\capc coUP when the window length is given in unary.</description>

      <title>CLVR Ordering of Transactions on AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a trade ordering rule that aims to reduce intra-block price volatility in Automated Market Maker (AMM) powered decentralized exchanges. The ordering rule introduced here, Clever Look-ahead Volatility Reduction (CLVR), operates under the (common) framework in decentralized finance that allows some entities to observe trade requests before they are settled, assemble them into "blocks", and order them as they like. On AMM exchanges, asset prices are continuously and transparently updated as a result of each trade and therefore, transaction order has high financial value. CLVR aims to order transactions for traders' benefit. Our primary focus is intra-block price stability (minimizing volatility), which has two main benefits for traders: it reduces transaction failure rate and allows traders to receive closer prices to the reference price at which they submit their transactions accordingly. We show that CLVR constructs an ordering which approximately minimizes price volatility with a small computation cost and can be trivially verified externally.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Finite Space Mean-Field Type Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean field type games (MFTGs) describe Nash equilibria between large coalitions: each coalition consists of a continuum of cooperative agents who maximize the average reward of their coalition while interacting non-cooperatively with a finite number of other coalitions. Although the theory has been extensively developed, we are still lacking efficient and scalable computational methods. Here, we develop reinforcement learning methods for such games in a finite space setting with general dynamics and reward functions. We start by proving that the MFTG solution yields approximate Nash equilibria in finite-size coalition games. We then propose two algorithms. The first is based on the quantization of mean-field spaces and Nash Q-learning. We provide convergence and stability analysis. We then propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which can scale to larger spaces. Numerical experiments in 4 environments with mean-field distributions of dimension up to $200$ show the scalability and efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

However, in non-IID settings, removing clients creates critical side effects: remaining clients with similar data distributions suffer disproportionate performance degradation, while the global model's stability deteriorates. These vulnerable clients then have reduced incentives to stay in the federation, potentially triggering a cascade of withdrawals that further destabilize the system. To address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that quantifies how data heterogeneity impacts unlearning outcomes. Based on these insights, we model FU as a Stackelberg game where the server strategically offers payments to retain crucial clients based on their contribution to both unlearning effectiveness and system stability. Our rigorous equilibrium analysis reveals how data heterogeneity fundamentally shapes the trade-offs between system-wide objectives and client interests. Our approach improves global stability by up to 6.23\%, reduces worst-case client degradation by 10.05\%, and achieves up to 38.6\% runtime efficiency over complete retraining.</description>

Abstract: We derive the first closed-form condition under which artificial intelligence (AI) capital profits could sustainably finance a universal basic income (UBI) without additional taxes or new job creation. In a Solow-Zeira economy characterized by a continuum of automatable tasks, a constant net saving rate $s$, and task-elasticity $\sigma &lt; 1$, we analyze how the AI capability threshold--defined as the productivity level of AI relative to pre-AI automation--varies under different economic scenarios. At present economic parameters, we find that AI systems must achieve only approximately 5-6 times existing automation productivity to finance an 11%-of-GDP UBI, in the worst case situation where *no* new jobs or tasks are created.
  Our analysis also reveals some specific policy levers: raising public revenue share (e.g. profit taxation) of AI capital from the current 15% to about 33% halves the required AI capability threshold to attain UBI to 3 times existing automotion productivity, but gains diminish beyond 50% public revenue share, especially if regulatory costs increase. Market structure also strongly affects outcomes: monopolistic or concentrated oligopolistic markets reduce the threshold by increasing economic rents, whereas heightened competition significantly raises it.
  Overall, these results suggest a couple policy recommendations: maximizing public revenue share up to a point so that operating costs are minimized, and strategically managing market competition can ensure AI's growing capabilities translate into meaningful social benefits within realistic technological progress scenarios.</description>
