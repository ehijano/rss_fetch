      <title>Quantifying the Dunkelflaute: An analysis of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable renewable energy droughts, also referred to as "Dunkelflaute", emerge as a challenge for realizing climate-neutral energy systems based on variable wind and solar power. Using data on 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method, we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and policy-relevant renewable technology portfolios. We show that drought characteristics heavily depend on the chosen threshold. Using single thresholds, as common in the literature, is thus not advisable. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We further identify the most extreme droughts and show how these drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system. Such events comprise sequences of shorter, contiguous droughts of varying severity. In a perfectly interconnected Europe, the most extreme drought event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55~days. Yet, the average renewable portfolio availability during this event was still 47% of its long-run mean. As extreme droughts may span across the turn of years, single calendar year planning horizons are not suitable for modeling weather-resilient future energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tidal evolution of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of low-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of low-mass stars undergo strong tidal effects that modify their spin states. These planets are expected to host dense atmospheres that can also play an important role in the spin evolution. On one hand, gravitational tides tend to synchronise the rotation with the orbital mean motion, but on the other hand, thermal atmospheric tides push the rotation away and may lead to asynchronous equilibria. Here, we investigate the complete tidal evolution of Earth-like planets by taking into account the effect of obliquity and eccentric orbits. We adopted an Andrade rheology for the gravitational tides and benchmarked the unknown parameters with the present rotation of Venus. We then applied our model to Earth-like planets, and we show that asynchronous rotation can be expected for planets orbiting stars with masses between 0.4 and 0.9 $M_\odot$ and semi-major axes between 0.2 and 0.7 au. Interestingly, we find that Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of stars with masses $\sim 0.8$ $M_\odot$ may end up with an equilibrium rotation of 24 hours. We additionally find that these planets can also develop high obliquities, which may help sustain temperate environments.</description>

      <title>Extending the blended generalized extreme value distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is commonly employed to help estimate the likelihood of extreme events in many geophysical and other application areas. The recently proposed blended generalized extreme value (bGEV) distribution modifies the GEV with positive shape parameter to avoid a hard lower bound that complicates fitting and inference. Here, the bGEV is extended to the GEV with negative shape parameter, avoiding a hard upper bound that is unrealistic in many applications. This extended bGEV is shown to improve on the GEV for forecasting heat and sea level extremes based on past data. Software implementing this bGEV and applying it to the example temperature and sea level data is provided.</description>
