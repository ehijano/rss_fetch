      <title>Kink movement on a periodic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of the kink in the sine-Gordon (sG) model in the presence of periodic inhomogeneity is studied. An ansatz is proposed that allows for the construction of a reliable effective model with two degrees of freedom. Effective models with excellent agreement with the original field-theoretic partial differential equation are constructed, including in the non-perturbative region and for relativistic velocities. The numerical solutions of the sG model describing the evolution of the kink in the presence of a barrier as well as in the case of a periodic heterogeneity under the potential additional influence of a switched bias current and/or dissipation were obtained. The results of the field equation and the effective models were compared. The effect of the choice of initial conditions in the field model on the agreement of the results with the effective model is discussed.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01463v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first half of the paper we consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate the "sound" wave coefficient of reflection from (coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the speeds of the "sound" waves relative to the shock and the wave impedances. In the second half of the paper we explicitly include into consideration the dissipation in the system, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to justify the conditions on the shocks, postulated in the first half of the paper. This also allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles, same as the profiles of the waves closely connected with the shocks - the kinks. The profiles of the latter, and in some particular cases the profiles of the former, were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Gradient dynamics approach to reactive thin-film hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wetting and dewetting dynamics of simple and complex liquids is described by kinetic equations in gradient dynamics form that incorporates the various coupled dissipative processes in a fully thermodynamically consistent manner. After briefly reviewing this, we also review how chemical reactions can be captured by a related gradient dynamics description, assuming detailed balanced mass action type kinetics. Then, we bring both aspects together and discuss mesoscopic reactive thin-film hydrodynamics illustrated by two examples, namely, models for reactive wetting and reactive surfactants. These models can describe the approach to equilibrium but may also be employed to study out-of-equilibrium chemo-mechanical dynamics. In the latter case, one breaks the gradient dynamics form by chemostatting to obtain active systems. In this way, for reactive wetting we recover running drops that are driven by chemically sustained wettability gradients and for drops covered by autocatalytic reactive surfactants we find complex forms of self-propulsion and self-excited oscillations.</description>
