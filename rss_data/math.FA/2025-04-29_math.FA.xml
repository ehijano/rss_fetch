      <title>Fourier and Helgason Fourier transforms for Vector Bundle-valued Differential Forms on Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18543v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the perspective of the functional equation satisfied by the classical Fourier transform to derive the Helgason Fourier transform map $\Omega^{l}(G/K,W)\longrightarrow\Omega^{k}(G/K\times G/P,V[\chi]):f\longmapsto \widehat{f}:G/K\times G/P\mapsto V[\chi]:(x,b)\longmapsto\widehat{f}(x,b)$ (for $W-$valued differential forms $f\in \Omega^{l}(G/K,W)$) as the $G-$ invariant vector bundle-valued differential form $\widehat{f}$ on the product space $G/K\times G/P$ whose image under the vector bundle-valued Poisson transform is the fibre convolution-integral $\varphi^{U^{\sigma,\nu}}_{\tau,l,k}* f$ on $G/K,$ where $\varphi^{U^{\sigma,\nu}}_{\tau,l,k}$ is the $W-$valued $\tau-$spherical $l-$form on $G/K.$ Explicitly, we prove that $$\widehat{f}_{l,k,\lambda}(x,b)=({\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}^{-1}\circ\beta^{V}(\lambda))\circ(\int_{G/K}\varphi^{U^{\sigma\nu},t}_{\tau,l,k}\wedge\pi^{*}_{K}f)(x),$$ where $b\in G/P$ is a consequence of the boundary map $\beta^{V}(\lambda)$ and ${\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}$ is the vector bundle-valued Harish-Chandra $c-$function. The Fourier transform map $\Omega^{l}(G/K,W)\longrightarrow\Omega^{k}(G/K\times G/P,W)$ $:f\mapsto f^{\triangle}$ $:(b,x)\longmapsto f^{\triangle}(b,x)$ is then established to be explicitly given as $f^{\triangle}_{l,k,\lambda}(b,x)=$ $$\int_{G/P}\phi_{k,l}\wedge\pi^{*}_{P}(({\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}^{-1}\circ\beta^{V}(\lambda))\circ(\int_{G/K}\varphi^{U^{\sigma\nu},t}_{\tau,l,k}\wedge\pi^{*}_{K}f)(x)).$$</description>

      <title>Quantitative cyclicity, stability, and geometric analysis in weighted Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new quantitative measures for cyclicity in radially weighted Besov spaces, including the Drury-Arveson space, by defining cyclicity indices based on potential theory and capacity. Extensions to non-commutative settings are developed, yielding analogues of cyclicity in free function spaces. We also study the stability of cyclic functions under perturbations of both the functions and the underlying weight, and we establish geometric criteria linking the structure of zero sets on the boundary to the failure or persistence of cyclicity. These results provide novel invariants and conditions that characterize cyclicity and the structure of multiplier invariant subspaces in a variety of function spaces.</description>

      <title>Some comments on the mth-order Projection Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Petty's projection inequality is a sharp upper bound for the volume of the polar projection body of a convex body. Lutwak later introduced the concept of mixed projection bodies, and extended Petty's projection inequality. Alonso-Guti\'{e}rrez later did a type of stability for Petty's projection inequality.
  In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th-order setting and extended the difference body to that setting. In a previous work, we, working with Haddad, Putterman, Roysdon and Ye, established an extension of the projection operator to this setting. In this note, we continue this study for the mixed projection body operator as well as the question of stability.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Hahn-Banach extensions in locally convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We intend to study the uniqueness of the Hahn-Banach extensions of linear functionals on a subspace in locally convex spaces. Various characterizations are derived when a subspace $Y$ has an analogous version of property-U (introduced by Phelps) in a locally convex space, referred to as the property-SNP. We characterize spaces where every subspace has this property. It is demonstrated that a subspace $M$ of a Banach space $E$ has property-U if and only if the subspace $M$ of the locally convex space $E$ endowed with the weak topology has the property-SNP, mentioned above. This investigation circles around exploring the potential connections between the family of seminorms and the unique extension of functionals previously mentioned. We extensively studied this property on the spaces of continuous functions on Tychonoff spaces endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence.</description>

      <title>On the spectral identities and fundamental properties of one-sided Drazin inverses in Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish several fundamental properties of one-sided (generalized) Drazin inverses in Banach algebras, including intertwining properties and reverse order laws. In particular, we introduce the concepts of one-sided strongly pi-regularity, which is shown to be equivalent to one-sided Drazin invertibility. By utilizing the Jacobson's lemma for one-sided regularity, we prove the Jacobson's lemma for one-sided (generalized) Drazin invertibility. These results allow us to derive the spectral identities for one-sided (generalized) Drazin invertible spectra in Banach algebras, as well as the spectral identities for Fredholm type operators acting on Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Weighted Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin Spaces of Optimal Scale: Boundedness of Pseudo-Differential, Trace, and Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a continuation of our work on generalized matrix-weighted Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces with matrix $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ weights. In this article, we aim to establish the boundedness of pseudo-differential, trace, and Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund operators on these spaces. The main tools involved in this article are the molecular and the wavelet characterizations of these spaces. Since generalized matrix-weighted Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces include many classical function spaces such as matrix-weighted Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin spaces, all the results in this article are of wide generality.</description>

      <title>Functions of bounded variation arising from a generalized two-normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first formal development of functions with bounded variation in normed spaces is attributed to Chistyakov [5], and was later extended to the context of 2-normed spaces by Cure, Ferrer S., and Ferrer V. [6]. In this paper, we elaborate on this extension (Definition 4.5), exploring its fundamental properties. The foundational characteristics of functions of bounded 2-variation within the context of generalized two-normed spaces are explored in detail (see Theorems 4.4, 4.12, 4.13). Additionally, it is shown that a function of bounded variation defined on a semi-normed space can generate a function of bounded 2-variation in the context of generalized two-normed spaces (Proposition 4.10).</description>

      <title>Quantified compactness in Lipschitz-free spaces of $[-1,1]^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the members of the Lipschitz-free space of $[-1,1]^n$ are exactly the 0-dimensional flat currents whose "boundary" vanishes. The connection with normal and flat currents allows to use the Federer-Fleming compactness and deformation theorems in this context. We characterize the compact subsets of this Lipschitz-free space and we quantify their $\epsilon$-entropy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study the sharp weak estimate for the $p$-adic $n$-dimensional fractional Hardy operator from $L^p$ to $L^{q,\infty}$. Secondly, we study the sharp bounds for the $m$-linear $n$-dimensional $p$-adic integral operator with a kernel on $p$-adic weighted spaces $H_{\alpha}^{\infty}( \mathbb{Q} _{p}^{n} )$. As an application, the sharp bounds for $p$-adic Hardy and Hilbert operators on $p$-adic weighted spaces are obtained. Finally, we also find the sharp bound for the Hausdorff operator on $p$-adic weighted spaces, which generalizes the previous results.</description>

      <title>Primal and dual characterizations of sign-symmetric norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies primal and dual characterizations of a class of sign-symmetric norms on product vector spaces. Correspondences between these norms and a class of convex functions are established. Explicit formulas for the dual norm and the convex subdifferential of a given primal norm are derived. It is demonstrated that this class of norms is well-suited for studying properties and problems on product spaces. As an application, we study the von Neumann-Jordan constant of norms on product spaces and extend a classical result of Clarkson from Lebesgue spaces to general normed vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Weighted approximation By Max-product Kantrovich type Exponential Sampling Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the convergence characteristics of the Max-Product Kantrovich type exponential sampling series within the weighted space of log-uniformly continuous and bounded functions. The research focuses on deriving fundamental convergence results for the series and analyzing its asymptotic convergence behavior. The study estimates the rate of convergence using the weighted logarithmic modulus of continuity and establishes a quantitative Voronovskaja-type theorem offering insights into the asymptotic behavior of the series. Additionally, we present the example of kernel functions satisfying assumptions of the presented theory along with graphical demonstration and estimates of approximation.</description>

      <title>Discrete analogues of second-order Riesz transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete analogues of many classical operators in harmonic analysis have been widely studied for many years with interesting connections to other areas in mathematics, including ergodic theory and analytic number theory. This paper concerns the problem of identifying the $\ell^p$-norms of discrete analogues of second-order Riesz transforms. Using probabilistic techniques, a class of second-order discrete Riesz transforms $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ is constructed on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$. It is shown that their $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ norms, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, are the same as the norms of the classical second-order Riesz transforms $R^{(jk)}$ in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$. The operators $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ differ from the harmonic analysis analogues of the discrete Riesz transforms, $R^{(jk)}_{\mathrm{dis}}$, by convolution with a function in $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. Applications are given to the discrete Beurling-Ahlfors operator. It is shown that the operators $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ arise by discretization of a class of Calder\'on-Zygmund singular integrals $T^{(jk)}$ which differ from the classical Riesz transforms $R^{(jk)}$ by convolution with a function in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

      <title>Integral representation of translation-invariant operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suppose that $G$ is a locally compact abelian group, $Y$ is a measure space, and $H$ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on $G\times Y$ such that $H$ is naturally embedded into $L^2(G\times Y)$ and it is invariant under the translations associated with $G$. We consider the von Neumann algebra of all bounded linear operators acting on $H$ that commute with these translations. Assuming that this algebra is commutative, we represent its elements as integral operators and characterize the corresponding integral kernels. Furthermore, we give W*-algebra structure on the functions associated with the integral kernels. We apply this general scheme to a series of examples, including rotation- or translation-invariant operators in Bergman or Fock spaces.</description>

      <title>Apodictic discourse and the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bunyakovsky's integral inequality (1859) is one of the familiar tools of modern Analysis. We try and understand what Bunyakovsky did, why he did it, why others did not follow the same path, and explore some of the mathematical (re)interpretations of his inequalities. This is achieved by treating the texts as discourses that provide motivation and proofs by their very discursive structure, in addition to what meets the eye at first reading. Bunyakovsky paper is an outgrowth of the mathematical theory of mean-values in Cauchy's work (1821), but viewed from the point of view of Probability and Statistics. Liouville (1836) gave a result that implies Bunyakovsky's inequality, but did not identify it as significant because his interests lay elsewhere. Grassmann (1862) stated the inequality in abstract form but did not prove it for reasons that can be identified. Finally, by relating the result to quadratic binary forms, Schwarz (1885) opened the way to a geometric interpretation of the inequality that became important in the theory of integral equations. His argument is the source of one of the proofs most commonly taught nowadays. At about the same time, the Rogers-H{\"o}lder inequality suggested generalizations of Cauchy's and Bunyakovsky's results in an entirely different direction. Later extensions and reinterpretations show that no single result, even now, subsumes all known generalizations.</description>

Abstract: We examine the Sobolev space associated with the linear canonical Dunkl transform and explore some properties of the linear canonical Dunkl operators. Building on these results, we establish a real Paley-Wiener theorem for the linear canonical Dunkl transform. Further, we characterize the square-integrable function f whose linear canonical Dunkl transform of the function is supported in the polynomial domain. Finally, we develop the Boas-type Paley-Wiener theorem for the linear canonical Dunkl transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the seventies', Zehnder found a Nash-Moser type implicit function theorem in the analytic set-up. This theorem has found many applications in dynamical systems although its applications require, as a general rule, some efforts. We develop further the analytic theory and give fixed point theorems with direct applications to the study of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Extremizer Stability of Higher-order Hardy--Rellich inequalities for Baouendi--Grushin vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve the $L^p$-Rellich and Hardy-Rellich inequalities in the setting of radial Baouendi--Grushin vector fields. We establish an identity relating the subcritical and critical Hardy inequalities, thereby demonstrating their equivalence. Moreover, we obtain improved versions of these inequalities via an analysis of extremizer stability. In the higher-order setting, we derive Hardy-Rellich type inequalities involving all radial operators in the Grushin framework and prove that all resulting constants are sharp. Finally, for the $L^2$-higher-order cases, we compute exact remainder terms by establishing identities rather than inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the restricted infinite-dimensional Siegel disc as a Marsden-Weinstein symplectic reduced space and as Kaehler quotient of a weak Kaehler manifold. The obtained symplectic form is invariant with respect to the left action of the infinite-dimensional restricted symplectic group and coincides with the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form of the restricted Siegel disc obtained via the identification with an affine coadjoint orbit of the restricted symplectic group, or equivalently with a coadjoint orbit of the universal central extension of the restricted symplectic group.</description>

      <title>A Shimorin-type analytic model on an annulus for left-invertible operators and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.03339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new analytic model for left-invertible operators, which extends both Shimorin's analytic model for left-invertible and analytic operators and Gellar's model for bilateral weighted shift is introduced and investigated. We show that a left-invertible operator $T$, which satisfies certain conditions can be modelled as a multiplication operator $\mathscr{M}_z$ on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of vector-valued analytic functions on an annulus or a disc. A similar result for composition operators in $\ell^2$-spaces is established.</description>

      <title>Composition-Differentiation Operator On Hardy-Hilbert Space of Dirichlet Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a compactness criterion for the composition-differentiation operator \( D_\Phi \) in terms of a decay condition of the mean counting function at the boundary of a half-plane. We provide a sufficient condition of the boundedness of the operator \( D_\Phi \) for the symbol \( \Phi \) with zero characteristic. Additionally, we investigate an estimate for the norm of \( D_\Phi \) in the Hardy-Hilbert space of Dirichlet series, specifically with the symbol \( \Phi(s) = c_1 + c_2 2^{-s} \). We also derive an estimate for the approximation numbers of the operator \( D_\Phi \). Moreover, we determine an explicit conditions under which the operator \( D_\Phi \) is self-adjoint and normal. Finally, we describe the spectrum of \( D_\Phi \) when the symbol \( \Phi(s) = c_1 + c_2 2^{-s} \).</description>

      <title>On existence and uniqueness for non-autonomous parabolic Cauchy problems with rough coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:1511.05134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider existence and uniqueness issues for the initial value problem of parabolic equations $\partial_{t} u = {\rm div} A \nabla u$ on the upper half space, with initial data in $L^p$ spaces. The coefficient matrix $A$ is assumed to be uniformly elliptic, but merely bounded measurable in space and time. For real coefficients and a single equation, this is an old topic for which a comprehensive theory is available, culminating in the work of Aronson. Much less is understood for complex coefficients or systems of equations except for the work of Lions, mainly because of the failure of maximum principles. In this paper, we come back to this topic with new methods that do not rely on maximum principles. This allows us to treat systems in this generality when $p\geq 2$, or under certain assumptions such as bounded variation in the time variable (a much weaker assumption that the usual H\"older continuity assumption) when $p&lt; 2$. We reobtain results for real coefficients, and also complement them. For instance, we obtain uniqueness for arbitrary $L^p$ data, $1\leq p \leq \infty$, in the class $L^\infty(0,T; L^p({\mathbb{R}}^n))$. Our approach to the existence problem relies on a careful construction of propagators for an appropriate energy space, encompassing previous constructions. Our approach to the uniqueness problem, the most novel aspect here, relies on a parabolic version of the Kenig-Pipher maximal function, used in the context of elliptic equations on non-smooth domains. We also prove comparison estimates involving conical square functions of Lusin type and prove some Fatou type results about non-tangential convergence of solutions. Recent results on maximal regularity operators in tent spaces that do not require pointwise heat kernel bounds are key tools in this study.</description>

      <title>Cauchy convergence in V-normed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the notion of normed category as suggested by Lawvere, we introduce notions of Cauchy convergence and cocompleteness which differ from proposals in previous works. Key to our approach is to treat them consequentially as categories enriched in the monoidal-closed category of normed sets. Our notions largely lead to the anticipated outcomes when considering individual metric spaces as small normed categories, but they can be challenging when considering some large categories, like those of semi-normed or normed vector spaces and all linear maps, or of generalized metric spaces and all mappings. These are the key example categories discussed in detail in this paper. Working with a general commutative quantale V as a value recipient for norms, rather than only with Lawvere's quantale of the extended real half-line, we observe that the categorically atypical structure gap between objects and morphisms in the example categories is already present in the underlying normed category of the enriching category of V-normed sets. To show that this normed category and, in fact, all presheaf categories over it, are Cauchy cocomplete, we assume the quantale V to satisfy a couple of light alternative extra properties. Of utmost importance to the general theory is the fact that our notion of normed colimit is subsumed by the notion of weighted colimit of enriched category theory. With this theory we are able to prove that all V-normed categories have correct-size Cauchy cocompletions. We also prove a Banach Fixed Point Theorem for contractive endofunctors of Cauchy cocomplete normed categories.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we show that a von Neumann algebra can be written as the linking von Neumann algebra of a W*-TRO if and only if it contains no abelian direct summand. We also provide some new characterizations of nuclear TROs and $W^\ast$-exact TROs in terms of the properties of their linking algebras.</description>

      <title>On the polar of Schneider's difference body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th-order extension of the difference body $DK$ of a convex body $K\subset\mathbb R^n$, the convex body $D^m(K)$ in $\mathbb R^{nm}$. He conjectured that its volume is minimized for ellipsoids when the volume of $K$ is fixed.
  In this work, we solve a dual version of this problem: we show that the volume of the polar body of $D^m(K)$ is maximized precisely by ellipsoids. For $m=1$ this recovers the symmetric case of the celebrated Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality. We also show that Schneider's conjecture cannot be tackled using standard symmetrization techniques, contrary to this new inequality. As an application for our results, we prove Schneider's conjecture asymptotically \'a la Bourgain-Milman. We also consider a functional version.</description>
