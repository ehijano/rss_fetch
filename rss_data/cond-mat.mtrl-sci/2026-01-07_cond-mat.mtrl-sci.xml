      <title>A large-scale nanocrystal database with aligned synthesis and properties enabling generative inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of nanocrystals has been highly dependent on trial-and-error, due to the complex correlation between synthesis parameters and physicochemical properties. Although deep learning offers a potential methodology to achieve generative inverse design, it is still hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align nanocrystal synthesis routes with their properties. Here, we present the construction of a large-scale, aligned Nanocrystal Synthesis-Property (NSP) database and demonstrate its capability for generative inverse design. To extract structured synthesis routes and their corresponding product properties from literature, we develop NanoExtractor, a large language model (LLM) enhanced by well-designed augmentation strategies. NanoExtractor is validated against human experts, achieving a weighted average score of 88% on the test set, significantly outperforming chemistry-specialized (3%) and general-purpose LLMs (38%). The resulting NSP database contains nearly 160,000 aligned entries and serves as training data for our NanoDesigner, an LLM for inverse synthesis design. The generative capability of NanoDesigner is validated through the successful design of viable synthesis routes for both well-established PbSe nanocrystals and rarely reported MgF2 nanocrystals. Notably, the model recommends a counter-intuitive, non-stoichiometric precursor ratio (1:1) for MgF2 nanocrystals, which is experimentally confirmed as critical for suppressing byproducts. Our work bridges the gap between unstructured literature and data-driven synthesis, and also establishes a powerful human-AI collaborative paradigm for accelerating nanocrystal discovery.</description>

      <title>Molecular Adsorption of H2O on TiO2 and TiO2:Y Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, using theoretical calculations within the framework of the density functional theory, taking into account the dispersive VDW interaction, the processes of adsorption and interaction of a water molecule with a TiO2 surface in various configurations are investigated. At the atomic/molecular level, the interactions of a water molecule with a TiO2 surface have been studied for various orientations. The results of calculations within the framework of DFT+ VDW show that the adsorption energies of single water molecules in different initial positions on the substrate surface vary from-0.72 to-0.84 eV, and the most stable adsorbate structure is the TiO2+ H2O system upon adsorption of a molecule of water, parallel to the Y axis, because during the adsorption of H2O parallel to the Y axis, some favorable effects are observed in the band structure of titanium dioxide. On the one hand, the band gap decreases to 2.59 eV, and on the other hand, a new energy state appears in the band gap with an energy contribution of 0.17 eV, when water is physisorbed and interacts with a titanium atom at a distance of 2.12 {\AA} and occupies a perpendicular position relative to the surface.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Optical Properties and Electronic Structure of Semiconductors of the Cu2NiXS4 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) Family as New Promising Materials for Optoelectronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the optoelectronic characteristics of kesterites of the Cu2NiXS4 system (X = Si, Ge, Sn) were studied. The electronic properties of the Cu2NiXS4 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) system were studied using first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory. For calculations, ab initio codes VASP and Wien2k were used. The high-precision modified Beke-Jones (mBJ) functional and the hybrid HSE06 functional were used to estimate the bandgap, electronic and optical properties. Calculations have shown that when replacing Si with Ge and Sn, the band gap decreases from 2.58 eV to 1.33 eV. Replacing Si with Ge and Sn reduces the overall density of electronic states. In addition, new deep (shallow) states are formed in the band gap of these crystals, which is confirmed by the behavior of their optical properties. The obtained band gap values are compared with existing experimental measurements, demonstrating good agreement between HSE06 calculations and experimental data. The nature of changes in the dielectric constant, absorption capacity and optical conductivity of these systems depending on the photon energy has also been studied. The statistical dielectric constant and refractive index of these materials were found. The results will help increase the amount of information about the properties of the materials under study and will allow the use of these compounds in a wider range of optoelectronic devices, in particular, in solar cells and other devices that use solar radiation to generate electric current.</description>

      <title>Strain effects on the binding and diffusion energies of Au adatoms and CeO2 admolcules on Au, CeO2, MgO and SrTiO3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to study the effects of elastic strains on the binding and diffusion activation energies of Au adatom and CeO2 admolecule on Au (001), Ce-terminated CeO2 (001), MgO (001), SrO- and TiO2-terminationed SrTiO3 (001) surfaces. In preparation for computing these energies, normal and shear strains within the range 0.15% were applied in the plane of the surface of the supercell prior to placing the adsorbed species on the surface. Our study shows that the dependence of binding energies and diffusion barriers of adatoms and molecules on the strain varies significantly among surfaces. The strain was found to alter the symmetry of surface diffusion pathways causing anisotropy of the diffusion barriers. This strain-induced anisotropy depends on the orientation of the applied strains relative to the in-plane crystallographic directions of the free surface. The binding and diffusion activation energies were fit linearly in terms of strain components in the range 0.15% and the extrapolated values compared favorably to DFT computed values up to 0.5%. The scheme presented here for the computation and fitting of the binding and diffusion energies in terms of strain can be used to inform models of surface diffusion, clustering and growth of multi-component and multi-phase thin films and investigate the effect of strain on the self-organization in such systems.</description>

      <title>An altermagnetic materials library in intercalated transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a promising class of magnetic materials owing to their distinctive spin-split band structures in the absence of net magnetization. Here, we present a first-principles investigation of altermagnetism in magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with the general formula T$_y$MX$_2$ (T= 3$d$-transition metal, M= transition-metal, X=chalcogen, $y$= 1/3 or 1/4). For a TMD host with 2H structure, compounds exhibiting A-type antiferromagnetism are $g$-wave altermagnets by symmetry. We identify several intercalated TMDs fulfilling the conditions for altermagnetic order to be realized. Several of these candidate materials display spin-splittings at the Fermi level as large as 100 meV.</description>

      <title>Polymer-Iron Oxide Hybrid Films for Controlling Electrokinetic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrokinetic phenomena at polymer-water interfaces are central to technologies for water purification, ion separations, and energy conversion, yet the ability to systematically control polymer surface charge and associated electrokinetic processes remains limited. Here, we demonstrate a simple liquid-phase infiltration (LPI) method to synthesize polymer-metal oxide hybrid films with controllable interfacial properties. Hydroxy-terminated poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP-OH) brushes grafted to silicon substrates were infiltrated with iron nitrate from ethanolic solution, followed by low-temperature thermal treatment to convert the infiltrated precursor into iron oxide. Spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis confirmed oxide incorporation and hybrid film formation without polymer degradation. Electrokinetic flow characterization reveals that the hybrid films acquire the electrokinetic properties of the infiltrated oxide, with concentration-dependent streaming potentials and surface conductivities closely matching those of pure iron oxide films. These results establish metal oxide infiltration as a scalable and low-cost strategy for controlling interfacial charge in polymer surfaces. The approach introduces new materials and design parameters for tailoring ion selectivity, transport, and energy conversion, with broad implications for the development of advanced membranes, electrokinetic harvesting devices, and polymer-supported oxide electrodes.</description>

      <title>X-ray photo-induced atomic motion in Phase Change Materials and conventional covalent chalcogenide glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) enables direct access to atomic-scale dynamics in disordered materials, revealing both spontaneous and X-ray-induced relaxation processes. Here, we study two compositionally similar alloy glasses near their glass transition temperatures: the phase change material (PCM) Ge15Sb85 and the non-PCM alloy Ge15Te85. Both exhibit X-ray induced atomic motion, yet with markedly different responses. Ge15Sb85 undergoes an immediate transition to a photo-induced yielding state, characterised by stationary dynamics governed solely by the absorbed dose. In contrast, Ge15Te85 shows a progressive slowing-down of the relaxation process, accompanied by a crossover from compressed to stretched exponential decay in the density autocorrelation functions. This behaviour is consistent with the emergence of liquid-like collective motion as supported by de Gennes narrowing in the wave-vector dependence of the dynamics at length scales comparable with the first sharp diffraction peak. Unlike Ge15Sb85, this alloy does not reach a stationary regime within experimental timescales, implying that the yielding transition occurs only after thousands of seconds with the available dose rate. Its response is also temperature dependent: at lower temperatures, the dynamics reflects intrinsic stress relaxation processes, whereas at higher temperatures becomes dose-controlled. These findings demonstrate that the dynamical response to X-ray excitation is not determined solely by chemical composition or bonding character, but results from the interplay between irradiation effects and structural relaxation pathways.</description>

      <title>Tailoring phonon-driven responses in {\alpha}-MoO3 through isotopic enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of polaritonic materials into nanoscale devices requires selective tuning of parameters to realize desired spectral or thermal responses. One robust material is {\alpha}-MoO3, which as an orthorhombic crystal boasts three distinct phonon dispersions, providing three polaritonic dispersions of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) across the mid-infrared (MIR). Here, the tunability of both optical and thermal responses in isotopically enriched {\alpha}-MoO3 (98MoO3, Mo18O3 and 98Mo18O3) are explored. A uniform ~5 % spectral redshift from 18O enrichment is observed in both Raman- and IR-active TO phonons. Both the in- and out-of-plane thermal conductivities for the isotopic variations are reported. Ab initio calculations both replicate experimental findings and analyze the select-mode three-phonon scattering contributions. The HPhPs from each isotopic variation are probed with s-SNOM and their Q- factors are reported. A Q-factor maxima increase of ~50 % along the [100] in the RB2 and ~100 % along the [001] in the RB3 are reported for HPhPs supported in 98Mo18O3. Observations in both real and Fourier space of higher-order HPhP modes propagating in single slabs of isotopically enriched {\alpha}-MoO3 without the use of a subdiffractional surface scatterer are presented here. This work illustrates the tunability of {\alpha}-MoO3 for thermal and nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale High-k SrTiO3 Dielectrics with Rational Barrier-layer Design for Low Leakage and High Charge Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-k oxides such as SrTiO3 promise large capacitance, but their dielectric response is often limited by leakage currents due to reduced bandgaps. We show that introducing a thin barrier layer beneath SrTiO3 is a simple and effective way to suppress leakage and increase charge density. Using hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, we grew uniform SrTiO3 films on Nb:SrTiO3, CaSnO3/Nb:SrTiO3, and 2-inch SiO2/p-Si stacks to directly compare how different barrier layers influence device behavior. Both CaSnO3 and SiO2 reduce leakage, but the ultra-wide-bandgap SiO2 layer enables much higher operating voltages, yielding charge densities exceeding 5x10^13 cm^-2 at room temperature - more than a fivefold enhancement compared to devices without a barrier layer. This improvement comes with a predictable trade-off: the lower dielectric constant of SiO2 reduces overall capacitance, making its thickness an important design parameter. Together, these results demonstrate that rational barrier-layer engineering - including wafer-scale integration on Si - provides a clear pathway to achieving higher charge densities in SrTiO3-based dielectric devices.</description>

      <title>Contact resistance and interfacial engineering: Advances in high-performance 2D-TMD based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of advanced electronic devices is contingent upon sustainable material development and pioneering research breakthroughs. Traditional semiconductor-based electronic technology faces constraints in material thickness scaling and energy efficiency. Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronics and optoelectronic applications, boasting high electron mobility, mechanical strength, and a customizable band gap. Despite these merits, the Fermi level pinning effect introduces uncontrollable Schottky barriers at metal-2D-TMD contacts, challenging prediction through the Schottky-Mott rule. These barriers fundamentally lead to elevated contact resistance and limited current-delivery capability, impeding the enhancement of 2D-TMD transistor and integrated circuit properties. In this review, we succinctly outline the Fermi pinning effect mechanism and peculiar contact resistance behavior at metal/2D-TMD interfaces. Subsequently, highlights on the recent advances in overcoming contact resistance in 2D-TMDs devices, encompassing interface interaction and hybridization, van der Waals (vdW) contacts, prefabricated metal transfer and charge-transfer doping will be addressed. Finally, the discussion extends to challenges and offers insights into future developmental prospects.</description>

      <title>Integrated magnonic chip using cascaded logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transistor transformed not only electronics but everyday life, and the integrated circuit - now simply the "chip" - made computation scalable and ubiquitous. Magnonics has long promised a parallel path to low-energy information processing by using spin waves instead of charge. Progress, however, has been limited by two fundamental obstacles: intrinsic attenuation of spin waves and the requirement for precisely normalised output intensity and input phase to ensure reliable logic operation - conditions that are difficult to maintain in large-scale circuits owing to inevitable imperfections. Here, we report an integrated magnonic circuit that overcomes both limitations through engineered nonlinearity in nanoscale yttrium iron garnet waveguides. Nonlinear self-adjustment of the spin wave phase renders logic operation insensitive to the relative phases of the inputs, while a deeply nonlinear, threshold-activated self-normalised excitation restores and standardises the output intensity. Using space-resolved micro-focused Brillouin light scattering, we demonstrate reconfigurable AND, OR and three-input majority gates and realise deterministic cascading across sequential stages, establishing a scalable on-chip logic primitive. The architecture operates with gigahertz frequencies, supports dynamic threshold control for functional reconfiguration, and is compatible with scalable integration, making it attractive for adaptive and neuromorphic computing. By resolving phase-independent operation and signal restoration at the level of device physics, this work advances magnonics from isolated proof-of-concept devices towards integrated magnonic chips that can complement advanced CMOS in energy-constrained computing tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Screening of Organic Singlet Fission Molecules Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singlet fission (SF) provides a promising strategy for surpassing the Shockley-Queisser limit in photovoltaics. However, the identification of efficient SF materials is hindered by the limited availability of suitable molecular candidates and the high computational costs associated with conventional quantum-chemical methods for excited states. In this study, we introduce a high-throughput screening framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) with multi-level validation to accelerate the discovery of SF-active molecules. Trained on a previously reported FORMED database, the GNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting SF-relevant excited-state properties, demonstrating a mean absolute error of about 0.1 eV for S1, T1, and T2 excitation energies. This capability facilitates the efficient screening of over 20 million molecular structures from both OE62 and QO2Mol databases. Our framework significantly reduces the computational demand associated with Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory validation by four orders of magnitude and identifies 180 potential SF molecules along with more than 1000 conformers. Subsequent assessments regarding synthetic accessibility, GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations further highlight a subset of experimentally feasible candidates among these SF candidates. The approach presented herein exemplifies an effective strategy for accelerating the discovery of functional molecules with optoelectronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Radiation-tolerant semiconductors have traditionally been engineered by the principle of suppressing defect accumulation and amorphization, based on the assumption that radiation damage is inherently stochastic. Here we show that, in monoclinic $\beta$-\ce{Ga2O3}, a promising ultrawide-bandgap semiconductor, surface crystallographic orientation deterministically governs radiation tolerance through highly anisotropic kinetics of the $\beta$-to-$\gamma$ phase transition. Using machine-learning molecular dynamics coupled with a local configurational-entropy descriptor, we quantitatively map anisotropic $\beta$-to-$\gamma$ transition kinetics, showing that the critical dose, transition-layer depth, and kinetic stability of the $\gamma$-phase are fundamentally governed by surface orientation. Under ion irradiation, non-channeling surfaces such as (100), (001), and (-201) undergo severe surface amorphization, whereas the strongly channeling (010) surface resists damage accumulation and promotes subsurface $\gamma$-phase nucleation. During thermal annealing recovery process, these initial states follow two distinct recovery pathways: the channeling (010) surface reverts directly from $\gamma$-to-$\beta$, whereas non-channeling surfaces follow a sequential amorphous-to-$\gamma$-to-$\beta$ transition pathway. This work establishes surface orientation as a fundamental design principle for achieving radiation tolerance through controlled polymorphic transitions, providing a universal framework for engineering functional materials capable of withstanding extreme irradiation environments.</description>

      <title>Transformation Journey of Zr-based MOFs: Study on Mechanics and Hydrogen Storage under Doping Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the transformation journey of Zr-based Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), focusing on enhancing their mechanical properties and hydrogen storage capacities through doping regulation. MOFs, a versatile class of crystalline porous materials, have garnered significant attention due to their unique properties and broad potential applications in gas storage, separation, catalysis, and sensing. Among them, Zr-based MOFs stand out for their exceptional stability and high surface area. This research systematically investigates six key Zr-based MOFs (UIO-66, UIO-67, UIO-68, MOF-801, MOF-802, and MOF-841) using multiscale computational methods, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT). The study explores the impact of metal ion substitution (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) on the mechanical and hydrogen storage properties of these MOFs. Our findings reveal that metal ion substitution significantly influences the mechanical stability and hydrogen adsorption capacity of Zr-based MOFs, providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of high-performance MOF materials.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall transport in Mn$_{3}$Sn$_{0.5}$X$_{0.5}$C (X = Ge and Zn)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mn-based antiperovskites that exhibit topological surface states show potential applications in spintronics, magnetoelectronics, and quantum devices owing to the interplay between magnetism and topology. In this family of compounds, Mn$3$SnC exhibits a concurrent ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground state below $T \sim 285$ K, along with a Berry curvature driven anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the anomalous Hall effect in Ge- and Zn-doped Mn$3$SnC compounds, namely Mn$3$Sn${0.5}$Ge${0.5}$C (MSGC) and Mn$3$Sn${0.5}$Zn${0.5}$C (MSZC). MSGC undergoes a paramagnetic to concurrent antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic transition at $T_C \sim 300$ K, whereas MSZC exhibits a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at $T_C \sim 240$ K, followed by a ferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition at $T_N \sim 170$ K. The electronic transport in these compounds is governed by electron-phonon and electron-magnon scattering and shows anomalous Hall resistivity $\rho^A_{xy}$. Our analysis indicates that the anomalous Hall effect arises from contributions of skew scattering and intrinsic Berry curvature mechanisms, with electron-phonon and electron-magnon scattering playing an important role in skew scattering at high temperatures. Ge and Zn doping in Mn$_3$SnC significantly enhances the anomalous Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Disclination Skin-topological Effects in Non-Hermitian Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk-disclination correspondence (BDC) is a fundamental concept in Hermitian systems that has been widely applied to predict disclination states. Recently, disclination states have also been observed and experimentally verified in non-Hermitian systems with C6 lattice symmetry, where gain and loss are introduced to induce non-Hermiticity. In this Letter, we propose a non-Hermitian two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) disclination model with skin-topological (ST) disclination states, and calculate its biorthogonal Zak phase. Together with the real-space disclination index, we predict the emergence of disclination states in a C4-symmetric non-Hermitian lattice and the corresponding fractional charge. We also generalize the symmetry indicator within the biorthogonal framework to predict the anomalous filling near the disclination core. Experimentally, the model is implemented on a nonreciprocal circuit platform, where we analyze the impedance matrix characterized by complex eigenfrequencies and directly observe the ST disclination states. Our work further extends the bulk-disclination correspondence to the non-Hermitian realm.</description>

      <title>Observation of spin-valley locked nodal lines in a quasi-2D altermagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay among quantum degrees of freedom-spin, orbital and momentum-has emerged as a fertile ground for realizing magnetic quantum states with transformative potential for electronic and spintronic technologies. Prominent examples include ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals and antiferromagnetic axion insulators. Recently, altermagnets(AMs) have been identified as a distinct spin-splitting class of collinear antiferromagnets(AFMs), characterized by crystal symmetry that connects magnetic sublattices in real space and enforces C-paired spin-momentum locking in reciprocal space. These materials combine the advantages of nonrelativistic spin-polarization akin to FMs and vanished net-magnetization as AFMs, making them highly promising for spintronic applications. Furthermore, they introduce nontrivial spin-momentum locking spin texture as an additional degree of freedom for realizing novel quantum phases. In this work, we report the discovery of a new type of spin-valley-locked nodal line phase in the layered AM Rb-intercalated V{_2}Te{_2}O. By combining high-resolution spin and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with first-principles calculations, we observe the coexistence of both spinless and spinful nodal lines near the Fermi level. Remarkably, the spinful nodal lines exhibit uniform spin polarization within each valley, while displaying opposite spin polarizations across symmetry-paired valleys-a unique feature we term spin-valley-locked nodal lines, which is exclusive to AMs. Direct measurements of out-of-plane band dispersion using a side-cleaving technique reveal the two-dimensional nature of these nodal lines. Our findings not only unveil a previously unexplored topological phase in AMs where valley-locked spin as an additional quantum character but also establish RbV{_2}Te{_2}O as a promising platform for spintronics, valleytronics, and moire-engineered quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of Intrinsic Anomalous Hall and Nernst Effects in Altermagnetic MnTe at Realistic Doping Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal MnTe has emerged as a prototypical g-wave altermagnet, hosting time-reversal symmetry breaking in momentum space despite a vanishing net magnetization. While this symmetry breaking theoretically allows for an intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, experimentally observed signals have remained weak. In this work, we investigate the origin of this suppression and demonstrate a strategy to amplify anomalous transport responses within the experimentally accessible doping regime. Using a $\bm{k}\cdot\bm{p}$ effective model, we reveal that near the valence band maximum, which corresponds to the energy window relevant for typical hole doping ($\sim10^{19}cm^{-3}$), the intrinsic Hall effect is suppressed due to a symmetry-enforced cancellation of opposing Berry curvature contributions. We propose that breaking the crystalline symmetry via volume-conserving biaxial strain lifts this cancellation, resulting in a significant enhancement of the anomalous Hall conductivity by orders of magnitude. This strain-induced Fermi surface distortion also amplifies the anomalous Nernst effect. Furthermore, the analysis of the spin texture confirms that these strain-enabled anomalous transport signatures emerge while preserving the zero net magnetization.</description>

      <title>Surface reconstruction-driven band folding and spin-orbit enhancement at the $\alpha$-antimonene/Au(111) interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic properties of the two-dimensional (2D) $\alpha$ phase of antimonene are unique, featuring unpinned Dirac cones that can be moved with strain. Here we investigate the structural and electronic properties of an epitaxial 2D $\alpha$-antimonene, grown on Au(111). Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density-functional theory, we reveal a strong hybridization at the Sb/Au interface, which imprints a rectangular reconstruction in the Au states, producing a band folding and hybrid bands exhibiting trigonal pockets. Additionally, hybridization displaces part of the Au wavefunction in regions of large electrostatic potential gradient, thereby enhancing spin-orbit splitting. Our work underscores that the pristine electronic properties of $\alpha$-antimonene may be deeply modified by its substrate, and even overwhelmed by the bands of the latter, and also shows that spin-orbit interaction in a heavy metal (Au) can be substantially enhanced by a lighter element (Sb).</description>

      <title>DeepH-pack: A general-purpose neural network package for deep-learning electronic structure calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational physics and materials science, first-principles methods, particularly density functional theory, have become central tools for electronic structure prediction and materials design. Recently, rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to reshape the research landscape, giving rise to the emerging field of deep-learning electronic structure calculations. Despite numerous pioneering studies, the field remains in its early stages; existing software implementations are often fragmented, lacking unified frameworks and standardized interfaces required for broad community adoption. Here we present DeepH-pack, a comprehensive and unified software package that integrates first-principles calculations with deep learning. By incorporating fundamental physical principles into neural-network design, such as the nearsightedness principle and the equivariance principle, DeepH-pack achieves robust cross-scale and cross-material generalizability. This allows models trained on small-scale structures to generalize to large-scale and previously unseen materials. The toolkit preserves first-principles accuracy while accelerating electronic structure calculations by several orders of magnitude, establishing an efficient and intelligent computational paradigm for large-scale materials simulation, high-throughput materials database construction, and AI-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Many-electron systems with fractional electron number and spin: exact properties above and below the equilibrium total spin value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the fundamental question of what is the ensemble ground state of a general, finite, many-electron system at zero temperature, with a given, possibly fractional, electron number $N_{tot}$ and a given $z$-projection of the spin, $M_{tot}$, distinguishing between low- and high-spin cases. For the low-spin case, the general form of the ensemble ground state has been rigorously derived in J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 15, 2337 (2024), finding the presence of an ambiguity in the ground state. Here we further discuss this ambiguity, and show that it can be removed via maximization of the entropy. For the high-spin case, we find that the form of the ensemble ground state strongly depends on the system in question. Furthermore, we prove three general properties which characterize the ensemble, and narrow the list of pure states it may consist of. We relate the frontier Kohn-Sham orbital energies to total energy differences, providing a generalization of the ionization potential theorem to systems with arbitrary fractional $M_{tot}$. Furthermore, we derive expressions for new derivative discontinuities, which appear as jumps in the KS potentials when crossing a boundary in the $N_{\uparrow}$-$N_{\downarrow}$ plane. Our analytical results are supported by an extensive numerical analysis of the Atomic Spectra Database of the National Institute of Standards. The new exact conditions for many-electron systems derived in this work are instrumental for development of advanced approximations in density functional theory and other many-electron methods.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Experimental Evidence of a Transitory State in the HDA-LDA Transition in Alumino-sodo-silicate Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural evolution with temperature of pure silica (SiO2), sodium-silicate (5Na2O-95SiO2, 10Na2O-90SiO2 and 25Na2O-75SiO2) and albite (15Na2O-15Al2O3-75SiO2) glasses previously densified from hot compression is monitored with a combination of small and wide angle x-ray scattering. Transient scattering maxima in the length scales associated with both techniques indicate the presence of a transitory state, suggesting the classification of the initial and final states as distinct glass states in the context of polyamorphism. In all glasses, a transient intensity peak in the small angle scattering is observed, consistent with the nucleation of a new amorphous state. Based on a comparison with the phenomenology observed in supercooled and glassy water, we propose that this structural evolution provide a strong evidence of the glass polyamorphism as the consequence of the existence of an underlying but thermodynamically defined liquid-liquid transition, independent on the polymerization degree of the system.</description>

      <title>Charge transport in liquid-crystalline phthalocyanine-based thin-film transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a series of liquid-crystalline phthalocyanines (metal-free and Cu, Zn, Ni, Co complexes) by correlating their vibrational signatures with their electronic performance in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). Raman spectroscopy reveals metal-dependent distortions of the phthalocyanine macrocycle, reflected in systematic shifts of the C-N-C and M-N vibrational modes. When integrated into OTFTs, all compounds exhibit markedly enhanced current response under ultrahigh vacuum compared to an N2-rich environment, demonstrating that intrinsic charge transport is strongly suppressed by atmospheric species. Temperature-dependent measurements (100-300 K) show clear threshold-voltage shifts driven by deep interface and bulk traps, while all devices display thermally activated mobility with low activation energies (14-20 meV). These results highlight how mesomorphic order, metal coordination, and environmental conditions collectively govern charge transport in liquid-crystalline phthalocyanines, offering design guidelines for their use as orientable semiconducting materials in organic electronics.</description>

      <title>Novel fast Li-ion conductors for solid-state electrolytes from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-throughput computational screening for fast lithium-ion conductors to identify promising materials for application in all solid-state electrolytes. Starting from more than 30,000 Li-containing experimental structures sourced from Crystallography Open Database, Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and Materials Platform for Data Science, we perform highly automated calculations to identify electronic insulators. On these ~1000 structures, we use molecular dynamics simulations to estimate Li-ion diffusivities using the pinball model, which describes the potential energy landscape of diffusing lithium with accuracy similar to density functional theory while being 200-500 times faster. Then we study the ~60 most promising and previously unknown fast conductors with full first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at several temperatures to estimate their activation barriers. The results are discussed in detail for the 9 fastest conductors, including $Li_7NbO_6$ which shows a remarkable ionic conductivity of ~5 mS/cm at room temperature. We further present the entire screening protocol, including the workflows where the accuracy of the pinball model is improved self-consistently, necessary to automatically running the required calculations and analysing their results.</description>

      <title>Interface-induced band bending and charge separation in all-organic ZnPc/F$_x$ZnPc heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic semiconductors are attractive building blocks for electronic devices due to their low cost and flexibility. Furthermore, heterostructures with type-II band alignments can efficiently separate photogenerated charges via a charge transfer and separation process.
  Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate model interfaces formed by zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and its fluorinated derivatives (F$_8$ZnPc and F$_{16}$ZnPc). We demonstrate that these interfaces not only exhibit a type-II band offset, but also band bending. The band bending causes both the LUMO and HOMO states to localize away from the interface. Therefore, the band bending creates a strong driving force for charge separation. We used ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) to experimentally confirm this predicted band bending. The wavefunction envelopes of vertically-stacked molecules resemble particle-in-a-box states, but this shape is lost when the molecules are staggered.
  These results elucidate how interface-induced band bending facilitates charge separation in all-organic heterostructures and suggest a design pathway toward improved performance in organic photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03207v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description>

      <title>A Unified Computational Framework for Two Dimensional Diffusion Limited Aggregation via Finite-Size Scaling, Multifractality, and Morphological Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA), the canonical model for non-equilibrium fractal growth, emerges from the simple rule of irreversible attachment by random walkers. Despite four decades of study, a unified computational framework reconciling its stochastic algorithm, universal fractal dimension, multifractal growth measure, and finite-size effects remains essential for applications from materials science to geomorphology. Through large-scale simulations (clusters up to $N = 10^6$ particles) in two dimensions, we perform a tripartite analysis: (1) We establish a definitive finite-size scaling collapse, extracting the universal fractal dimension $D = 1.712 \pm 0.015$ and identifying the crossover to boundary-dominated growth at a scaled mass $x_0 \approx 0.10 \pm 0.02$. (2) We quantify the full multifractal spectrum of the harmonic measure ($\Delta\alpha \approx 1.13$), directly linking the stochastic algorithm to the deterministic Laplacian growth equation $\nabla^2 p = 0$ and explaining the screening effect via an exponential decay $\eta \sim e^{-r/\xi}$ with screening length $\xi = 22.7 \pm 0.8$ lattice units. (3) We provide a complete morphological characterization, revealing power-law branch length distributions ($\tau \approx 2.1$) and angular branching preferences ($\sim 72^\circ$). This work computationally validates DLA as a robust universality class and provides a scalable methodology for analyzing diffusion-controlled pattern formation across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Collision of Exceptional Points on Nonorientable Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Band degeneracies, ranging from Hermitian Dirac points to non-Hermitian exceptional points (EPs), play a central role in topological phase transitions. Beyond the topology of individual degeneracies, their mutual interactions yield richer phenomena. A representative example is the anomalous non-annihilating collision of pairwise-created degeneracies, previously believed to occur only in non-Abelian multiband systems. Here, we theoretically reveal and experimentally demonstrate that such an anomalous collision can emerge even in a simple two-band system without non-Abelian nature. In a two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice whose Brillouin zone forms a nonorientable Klein bottle, two EPs with opposite topological charges, pairwise created from a hybrid point, merge into a new vortex point upon re-encounter, instead of annihilating. Remarkably, the hybrid point is a defective degeneracy featuring no eigenenergy braiding, whereas the vortex point is a non-defective degeneracy yet exhibits nontrivial eigenenergy braiding. This process manifests a non-Hermitian phase transition from a gapped phase to a gapless phase, a scenario that we directly observe in a hybrid-dimensional acoustic lattice via momentum-resolved band braid and Berry phase measurements. Our findings identify nonorientability as a new arena for engineering band degeneracies and topological phases, and pave the way for experimentally exploring the interplay between exceptional and nonorientable topology.</description>

      <title>Fermi Sets: Universal and interpretable neural architectures for fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Fermi Sets, a universal and physically interpretable neural architecture for fermionic many-body wavefunctions. Building on a ``parity-graded'' representation [1], we prove that any continuous fermionic wavefunction on a compact domain can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a linear combination of K antisymmetric basis functions--such as pairwise products or Slater determinants--multiplied by symmetric functions. A key result is that the number of required bases is provably small: K=1 suffices in one-dimensional continua (and on lattices in any dimension), K=2 suffices in two dimensions, and in higher dimensions K grows at most linearly with particle number. The antisymmetric bases can be learned by small neural networks, while the symmetric factors are implemented by permutation-invariant networks whose width scales only linearly with particle number. Thus, Fermi Sets achieve universal approximation of fermionic wavefunctions with minimal overhead while retaining clear physical interpretability.</description>

      <title>Fluids at an electrostatically active surface: Optimum in interfacial friction and electrohydrodynamic drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Analogy of Quantum Baldin Sum Rule for Optimal Causal Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass law is a cornerstone in predicting sound transmission loss, yet it neglects the constraints of causal dispersion. Current causality-based theories, such as the Rozanov limit, are applicable only to one-port reflective absorbers. Here, we derive a universal sum rule governing causal scattering in acoustic systems, establishing a rigorous analogy to the Baldin sum rule in quantum field theory. This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Thermalized buckling of extensible, semiflexible polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euler buckling of rods is a long-studied mechanical instability, and it remains relevant to this day, as the constituent components in many biological and physical systems are linear polymers, such as microtubules or carbon nanotubes. At finite temperature, if a polymer is shorter than its persistence length, the polymer is semiflexible, and its elasticity remains rod-like. But polymers can also stretch due to their finite extensibility, which can couple to energetically cheap bending deformations in nonlinear ways when a load is applied to the system. We show how the interplay between thermal fluctuations and nonlinear elasticity dramatically modifies the Euler buckling instability for compressed semiflexible polymers in a fixed strain ensemble. We identify a Ginzburg-like length scale beyond which thermally excited undulations lead to a softened Young's modulus, while the polymer nevertheless remains semiflexible. Both perturbative calculations and numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest a qualitative change in several scaling properties of the buckling transition. The critical compressional strain for thermal buckling now increases with system size, in contrast to athermal buckling, where it decreases with system size. Renormalization group calculations confirm this picture, and also show that thermal buckling is controlled by a new fixed point with different critical exponents compared to classical Euler buckling.</description>

      <title>Inverse magnetic melting effect in vdW-like Kondo lattice CeSn$_{0.75}$Sb$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the intimate connection between magnetic orders and the interplay among multiple degrees of freedom in heavy-fermion systems, controlling and understanding the associated inverse melting effect is crucial for unveiling novel condensed-matter states and their potential applications. Here, we report the growth of single crystalline quasi-two-dimensional van-der-Waals-like Kondo lattice CeSn$_{0.75}$Sb$_2$, and its physical properties by a combination of transport / magnetic / thermodynamic measurements. We find that it hosts a fragile antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and a cluster glass (CG) ground state, both of which are highly sensitive to external fields. Upon cooling under low in-plane magnetic fields, the AFM phase evolves into a polarized paramagnetic phase, either directly or indirectly through the intermediate CG phase. This process constitutes an inverse magnetic melting effect that restores the broken translational / rotational symmetries. Our work provides a rare paradigm of inverse magnetic melting effect in vdW-like heavy-fermion materials, and enriches the physics in conventional Kondo-lattice models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AlYN and AlScN have recently emerged as promising nitride materials that can be integrated with GaN to form two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at heterojunctions. Electron transport properties in these heterostructures have been enhanced through careful design and optimization of epitaxial growth conditions. In this work, we report for the first time Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of 2DEGs in AlYN/GaN and AlScN/GaN heterostructures, grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. SdH oscillations provide direct access to key 2DEG parameters at the Fermi level: (1) carrier density, (2) electron effective mass (m* ~ 0.24 me for AlYN/GaN and m* ~ 0.25 me for AlScN/GaN), and (3) quantum scattering time (~ 68 fs for AlYN/GaN and ~ 70 fs for AlScN/GaN). These measurements of fundamental transport properties provide critical insights for advancing emerging nitride semiconductors for future high-frequency and power electronics.</description>

      <title>Signatures of moir\'e intralayer biexcitons and exciton-phason coupling in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions among electronic and lattice degrees-of-freedom are foundational to various phases in condensed-matter physics, yet the dynamic interplay between excitonic and phononic quasiparticles represents an equivalent, underexplored frontier. Moir\'e superlattices provide an ideal platform for realizing these interactions by offering localized intralayer excitons (IALX) and ultralow-energy collective lattice modes, such as phasons. Here, by optically suppressing ultrafast charge-transfer (CT) to interlayer excitons in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures, we uncover dynamics of moir\'e IALX revealing long lifetimes ({\tau} &gt; 1000 ps) arising from localized Wannier and in-plane CT nature. We then observe moir\'e intralayer intervalley biexcitons with binding energy ~ 16 meV, with long lifetimes due to moir\'e confinement. Furthermore, we find time-domain signatures of strong coupling between moir\'e-IALX and ~ 10 micro-eV phasons, evidenced as twist-angle-dependent GHz oscillations in IALX dynamics. Our findings establish moir\'e superlattices as interacting hybrid quantum systems and for engineering non-equilibrium phenomena, as well as for GHz-scale optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductance across bonded SiOx-SiOx interfaces in hybrid bonding process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid bonding is a pivotal technology for enabling three dimensional integrated circuits. Among the foremost challenges facing 3D IC implementation is thermal management, where a deep understanding of heat conduction across bonded interfaces is essential for addressing heat dissipation and reliability issues. Nevertheless, the thermal conductance of bonded dielectric-dielectric interfaces remains poorly understood. In this study, we employ the low-temperature bonding technique integral to hybrid bonding to fabricate SiO-SiO interfaces and investigate their thermal boundary conductance using time domain thermoreflectance. Structural characterizations show high quality bonded interfaces. By fitting the data with an equivalent multilayer thermal model, we establish a lower limit TBC of 150 MW/m2-K for the SiO-SiO interfaces, which corresponds to a thermal resistance lower than that of a 9.2-nm-thick dielectric layer. These findings offer valuable insights into thermal transport in hybrid-bonded structures and provide critical guidance for the thermal design of advanced packaging solutions.</description>

Abstract: Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05481v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vision of a hydrogen economy demands efficient platforms to close the gap between sustainable proton sources and solid-state hydrogen carriers. Metal hydrides serve as key carriers, yet their synthesis remains constrained by the energy-intensive use of high-pressure H2, which fragments the hydrogen chain. Here, we overturn this paradigm by transforming two classic degradation mechanisms, acidic corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement, into a constructive materials-design strategy. We demonstrate that synergistic control of these processes in acid enables the in-situ engineering of a "hydrogen-trapping cage" (HTC) microstructure within metals. Composed of a dense defect network, this cage directly captures and stabilizes protons as hydrides under mild conditions, guided by the universal criterion |DeltaPeq| &gt; DeltaPph. Using this platform, we synthesize over 20 hydrides, including challenging targets such as LiH and NaH, and showcase its functional power with a cage-rich titanium hydride electrocatalyst. This catalyst achieves an exceptional current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for nitrate-to-ammonia conversion, attributed to rapid H- transport within the engineered cage. This work establishes a transformative "failure-to-function" paradigm, delivering an integrated platform that unifies hydrogen capture, stabilization, and conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron accumulation in interatomic regions is a fundamental quantum phenomenon dictating chemical bonding and material properties, yet its origin remains elusive across disciplines. Here, we report a counterintuitive quantum effect -- potential-barrier affinity (PBA) -- revealed by solving the Schr\"odinger equation for a crystalline potential. PBA effect drives significant interatomic electron accumulation when electron energy exceeds the barrier maximum. This effect essentially determines interatomic electron density patterns, governing microstructures and properties of condensed matters. Our theory overturns the traditional wisdom that the interstitial electron localization in electride requires potential-well constraints or hybrid orbitals, and it serves the fundamental mechanism underlying the formation of conventional chemical bonds. This work delivers a paradigm shift in understanding electron distribution and establishes a theoretical foundation for the microscopic design of material properties.</description>

Abstract: Developing reliable pseudopotentials for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT), especially for transition metals, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for analyzing pseudization strategies for OF-DFT calculations. From the analysis arises a proposed pseudization method which involves constructing local pseudopotentials by targeting existing Kohn-Sham DFT pseudopotentials through an optimized effective potential procedure. We produce four distinct sets of local pseudopotentials and evaluate their accuracy and transferability on the transition metal elements. Our results indicate a substantial improvement over previously available pseudopotentials. Although current OF-DFT functionals still only reach a qualitative accuracy for transition metals, our newly developed pseudopotentials provide a rigorous framework for further methodological advancements.</description>

Abstract: Predicting the growth of large cracks in brittle materials is a fundamental unresolved problem in fracture mechanics. Under out-of-plane shear loading, an initially planar crack may fragment into multiple cracks, forming an echelon crack pattern. Explaining this phenomenon is essential for developing a general theory of crack growth. Although numerous empirical criteria have been proposed in the literature, none provide a unified explanation of all observed features and are largely restricted to two-dimensional growth in linear elastic isotropic materials. In this Letter, we confront a classical set of echelon crack growth experiments using two phase-field approaches: the classical variational model and a strength-constrained model. We show that, contrary to prevailing views, the variational model based solely on Griffith's energetic competition between elastic and fracture energies is fundamentally incomplete even for predicting the growth of large cracks. By incorporating a material strength surface that constrains the regions in which a crack can grow, the resulting model accurately predicts echelon crack growth without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about material or geometrical disorder. Results are presented for both soft and hard materials, confirming the model's general applicability to any brittle material. We further identify two governing non-dimensional parameters that control crack orientation and morphology and demonstrate that one of them, the ratio of shear to tensile strength, determines whether crack paths are more influenced by energy-based or stress-based empirical criteria, thereby reconciling these criteria within a single framework.</description>

      <title>Topical Review: The rise of Klein tunneling in low-dimensional materials and superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review recent advances in Klein and anti-Klein tunneling in one- and two-dimensional materials. Using a general tight-binding framework applied to multiple periodic systems, we establish the criteria for the emergence of Klein tunneling based on the conservation of an effective reduced pseudospin. The inclusion of higher-order terms in the wave vector leads to nontrivial matching conditions for wave scattering at interfaces. We further examine the emergence of multiple types of Klein tunneling in two-dimensional materials beyond graphene, including phosphorene and borophene, as well as in one-dimensional systems such as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. Finally, we discuss how these tunneling phenomena can be tested in both synthesized and artificial lattices, including elastic metamaterials, optical, photonic, phononic, and superconducting platforms, demonstrating the universality of Klein tunneling across different wave natures and length scales.</description>

      <title>Tuning Separator Chemistry: Improving Zn Anode Compatibility via Functionalized Chitin Nanofibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.</description>

Abstract: Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, yet their potential for optoelectronic applications remains largely unexplored. Here, we report high-performance photodetectors based on van der Waals KV$_3$Sb$_5$/WSe$_2$ heterojunctions. A high-quality Schottky interface readily forms between KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and WSe$_2$, enabling efficient separation and transport of photoinduced carriers. Under 520 nm illumination, the device achieves an open-circuit voltage up to 0.6 V, a responsivity of 809 mA/W, and a fast response time of 18.3 us. This work demonstrates the promising optoelectronic applications of Kagome metals and highlights the potential of KV$_3$Sb$_5$-based van der Waals heterostructures for high-performance photodetection.</description>

      <title>Light-Driven Skyrmion Crystal Generation in Plasmonic Metasurfaces Through the Inverse Faraday Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological structures defined by a winding vector configuration that yields a quantized topological charge. In magnetic materials, skyrmions manifest as stable, mobile spin textures, positioning them at the forefront of spintronics research. Meanwhile, their optical counterparts unlock new possibilities for manipulating and directing light at the nanoscale. Exploring the territories where magnetism and optics meet therefore holds immense promise for ultrafast control over magnetic processes. Here, we report the generation of a skyrmion-topological lattice through the inverse Faraday effect in a plasmonic metasurface. Specifically, a hexagonal array of gold nanodisks induces unidirectional drift photocurrents in each nanodisk, while counterpropagating phantom currents arise in the hexagonal interstices. This interplay creates a lattice of skyrmionic magnetic textures. Crucially, the all optical, large scale formation of skyrmions potentially at ultrafast timescales offers a pathway for integrating these topological spin textures into magnetic materials, laying the groundwork for next-generation data storage and processing technologies.</description>

      <title>Multiscale contact mechanics for elastoplastic contacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We test Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory for elastoplastic solids, assuming a constant penetration hardness. Using a numerical model based on the boundary element method, we simulate the contact between a flat rigid surface and an elastic-perfectly plastic half-space with a randomly rough surface. The theory's predictions for elastic, plastic, and total contact area agree quantitatively with the numerical results. The simulations also support the boundary conditions assumed in the theory, namely that the stress probability vanishes at both zero and yield stress. These findings reinforce the validity of the theory for systems with constant hardness.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Altermagnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental role of magnetic materials in modern science and technology has driven a rapid surge in research on unconventional magnetism in recent years. In particular, altermagnets, which simultaneously exhibit zero net magnetization in real space and anisotropic spin splitting in momentum space, have garnered significant interest for both fundamental physics and technological applications. Among these, $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ stands as the pioneering and most extensively studied altermagnet. While the intrinsic magnetic order of $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ is still a subject of active debate, numerous exotic phenomena characteristic of altermagnetism have been observed in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ samples. In this review, we explore each facet of the altermagnetism through specific case studies in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, systematically surveying its crystal and magnetic structures, electronic band properties, and transport phenomena. We critically assess the debate surrounding the intrinsic magnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, incorporating evidence from altermagnetic signatures in transport, as well as contrasting results from magnetic and spectroscopic measurements. Finally, possible future research directions in this field are discussed.</description>

      <title>Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of the interactions between these quasiparticles is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to important exchange processes that can take place between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work, we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal in position space and depends on the combined spin configurations of the electrons and holes. When particularized to the case of hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, this potential becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to the case of arbitrary masses. We also show how including corrections due to excited states into the theory results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Our approach is also applicable to more complicated systems with nonhydrogenic exciton series, such as layered semiconductors with Rytova-Keldysh interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a dilute gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in this approach the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in...</description>

      <title>Effects of thermal annealing and film thickness on the structural and optical properties of indium-tin-oxide thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indium-tin oxide (ITO) is a crucial functional layer for the optoelectronic applications, such as non-volatile color display thin films based on the ITO/phase-change material (PCM)/ITO/reflective metal multilayer structures on a silicon substrate. In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, thermally induced crystallization may alter the optical properties of ITO layers as well. But the potential change in color of the ITO layers is not considered so far. In this work, we investigate the structural and optical properties of ITO thin films via X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. After thermal annealing at 250 {\deg}C, the ITO thin films of 15-100 nm get crystallized with strong changes in refractive index n and extinction coefficient k in the visible light range. However, for the 5-nm ITO thin film, crystallization is only observed after thermal annealing at 350 {\deg}C and the change in color is limited upon phase transition. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 {\deg}C) and ITO film thickness (5-100 nm). Our work suggests that the intrinsic change in colors of ITO layers should also be considered for the PCM-based reconfigurable display application.</description>

      <title>Nanocrystal Geometry Governs Phase Transformation Pathways in Palladium Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pathways and structural dynamics of phase transformations impact performance of materials in energy and information storage technologies. Palladium hydride ($\mathrm{PdH}_x$) nanocrystals are an ideal model system for studying solute-induced phase transformations, where elastic energy from lattice mismatch between $\alpha$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ and $\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases is often considered a key to determining the transformation pathways. $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfacial elastic energy is affected by the confined geometry of a nanocrystal. However, how nanocrystal geometry influences phase transformation pathways is largely unknown. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize hydrogenation in Pd nanocrystals with two geometries -- a nanocube and a hexagonal nanoplate. Both follow similar sequences of an initially curved nucleus, interface flattening, and reverse-stage nucleation; however, their evolving $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibit geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. In nanocubes, $\{100\}$-aligned configurations conform to static elastic energy ordering, representing a pathway that maintains a local mechanical equilibrium, whereas nanoplates display both $\{110\}$- and $\{211\}$-aligned interfaces. Theoretical simulations show that geometry determines the accessibility of alternative phase transformation pathways as the system is driven far from equilibrium during hydrogenation. These findings identify geometry as a fundamental parameter for directing phase transformation pathways, offering design principles for accessing atypical configurations and improving properties of intercalation-based devices.</description>
