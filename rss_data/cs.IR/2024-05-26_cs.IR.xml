      <title>Let Me Do It For You: Towards LLM Empowered Recommendation via Tool Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional recommender systems (RSs) face challenges in precisely capturing users' fine-grained preferences. Large language models (LLMs) have shown capabilities in commonsense reasoning and leveraging external tools that may help address these challenges. However, existing LLM-based RSs suffer from hallucinations, misalignment between the semantic space of items and the behavior space of users, or overly simplistic control strategies (e.g., whether to rank or directly present existing results). To bridge these gap, we introduce ToolRec, a framework for LLM-empowered recommendations via tool learning that uses LLMs as surrogate users, thereby guiding the recommendation process and invoking external tools to generate a recommendation list that aligns closely with users' nuanced preferences.
  We formulate the recommendation process as a process aimed at exploring user interests in attribute granularity. The process factors in the nuances of the context and user preferences. The LLM then invokes external tools based on a user's attribute instructions and probes different segments of the item pool. We consider two types of attribute-oriented tools: rank tools and retrieval tools. Through the integration of LLMs, ToolRec enables conventional recommender systems to become external tools with a natural language interface. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ToolRec, particularly in scenarios that are rich in semantic content.</description>

      <title>Shopping Queries Image Dataset (SQID): An Image-Enriched ESCI Dataset for Exploring Multimodal Learning in Product Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the fields of Information Retrieval and Machine Learning have focused on improving the performance of search engines to enhance the user experience, especially in the world of online shopping. The focus has thus been on leveraging cutting-edge learning techniques and relying on large enriched datasets. This paper introduces the Shopping Queries Image Dataset (SQID), an extension of the Amazon Shopping Queries Dataset enriched with image information associated with 190,000 products. By integrating visual information, SQID facilitates research around multimodal learning techniques that can take into account both textual and visual information for improving product search and ranking. We also provide experimental results leveraging SQID and pretrained models, showing the value of using multimodal data for search and ranking. SQID is available at: https://github.com/Crossing-Minds/shopping-queries-image-dataset.</description>

      <title>DFGNN: Dual-frequency Graph Neural Network for Sign-aware Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph-based recommendation has achieved great success in recent years. However, most existing graph-based recommendations focus on capturing user preference based on positive edges/feedback, while ignoring negative edges/feedback (e.g., dislike, low rating) that widely exist in real-world recommender systems. How to utilize negative feedback in graph-based recommendations still remains underexplored. In this study, we first conducted a comprehensive experimental analysis and found that (1) existing graph neural networks are not well-suited for modeling negative feedback, which acts as a high-frequency signal in a user-item graph. (2) The graph-based recommendation suffers from the representation degeneration problem. Based on the two observations, we propose a novel model that models positive and negative feedback from a frequency filter perspective called Dual-frequency Graph Neural Network for Sign-aware Recommendation (DFGNN). Specifically, in DFGNN, the designed dual-frequency graph filter (DGF) captures both low-frequency and high-frequency signals that contain positive and negative feedback. Furthermore, the proposed signed graph regularization is applied to maintain the user/item embedding uniform in the embedding space to alleviate the representation degeneration problem. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Codes of our model will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Semantic Query Processing in a Scholarly Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed research aims to develop an innovative semantic query processing system that enables users to obtain comprehensive information about research works produced by Computer Science (CS) researchers at the Australian National University (ANU). The system integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ANU Scholarly Knowledge Graph (ASKG), a structured repository of all research-related artifacts produced at ANU in the CS field. Each artifact and its parts are represented as textual nodes stored in a Knowledge Graph (KG).
  To address the limitations of traditional scholarly KG construction and utilization methods, which often fail to capture fine-grained details, we propose a novel framework that integrates the Deep Document Model (DDM) for comprehensive document representation and the KG-enhanced Query Processing (KGQP) for optimized complex query handling. DDM enables a fine-grained representation of the hierarchical structure and semantic relationships within academic papers, while KGQP leverages the KG structure to improve query accuracy and efficiency with LLMs.
  By combining the ASKG with LLMs, our approach enhances knowledge utilization and natural language understanding capabilities. The proposed system employs an automatic LLM-SPARQL fusion to retrieve relevant facts and textual nodes from the ASKG. Initial experiments demonstrate that our framework is superior to baseline methods in terms of accuracy retrieval and query efficiency.
  We showcase the practical application of our framework in academic research scenarios, highlighting its potential to revolutionize scholarly knowledge management and discovery. This work empowers researchers to acquire and utilize knowledge from documents more effectively and provides a foundation for developing precise and reliable interactions with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Context Retrieval Augmented Generation Pipeline: LLM-Augmented Knowledge Graphs and Vector Database for Accreditation Reporting Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In higher education, accreditation is a quality assurance process, where an institution demonstrates a commitment to delivering high quality programs and services to their students. For business schools nationally and internationally the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accreditation is the gold standard. For a business school to receive and subsequently maintain accreditation, the school must undertake a rigorous, time consuming reporting and peer review process, to demonstrate alignment with the AACSB Standards. For this project we create a hybrid context retrieval augmented generation pipeline that can assist in the documentation alignment and reporting process necessary for accreditation. We implement both a vector database and knowledge graph, as knowledge stores containing both institutional data and AACSB Standard data. The output of the pipeline can be used by institution stakeholders to build their accreditation report, dually grounded by the context from the knowledge stores. To develop our knowledge graphs we utilized both a manual construction process as well as an LLM Augmented Knowledge Graph approach. We evaluated the pipeline using the RAGAs framework and observed optimal performance on answer relevancy and answer correctness metrics.</description>

      <title>A Preference-oriented Diversity Model Based on Mutual-information in Re-ranking for E-commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Re-ranking is a process of rearranging ranking list to more effectively meet user demands by accounting for the interrelationships between items. Existing methods predominantly enhance the precision of search results, often at the expense of diversity, leading to outcomes that may not fulfill the varied needs of users. Conversely, methods designed to promote diversity might compromise the precision of the results, failing to satisfy the users' requirements for accuracy. To alleviate the above problems, this paper proposes a Preference-oriented Diversity Model Based on Mutual-information (PODM-MI), which consider both accuracy and diversity in the re-ranking process. Specifically, PODM-MI adopts Multidimensional Gaussian distributions based on variational inference to capture users' diversity preferences with uncertainty. Then we maximize the mutual information between the diversity preferences of the users and the candidate items using the maximum variational inference lower bound to enhance their correlations. Subsequently, we derive a utility matrix based on the correlations, enabling the adaptive ranking of items in line with user preferences and establishing a balance between the aforementioned objectives. Experimental results on real-world online e-commerce systems demonstrate the significant improvements of PODM-MI, and we have successfully deployed PODM-MI on an e-commerce search platform.</description>

      <title>AGRaME: Any-Granularity Ranking with Multi-Vector Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ranking is a fundamental and popular problem in search. However, existing ranking algorithms usually restrict the granularity of ranking to full passages or require a specific dense index for each desired level of granularity. Such lack of flexibility in granularity negatively affects many applications that can benefit from more granular ranking, such as sentence-level ranking for open-domain question-answering, or proposition-level ranking for attribution. In this work, we introduce the idea of any-granularity ranking, which leverages multi-vector embeddings to rank at varying levels of granularity while maintaining encoding at a single (coarser) level of granularity. We propose a multi-granular contrastive loss for training multi-vector approaches, and validate its utility with both sentences and propositions as ranking units. Finally, we demonstrate the application of proposition-level ranking to post-hoc citation addition in retrieval-augmented generation, surpassing the performance of prompt-driven citation generation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Recommendation Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlearning methods for recommender systems (RS) have emerged to address privacy issues and concerns about legal compliance. However, evolving user preferences and content licensing issues still remain unaddressed. This is particularly true in case of multi-modal recommender systems (MMRS), which aim to accommodate the growing influence of multi-modal information on user preferences. Previous unlearning methods for RS are inapplicable to MMRS due to incompatibility of multi-modal user-item behavior data graph with the matrix based representation of RS. Partitioning based methods degrade recommendation performance and incur significant overhead costs during aggregation. This paper introduces MMRecUN, a new framework for multi-modal recommendation unlearning, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt in this direction. Given the trained recommendation model and marked forget data, we devise Reverse Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) objective to force the model to forget it. MMRecUN employs both reverse and forward BPR loss mechanisms to selectively attenuate the impact of interactions within the forget set while concurrently reinforcing the significance of interactions within the retain set. Our experiments demonstrate that MMRecUN outperforms baseline methods across various unlearning requests when evaluated on benchmark multi-modal recommender datasets. MMRecUN achieves recall performance improvements of up to $\mathbf{49.85%}$ compared to the baseline methods. It is up to $\mathbf{1.3}\times$ faster than the \textsc{Gold} model, which is trained on retain data from scratch. MMRecUN offers advantages such as superior performance in removing target elements, preservation of performance for retained elements, and zero overhead costs in comparison to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Self-distilled Dynamic Fusion Network for Language-based Fashion Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the domain of language-based fashion image retrieval, pinpointing the desired fashion item using both a reference image and its accompanying textual description is an intriguing challenge. Existing approaches lean heavily on static fusion techniques, intertwining image and text. Despite their commendable advancements, these approaches are still limited by a deficiency in flexibility. In response, we propose a Self-distilled Dynamic Fusion Network to compose the multi-granularity features dynamically by considering the consistency of routing path and modality-specific information simultaneously. Two new modules are included in our proposed method: (1) Dynamic Fusion Network with Modality Specific Routers. The dynamic network enables a flexible determination of the routing for each reference image and modification text, taking into account their distinct semantics and distributions. (2) Self Path Distillation Loss. A stable path decision for queries benefits the optimization of feature extraction as well as routing, and we approach this by progressively refine the path decision with previous path information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hidden Confounding Effects for Causal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from confounding biases when there exist confounders affecting both item features and user feedback (e.g., like or not). Existing causal recommendation methods typically assume confounders are fully observed and measured, forgoing the possible existence of hidden confounders in real applications. For instance, product quality is a confounder since affecting both item prices and user ratings, but is hidden for the third-party e-commerce platform due to the difficulty of large-scale quality inspection; ignoring it could result in the bias effect of over-recommending high-price items. This work analyzes and addresses the problem from a causal perspective. The key lies in modeling the causal effect of item features on a user's feedback. To mitigate hidden confounding effects, it is compulsory but challenging to estimate the causal effect without measuring the confounder. Towards this goal, we propose a Hidden Confounder Removal (HCR) framework that leverages front-door adjustment to decompose the causal effect into two partial effects, according to the mediators between item features and user feedback. The partial effects are independent from the hidden confounder and identifiable. During training, HCR performs multi-task learning to infer the partial effects from historical interactions. We instantiate HCR for two scenarios and conduct experiments on three real-world datasets. Empirical results show that the HCR framework provides more accurate recommendations, especially for less-active users. We will release the code once accepted.</description>

      <title>Identifiability Matters: Revealing the Hidden Recoverable Condition in Unbiased Learning to Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unbiased Learning to Rank (ULTR) aims to train unbiased ranking models from biased click logs, by explicitly modeling a generation process for user behavior and fitting click data based on examination hypothesis. Previous research found empirically that the true latent relevance is mostly recoverable through click fitting. However, we demonstrate that this is not always achievable, resulting in a significant reduction in ranking performance. This research investigates the conditions under which relevance can be recovered from click data in the first principle. We initially characterize a ranking model as identifiable if it can recover the true relevance up to a scaling transformation, a criterion sufficient for the pairwise ranking objective. Subsequently, we investigate an equivalent condition for identifiability, articulated as a graph connectivity test problem: the recovery of relevance is feasible if and only if the identifiability graph (IG), derived from the underlying structure of the dataset, is connected. The presence of a disconnected IG may lead to degenerate cases and suboptimal ranking performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce two methods, namely node intervention and node merging, designed to modify the dataset and restore the connectivity of the IG. Empirical results derived from a simulated dataset and two real-world LTR benchmark datasets not only validate our proposed theory but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in alleviating data bias when the relevance model is unidentifiable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining semantic information with behavioral data is a crucial research area in recommender systems. A promising approach involves leveraging external knowledge to enrich behavioral-based recommender systems with abundant semantic information. However, this approach faces two primary challenges: denoising raw external knowledge and adapting semantic representations. To address these challenges, we propose an External Knowledge-Enhanced Recommendation method with LLM Assistance (TRAWL). This method utilizes large language models (LLMs) to extract relevant recommendation knowledge from raw external data and employs a contrastive learning strategy for adapter training. Experiments on public datasets and real-world online recommender systems validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Model for Tumoral Clinical Decision Support Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparative diagnostic in brain tumor evaluation makes possible to use the available information of a medical center to compare similar cases when a new patient is evaluated. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence models, the proposed system is able of retrieving the most similar cases of brain tumors for a given query. The primary objective is to enhance the diagnostic process by generating more accurate representations of medical images, with a particular focus on patient-specific normal features and pathologies. The proposed model uses Artificial Intelligence to detect patient features to recommend the most similar cases from a database. The system not only suggests similar cases but also balances the representation of healthy and abnormal features in its design. This not only encourages the generalization of its use but also aids clinicians in their decision-making processes. We conducted a comparative analysis of our approach in relation to similar studies. The proposed architecture obtains a Dice coefficient of 0.474 in both tumoral and healthy regions of the patients, which outperforms previous literature. Our proposed model excels at extracting and combining anatomical and pathological features from brain \glspl{mr}, achieving state-of-the-art results while relying on less expensive label information. This substantially reduces the overall cost of the training process. This paper provides substantial grounds for further exploration of the broader applicability and optimization of the proposed architecture to enhance clinical decision-making. The novel approach presented in this work marks a significant advancement in the field of medical diagnosis, particularly in the context of Artificial Intelligence-assisted image retrieval, and promises to reduce costs and improve the quality of patient care using Artificial Intelligence as a support tool instead of a black box system.</description>

Abstract: Link streams offer a good model for representing interactions over time. They consist of links $(b,e,u,v)$, where $u$ and $v$ are vertices interacting during the whole time interval $[b,e]$. In this paper, we deal with the problem of enumerating maximal cliques in link streams. A clique is a pair $(C,[t_0,t_1])$, where $C$ is a set of vertices that all interact pairwise during the full interval $[t_0,t_1]$. It is maximal when neither its set of vertices nor its time interval can be increased. Some of the main works solving this problem are based on the famous Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for enumerating maximal cliques in graphs. We take this idea as a starting point to propose a new algorithm which matches the cliques of the instantaneous graphs formed by links existing at a given time $t$ to the maximal cliques of the link stream. We prove its validity and compute its complexity, which is better than the state-of-the art ones in many cases of interest. We also study the output-sensitive complexity, which is close to the output size, thereby showing that our algorithm is efficient. To confirm this, we perform experiments on link streams used in the state of the art, and on massive link streams, up to 100 million links. In all cases our algorithm is faster, mostly by a factor of at least 10 and up to a factor of $10^4$. Moreover, it scales to massive link streams for which the existing algorithms are not able to provide the solution.</description>

      <title>User Simulation for Evaluating Information Access Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08550</link>

Abstract: Information access systems, such as search engines, recommender systems, and conversational assistants, have become integral to our daily lives as they help us satisfy our information needs. However, evaluating the effectiveness of these systems presents a long-standing and complex scientific challenge. This challenge is rooted in the difficulty of assessing a system's overall effectiveness in assisting users to complete tasks through interactive support, and further exacerbated by the substantial variation in user behaviour and preferences. To address this challenge, user simulation emerges as a promising solution.
  This book focuses on providing a thorough understanding of user simulation techniques designed specifically for evaluation purposes. We begin with a background of information access system evaluation and explore the diverse applications of user simulation. Subsequently, we systematically review the major research progress in user simulation, covering both general frameworks for designing user simulators, utilizing user simulation for evaluation, and specific models and algorithms for simulating user interactions with search engines, recommender systems, and conversational assistants. Realizing that user simulation is an interdisciplinary research topic, whenever possible, we attempt to establish connections with related fields, including machine learning, dialogue systems, user modeling, and economics. We end the book with a detailed discussion of important future research directions, many of which extend beyond the evaluation of information access systems and are expected to have broader impact on how to evaluate interactive intelligent systems in general.</description>

      <title>BBK: a simpler, faster algorithm for enumerating maximal bicliques in large sparse bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bipartite graphs are a prevalent modeling tool for real-world networks, capturing interactions between vertices of two different types. Within this framework, bicliques emerge as crucial structures when studying dense subgraphs: they are sets of vertices such that all vertices of the first type interact with all vertices of the second type. Therefore, they allow identifying groups of closely related vertices of the network, such as individuals with similar interests or webpages with similar contents. This article introduces a new algorithm designed for the exhaustive enumeration of maximal bicliques within a bipartite graph. This algorithm, called BBK for Bipartite Bron-Kerbosch, is a new extension to the bipartite case of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, which enumerates the maximal cliques in standard (non-bipartite) graphs. It is faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms and allows the enumeration on massive bipartite graphs that are not manageable with existing implementations. We analyze it theoretically to establish two complexity formulas: one as a function of the input and one as a function of the output characteristics of the algorithm. We also provide an open-access implementation of BBK in C++, which we use to experiment and validate its efficiency on massive real-world datasets and show that its execution time is shorter in practice than state-of-the art algorithms. These experiments also show that the order in which the vertices are processed, as well as the choice of one of the two types of vertices on which to initiate the enumeration have an impact on the computation time.</description>
