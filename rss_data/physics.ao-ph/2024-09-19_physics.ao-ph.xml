      <title>DiffESM: Conditional Emulation of Temperature and Precipitation in Earth System Models with 3D Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth System Models (ESMs) are essential for understanding the interaction between human activities and the Earth's climate. However, the computational demands of ESMs often limit the number of simulations that can be run, hindering the robust analysis of risks associated with extreme weather events. While low-cost climate emulators have emerged as an alternative to emulate ESMs and enable rapid analysis of future climate, many of these emulators only provide output on at most a monthly frequency. This temporal resolution is insufficient for analyzing events that require daily characterization, such as heat waves or heavy precipitation. We propose using diffusion models, a class of generative deep learning models, to effectively downscale ESM output from a monthly to a daily frequency. Trained on a handful of ESM realizations, reflecting a wide range of radiative forcings, our DiffESM model takes monthly mean precipitation or temperature as input, and is capable of producing daily values with statistical characteristics close to ESM output. Combined with a low-cost emulator providing monthly means, this approach requires only a small fraction of the computational resources needed to run a large ensemble. We evaluate model behavior using a number of extreme metrics, showing that DiffESM closely matches the spatio-temporal behavior of the ESM output it emulates in terms of the frequency and spatial characteristics of phenomena such as heat waves, dry spells, or rainfall intensity.</description>

      <title>Harnessing AI data-driven global weather models for climate attribution: An analysis of the 2017 Oroville Dam extreme atmospheric river</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI data-driven models (Graphcast, Pangu Weather, Fourcastnet, and SFNO) are explored for storyline-based climate attribution due to their short inference times, which can accelerate the number of events studied, and provide real time attributions when public attention is heightened. The analysis is framed on the extreme atmospheric river episode of February 2017 that contributed to the Oroville dam spillway incident in Northern California. Past and future simulations are generated by perturbing the initial conditions with the pre-industrial and the late-21st century temperature climate change signals, respectively. The simulations are compared to results from a dynamical model which represents plausible pseudo-realities under both climate environments. Overall, the AI models show promising results, projecting a 5-6 % increase in the integrated water vapor over the Oroville dam in the present day compared to the pre-industrial, in agreement with the dynamical model. Different geopotential-moisture-temperature dependencies are unveiled for each of the AI-models tested, providing valuable information for understanding the physicality of the attribution response. However, the AI models tend to simulate weaker attribution values than the pseudo-reality imagined by the dynamical model, suggesting some reduced extrapolation skill, especially for the late-21st century regime. Large ensembles generated with an AI model (&gt;500 members) produced statistically significant present-day to pre-industrial attribution results, unlike the &gt;20-member ensemble from the dynamical model. This analysis highlights the potential of AI models to conduct attribution analysis, while emphasizing future lines of work on explainable artificial intelligence to gain confidence in these tools, which can enable reliable attribution studies in real-time.</description>

      <title>Super Resolution On Global Weather Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11502v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is a vitally important tool for tasks ranging from planning day to day activities to disaster response planning. However, modeling weather has proven to be challenging task due to its chaotic and unpredictable nature. Each variable, from temperature to precipitation to wind, all influence the path the environment will take. As a result, all models tend to rapidly lose accuracy as the temporal range of their forecasts increase. Classical forecasting methods use a myriad of physics-based, numerical, and stochastic techniques to predict the change in weather variables over time. However, such forecasts often require a very large amount of data and are extremely computationally expensive. Furthermore, as climate and global weather patterns change, classical models are substantially more difficult and time-consuming to update for changing environments. Fortunately, with recent advances in deep learning and publicly available high quality weather datasets, deploying learning methods for estimating these complex systems has become feasible. The current state-of-the-art deep learning models have comparable accuracy to the industry standard numerical models and are becoming more ubiquitous in practice due to their adaptability. Our group seeks to improve upon existing deep learning based forecasting methods by increasing spatial resolutions of global weather predictions. Specifically, we are interested in performing super resolution (SR) on GraphCast temperature predictions by increasing the global precision from 1 degree of accuracy to 0.5 degrees, which is approximately 111km and 55km respectively.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the pattern effect in the atmosphere-ocean coupled system through linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy surplus resulting from radiative forcing causes warming of the Earth system. This initial warming drives a myriad of changes including in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), leading to different radiative feedbacks. The relationship between the radiative feedbacks and the pattern of SST changes is referred to as the "pattern effect". The current approach to study the pattern effect relies on diagnosing the response of atmosphere-only models to perturbations in the SST boundary condition. Here, we argue that the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), together with coarse-graining procedures, is a computationally cheap and theoretically grounded alternative to model experiments. We introduce a protocol to study the pattern effect and present its application in a state-of-the-art coupled climate model. By focusing on the coupled dynamics, we unveil the role of the slow ocean component in setting the pattern effect. We present a new "sensitivity map", representing a first, qualitative prediction of the response of the average top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiative flux to perturbations in the SST field. We find negative sensitivity throughout the tropics, in contrast to the current understanding of a positive-negative dipole of sensitivity in the tropical Pacific. Considering only the shortest time scales, the response is dominated by the fast atmospheric variability and we recover results in qualitative agreement with the literature. Therefore, the difference between our results and previous studies, largely comes from including the atmosphere-ocean coupling. The framework offers a conceptually novel perspective on the pattern effect: feedbacks in the coupled system are encoded in a temporally and spatially dependent response operator, rather than time-independent maps as for previous studies.</description>

      <title>Theory of accelerated flows in a long wave approximation: High-order Shallow Water Equations (HSWE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of coastal flows are characterized by turbulence, rendering the application of shallow water equations an inadequate approach for their accurate description. This paper presents a theory for characterizing accelerated coastal flows, offering an enhanced representation of turbulent flows in the long-wave approximation. The fundamental premise of the theory is as follows: Fluctuating velocities present in the water flow are found to correlate and generate additional motion (or fluctuating motion), which is associated with a velocity of the same order and regularity as the mean flow velocity. The resulting high-order long-wave model is both stable and efficient, comprising classical shallow water equations and additional equations that describe the transport of kinetic energy due to turbulence. The model's detailed eigenstructure and Rankine-Hugoniot relations, steady state solutions are presented in this paper. The proposed theory shows promise for addressing a variety of engineering problems, including roll waves, hydraulic jumps, dam breaks, and flooding. The derived model can accurately address the problem of the mixing layer interaction with a free surface and its transition into a turbulent surface jet. Recent application to sediment transport gives interesting results and good numerical convergences.</description>
