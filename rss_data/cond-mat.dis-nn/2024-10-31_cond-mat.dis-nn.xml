      <title>Slow Relaxation in a Glassy Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits have become a powerful tool in the study of many-body quantum physics, providing insights into both fast-thermalizing chaotic and non-thermalizing integrable many-body dynamics. In this work, we explore a distinct intermediate class - glassy quantum systems - where thermalization occurs, but over very long timescales. We introduce and analyze a Floquet random quantum circuit that can be tuned between glassy and fully ergodic behavior through a single adjustable parameter. This circuit can be understood as the unitary analog of the block Rosenzweig-Porter model, which is defined by a Hamiltonian. Using an effective field theory for random quantum circuits, we analyze the correlations between quasienergy eigenstates and thereby determine the time evolution of the disorder-averaged density matrix. In the intermediate regime the circuit displays a two-step thermalization process: an initial relaxation within weakly coupled sectors followed by a later, global thermalization. We also show that the ramp of the spectral form factor is enhanced by a factor of the number of sectors in the glassy regime, and at early times in the intermediate regime. These results indicate that quantum circuits provide an ideal platform for the exploration of nontrivial thermalization dynamics in many-body quantum systems, offering deeper insights into quantum thermalization.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanical mapping and maximum-likelihood thresholds for the surface code under generic single-qubit coherent errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the $X$ or $Z$ axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle $\alpha$ about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds $\alpha_\text{th}$. The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error correcting phase, $\alpha&lt;\alpha_\text{th}$, where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix -- a non-unitary (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit -- can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states. Based on this approach, (ii) we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The $\alpha_\text{th}$ values we find show that the maximum likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.</description>

      <title>Winding Number Statistics for Chiral Random Matrices: Universal Correlations and Statistical Moments in the Unitary Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The winding number is the topological invariant that classifies chiral symmetric Hamiltonians with one-dimensional parametric dependence. In this work we complete our study of the winding number statistics in a random matrix model belonging to the chiral unitary class AIII. We show that in the limit of large matrix dimensions the winding number distribution becomes Gaussian. Our results include expressions for the statistical moments of the winding number and for the k-point correlation function of the winding number density.</description>

      <title>Anderson Localization in Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solutions of the wave equations for time-independent disordered media can exhibit Anderson localization where instead of wave propagation we observe their localization around different points in space. Photonic time crystals are spatially homogeneous media in which the refractive index changes periodically in time, leading to the formation of bands in the wave number domain. By analogy to Anderson localization in space, one might expect that the presence of temporal disorder in photonic time crystals would lead to Anderson localization in the time domain. Here, we show that indeed periodic modulations of the refractive index with the addition of temporal disorder lead to Anderson localization in time, where an electromagnetic field can emerge from the temporally modulated medium at a certain moment in time and then decay exponentially over time. Thus, we are dealing with a situation where, in a fluctuating three-dimensional medium, the birth and death of waves can occur, and the mechanism of this phenomenon corresponds to Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Noise-augmented Chaotic Ising Machines for Combinatorial Optimization and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ising machines, hardware accelerators for combinatorial optimization and probabilistic sampling problems, have gained significant interest recently. A key element is stochasticity, which enables a wide exploration of configurations, thereby helping avoid local minima. Here, we refine the previously proposed concept of coupled chaotic bits (c-bits) that operate without explicit stochasticity. We show that augmenting chaotic bits with stochasticity enhances performance in combinatorial optimization, achieving algorithmic scaling comparable to probabilistic bits (p-bits). We first demonstrate that c-bits follow the quantum Boltzmann law in a 1D transverse field Ising model. We then show that c-bits exhibit critical dynamics similar to stochastic p-bits in 2D Ising and 3D spin glass models, with promising potential to solve challenging optimization problems. Finally, we propose a noise-augmented version of coupled c-bits via the adaptive parallel tempering algorithm (APT). Our noise-augmented c-bit algorithm outperforms fully deterministic c-bits running versions of the simulated annealing algorithm. Other analog Ising machines with coupled oscillators could draw inspiration from the proposed algorithm. Running replicas at constant temperature eliminates the need for global modulation of coupling strengths. Mixing stochasticity with deterministic c-bits creates a powerful hybrid computing scheme that can bring benefits in scaled, asynchronous, and massively parallel hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of Levy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the Efetov's super-symmetric formalism we computed analytically the mean spectral density $\rho(E)$ for the L\'evy and the L\'evy -Rosenzweig-Porter random matrices which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem analytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\rho(E)$ depends crucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an order parameter.</description>
