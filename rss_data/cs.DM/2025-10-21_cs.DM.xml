      <title>Forward-Backward Binarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binarization of gene expression data is a \textbf{critical prerequisite} for the synthesis of Boolean gene regulatory network (GRN) models from omics datasets. Because Boolean networks encode gene activity as binary variables, the accuracy of binarization directly conditions whether the inferred models can faithfully reproduce biological experiments, capture regulatory dynamics, and support downstream analyses such as controllability and therapeutic strategy design. In practice, binarization is most often performed using thresholding methods that partition expression values into two discrete levels, representing the absence or presence of gene expression. However, such approaches oversimplify the underlying biology: gene-specific functional roles, measurement uncertainty, and the scarcity of time-resolved experimental data render thresholding alone insufficient. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{regulation-based binarization method} tailored to snapshot data. Our approach combines thresholding with functional binary value completion guided by the regulatory graph, propagating values between regulators and targets according to Boolean regulation rules. This strategy enables the inference of missing or uncertain values and ensures that binarization remains biologically consistent with both regulatory interactions and Boolean modeling principles of the gene regulation. Validation against ODE simulations of artificial and established Boolean GRNs demonstrates that the method achieves accurate and robust binarization, thereby strengthening the reliability of Boolean network synthesis.</description>

      <title>Random generation of universal cycles and de Bruijn sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present practical algorithms for generating universal cycles uniformly at random. In particular, we consider universal cycles for shorthand permutations, subsets and multiset permutations, weak orders, and orientable sequences. Additionally, we consider de Bruijn sequences, weight-range de Bruin sequences, and de Bruijn sequences, with forbidden $0^z$ substring. Each algorithm, seeded with a random element from the given set, applies a random walk of an underlying Eulerian de Bruijn graph to obtain a random arborescence (spanning in-tree). Given the random arborescence and the de Bruijn graph, a corresponding random universal cycle can be generated in constant time per symbol. We present experimental results on the average cover time needed to compute a random arborescence for each object using a Las Vegas algorithm.</description>

      <title>New results on $B_{\alpha}$-eigenvalues of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with adjacency matrix $A(G)$ and Laplacian matrix $L(G)$. In 2024, Samanta \textit{et} \textit{al.} defined the convex linear combination of $A(G)$ and $L(G)$ as $B_\alpha(G) = \alpha A(G) + (1-\alpha)L(G)$, for $\alpha \in [0,1]$. This paper presents some results on the eigenvalues of $B_{\alpha}(G)$ and their multiplicity when some sets of vertices satisfy certain conditions. Moreover, the positive semidefiniteness problem of $B_{\alpha}(G)$ is studied.</description>

      <title>Efficient recognition algorithms for $(1,2)$-, $(2,1)$- and $(2,2)$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be a $(k,\ell)$-graph if its vertex set can be partitioned into $k$ independent sets and $\ell$ cliques. It is well established that the recognition problem for $(k,\ell)$-graphs is NP-complete whenever $k \geq 3$ or $\ell \geq 3$, while it is solvable in polynomial time otherwise. In particular, for the case $k+\ell \leq 2$, recognition can be carried out in linear time, since split graphs coincide with the class of $(1,1)$-graphs, bipartite graphs correspond precisely to $(2,0)$-graphs, and $(\ell,k)$-graphs are the complements of $(k,\ell)$-graphs. Recognition algorithms for $(2,1)$- and $(1,2)$-graphs were provided by Brandst\"adt, Le and Szymczak in 1998, while the case of $(2,2)$-graphs was addressed by Feder, Hell, Klein, and Motwani in 1999. In this work, we refine these results by presenting improved recognition algorithms with lower time complexity. Specifically, we reduce the running time from $O((n+m)^2)$ to $O(n^2+nm)$ for $(2,1)$-graphs, from $O((n+\overline{m})^2)$ to $O(n^2+n\overline{m})$ for $(1,2)$-graphs, and from $O(n^{10}(n+m))$ to $O(n^4 (n+\min\{m,\overline{m}\})^3)$ for $(2,2)$-graphs. Here, $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and edges of the input graph $G$, respectively, and $\overline{m}$ denotes the number of edges in the complement of $G$.</description>

      <title>Edge open packing on subclasses of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. In a graph $G$, two edges $e_1, e_2\in E(G)$ are said to have a \emph{common edge} $e\neq e_1, e_2$ if $e$ joins an endpoint of $e_1$ to an endpoint of $e_2$ in $G$. A subset $D\subseteq E(G)$ is called an \emph{edge open packing set} in $G$ if no two edges in $D$ share a common edge in $G$, and the largest size of such a set in $G$ is known as the \emph{edge open packing number}, represented by $\rho_{e}^o(G)$. The \textsc{Maximum Edge Open Packing Problem} is to find an edge open packing set of a given graph with maximum size. In [Bre{\v{s}}ar and Samadi. Edge open packing: complexity, algorithmic aspects, and bounds. Theor. Comput. Sci., 2024.], Bre{\v{s}}ar and Samadi pose an open question of the edge open packing problem in chordal graphs. In this paper, we partially answer this open question by showing a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the maximum edge open packing problem in the subclasses of chordal graphs. First, we show that the \textsc{Maximum Edge Open Packing Problem} can be solved in polynomial time for \emph{proper interval graphs}. Furthermore, we show that in \emph{block graphs} we can solve this problem in polynomial time. Finally, we prove that this problem can be solved in linear time for \emph{split graphs}.</description>

      <title>Near-linear time subhypergraph counting in bounded degeneracy hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting small patterns in a large dataset is a fundamental algorithmic task. The most common version of this task is subgraph/homomorphism counting, wherein we count the number of occurrences of a small pattern graph $H$ in an input graph $G$. The study of this problem is a field in and of itself. Recently, both in theory and practice, there has been an interest in \emph{hypergraph} algorithms, where $G = (V,E)$ is a hypergraph. One can view $G$ as a set system where hyperedges are subsets of the universe $V$.
  Counting patterns $H$ in hypergraphs is less studied, although there are many applications in network science and database algorithms. Inspired by advances in the graph literature, we study when linear time algorithms are possible.
  We focus on input hypergraphs $G$ that have bounded \emph{degeneracy}, a well-studied concept for graph algorithms. We give a spectrum of definitions for hypergraph degeneracy that cover all existing notions. For each such definition, we give a precise characterization of the patterns $H$ that can be counted in (near) linear time. Specifically, we discover a set of ``obstruction patterns". If $H$ does not contain an obstruction, then the number of $H$-subhypergraphs can be counted exactly in $O(n\log n)$ time (where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$). If $H$ contains an obstruction, then (assuming hypergraph variants of fine-grained complexity conjectures), there is a constant $\gamma &gt; 0$, such that there is no $o(n^{1+\gamma})$ time algorithm for counting $H$-subhypergraphs. These sets of obstructions can be defined for all notions of hypergraph degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Reduction Techniques for Quantum Graph Colouring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient quantum computing method for reducing special graphs in the context of the graph coloring problem. The special graphs considered include both symmetric and non-symmetric graphs where the axis passes through nodes only, edges only, and both together. The presented method reduces the number of coloring matrices, which is important for realization of the number of quantum states required, from $K^{N}$ to $K^{\frac{N+m}{2}}$ upon one symmetric reduction of graphs symmetric about an axis passing through $m$ nodes, where $K$ is the number of colours required and \emph{N} being total number of nodes. Similarly for other types also, the number of quantum states is reduced. The complexity in the number of qubits has been reduced by $\delta C_q= \frac{9N^2}{8}-\frac{3m^2}{8}-\frac{3Nm}{4}-\frac{N}{4}+\frac{m}{4}$ upon one symmetric reduction of graphs, symmetric about an axis passing through $m$ nodes and other types as presented in the paper. Additionally, the number of gates and number of iterations are reduced massively compared to state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. Like for a graph with 20 nodes and symmetric line passing through 2 nodes, the number of iterations decreased from 5157 to 67. Therefore, the procedure presented for solving the graph coloring problem now requires a significantly reduced number of qubits compared to before. The run time of the proposed algorithm for these special type of graphs are reduced from $O(1.9575^{N})$ to $O(1.9575^{(\frac{N+m}{2})})$ upon one symmetric reduction of graphs symmetric about an axis passing through $m$ nodes and similarly for others cases.</description>

      <title>Hitting all longest paths in $H$-free graphs and $H$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \textit{longest path transversal number} of a connected graph $G$, denoted by $lpt(G)$, is the minimum size of a set of vertices of $G$ that intersects all longest paths in $G$. We present constant upper bounds for the longest path transversal number of \textit{hereditary classes of graphs}, that is, classes of graphs closed under taking induced subgraphs. Our first main result is a structural theorem that allows us to \textit{refine} a given longest path transversal in a graph using domination properties. This has several consequences: First, it implies that for every $t \in \{5,6\}$, every connected $P_t$-free graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq t-2$. Second, it shows that every $(\textit{bull}, \textit{chair})$-free graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq 5$. Third, it implies that for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, every connected chordal graph $G$ with no induced subgraph isomorphic to $K_t \mat \overline{K_t}$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq t-1$, where $K_t \mat \overline{K_t}$ is the graph obtained from a $t$-clique and an independent set of size $t$ by adding a perfect matching between them. Our second main result provides an upper bound for the longest path transversal number in \textit{$H$-intersection graphs}. For a given graph $H$, a graph $G$ is called an \textit{$H$-graph} if there exists a subdivision $H'$ of $H$ such that $G$ is the intersection graph of a family of vertex subsets of $H'$ that each induce connected subgraphs. The concept of $H$-graphs, introduced by Bir\'o, Hujter, and Tuza, naturally captures interval graphs, circular-arc graphs, and chordal graphs, among others. Our result shows that for every connected graph $H$ with at least two vertices, there exists an integer $k = k(H)$ such that every connected $H$-graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq k$.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Computing the VC-Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VC-dimension is a fundamental and well-studied measure of the complexity of a set system (or hypergraph) that is central to many areas of machine learning. We establish several new results on the complexity of computing the VC-dimension. In particular, given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, we prove that the naive $2^{\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{V}|)}$-time algorithm is asymptotically tight under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). We then prove that the problem admits a 1-additive fixed-parameter approximation algorithm when parameterized by the maximum degree of $\mathcal{H}$ and a fixed-parameter algorithm when parameterized by its dimension, and that these are essentially the only such exploitable structural parameters. Lastly, we consider a generalization of the problem, formulated using graphs, which captures the VC-dimension of both set systems and graphs. We show that it is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the treewidth of the graph (which, in the case of set systems, applies to the treewidth of its incidence graph). In contrast with closely related problems whose dependency on the treewidth is necessarily double-exponential (assuming the ETH), our algorithm has a relatively low dependency on the treewidth.</description>

      <title>Cliquewidth and dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every poset with bounded cliquewidth and with sufficiently large dimension contains the standard example of dimension $k$ as a subposet. This applies in particular to posets whose cover graphs have bounded treewidth, as the cliquewidth of a poset is bounded in terms of the treewidth of the cover graph. For the latter posets, we prove a stronger statement: every such poset with sufficiently large dimension contains the Kelly example of dimension $k$ as a subposet. Using this result, we obtain a full characterization of the minor-closed graph classes $\mathcal{C}$ such that posets with cover graphs in $\mathcal{C}$ have bounded dimension: they are exactly the classes excluding the cover graph of some Kelly example. Finally, we consider a variant of poset dimension called Boolean dimension, and we prove that posets with bounded cliquewidth have bounded Boolean dimension.
  The proofs rely on Colcombet's deterministic version of Simon's factorization theorem, which is a fundamental tool in formal language and automata theory, and which we believe deserves a wider recognition in structural and algorithmic graph theory.</description>

      <title>Graph Burning: Bounds and Hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph. The graph burning is defined as follows: at time $t=0$, all vertices in $G$ are unburned. For each time $t\geq 1$, an unburned vertex is chosen to burn, and at each subsequent time, the fire spreads from each burned vertex to all its neighbors. Once a vertex is burned, it remains burned for all future steps. The process continues until all vertices in $V$ are burned. The burning number of a graph $G$, denoted $b(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists a sequence of vertices $(v_1,v_2,\ldots, v_k)\subseteq V$, where $v_i$ is burned at time $i$, and all vertices in $V$ are burned within time step $k$. The Burning Number problem asks whether the burning number of an input graph $G$ is at most $k$ or not. In this paper, we study the Burning Number problem both from an algorithmic and a structural point of view. The Burning Number problem is known to be NP-complete for interval graphs. Here, we prove that this problem is NP-complete even when restricted to connected proper interval graphs. The well-known burning number conjecture asserts that all the vertices of a graph of order $n$ can be burned in $\lceil \sqrt{n}~\rceil$ steps. In line with this conjecture, the upper and lower bounds of $b(G)$ are well-studied for various graph classes. Here, we provide an improved upper bound for the burning number of connected $P_k$-free graphs and show that the bound is tight up to an additive constant $1$. Finally, we study two variants of the problem, namely edge burning (only edges are burned) and total burning (both vertices and edges are burned). In particular, we establish their relationship with the burning number problem and evaluate the algorithmic complexity of these variants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel exact algorithm for generating connected Erdos-Renyi random graphs $G(n,p)$. The method couples the graph exploration process to an inhomogeneous Poisson random walk, which yields an exact sampler that runs in $O(n)$ time in the sparse regime $p=c/n$. We also show how the method extends to the $G(n,M)$ model via an additional acceptance-rejection step.</description>

      <title>An Exact Solver for Submodular Knapsack Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing a monotone increasing submodular function over a set of weighted elements subject to a knapsack constraint. Although this problem is NP-hard, many applications require exact solutions, as approximate solutions are often insufficient in practice. To address this need, we propose an exact branch-and-bound algorithm tailored for the submodular knapsack problem and introduce several acceleration techniques to enhance its efficiency. We evaluate these techniques on artificial instances of three benchmark problems as well as on instances derived from real-world data. We compare the proposed solver with two solvers by Sakaue and Ishihata (2018), which currently achieve the strongest performance reported in the literature, as well as with a branch-and-cut algorithm implemented using Gurobi that solves a binary linear reformulation of the submodular knapsack problem, demonstrating that our methods are highly successful.</description>

      <title>Voting-Based Semi-Parallel Proof-of-Work Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols are suggested to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

      <title>A threshold for online balancing of sparse i.i.d. vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the task of \textit{online} vector balancing for stochastic arrivals $(X_i)_{i \in [T]}$, where the time horizon satisfies $T = \Theta(n)$, and the $X_i$ are i.i.d uniform $d$--sparse $n$--dimensional binary vectors, with $2\leq d \le (\log\log n)^2/\log\log\log n$. We show that for this range of parameters, every online algorithm incurs discrepancy at least $\Omega(\log \log n)$, and there is an efficient algorithm which achieves a matching discrepancy bound of $O(\log\log n)$ w.h.p. This establishes an asymptotic gap, both existential and algorithmic, between the online and offline versions of the average--case Beck--Fiala problem. Strikingly, the optimal online discrepancy in the considered setting is order $\log \log n$, independent of $d$ and the norms of the vectors $(X_i)_i$. Our assumptions on $d$ are nearly optimal, as this independence ceases when $d=\omega((\log\log n)^2)$.</description>

      <title>Expansion of gap-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph is $k$-gap-planar if it has a drawing in the plane such that every crossing can be charged to one of the two edges involved so that at most $k$ crossings are charged to each edge. We show this class of graphs has linear expansion. In particular, every $r$-shallow minor of a $k$-gap-planar graph has density $O(rk)$. Several extensions of this result are proved: for topological minors, for $k$-cover-planar graphs, for $k$-gap-cover-planar graphs, and for drawings on any surface. Application to graph colouring are presented.</description>

      <title>Balanced Fibonacci word rectangles, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a recent paper of Anselmo et al., we consider $m \times n$ rectangular matrices formed from the Fibonacci word, and we show that their balance properties can be solved with a finite automaton. We also generalize the result to every Sturmian characteristic word corresponding to a quadratic irrational. Finally, we also examine the analogous question for the Tribonacci word and the Thue-Morse word.</description>

      <title>The Tribonacci constant and finite automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is no automaton accepting the Tribonacci representations of $n$ and $x$ in parallel, where $\psi = 1.839\cdots$ is the Tribonacci constant, and $x= \lfloor n \psi \rfloor$. Similarly, there is no Tribonacci automaton generating the Sturmian characteristic word with slope $\psi-1$.</description>
