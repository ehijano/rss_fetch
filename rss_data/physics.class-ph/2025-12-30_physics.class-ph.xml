      <title>A novel large-strain kinematic framework for fiber-reinforced laminated composites and its application in the characterization of damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel kinematic framework for fiber-reinforced composite materials is presented. For this purpose, we use the multiple natural configurations in conjunction with the multi-continuum theory of Bedford and Stern~(1972). Keeping the underlying physics of the proposed kinematics consistent. The proposed kinematics results in a three-term decomposition of the deformation gradient i.e. $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}^e\mathbf{F}^r_\alpha\mathbf{F}^d_\alpha$, where $\alpha$ represents either the matrix or the fiber. After discussing the kinematic framework in detail, we use this new kinematic framework to characterize the damage contents associated with four damage mechanisms. These damage mechanisms are matrix cracking, fiber breakage, interfacial slip or debonding, and delamination. While the first two are derived by measuring the incompatibility of the pertinent configuration occupied by individual constituents, the latter two involve a relative displacement between either the constituents or the lamin\ae. The geometric interpretation corresponding to these damage mechanisms is also presented using tools from differential geometry. The derived damage contents can be used in developing an appropriate constitutive model for laminated composites undergoing damage.</description>

      <title>Energy transport in the Schr\"odinger plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce "the Schr\"odinger plate." This is an infinite two-dimensional linear micro-polar elastic medium, with out-of-plane degrees of freedom, lying on a linear elastic foundation of a special kind. Any free motion of the plate can be corresponded to a solution of the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation for a single particle in the external potential field $V$. The specific dependence of the potential $V$ on the position is taken into account in the properties of the plate elastic foundation. The governing equations of the plate are derived as equations of the two-dimensional constraint Cosserat continuum using the direct approach. The plate dynamics can be described by the classical Germain-Lagrange equation for a plate, but the strain energy is different from the one used in the classical Kirchhoff-Love plate theory. Namely, the Schr\"odinger plate cannot be imagined as a thin elastic body composed of an isotropic linear material. The main property of the Schr\"odinger plate is as follows: the mechanical energy propagates in the plate exactly in the same way as the probability density propagates according to the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Reply to "Comment on 'Absence of a consistent classical equation of motion for a mass-renormalized point charge'" (arXiv:2511.02865v1, 3 Nov 2025)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of a brief review of the derivation of the causal modified Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac classical equation of motion from the renormalization of the mass in the modified equation of motion of an extended charged sphere as its radius approaches zero, it is shown that Zin and Pylak's objection that the jumps in velocity allowed across transition intervals near nonanalytic points in time of the externally applied force produce delta functions in the radiated fields is incorrect.</description>

      <title>Study of Ni-Zn battery by coupling strain gauge measurements and acoustic emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two different non-destructive techniques of characterization were coupled to study the mechanical behavior of materials inside a battery during operation: measurement of the deformation of a battery casing by strain gauge and acoustic emission due to the release of mechanical stress inside the battery materials. Experiments were conducted on a commercial Ni-Zn AA-type battery and, particularly, phenomena occurring during overcharge were considered. Beyond the example of this study on a Ni-Zn battery, these two techniques offer complementary information that can be very useful for the monitoring and management of different type of batteries.</description>

      <title>New approach to approximate analytical solutions of a harmonic oscillator with weak to moderate nonlinear damping: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to deriving approximate analytical solutions of a harmonic oscillator damped by purely nonlinear, or combinations of linear and nonlinear damping forces. Our approach is based on choosing a suitable trial solution, i.e. an ansatz, which is the product of the time-dependent amplitude and the oscillatory (trigonometric) function that has the same frequency but different initial phase, compared to the undamped case. We derive the equation for the amplitude decay using the connection of the energy dissipation rate with the power of the total damping force and the approximation that the amplitude changes slowly over time compared to the oscillating part of the ansatz. By matching our ansatz to the initial conditions, we obtain the equations for the corresponding initial amplitude and initial phase. Here we demonstrate the validity of our approach in the case of damping quadratic in velocity, Coulomb damping, and a combination of the two, i.e. in this paper we consider purely nonlinear damping, while the dynamics with combinations of damping linear in velocity and nonlinear damping will be analyzed in a follow-up paper. In the case of damping quadratic in velocity, by comparing our approximate analytical solutions with the corresponding numerical solutions, we find that our solutions excellently describe the dynamics of the oscillator in the regime of weak to moderately strong quadratic damping. In the case of Coulomb damping, as well as in the case of a combined Coulomb and quadratic damping, our approximate analytical solutions agree well with the corresponding numerical solutions until the last few half-periods of the motion. Therefore, for these two cases, we introduce improved variants of our approximate solutions which describe the dynamics well until the very end.</description>

      <title>Conservation of Momentum and Energy in the Lorenz-Abraham-Dirac Equation of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After a brief review of the modified causal Lorentz-Abraham classical equation of motion for an extended charged sphere and its limit to the mass-renormalized modified causal Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation of motion as the radius of the charged sphere approaches zero, a concise derivation is given for the conditions on the velocity and external force required for these modified equations of motion to satisfy conservation of momentum and energy. The solutions to the unmodified and modified LAD equations of motion as well as the Landau-Liftshitz approximate solution to the unmodified LAD equation of motion are obtained for a charge traveling through a parallel-plate capacitor.</description>
