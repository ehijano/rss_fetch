      <title>Lomics: Generation of Pathways and Gene Sets using Large Language Models for Transcriptomic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interrogation of biological pathways is an integral part of omics data analysis. Large language models (LLMs) enable the generation of custom pathways and gene sets tailored to specific scientific questions. These targeted sets are significantly smaller than traditional pathway enrichment analysis libraries, reducing multiple hypothesis testing and potentially enhancing statistical power. Lomics (Large Language Models for Omics Studies) v1.0 is a python-based bioinformatics toolkit that streamlines the generation of pathways and gene sets for transcriptomic analysis. It operates in three steps: 1) deriving relevant pathways based on the researcher's scientific question, 2) generating valid gene sets for each pathway, and 3) outputting the results as .GMX files. Lomics also provides explanations for pathway selections. Consistency and accuracy are ensured through iterative processes, JSON format validation, and HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) gene symbol verification. Lomics serves as a foundation for integrating LLMs into omics research, potentially improving the specificity and efficiency of pathway analysis.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of Non-Ideal Reaction-Diffusion Systems: Implications for Active Self-Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework describing the dynamics and thermodynamics of open non-ideal reaction-diffusion systems, which embodies Flory-Huggins theories of mixtures and chemical reaction network theories. Our theory elucidates the mechanisms underpinning the emergence of self-organized dissipative structures in these systems. It evaluates the dissipation needed to sustain and control them, discriminating the contributions from each reaction and diffusion process with spatial resolution. It also reveals the role of the reaction network in powering and shaping these structures. We identify particular classes of networks in which diffusion processes always equilibrate within the structures, while dissipation occurs solely due to chemical reactions. The spatial configurations resulting from these processes can be derived by minimizing a kinetic potential, contrasting with the minimization of the thermodynamic free energy in passive systems. This framework opens the way to investigating the energetic cost of phenomena such as liquid-liquid phase separation, coacervation, and the formation of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>ProLLM: Protein Chain-of-Thoughts Enhanced LLM for Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding biological functions and diseases. Previous machine learning approaches to PPI prediction mainly focus on direct physical interactions, ignoring the broader context of nonphysical connections through intermediate proteins, thus limiting their effectiveness. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a new opportunity for addressing this complex biological challenge. By transforming structured data into natural language prompts, we can map the relationships between proteins into texts. This approach allows LLMs to identify indirect connections between proteins, tracing the path from upstream to downstream. Therefore, we propose a novel framework ProLLM that employs an LLM tailored for PPI for the first time. Specifically, we propose Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT), which replicates the biological mechanism of signaling pathways as natural language prompts. ProCoT considers a signaling pathway as a protein reasoning process, which starts from upstream proteins and passes through several intermediate proteins to transmit biological signals to downstream proteins. Thus, we can use ProCoT to predict the interaction between upstream proteins and downstream proteins. The training of ProLLM employs the ProCoT format, which enhances the model's understanding of complex biological problems. In addition to ProCoT, this paper also contributes to the exploration of embedding replacement of protein sites in natural language prompts, and instruction fine-tuning in protein knowledge datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of ProLLM through rigorous validation against benchmark datasets, showing significant improvement over existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalizability.
