      <title>The Impact of Bitcoin ETF Approval on Bitcoin's Hedging Properties Against Traditional Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF in January 2024 marked a transformative event in cryptocurrency markets, signaling increased institutional adoption and integration into traditional finance. This study examines Bitcoin's changing relationships with traditional assets, including equities, gold, and fiat currencies, following this milestone. Using rolling correlation analysis, Chow tests, and DCC-GARCH models, we found that Bitcoin's correlation with the S\&amp;P 500 increased significantly post-ETF approval, indicating stronger alignment with equities. Its relationship with gold stabilized near zero, while its correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index remained consistently negative, reflecting its continued independence from fiat currencies. These findings offer insights into Bitcoin's evolving role in portfolios, implications for market stability, and future research opportunities on cryptocurrency integration into traditional financial systems.</description>

      <title>ESG Integration into Corporate Strategy Value Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the formal introduction of its "dual-carbon" strategy in 2020, China has witnessed the concepts of green development and sustainability evolve from policy directives into a broad societal consensus. Within this transformative context, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework has emerged as a critical enabler, mutually reinforcing and synergizing with the national strategic objectives of achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality. This integration signifies a fundamental shift in corporate philosophy, urging enterprises to transcend a narrow focus on short-term financial metrics. To align with the national vision of ecological civilization and sustainable growth, companies are now expected to proactively fulfill their social responsibilities and pursue long-term, non-financial value creation. This entails a deep integration of ESG principles into the very core of corporate culture and strategy, ensuring their active implementation in daily operations and decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>The Agentic Regulator: Risks for AI in Finance and a Proposed Agent-based Framework for Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative and agentic artificial intelligence is entering financial markets faster than existing governance can adapt. Current model-risk frameworks assume static, well-specified algorithms and one-time validations; large language models and multi-agent trading systems violate those assumptions by learning continuously, exchanging latent signals, and exhibiting emergent behavior. Drawing on complex adaptive systems theory, we model these technologies as decentralized ensembles whose risks propagate along multiple time-scales. We then propose a modular governance architecture. The framework decomposes oversight into four layers of "regulatory blocks": (i) self-regulation modules embedded beside each model, (ii) firm-level governance blocks that aggregate local telemetry and enforce policy, (iii) regulator-hosted agents that monitor sector-wide indicators for collusive or destabilizing patterns, and (iv) independent audit blocks that supply third-party assurance. Eight design strategies enable the blocks to evolve as fast as the models they police. A case study on emergent spoofing in multi-agent trading shows how the layered controls quarantine harmful behavior in real time while preserving innovation. The architecture remains compatible with today's model-risk rules yet closes critical observability and control gaps, providing a practical path toward resilient, adaptive AI governance in financial systems.</description>

      <title>The Memorization Problem: Can We Trust LLMs' Economic Forecasts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) cannot be trusted for economic forecasts during periods covered by their training data. Counterfactual forecasting ability is non-identified when the model has seen the realized values: any observed output is consistent with both genuine skill and memorization. Any evidence of memorization represents only a lower bound on encoded knowledge. We demonstrate LLMs have memorized economic and financial data, recalling exact values before their knowledge cutoff. Instructions to respect historical boundaries fail to prevent recall-level accuracy, and masking fails as LLMs reconstruct entities and dates from minimal context. Post-cutoff, we observe no recall. Memorization extends to embeddings.</description>

      <title>CBDC Stress Test in a Dual-Currency Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the potential impact of introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on financial stability in an emerging dual-currency economy (Romania), where the domestic currency (RON) coexists with the euro. It develops an integrated analytical framework combining econometrics, machine learning, and behavioural modelling. CBDC adoption probabilities are estimated using XGBoost and logistic regression models trained on behavioural and macro-financial indicators rather than survey data. Liquidity stress simulations assess how banks would respond to deposit withdrawals resulting from CBDC adoption, while VAR, MSVAR, and SVAR models capture the macro-financial transmission of liquidity shocks into credit contraction and changes in monetary conditions. The findings indicate that CBDC uptake (co-circulating Digital RON and Digital EUR) would be moderate at issuance, amounting to around EUR 1 billion, primarily driven by digital readiness and trust in the central bank. The study concludes that a non-remunerated, capped CBDC, designed primarily as a means of payment rather than a store of value, can be introduced without compromising financial stability. In dual currency economies, differentiated holding limits for domestic and foreign digital currencies (e.g., Digital RON versus Digital Euro) are crucial to prevent uncontrolled euroisation and preserve monetary sovereignty. A prudent design with moderate caps, non remuneration, and macroprudential coordination can transform CBDC into a digital liquidity buffer and a complementary monetary policy instrument that enhances resilience and inclusion rather than destabilising the financial system.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Machine Learning? Regularization and Forecast Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard forecast efficiency tests interpret violations as evidence of behavioral bias. We show theoretically and empirically that rational forecasters using optimal regularization systematically violate these tests. Machine learning forecasts show near zero bias at one year horizon, but strong overreaction at two years, consistent with predictions from a model of regularization and measurement noise. We provide three complementary tests: experimental variation in regularization parameters, cross-sectional heterogeneity in firm signal quality, and quasi-experimental evidence from ML adoption around 2013. Technically trained analysts shift sharply toward overreaction post-2013. Our findings suggest reported violations may reflect statistical sophistication rather than cognitive failure.</description>
