      <title>Utilizing long memory and circulation patterns for stochastic forecasts of temperature extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long memory and circulation patterns are potential sources of subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions. Here, we infer one-dimensional nonlinear stochastic models of daily temperature which capture both long memory and external driving by the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index. To this end, we employ a data-driven method which combines fractional calculus and stochastic difference equations. A causal analysis of AO and North-Atlantic Oscillation indices and European daily extreme temperatures reveals the largest influence of the AO index on winter temperature in southern Scandinavia. Stochastic temperature forecasts for Visby Flygplats, Sweden, show significantly improved performance for long memory models. Binary temperature forecasts show predictive power for up to 20 (11) days lead time for maximum (minimum) daily temperature (66% CI) while an AR(1) model possesses predictive power for 8 (3) days lead time for daily maximum (minimum) temperature (66% CI). Our results show the potential of long memory and circulation patterns for extreme temperature forecasts.</description>

      <title>Questioning whether seasonal advance of intense tropical cyclones since the 1980s truly exists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shan et al. recently reported significant seasonal advances of intense tropical cyclones (TCs) in both the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) since the 1980s and emphasized the data insensitivity of this conclusion, based on the advanced Dvorak Technique-Hurricane Satellite (ADT-HURSAT) and the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) datasets. However, this conclusion contradicts with previous research and our recent findings. Our analyses reveal that both the magnitudes and statistical significance of seasonal advancing trends of intense TCs are sensitive to the choice of datasets. These inconsistencies primarily arise from the differences in intense TC cases identified from the two datasets, which is attributed to the uncertainties of ADT-HURSAT in estimating TCs' lifetime maximum intensities (LMIs). According to the IBTrACS records, we find that no significant seasonal advancing trends of intense TCs were observed in both hemispheres since the 1980s. These findings raise doubts about the validity of Shan et al.'s conclusions regarding the seasonal advance of intense TCs. We argue that the reported seasonal advance of intense TCs since the 1980s is inconclusive and further investigations with alternative datasets and approaches are needed.</description>

      <title>Recommendations for Comprehensive and Independent Evaluation of Machine Learning-Based Earth System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is a revolutionary technology with demonstrable applications across multiple disciplines. Within the Earth science community, ML has been most visible for weather forecasting, producing forecasts that rival modern physics-based models. Given the importance of deepening our understanding and improving predictions of the Earth system on all time scales, efforts are now underway to develop forecasting models into Earth-system models (ESMs), capable of representing all components of the coupled Earth system (or their aggregated behavior) and their response to external changes. Modeling the Earth system is a much more difficult problem than weather forecasting, not least because the model must represent the alternate (e.g., future) coupled states of the system for which there are no historical observations. Given that the physical principles that enable predictions about the response of the Earth system are often not explicitly coded in these ML-based models, demonstrating the credibility of ML-based ESMs thus requires us to build evidence of their consistency with the physical system. To this end, this paper puts forward five recommendations to enhance comprehensive, standardized, and independent evaluation of ML-based ESMs to strengthen their credibility and promote their wider use.</description>
