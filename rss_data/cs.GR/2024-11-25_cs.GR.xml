      <title>TEXGen: a Generative Diffusion Model for Mesh Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While high-quality texture maps are essential for realistic 3D asset rendering, few studies have explored learning directly in the texture space, especially on large-scale datasets. In this work, we depart from the conventional approach of relying on pre-trained 2D diffusion models for test-time optimization of 3D textures. Instead, we focus on the fundamental problem of learning in the UV texture space itself. For the first time, we train a large diffusion model capable of directly generating high-resolution texture maps in a feed-forward manner. To facilitate efficient learning in high-resolution UV spaces, we propose a scalable network architecture that interleaves convolutions on UV maps with attention layers on point clouds. Leveraging this architectural design, we train a 700 million parameter diffusion model that can generate UV texture maps guided by text prompts and single-view images. Once trained, our model naturally supports various extended applications, including text-guided texture inpainting, sparse-view texture completion, and text-driven texture synthesis.

      <title>Material Anything: Generating Materials for Any 3D Object via Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Material Anything, a fully-automated, unified diffusion framework designed to generate physically-based materials for 3D objects. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex pipelines or case-specific optimizations, Material Anything offers a robust, end-to-end solution adaptable to objects under diverse lighting conditions. Our approach leverages a pre-trained image diffusion model, enhanced with a triple-head architecture and rendering loss to improve stability and material quality. Additionally, we introduce confidence masks as a dynamic switcher within the diffusion model, enabling it to effectively handle both textured and texture-less objects across varying lighting conditions. By employing a progressive material generation strategy guided by these confidence masks, along with a UV-space material refiner, our method ensures consistent, UV-ready material outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms existing methods across a wide range of object categories and lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Weight Space of Customized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the space of weights spanned by a large collection of customized diffusion models. We populate this space by creating a dataset of over 60,000 models, each of which is a base model fine-tuned to insert a different person's visual identity. We model the underlying manifold of these weights as a subspace, which we term weights2weights. We demonstrate three immediate applications of this space that result in new diffusion models -- sampling, editing, and inversion. First, sampling a set of weights from this space results in a new model encoding a novel identity. Next, we find linear directions in this space corresponding to semantic edits of the identity (e.g., adding a beard), resulting in a new model with the original identity edited. Finally, we show that inverting a single image into this space encodes a realistic identity into a model, even if the input image is out of distribution (e.g., a painting). We further find that these linear properties of the diffusion model weight space extend to other visual concepts. Our results indicate that the weight space of fine-tuned diffusion models can behave as an interpretable meta-latent space producing new models.</description>

      <title>Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting for Few-Shot Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, the 3DGS model tends to overfit when trained with sparse posed views, limiting its generalization ability to novel views. In this paper, we alleviate the overfitting problem, presenting a Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS) approach. Our method encompasses a $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and a $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model. The $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model serves as an ensemble of 3DGS models that generates novel-view images during inference. We achieve the self-ensembling by introducing an uncertainty-aware perturbation strategy at the training state. We complement the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model with the $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model, which is dynamically perturbed based on the uncertainties of novel-view renderings across different training steps. The perturbation yields diverse temporal samples in the Gaussian parameter space without additional training costs. The geometry of the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model is regularized by penalizing discrepancies between the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and these temporal samples. Therefore, our SE-GS conducts an effective and efficient regularization across a large number of 3DGS models, resulting in a robust ensemble, the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model. Our experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets show that our approach improves NVS quality with few-shot training views, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Sketch-guided Cage-based 3D Gaussian Splatting Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) is one of the most promising novel 3D representations that has received great interest in computer graphics and computer vision. While various systems have introduced editing capabilities for 3D GS, such as those guided by text prompts, fine-grained control over deformation remains an open challenge. In this work, we present a novel sketch-guided 3D GS deformation system that allows users to intuitively modify the geometry of a 3D GS model by drawing a silhouette sketch from a single viewpoint. Our approach introduces a new deformation method that combines cage-based deformations with a variant of Neural Jacobian Fields, enabling precise, fine-grained control. Additionally, it leverages large-scale 2D diffusion priors and ControlNet to ensure the generated deformations are semantically plausible. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and showcase its ability to animate static 3D GS models as one of its key applications.</description>
