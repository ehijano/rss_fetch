      <title>Design of reconfigurable Huygens metasurfaces based on Drude-like scatterers operating in the epsilon-negative regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the feasibility of designing reconfigurable transmitting metasurfaces through the use of Drude-like scatterers with purely electric response. Theoretical and numerical analyses are provided to demonstrate that the response of spherical Drude-like scatterers can be tailored to achieve complete transmission, satisfying a generalized Kerker's condition at half of their plasma frequency. This phenomenon, which arises from the co-excitation of the electric dipole and the electric quadrupole within the scatterer, also exhibits moderate broadband performance. Subsequently, we present the application of these particles as meta-atoms in the design of reconfigurable multipolar Huygens metasurfaces, outlining the technical prerequisites for achieving effective beam-steering capabilities. Finally, we explore a plausible implementation of these low-loss Drude-like scatterers at microwave frequencies using plasma discharges. Our findings propose an alternative avenue for Huygens metasurface designs, distinct from established approaches relying on dipolar meta-atoms or on core-shell geometries. Unlike these conventional methods, our approach fosters seamless integration of reconfigurability strategies in beam-steering devices.</description>

      <title>Analytical photoresponses of gated nanowire photoconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional photoconductors have extraordinarily high photoresponse and gain, which can be modulated by gate voltages as shown in literature. However, the physics of gate modulation remains elusive. In this work, we investigated the physics of gate modulation in silicon nanowire photoconductors with the analytical photoresponse equations. It was found that the impact of gate voltage varies vastly for nanowires with different size. For the wide nanowires that cannot be pinched off by high gate voltage, we found that the photoresponses are enhanced by at least one order of magnitude due to the gate-induced electric passivation. For narrow nanowires that starts with a pinched-off channel, the gate voltage has no electric passivation effect but increases the potential barrier between source and drain, resulting in a decrease in dark and photo current. For the nanowires with an intermediate size, the channel is continuous but can be pinched off by a high gate voltage. The photoresponsivity and photodetectivity is maximized during the transition from the continuous channel to the pinched-off one. This work provides important insights on how to design high-performance photoconductors.</description>

      <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Without External Magnetic Fields from Individual CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), the latest generation of colloidal QD family, exhibit outstanding optical properties which are now exploited as both classical and quantum light sources. Most of their rather exceptional properties are related to the peculiar exciton fine-structure of band-edge states which can support unique bright triplet excitons. The degeneracy of the bright triplet excitons is lifted with energetic splitting in the order of millielectronvolts, which can be resolved by the photoluminescence (PL) measurements of single QDs at cryogenic temperatures. Each bright exciton fine-structure-state (FSS) exhibits a dominantly linear polarization, in line with several theoretical models based on the sole crystal field, exchange interaction and shape anisotropy. Here, we show that in addition to a high degree of linear polarization, the individual exciton FSS can exhibit a non-negligible degree of circular polarization even without external magnetic fields by investigating the four Stokes parameters of the exciton fine-structure in individual CsPbBr3 QDs through Stokes polarimetric measurements. We observe a degree of circular polarization up to ~38%, which could not be detected by using the conventional polarimetric technique. In addition, we found a consistent transition from left- to right-hand circular polarization within the fine-structure triplet manifold, which was observed in magnetic field dependent experiments. Our optical investigation provides deeper insights into the nature of the exciton fine-structures and thereby drives the yet-incomplete understanding of the unique photophysical properties of this novel class of QDs, potentially opening new scenarios in chiral quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Accurate determination of thermoelectric figure of merit using ac Harman method with a four-probe configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ac Harman method has been used for the direct estimation of dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) through ac/dc resistance measurements. However, accurate zT estimation with a four-probe configuration is difficult owing to the occurrence of a thermal phase-delay in the heat flow with a low frequency current. This study reports an exact solution for zT estimation by solving the heat conduction equation. The analysis can explain the reverse heat flow, which is the main source of the error in the four-probe configuration, and the experimentally obtained behavior of the frequency dependence of zT of (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$. Approximately 20 % of the error is caused by a thermal phase-delay, unless an appropriate current frequency and voltage-terminal position are chosen. Thus, an accurate zT evaluation using a four-probe configuration at any voltage terminal position is achieved. These findings can lead to interesting thermoelectric metrology and could serve as a powerful tool to search for promising thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Broadband Visible Wavelength Microcomb Generation In Silicon Nitride Microrings Through Air-Clad Dispersion Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of broadband microresonator frequency combs at visible wavelengths is pivotal for the advancement of compact and fieldable optical atomic clocks and spectroscopy systems. Yet, their realization necessitates resonators with anomalous dispersion, an arduous task due to the prevailing normal dispersion regime of materials within the visible spectrum. In this work, we evince that silicon nitride microring resonators with air cladding on top and sides -- a deviation from the frequently employed silica-embedded resonators -- allows for the direct generation of broadband microcombs in the visible range. We experimentally demonstrate combs pumped at 1060~nm (283~THz) that reach wavelengths as short as 680~nm (440 THz), and combs pumped at 780~nm (384 THz) that reach wavelengths as short as 630 nm (475 THz). We further show through simulations that microcombs extending to wavelengths as low as 461 nm (650 THz) should be accessible in this platform.</description>

      <title>Synthesize of PCPDTBT nanostructures and PCPDTBT_PC71BM nanocomposite via modified polymer-melt technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PCPDTBT nanostructures have been synthesized via template-assisted method and polymer-melt technique. The morphological, optical and structural properties of the PCPDTBT have been investigated. Melting polymer was used as a driving force to infiltrate the Anodic Aluminum Oxide (AAO) template in which the applied temperatures are 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 and 450 Celsius respectively. The melting time duration is set constant for 30 minutes for each of those melting temperatures. Nanowires constructions have been produced at all melting temperature however based the morphological investigation, only the first two melting temperatures, 200 and 250, that can serve the structural without any broken noticed on the Raman measurement. The optical and structural properties are also confirm these facts.</description>

      <title>Laser mode-hopping assisted all-optical single beam pulsed atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an all-optical single beam pulsed atomic magnetometer assisted by laser mode-hopping in a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser. We implement a temporal sequence of the laser current; sinusoidal current modulation including the laser mode-hop current for synchronous optical pumping and the following constant current for paramagnetic Faraday rotation measurements to probe the free induction decay (FID) of transverse $^{87}$Rb spin polarization. Repetitive sudden frequency shifts of 20 GHz around the pressure-broadened $^{87}$Rb spectra originating from laser mode-hopping enables discontinuous optical pumping modulation with a large depth which enhances transverse spin polarization. We achieve a sensitivity of 3.77 pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ in a magnetic field of 14 $\mu$T, limited by the performance of the frequency counter. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the sensitivity due to the non-magnetic noise such as photon shot-noise is 191 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$. Our approach based on laser mode-hopping can be applied to miniaturization of all-optical atomic magnetometers with sub-pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Reaching Curzon-Ahlborn limit in linear response and Whitney limit in nonlinear response in edge mode quantum thermoelectrics and refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators are proposed in three-terminal quantum Hall (QH) and quantum spin Hall (QSH) setups with a voltage-temperature probe in linear and nonlinear transport regimes. In the linear response regime, we find that efficiency at maximum power approaches the Curzon-Ahlborn limit in both QH and QSH setups. Similarly, in nonlinear response, we find that efficiency at maximum power reaches the Whitney bounds. For the first time, we see that the thermoelectric efficiency limits in linear and nonlinear transport regimes are achieved using quantum point contacts in the same setup.</description>

Abstract: We describe a new concept for a basic radiation detection panel based on conventional scintillator technology and commercially available solid-state photo-detectors. The panels are simple in construction, robust, very efficient and cost-effective and are easily scalable in size, from tens of cm$^2$ to tens of m$^2$. We describe two possible applications: flagging radioactive food coontamination and detection of illicit radio nucleides, such as those potentially used in a terrorist attack with a dirty bomb.</description>

      <title>Identifiability Study of Lithium-Ion Battery Capacity Fade Using Degradation Mode Sensitivity for a Minimally and Intuitively Parametrized Electrode-Specific Cell Open-Circuit Voltage Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When two electrode open-circuit potentials form a full-cell OCV (open-circuit voltage) model, cell-level SOH (state of health) parameters related to LLI (loss of lithium inventory) and LAM (loss of active materials) naturally appear. Such models have been used to interpret experimental OCV measurements and infer these SOH parameters associated with capacity fade. In this work, we first re-parametrize a popular OCV model formulation by the N/P (negative-to-positive) ratio and Li/P (lithium-to-positive) ratio, which have more symmetric and intuitive physical meaning, and are also pristine-condition-agnostic and cutoff-voltage-independent. We then study the modal identifiability of capacity fade by mathematically deriving the gradients of electrode slippage and cell OCV with respect to these SOH parameters, where the electrode differential voltage fractions, which characterize each electrode's relative contribution to the OCV slope, play a key role in passing the influence of a fixed cutoff voltage to the parameter sensitivity. The sensitivity gradients of the total capacity also reveal four characteristic regimes regarding how much lithium inventory and active materials are limiting the apparent capacity. We show the usefulness of these sensitivity gradients with an application regarding degradation mode identifiability from OCV measurements at different SOC (state of charge) windows.</description>

      <title>Rotating-modulated Higher-Order Topological States in a Split-ring Photonic Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of topology has brought device effects to a new level. Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) go beyond traditional descriptions of bulk-edge correspondence, broadening the understanding of topologically insulating phases. In this paper, a second-order split-ring photonic crystal (SSPC) with zero-dimensional (0D) corner states and one-dimensional (1D) edge states is proposed. Based on the coupling strength determined by the opening direction between the split-rings, the electronic transition strength of the electronic system is imitated, and the topological trivial and non-trivial transformation of the topological two-dimensional (2D) SSH model are realized by using the rotating split-ring lattice. Theory and simulation find that SSPC has non-trivial topological edge states that can be quantified by bulk polarization. As the opening direction of the split-rings gradually changes within one period, there will be transitions between four different topological polarizations of the lowest energy bands, which can be conveniently used to achieve transitions between different topological phases. Our research can be extended to higher dimensions and broaden research paths for higher-order photonic topological insulators and semimetals.</description>
