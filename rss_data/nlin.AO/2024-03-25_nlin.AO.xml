      <title>Cell Motility in Cancer, Crucial Events, Criticality, and L\'{e}vy Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of glioblastoma (GB) cell locomotion and its modeling inspired by Levy random walks is presented herein. We study such walks occurring on a two-dimensional plane where the walk is similar to the motion of a bird flying with a constant velocity, but with random changes of direction in time. The intelligence of the bird is signaled by the instantaneous changes of flying direction, which become invisible in the time series obtained by projecting the 2D walk either on the x axis or the y axis. We establish that the projected 1D time series share the statistical complexity of time series frequently used to monitor physiological processes, shedding light on the role of crucial events (CE-s) in pathophysiology. Such CE-s are signified by abrupt changes of flying direction which are invisible in the 1D physiological time series. We establish a connection between the complex scaling index \delta generated by the CE-s through \mu_{R} = 2 - \delta , where \mu_{R} is the inverse power law index of the probability density function of the time interval between consecutive failures of the process of interest. We argue that the identification of empirical indices along with their theoretical relations afford important measures to control cancer.</description>

      <title>Dynamical importance and network perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leading eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the adjacency matrix of a graph exerts much influence on the behavior of dynamical processes on that graph. It is thus relevant to relate notions of the importance (specifically, centrality measures) of network structures to $\lambda$ and its associated eigenvector. We study a previously derived measure of edge importance known as "dynamical importance", which estimates how much $\lambda$ changes when one removes an edge from a graph or adds an edge to it. We examine the accuracy of this estimate for different network structures and compare it to the true change in $\lambda$ after an edge removal or edge addition. We then derive a first-order approximation of the change in the leading eigenvector. We also consider the effects of edge additions on Kuramoto dynamics on networks, and we express the Kuramoto order parameter in terms of dynamical importance. Through our analysis and computational experiments, we find that studying dynamical importance can improve understanding of the relationship between network perturbations and dynamical processes on networks.</description>

      <title>Consensus formation in quality-sensitive interdependent agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate fluctuations arising from finite-size effects.
  In scenarios with strong interdependence, we identify an absorbing phase transition and scrutinize its key features, including critical fluctuations in finite spatial systems. We find that fluctuations play a significant role in the collective decision-making process, particularly when options have similar qualities.
  Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively. Finally, we show that this model also fulfills Weber's Law of perception, aligning with previous analyses of collective-decision problems in their adherence to different psychophysical laws.</description>
