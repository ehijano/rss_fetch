      <title>The Mechanism behind the Information Encoding for Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement islands are subregions in a gravitational universe whose information is fully encoded in a disconnected non-gravitational system away from it. In the context of the black hole information paradox, entanglement islands state that the information about the black hole interior is encoded in the early-time Hawking radiation. Nevertheless, it was unclear how this seemingly nonlocal information encoding emerges from a manifestly local theory. In this paper, we provide an answer to this question by uncovering the mechanism behind this information encoding scheme. As we will see, the early understanding that graviton is massive in island models plays an essential role in this mechanism. As an example, we will discuss how this mechanism works in detail in the Karch-Randall braneworld. This study also suggests the potential importance of this mechanism to the ER=EPR conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Non-Relativistic Limit for Heterotic Supergravity and its Gauge Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the non-relativistic (NR) limit of $D=10$ heterotic supergravity has a finite gauge Lagrangian due to non-trivial cancellations of divergent parts coming from the Chern-Simons terms in the curvature of the $\hat B$-field and the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. This is similar to what happens in bosonic supergravity between the Ricci scalar, $\hat R$, and the $- \frac{1}{12} \hat H^2$ term after taking the same limit. In this work we present the explicit form of the gauge transformations and curvatures after considering the NR limit and we compute the finite gauge Lagrangian in its covariant form. As an interesting property, the Green-Schwarz mechanism for the two-form can be trivialized in this limit. Terms equivalent to Chern-Simons contributions naturally arise from the previous property.</description>

      <title>Firewalls From General Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I define "horizon normalcy" as the approximate validity of Semiclassical Gravity and Effective Field Theory (SGEFT), for the description of observers that approach or cross a black hole horizon. If black holes return information, then horizon normalcy must fail substantially, at least in some global states. Proposals such as ER=EPR and nonisometric maps assert that horizon normalcy persists, so long as the Hawking radiation remains in a computationally simple state. Here I argue that state-dependent horizon normalcy - independently of the underlying mechanism, and independently of the class of radiation states asserted to guarantee normalcy - requires a breakdown of general covariance far from the black hole, or else horizon normalcy will depend on the infinite future of the exterior. This is because the radiation can be in different states at different events, all spacelike to the horizon crossing event whose normalcy is at stake. I discuss a related effect in AdS/CFT, and I argue that its resolution by timefolds is of no help here.</description>

      <title>Birational Transformations and 2d (0,2) Quiver Gauge Theories beyond Toric Fano 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a family of birational transformations that relate toric Fano 3-folds defined by reflexive lattice polytopes can be identified with mass deformations of corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. These theories are realized by a Type IIA brane configuration known as brane brick models. We further show that the same family of birational transformations extends to more general toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, including those defined by non-reflexive toric diagrams. Under these birational transformations, the mesonic moduli spaces of the associated abelian 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories and brane brick models share the same number of generators and the same Hilbert series when refined only under the U(1)R symmetry. Since these transformations categorize toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds and their corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories into non-trivial equivalence classes, we anticipate that our findings will pave the way for a `Minimal Model Program' for quiver gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a two-dimensional Kemmer oscillator within relativistic quantum mechanics, incorporating minimal length and non-commutative phase space effects. We derive eigen solutions in configuration space $\{p\}$, examining the relationship between minimal length and non-commutative parameters. Our analysis reveals a connection to the Schr\"odinger equation through a P\"oschl-Teller potential, enhancing our understanding of fundamental quantum phenomena in relativistic systems.</description>

      <title>Notes on conformal integrals: Coulomb branch amplitudes, magic identities and bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multi-loop conformal integrals for four-point correlators of planar ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, and in particular those contributing to Coulomb branch amplitudes in the ten-dimensional lightlike limit, where linear combinations of such integrals are determined by the large R-charge octagons exactly known from integrability. Exploiting known results for integrands, we review those combinations of dual conformal invariant (DCI) integrals that must evaluate to determinants of ladders, generalizing the simplest cases of Basso-Dixon fishnet integrals; in this way, we summarize all-loop predictions for the integrands (which are extracted from $f$-graphs) contributing to components of Coulomb branch amplitudes, such as next-to-fishnet integrals. Moreover, this exercise produces new ``magic identities", {\it i.e.} certain combinations of DCI integrals equal zero, and we enumerate and simplify such identities up to six loops explicitly.
  On the other hand, most of these individual integrals have not been computed beyond three loops, and as a first step we consider a bootstrap program for DCI integrals based on their leading singularities and the space of pure functions. We bootstrap the $3$ non-trivial DCI integrals for four-loop Coulomb branch amplitudes (providing an independent verification of the four-loop magic identity), which all take remarkably simple form as weight-$8$ single-valued harmonic polylogarithms. We also compute all leading singularities and a large portion of the pure functions for the $34$ DCI integrals contributing to five-loop amplitudes, where not only some integrals evaluate to functions beyond harmonic polylogarithms but they also contain lower-weight pieces individually.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Phantom Dark Energy and its Relation to Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we show that, at its fundamental level, phantom dark energy is a fluid made up of time crystals that permeate the fabric of space-time. In turn, any well-behaved stable theory of a non-canonical scalar field that acts as phantom dark energy also leads to the production of time crystals. This relation offers a new way of thinking and a deeper insight into the nature of the most inexplicable of all ingredients in the universe, dark energy.</description>

      <title>A First Look at Quartic-in-Spin Binary Dynamics at Third Post-Minkowskian Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the conservative and radiation-reaction contributions to classical observables in the gravitational scattering between a spinning and a spinless black hole to the fourth order in spin and third order in the gravitational constant. The conservative results are obtained from two-loop amplitudes for the scattering process of a massive scalar with a massive spin-$s$ field $(s=0, 1, 2)$ minimally coupled to gravity, employing the recently introduced spin interpolation method to resolve all spin-Casimir terms. The two-loop amplitude exhibits a spin-shift symmetry in both probe limits, which we conjecture to be a sign of yet unknown integrability of Kerr orbits through the quartic order in spin and to all orders in the gravitational constant. We obtain the radial action from the finite part of the amplitude and use it to compute classical observables, including the impulse and spin kick. This is done using the recently introduced covariant Dirac brackets, which allow for the computation of classical scattering observables for general (non-aligned) spin configurations. Finally, employing the radiation-reaction amplitude proposed by Alessio and Di Vecchia, together with the Dirac brackets, we obtain radiation-reaction contributions to observables at all orders in spin and beyond the aligned-spin limit. We find agreement with known results up to the quadratic order in spin for both conservative and radiation-reaction contributions. Our results advance the state of the art in the understanding of spinning binary dynamics in general relativity and demonstrate the power and simplicity of the Dirac bracket formalism for relating scattering amplitudes to classical observables.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet-induced symmetry breaking/restoration during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of symmetry breaking or restoration that can occur in the middle of inflation due to the coupling of the Gauss-Bonnet term to a charged scalar. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling results in an inflaton-dependent effective squared mass of the charged scalar, which can change its sign (around the symmetric point) during inflation. This can lead to spontaneous breaking of the symmetry, or to its restoration, if it is initially broken. We show the conditions under which the backreaction of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling on the inflationary background is negligible, such that the predictions of a given inflationary model are unaffected by the symmetry breaking/restoration process.</description>

      <title>Oscillons from $Q$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Renormalization Group Theory we show that oscillons in (1+1)-dimensions can be obtained, at the leading nonlinear order, from $Q$-balls of universal complex field theories. For potentials with a nonzero cubic or quartic term the universal $Q$-ball theory is well approximated by the integrable complex sine-Gordon model. This allows us to generalize the usual perturbative expansion by Fodor et. al. beyond the simplest unmodulated oscillon case. Concretely, we explain the characteristic amplitude modulations of excited oscillons as an effect of formation of a two-Q-ball (two-oscillon) bound state.</description>

      <title>Relating electrodynamics and gravity in two Euclidean dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electrodynamics coupled to Dirac fermions is mapped onto two-dimensional gravity in the first-order formalism, also including fermions. However, the resulting fermion-gravity coupling deviates from the conventional form, explicitly violating parity and time-reversal symmetries. Additionally, these fermions exhibit an unconventional transformation behavior under $SO(2)$ transformations. Furthermore, we analyze the consistency of this mapping at the quantum level using the path integral formalism and Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin techniques. Our findings demonstrate that quantum electrodynamics and quantum gravity remain equivalent at the quantum level.</description>

      <title>A unique coupling of the massive spin-2 field to supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the coupling of a massive spin-2 field to undeformed N=1 supergravity in four dimensions is unique, leading to a specific non-minimal coupling to the Riemann tensor. The massive spin-2 coupling reproduces the one of an oscillator mode in open string theory, while the massive spin-1 coupling includes a higher-derivative term that is expected to violate causality in the background of a gravitational shock wave. We argue that the resolution of causality and the unitarity bound in the Regge limit require the introduction of infinitely many higher-spin fields similar to the Regge trajectories in string theory, therefore providing an argument in favour of the string lamppost principle with minimal supersymmetry in four dimensions. To obtain this result, we construct the general stress-energy tensor multiplet for the massive spin-2 multiplet with N=1 supersymmetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A global scale-invariant Dark Energy model based on Induced Gravity with the addition of a small $R^2$ contribution is examined. The scalar field (quintessence), playing the role of Dark Energy, has a quartic potential and generates Newton's constant with its non-minimal coupling (after introducing a suitable symmetry breaking). Even when small, the $R^2$ contribution significantly modifies the cosmological evolution of the matter-gravity system. The solutions to this model are obtained analytically through a perturbative expansion and oscillate with transplanckian frequency. They are then compared with similar solutions found for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology plus $R^2$. Finally scalar field production is perturbatively taken into account in a simple model and the resulting effects illustrated.</description>

      <title>Rotating and swirling binary black hole system balanced by its gravitational spin-spin interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first exact and analytical solution representing an equilibrium configuration of two stationary black holes, in general relativity, is presented. The metric models two collinear extremal Kerr black holes immersed into an external and back-reacting rotating tidal drag. The gravitational attraction is balanced by the repulsive gravitational spin-spin interaction generated by the interplay between black holes angular momenta with the rotational background. The new solution is built by embedding the double Kerr metric into a swirling universe by means of the Ehlers transformation. The geometry is completely regular outside the event horizons. Thermodynamic properties of the binary black hole system are studied, the Smarr law, the first law and the Christodoulou-Ruffini formulas are verified. Microscopic degrees of freedom of the entropy are computed from the dual CFT living on the boundary of the near horizon geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>

      <title>Dual view of the Z$_2$-Gauged XY Model in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $Z_2$ gauged neutral XY model is of long-standing interest both in the context of nematic order, and the study of fractionalization and superconductivity. This paper presents heuristic arguments that no deconfinement of the XY field occurs in this model and presents results of a large-scale Monte Carlo simulations on a cubic lattice which are consistent with this conclusion. The correlation radius determining the confinement is found to be growing rapidly as a function of the parameters in the phase featuring the nematic order. Thus, mesoscopic properties of the system can mimic deconfinement with high accuracy in some part of the phase diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work arXiv:2410.00112, we introduced and computed entanglement entropy of the color flux tube (FTE$^2$) between a heavy quark-antiquark pair in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory. Our numerical results suggest that FTE$^2$ can be partitioned into a component corresponding to transverse vibrations of the flux tube and an internal color entropy. Further, motivated by analytical (1+1)D calculations, and SU(2) (2+1)D Yang-Mills numerical results, we argued that the internal entropy takes the form $\langle F\rangle\log(N_c)$, with $\langle F\rangle$ the number of times, on average, that the flux tube crossed a boundary between region $V$ and its complement. We extend here our FTE$^2$ study to consider different geometries of region $V$, varying the number of boundary crossings, and number of colors. Our preliminary results support the conjectured form of the internal entropy, albeit with noteworthy subtleties relating to the partial/full intersections of the flux tube with the region $V$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard formula, due to Spiegel, for the smoothing of temperature fluctuations by radiative transfer is unstable in relativity. This is due to the fact that Spiegel neglected the transit time of light, thereby allowing the transport coefficients to move outside the convex geometry compatible with causality (the "hydrohedron"). Here, we fix this pathology. First, we prove that the linearized radiative transfer equations are causal and covariantly stable by construction. Then, we repeat Spiegel's calculation accounting for the finite speed of photons. We find that the full transfer problem can be solved analytically. All the infinite (exact) transport coefficients arising from it fall inside the hydrohedron. Our analysis also accounts for isotropic scattering.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Polarization, Geodesic Equation and Sachs-Wolfe Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the null geodesic equation for photons is modified in the presence of a charged scalar field, with quantum fluctuations acting as an effective mass term that changes the null paths to timelike curves. This effect can be interpreted as a vacuum polarization phenomenon in curved spacetime. The resulting contribution to the Sachs-Wolfe effect varies with photon frequency, leading to frequency-dependent corrections to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) blackbody spectrum in the form of a $\mu$-distortion, as well as modifications to the CMB power spectrum. We estimate these within a standard inflationary scenario and find that while the correction to the CMB power spectrum is significant when the scalar field is light, the magnitude of the $\mu$-distortion depends strongly on the regularization prescription.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: \textit{Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics?} This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints from information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and obeying any statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this, we obtain the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ and the system energy of the black hole as its thermal energy: $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze a scalar field model which gives rise to stable bound states in field space characterized by nonzero motion that breaks the underlying time translation symmetry of its Hamiltonian, known as time crystals. We demonstrate that an ideal fluid made up of these time crystals behaves as phantom dark energy characterized by an equation of state $w \le -1$, speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2} &gt; 0$, and nonnegative energy density $\rho \ge 0$.</description>

      <title>Equatorial periodic orbits and gravitational waveforms in a black hole free of Cauchy horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the periodic orbits and gravitational wave radiation in an extreme mass ratio inspiral system, where a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole without Cauchy horizons. Firstly, by using the effective potential, the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits are investigated. It is found that the radius, orbital angular momentum, and energy increase with the hair parameter for both orbits. Based on these results, we examine one special type of orbit, the periodic orbit, around the black hole without the Cauchy horizon. The results show that, for a fixed rational number, the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit increase with the hair parameter. In particular, we observe a significant deviation from the Schwarzschild case for small hair parameter with a large amount of external mass outside the black hole horizon. Moreover, we examine the waveforms in the extreme mass ratio inspiral system to explore the orbital information of the periodic orbits and the constraints on the parameters of the black holes. The results reveal that the gravitational waveforms can fully capture the zoom-whirl behavior of periodic orbits. Moreover, the phase of the gravitational waves imposes constraints on the parameters of the black hole solutions. As the system evolves, the phase shift of the waveforms becomes increasingly significant, with cumulative deviations becoming more pronounced over time. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole background, the waveform phase will advance for the central supermassive black hole without a Cauchy horizon.</description>

Abstract: We study the zero modes of the operator $H_f=D^*_fD_f$, with a Dirac type operator $D_f$, acting on the spinor bundle over a closed even dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$. The operator $D_f=D+ifI$ is a deformation of the Dirac operator $D$ by a smooth function $f$. We obtain sufficient conditions on the deformation function that guarantee the positivity of the operator $H_f$, that is, the absence of zero modes. We also show that these conditions are not necessary and provide an explicit counterexample of a zero mode of the operator $H_f$.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for a CP broken deconfined phase at $\theta =\pi$ in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory through simulations at imaginary $\theta$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills at $\theta=\pi$, which has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we provide a numerical evidence that the CP symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken at low temperature and it gets restored above the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, which is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the situation predicted in the large-$N$ limit. We avoid the severe sign problem by performing simulations at imaginary $\theta$. We obtain the critical temperature of the CP restoration and that of deconfinement at $\theta=\pi$ by analytic continuation, which leads to the above conclusion.</description>

      <title>Emergent large flavor mixing from canonical and inverse seesaws?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the canonical seesaw mechanism provides a most natural qualitative interpretation of tiny masses for the three active neutrinos, it offers no explanation for their large flavor mixing effects. The latter can be regarded as an emergent consequence of this mechanism, in which case we are left with an intriguing cross seesaw framework in the mass basis of all the six Majorana neutrinos. To lower the mass scales of heavy neutrinos, one is motivated to invoke the inverse seesaw mechanism but has to pay the price for a fine-tuned cancellation between its two sets of new degrees of freedom, in which case the largeness of active flavor mixing is an emergent phenomenon as well. A comparison between the approximate seesaw relations in the flavor basis and those exact ones in the mass basis is also made.</description>

      <title>Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic censorship and Hoop conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit, highlighting the potential of analog systems to capture essential features of BH physics. Interestingly, we find that while geometric criteria related to the hoop conjecture are necessary, they are not sufficient for BH formation in our model. Instead, the exponential growth of energy and cluster size emerges as the key indicator, suggesting a novel interpretation of the hoop conjecture and providing further support for cosmic censorship within our analog framework by ensuring horizon formation. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions that could shed light on Hawking radiation and the BH information paradox by linking entanglement entropy in quantum percolation models to BH entropy.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly test or measure weak gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the first-tier prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculating the action and the interaction Hamiltonian at higher orders in cosmological perturbation theory is a cumbersome task. We employ the formalism of EFT of inflation in models of single field ultra slow-roll inflation and obtain a non-perturbative result for the Hamiltonian in terms of the Goldstone field $\pi$. To complete the dictionary, a non-linear relation between the curvature perturbations and $\pi$ is presented. Equipped with these non-linear results, we calculate the higher order loop corrections in USR models which are employed for PBHs formation. It is shown that the loop corrections on long CMB scales increase rapidly with the number of loop $L$ and the setup will go out of perturbative control at the four-loop level.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Masses and Phenomenology in Nnaturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that $N$naturalness scenarios have an intrinsic mechanism to suppress neutrino masses. As in other infrared neutrino mass models like extra-dimensional theories or many species theories, the large number of mixing partners is responsible for the neutrino mass suppression. It is shown how neutrino mass matrices arise in $N$naturalness models and the resulting neutrino mixing is analyzed. The first result is that a totally democratic coupling among the different sectors like in the original models is already ruled out by the fact that neutrinos are not massless. In the case where the sector couplings deviate from the intersector ones a tower of additional neutrino mass eigenstates appears whose difference between the squared masses, $\Delta m_{ij}^2$, is determined fully by the theory. The resulting phenomenology of such a tower is investigated and the unique signals in neutrino oscillation experiments, neutrino mass measurements, and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are discussed. This opens the door for terrestrial tests of $N$naturalness whose phenomenology was so far focused on Cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to optimizing the reduction of Feynman integrals using integration-by-parts identities. By developing a priority function through the FunSearch algorithm, which combines large language models and genetic algorithms, we achieve significant improvements in memory usage and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods. Our approach demonstrates substantial reductions in the required seeding integrals, making previously intractable integrals more manageable. Tested on a variety of Feynman integrals, including one-loop and multi-loop cases with planar and non-planar configurations, our method demonstrates remarkable scalability and adaptability. For reductions of certain Feynman integrals with many dots and numerators, we observed an improvement by a factor of 3058 compared to traditional methods. This work provides a powerful and interpretable framework for optimizing IBP reductions, paving the way for more efficient and practical calculations in high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how competitive gravitational wave detectors can be to current and near-future colliders in probing a model where the new physics is completely encapsulated in a modified scalar sector. For this, we study a model where an additional logarithmic term arises in the scalar potential due to a non-trivial path integral measure, which is constructed using effective field theory. This new term alters the dynamics of cosmological phase transitions and could lead to potentially detectable gravitational waves from the early Universe. Our results confirm the expectation that the intensity of such spectrum is highly correlated to the scalar field's self-coupling, and that gravitational wave experiments could therefore be used to probe these couplings with an accuracy competitive with the projected sensitivity of near-future colliders.</description>

Abstract: Weyl conformal geometry is a gauge theory of scale invariance that naturally brings together the Standard Model (SM) and Einstein gravity. The SM embedding in this geometry is possible without new degrees of freedom beyond SM and Weyl geometry, while Einstein gravity is generated by the broken phase of this symmetry. This follows a Stueckelberg breaking mechanism in which the Weyl gauge boson becomes massive and decouples, as discussed in the past (arXiv:1812.08613, 1904.06596, 2104.15118). However, Weyl anomaly could break explicitly this gauge symmetry, hence we study it in Weyl geometry. We first note that in Weyl geometry {\it metricity} can be restored with respect to a new differential operator ($\hat \nabla$) that also enforces a Weyl-covariant formulation. This leads to a metric-like Weyl gauge invariant formalism that enables one to do quantum calculations directly in Weyl geometry, rather than use a Riemannian (metric) geometry picture. The result is the Weyl-covariance in $d$ dimensions of all geometric operators ($\hat R$, etc) {\it and} of their derivatives ($\hat\nabla_\mu\hat R$, etc), including the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet term. A natural, Weyl-invariant dimensional regularisation of quantum corrections exists and Weyl gauge symmetry is then maintained and manifest at the quantum level, in $d$ dimensions. This is related to a non-trivial current of this symmetry, the divergence of which cancels the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The "usual" Weyl anomaly and Riemannian geometry are recovered in the (spontaneously) broken phase. The relation to holographic Weyl anomaly is discussed.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Polyakov Loop for QCD with Twelve Massless Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12203v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider continuum-formulation QCD in four dimensions with twelve massless fundamental quark flavors. Splitting the SU(\(N\)) gauge field into background and fluctuation parts, we use well-developed techniques to calculate the one-loop effective action for the theory. We find that for constant self-dual background field-strength tensor the notorious infrared divergences of the effective action cancel between gauge and matter sectors if the number of massless quark flavors is exactly . The ultraviolet divergencies of the effective action are non-perturbatively renormalized with a \b{eta}-function that matches the known perturbative result in the high energy limit. The resulting UV- and IR-finite effective action possesses a non-trivial saddle which has lower free energy than the perturbative vacuum, and for which the expectation value of the Polyakov loop vanishes. Inclusion of finite temperature effects points to the presence of a first-order phase transition to the perturbative vacuum with a calculable critical temperature.</description>

      <title>New insights into the analytic structure of correlation functions via kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The way a relativistic system approaches fluid dynamical behaviour can be understood physically through the signals that will contribute to its linear response to perturbations. What these signals are is captured in the analytic structure of the retarded correlation function. The non-analyticities can be grouped into three types based on their dimension in the complex frequency plane. In this paper, we will use kinetic theory to find how we can calculate their corresponding signals. In the most general case of a system with particles that have a continuum of thermalization rates, we find that a non-analytic region appears. To calculate its signal, we introduce the non-analytic area density that describes the properties of this region, and we construct a method to calculate it. Further, to take into account the ambiguity present in signal analysis, following from manipulations of the non-analyticities, we will identify two specific choices called pictures with interesting analytic properties and compare in what scenarios each picture is most useful.</description>

      <title>Dynamical edge modes in Maxwell theory from a BRST perspective, with an application to the Casimir energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, dynamical edge modes (DEM) in Maxwell theory have been constructed using a specific local boundary condition on the horizon. We discuss how to enforce this boundary condition on an infinite parallel plate in the QED vacuum by introducing Lagrange multiplier fields into the action. We carefully introduce appropriate boundary ghosts to maintain BRST invariance. Explicit correspondence of this BRST extended theory with the original DEM formulation is discussed, both directly, and through the correspondence between edge modes and Wilson lines attached to the boundary surface. We then use functional methods to calculate the Casimir energy for the first time with DEM boundary conditions imposed on two infinite parallel plates, both in generalized Coulomb and linear covariant gauge. Depending on the gauge, different fields are contributing, but, after correctly implementing the BRST symmetry, we retrieve the exact same Casimir energy as for two perfectly conducting parallel plates.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Mixed Phase Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity of thermofield double states in systems with mixed phase space, uncovering a direct correlation with the Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner statistics. Our analysis spans two-dimensional random matrix models featuring (I) GOE-Poisson and (II) GUE-Poisson transitions and extends to higher-dimensional cases, including a stringy matrix model (GOE-Poisson) and the mass-deformed SYK model (GUE-Poisson). Krylov complexity consistently emerges as a reliable marker of quantum chaos, displaying a characteristic peak in the chaotic regime that gradually diminishes as the Brody parameter approaches zero, signaling a shift toward integrability. These results establish Krylov complexity as a powerful diagnostic of quantum chaos and highlight its interplay with eigenvalue statistics in mixed phase systems.</description>

      <title>Testing the RG-flow $M(3,10)+\phi_{1,7}\to M(3,8)$ with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) methods provide a powerful numerical approach for investigating strongly coupled QFTs. In this work, we develop HT techniques to analyse a specific Renormalization Group (RG) flow recently proposed in Refs. [1, 3]. These studies put forward Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for the conformal minimal models $M(3,10)$ and $M(3,8)$, as well as the RG flow connecting them. Specifically, the RG-flow is defined by deforming the $M(3,10)$ with the relevant primary operator $\phi_{1,7}$ (whose indices denote its position in the Kac table), yielding $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$. From the perspective of HT, realising such an RG-flow presents significant challenges, as the $\phi_{1,7}$ deformation requires renormalizing the UV theory up to third order in the coupling constant of the deformation. In this study, we carry out the necessary calculations to formulate HT for this theory and numerically investigate the spectrum of $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$ in the large coupling regime, finding strong evidence in favour of the proposed flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The de Sitter conjecture yields a severe bound on possible vacua for a consistent quantum gravity. We extend the de Sitter conjecture by taking into account dynamics of the scalar field. We then apply such an extended de Sitter conjecture to a quintessence model of inflation for which dynamics of the scalar field is essential, and obtain an allowed region of parameters of the scalar potential wider than previously considered cases with the conventional de Sitter conjecture. The new bounds in the swampland conjecture could have implications in several situations to construct compactification models.</description>

Abstract: We discuss recent approaches to the computation of black hole entropies through semiclassical estimates of appropriate state overlaps, saturated by Euclidean wormhole configurations. We notice that the relevant saddle-point manifolds may exhibit instabilities, thereby compromising the interpretation of the Euclidean path integral as a tool for computing positive-definite inner products. We show that a proper treatment using a microcanonical formulation effectively addresses the puzzles posed by these instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our studies of the ghost condensate (GC) with sixth-order dispersion relation. Contrary to the GC with quartic dispersion relation, we find that the correction to the Newtonian potential explicitly depends on the space and time dependence of matter density. At late times when the Newtonian potential becomes time-independent, one obtains similar oscillatory behavior at the distance $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{M^2}$, but this time at the time scale $\frac{M^4}{M_\textrm{Pl}^3}$, where $M^2$ is the ghost field velocity. We also show that the speed of gravitational wave is modified in a frequency dependent manner at momenta close to $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{\sqrt{|\sigma_1|}}$, where $\sigma_1$ is the coefficient of $\gamma^{ij} \nabla_i K_{lr} \nabla_j K^{lr}$ operator in the unitary gauge action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge origami is a generalized supersymmetric gauge theory defined on several intersecting space-time components. It provides a systematic way to consider generalizations of instantons. In this thesis, we explore the gauge origami system in $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}\times \mathbb{C}^{4}$ and its BPS/CFT correspondence. String theoretically, instantons of the gauge origami system arise from D0-branes bound to D$(2p)$-branes wrapping cycles in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$. The low energy theory of the D0-branes is understood as an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanical system and the Witten index of it produces the instanton partition function. We define a $q$-deformed quiver Cartan matrix associated to this quiver structure and introduce vertex operators associated with the D-branes and show that the contour integral formula for the Witten index has a nice free field realization. Such free field realization leads to the concept of BPS $qq$-characters or BPS quiver W-algebras, which are generalizations of the conventional deformed W-algebras. The $qq$-characters of D2 and D4-branes correspond to screening charges and generators of the affine quiver W-algebra, respectively. On the other hand, the $qq$-characters of D6 and D8-branes represent novel types of $qq$-characters, where monomial terms are characterized by plane partitions and solid partitions. The composition of these $qq$-characters yields the instanton partition functions of the gauge origami system, eventually establishing the BPS/CFT correspondence. Additionally, we demonstrate that the fusion of $qq$-characters of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-brane $qq$-characters. We also investigate quadratic relations among these $qq$-characters. Furthermore, we explore the relationship with the representations of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</description>

Abstract: We study time-dependent compactification of extra dimensions. We assume that the spacetime is spatially homogeneous, and solve the vacuum Einstein equations without cosmological constant in more than three dimensions. We consider globally hyperbolic spacetimes in which almost Abelian Lie groups act on the spaces isometrically and simply transitively. We give left-invariant metrics on the spaces and solve Ricci-flat conditions of the spacetimes. In the four-dimensional case, our solutions correspond to the Bianchi type II solution. By our results and previous studies, all spatially homogeneous solutions whose spaces have zero-dimensional moduli spaces of left-invariant metrics are found. For the simplest solution, we show that each of the spatial dimensions cannot expand or contract simultaneously in the late-time it.</description>

      <title>BOSS Constraints on Massive Particles during Inflation: The Cosmological Collider in Action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive particles leave imprints on primordial non-Gaussianity via couplings to the inflaton, even despite their exponential dilution during inflation: practically, the Universe acts as a Cosmological Collider. We present the first dedicated search for spin-zero particles using BOSS redshift-space galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles, as well as Planck CMB non-Gaussianity data. We demonstrate that some Cosmological Collider models are well approximated by the standard equilateral and orthogonal parametrization; assuming negligible inflaton self-interactions, this facilitates us translating Planck non-Gaussianity constraints into bounds on Collider models. Many models have signatures that are not degenerate with equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussianity and thus require dedicated searches. Here, we constrain such models using BOSS three-dimensional redshift-space galaxy clustering data, focusing on spin-zero particles in the principal series (i.e. with mass $m\geq 3H/2$) and constraining their couplings to the inflaton at varying speed and mass, marginalizing over the unknown inflaton self-interactions. This is made possible through an improvement in Cosmological Bootstrap techniques and the combination of perturbation theory and halo occupation distribution models for galaxy clustering. Our work sets the standard for inflationary spectroscopy with cosmological observations, providing the ultimate link between physics on the largest and smallest scales.</description>

      <title>Geometry from geodesics: fine-tuning Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild argued that measurements of null and timelike geodesics yield Weyl and projective connections, respectively, with compatibility in the lightlike limit giving an integrable Weyl connection. Their conclusions hold only for a 4-dim representation of the conformal connection on the null cone, and by restricting reparameterizations of timelike geodesics to yield a torsion-free, affine connection. An arbitrary connection gives greater freedom. A linear connection for the conformal symmetry of null geodesics requires the SO(4,2) representation. The enlarged class of projective transformations of timelike geodesics changes Weyl's projective curvature, and we find invariant forms of the torsion and nonmetricity, along with a new, invariant, second rank tensor field generalizing the dilatational curvature without requiring a metric. We show that either projective or conformal connections require a monotonic, twice differentiable function on a spacetime region foliated by order isomorphic, totally ordered, twice differentiable timelike curves in a necessarily Lorentzian geometry. We prove that the conditions for projective and conformal Ricci flatness imply each other and gauge choices within either can reduce the geometry to the original Riemannian form. Thus, measurements of null and timelike geodesics lead to an SO(4,2) connection, with no requirement for a lightlike limit. Reduction to integrable Weyl symmetry can only follow from the field equations of a gravity theory. We show that the simplest quadratic spacetime action leads to this reduction.</description>

      <title>Probing flavored regimes of leptogenesis with gravitational waves from cosmic strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings radiate detectable gravitational waves in models featuring high-scale symmetry breaking, e.g., high-scale leptogenesis. In this Letter, for the first time, we show that different flavored regimes of high-scale leptogenesis can be tested with the spectral features in cosmic string-radiated gravitational waves. This is possible if the scalar field that makes right-handed neutrinos massive is feebly coupled to the Standard Model Higgs. Each flavored regime, sensitive to low-energy neutrino experiments, leaves a marked imprint on the gravitational waves spectrum. A three-flavor and a two-flavor regime could be probed by a characteristic fall-off of the gravitational wave spectrum at the LISA-DECIGO-ET frequency bands with preceding scale-invariant amplitudes bounded from above and below. We present Gravitational Waves windows for Flavored Regimes of Leptogenesis (GWFRL) testable in the upcoming experiments. We also provide the first construction of a leptogenesis framework where a testable distinction of flavor regimes is possible without constraining the flavor structure of the theory.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the intrinsic geometry of compact cross-sections of an extremal horizon in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory must admit a Killing vector field or is static. This implies that any such horizon must be an extremal Kerr-Newman horizon and completes the classification of the associated near-horizon geometries. The same results hold with a cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic method to derive the chiral kinetic theory from the Wigner equations based on quantum field theory order by order. We take special effort to derive the chiral kinetic theory in seven-dimensional phase space from the eight-dimensional chiral kinetic theory. We give the seven-dimensional chiral kinetic theory up to second order of semiclassical expansion. We find some new second-order contributions compared with other approaches.</description>

      <title>Achronal localization and representation of the causal logic from conserved current, application to massive scalar boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method applies to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. Due to the one-to-one correspondence between (covariant) achronal localizations and (covariant) representations of the causal logic thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly one derives the covariant family of representations of the causal logic related to the stress energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. While reaching this result the divergence theorem is proven for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections to the E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-loop corrections (1LC) to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations arising from cubic interactions in the single-field E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole (PBH) production are numerically calculated. The results demonstrate the 1LC contributes merely a few percent to the tree-level power spectrum. The model parameters are chosen to predict the PBH masses in the asteroid-mass range, while maintaining consistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations within 1$\sigma$ confidence levels, and obeying the upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. The PBHs formed on scales smaller than the inflation scale can constitute a significant fraction of the present dark matter (DM). The PBH-induced gravitational waves (GW) may be detectable by the future space-based gravitational interferometers. We also consider a reconstruction of the scalar potential from possible GW observations and present a numerical approach tested in the model parameter space.</description>

      <title>Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</description>
