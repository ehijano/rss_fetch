      <title>Surrogate-assisted global sensitivity analysis of a hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of new multiscale mathematical models often entails considerable complexity and multiple undetermined parameters, typically arising from closure relations. To enable reliable simulations, one must quantify how uncertain physical parameters influence model predictions. We propose surrogate-assisted global sensitivity analysis that combines computational efficiency with a rigorous assessment of parameter influence. In this work, we analyze the recently proposed hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy model, which describes fluid flows in coupled free-flow and porous-medium systems with arbitrary flow directions at the fluid--porous interface. The model results from vertical averaging and contains several unknown parameters. We perform surrogate-assisted global sensitivity analysis using Sobol' indices to investigate the sensitivity of the model to variations of physical parameters for two test cases: filtration and splitting flows. However, constructing surrogates for higher-dimensional random fields requires either many training runs or sophisticated sampling strategies. To address this, we compare polynomial chaos surrogates, including sparse and multi-resolution representations, for their efficiency in global sensitivity analysis, using a predefined Sobol' sequence of training samples. Across the tested cases, multi-resolution approach delivers the most accurate estimation of Sobol' indices.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of a Linear, Unconditionally Energy-Stable SAV Finite Element Method for the Cahn-Hilliard Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a finite element scheme, based on the Scalar Auxiliary Variable (SAV) approach, for the Cahn-Hilliard equation--a model that possesses significant physical relevance and a rich mathematical structure. A convergence analysis of the fully discrete scheme is conducted under suitable regularity assumptions, confirming optimal-order convergence in both time and space for the phase variable, chemical potential, and auxiliary variable in the H1-norm. Furthermore, the scheme is proven to be unconditionally energy stable. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and to confirm the theoretical convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Adaptive isogeometric analysis of high-order phase-field fracture based on THB-splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, the study of fracture propagation in solids has increasingly relied on phase-field models. Several recent contributions have highlighted the potential of this approach in both static and dynamic frameworks. However, a major limitation remains the high computational cost. Two main strategies have been identified to mitigate this issue: the use of locally refined meshes and the adoption of higher-order models. In this work, leveraging Truncated Hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines), we introduce adaptive simulations of higher-order phase-field formulations (AT1 and AT2), focusing primarily on two-dimensional fracture problems.</description>

      <title>A dual lumping procedure for static condensation in mixed NURBS-based isogeometric elements with optimal convergence rates for arbitrary open knot vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locking is a common effect in finite element and isogeometric analysis. In the case of plates, transverse shear locking is most prominent, for shells several other types of locking exist. A common cure are mixed methods that introduce additional fields of unknowns into the variational formulation. These fields reduce constraints and thus alleviate locking significantly. As a drawback, the discretized additional fields increase computational costs significantly. These fields are often eliminated by static condensation, which requires the inverse of a part of the stiffness matrix. In Lagrange-based finite elements, this inverse is computed on element level, due to a discontinuous interpolation of additional fields. Since isogeometric analysis features higher continuity, static condensation must be performed on patch level, which requires a costly matrix inversion on that level. In this contribution, the virtual shear parameters of a mixed isogeometric plate formulation are interpolated by enhanced approximate dual basis functions. This allows to conduct row-sum lumping of the relevant matrix part at a minimal loss of accuracy, since this part becomes diagonal dominant. For a properly chosen integration space, this lumped matrix becomes the identity matrix. Thus, the proposed condensation procedure does not require an inversion anymore. The crucial and novel point is the proposed treatment of knot vectors with limited internal continuity. With the help of several single- and multi-patch examples, both with full and with limited internal continuity, we show that the proposed procedure obtains optimal error convergence rates in all cases, while without these alterations, convergence rates are significantly deteriorated.</description>

      <title>Kernel Methods for the Construction of Certified Lyapunov Functions via Approximate Koopman Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a kernel-based methodology for constructing Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamical systems using approximate Koopman eigenfunctions. Our approach decomposes principal Koopman eigenfunctions into linear and nonlinear components, where the linear part is obtained from the system's linearization and the nonlinear part is computed by solving a partial differential equation using symmetric kernel collocation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The resulting Lyapunov function is constructed as a quadratic form in the approximate eigenfunctions. We establish error bounds relating the approximation quality to the fill distance of collocation points and provide a certification procedure using continuous piecewise affine (CPA) methods. Numerical experiments on benchmark systems, including a polynomial system and the Duffing oscillator, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>A generalized Riemann problem-based compact reconstruction method for finite volume schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Generalized Riemann Problem-based reconstruction method (GRPrec) for high-order finite volume schemes applied to hyperbolic partial differential equations. The method constructs spatial polynomials using cell averages at the current time level and GRP solution data from the previous time level. The resulting GRPrec stencil is as compact as that of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes but unlike DG, our finite volume schemes obey a generous CFL stability condition that is independent of the order of accuracy. We assess the method's performance through test problems for smooth and discontinuous solutions of the linear advection equation and the Euler equations of gas dynamics in one space dimension. Results are compared against exact solutions and against numerical results from well-known spatial reconstruction finite volume and DG schemes, with all methods implemented in the fully discrete ADER framework. The performance of GRPrec is very promising, especially in terms of efficiency, that is error against CPU cost.</description>

      <title>A fully iterative adaptive energy-based approach for monotone elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully iterative adaptive algorithm for the numerical minimization of strongly convex energy functionals in Hilbert spaces. The proposed approach, which we first present in abstract form, generates a hierarchical sequence of adaptively refined finite-dimensional approximation spaces and employs a (nonlinear) conjugate gradient (CG) method to compute suitable approximations on each space. A core novelty of our approach is that all components of the algorithm are consistently driven by energy reduction principles rather than by classical a posteriori estimators. In particular, adaptive refinement is steered by local energy reduction indicators which aim to construct subsequent approximation spaces in a way that attains the largest potential decrease in energy. Likewise, the stopping criteria for the iterative solver are based on either relative or averaged energy reductions on each subspace. As a concrete realization, we present a concise implementation for $\mathbb{P}_1$ finite element discretizations of second-order semilinear elliptic diffusion-reaction models, where the local indicators driving the element refinements are computed based on edge-wise energy reductions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting scheme achieves optimal convergence for various benchmark problems in two-dimensional polygonal domains.</description>

      <title>Robust Kaczmarz methods for nearly singular linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kaczmarz method is an efficient iterative algorithm for large-scale linear systems. However, its linear convergence rate suffers from ill-conditioned problems and is highly sensitive to the smallest nonzero singular value. In this work, we aim to extend the classical Kaczmarz to nearly singular linear systems that are row rank-deficient. We introduce a new concept of nearly singular property by treating the row space as an unstable subspace in the Grassman manifold. We then define a related important space called the approximate kernel, based on which a robust kernel-augmented Kaczmarz (KaK) is introduced via the subspace correction framework and analyzed by the well-known Xu--Zikatanov identity. To get an implementable version, we further introduce the approximate dual kernel and transform KaK into an equivalent kernel-augmented coordinate descent. Furthermore, we develop an accelerated variant and establish the improved rate of convergence matching the optimal complexity of first-order methods. Compared with existing methods, ours achieve uniform convergence rates for nearly singular linear systems, and the robustness has been confirmed by some numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Analysis of eigenvalue clustering leads to optimal scaling in numerical radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multidimensional polychromatic radiative transfer (RT) problem, accounting for scattering processes in a general form, i.e. anisotropic (dipole) scattering with partial frequency redistribution. Given a discrete ordinates discretization, we report the corresponding matrix structures, depending on model and discretization parameters. Despite the possibly dense nature of these matrices, the use of Krylov methods is effective (especially in the matrix-free context) and robust. We propose a theoretical analysis, using the spectral tools of the symbol theory, explaining why Krylov convergence is robust w.r.t. all the discretization parameters, even in the unpreconditioned case. In fact, the compactness of the continuous operators used in the modeling leads to zero-clustered dense matrix sequences plus identity, so that the clustering at the unity of the spectra is deduced. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results, which have a direct application, for example, in the simulation of radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres, a key problem in astrophysical research. In general, we demonstrate that optimal scaling with respect to RT discretization parameters is expected for Krylov solution strategies.</description>

      <title>Subspace gradient descent method for linear tensor equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical solution of algebraic tensor equations is a largely open and challenging task. Assuming that the operator is symmetric and positive definite, we propose two new gradient-descent type methods for tensor equations that generalize the recently proposed Subspace Conjugate Gradient (SS-CG), D. Palitta et al, SIAM J. Matrix Analysis and Appl (2025). As our interest is mainly in a modest number of tensor modes, the Tucker format is used to efficiently represent low-rank tensors. Moreover, mixed-precision strategies are employed in certain subtasks to improve the memory usage, and different preconditioners are applied to enhance convergence. The potential of our strategies is illustrated by experimental results on tensor-oriented discretizations of three-dimensional partial differential equations with separable coefficients. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art Alternating Minimal Energy (AMEn) algorithm confirm the competitiveness of the proposed strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimal error bounds on the exponential integrator for dispersive equations with highly concentrated potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional linear dispersive equation of differential order $\kappa \geq 2$ with concentrated potential of extension $\varepsilon$ with $0 &lt; \varepsilon \ll 1$, featuring a competition between weak dispersion of strength $\varepsilon^\alpha \ (0 \leq \alpha \leq \kappa)$ and localization induced by the concentrated potential. We first obtain precise regularity estimates of the exact solution in terms of $\varepsilon$. We then apply a natural first-order exponential integrator with step size $\tau$ to discretize the equation, and establish an optimal error bound of the form $O_{L^\infty}(\tau \varepsilon^\beta)$ (up to logarithmic factors in $\tau$ and $\varepsilon$). Salient features of the result are: (i) error bounds are not only uniform in $\varepsilon$ but improve as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$; and (ii) no restriction on $\tau$ in terms of $\varepsilon$. The analysis combines iterated Duhamel's expansions and a transformation that exploits cancellations in oscillatory phases that cannot be obtained directly from regularity estimates of the exact solution. We also show that other classical numerical schemes, such as Lie or centered splitting schemes and low regularity integrators, fail to display optimal rates of convergence. Extensive numerical results are presented and confirm the theoretical error estimates.</description>

      <title>Matrix Perturbation Theory in the Tangent Space of Isospectral Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenvalue and eigenvector perturbation theory is a fundamental topic in several disciplines, including numerical linear algebra, quantum physics, and related fields. The central problem is to understand how the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ change under the addition of a perturbation matrix $E \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$. Much of the existing literature focuses on structured perturbations. For example, in [C.-K. Li and R.-C. Li, Linear Algebra Appl. 2005], the matrix $A$ is assumed to be Hermitian and block diagonal, while the perturbation $E$ is Hermitian and block off-diagonal. In this work, we investigate a different structured setting in which the perturbation has the commutator form $E = AB - BA$ for some matrix $B$, which we show to be a generalization of the block diagonal structure considered by Li and Li. First, we extend their main result by showing that the perturbation of the $i$-th eigenvalue of $A$, denoted by $\lambda_i$, is of order $\|E\|^2 / \eta_i$, where $\eta_i = \min_{j \neq i} |\lambda_i - \lambda_j|$ is the spectral gap associated with $\lambda_i$. Second, we provide a detailed analysis of the role played by the matrix $B$ in the perturbation of the eigenvectors. This analysis is further generalized to the case of block-diagonal matrices with multiple eigenvalues, as well as to perturbed singular values and eigenvalues of Jordan blocks.</description>

      <title>An accelerated rearrangement method for two-phase composite optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an Accelerated Rearrangement Method (ARM) for solving a class of nonconvex optimization problems involving two-phase composites. These problems include maximizing the (work) energy of a membrane governed by the Poisson equation and minimizing the principal eigenvalue of a weighted Dirichlet-Laplacian, both subject to material distribution constraints. Building on the classical rearrangement method, we introduce momentum-like acceleration by extrapolating the Fr\'echet derivative, leading to a provably convergent algorithm. We also introduce a restarted variant that guarantees monotonic improvement of the objective. In one dimension, we derive asymptotic convergence rates for ARM and prove that they improve upon the classical rearrangement method. Numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions confirm the accelerated convergence and demonstrate practical efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Error of Deep Operator Networks Is the Sum of Its Parts: Branch-Trunk and Mode Error Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning has the potential to strongly impact scientific computing by learning solution operators for differential equations, potentially accelerating multi-query tasks such as design optimization and uncertainty quantification by orders of magnitude. Despite proven universal approximation properties, deep operator networks (DeepONets) often exhibit limited accuracy and generalization in practice, which hinders their adoption. Understanding these limitations is therefore crucial for further advancing the approach.
  This work analyzes performance limitations of the classical DeepONet architecture. It is shown that the approximation error is dominated by the branch network when the internal dimension is sufficiently large, and that the learned trunk basis can often be replaced by classical basis functions without a significant impact on performance.
  To investigate this further, a modified DeepONet is constructed in which the trunk network is replaced by the left singular vectors of the training solution matrix. This modification yields several key insights. First, a spectral bias in the branch network is observed, with coefficients of dominant, low-frequency modes learned more effectively. Second, due to singular-value scaling of the branch coefficients, the overall branch error is dominated by modes with intermediate singular values rather than the smallest ones. Third, using a shared branch network for all mode coefficients, as in the standard architecture, improves generalization of small modes compared to a stacked architecture in which coefficients are computed separately. Finally, strong and detrimental coupling between modes in parameter space is identified.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory behaviour of the RBF-FD approximation accuracy under increasing stencil size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When solving partial differential equations on scattered nodes using the Radial Basis Function generated Finite Difference (RBF-FD) method, one of the parameters that must be chosen is the stencil size. Focusing on Polyharmonic Spline RBFs with monomial augmentation, we observe that it affects the approximation accuracy in a particularly interesting way - the solution error oscillates under increasing stencil size. We find that we can connect this behaviour with the spatial dependence of the signed approximation error. Based on this observation we are then able to introduce a numerical quantity that indicates whether a given stencil size is locally optimal.</description>

      <title>Approximating Sparse Matrices and their Functions using Matrix-vector products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computation of a matrix function $f(A)$ is an important task in scientific computing appearing in machine learning, network analysis and the solution of partial differential equations. In this work, we use only matrix-vector products $x\mapsto Ax$ to approximate functions of sparse matrices and matrices with similar structures such as sparse matrices $A$ themselves or matrices that have a similar decay property as matrix functions. We show that when $A$ is a sparse matrix with an unknown sparsity pattern, techniques from compressed sensing can be used under natural assumptions. Moreover, if $A$ is a banded matrix then certain deterministic matrix-vector products can efficiently recover the large entries of $f(A)$. We describe an algorithm for each of the two cases and give error analysis based on the decay bound for the entries of $f(A)$. We finish with numerical experiments showing the accuracy of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>A superconvergence result in the RBF-FD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Differences (RBF-FD) is a meshless method that can be used to numerically solve partial differential equations. The solution procedure consists of two steps. First, the differential operator is discretised on given scattered nodes and afterwards, a global sparse matrix is assembled and inverted to obtain an approximate solution. Focusing on Polyharmonic Splines as our Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) of choice, appropriately augmented with monomials, it is well known that the truncation error of the differential operator approximation is determined by the degree of monomial augmentation. Naively, one might think that the solution error will have the same order of convergence. We present a superconvergence result that shows otherwise - for some augmentation degrees, order of convergence is higher than expected.</description>

      <title>Some observations regarding the RBF-FD approximation accuracy dependence on stencil size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When solving partial differential equations on scattered nodes using the Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Difference (RBF-FD) method, one of the parameters that must be chosen is the stencil size. Focusing on Polyharmonic Spline RBFs with monomial augmentation, we observe that it affects the approximation accuracy in a particularly interesting way - the solution error oscillates under increasing stencil size. We find that we can connect this behaviour with the spatial dependence of the signed approximation error. Based on this observation we are able to introduce a numerical quantity that could indicate whether a given stencil size is locally optimal. This work is an extension of our ICCS 2023 conference paper.</description>

      <title>Parallel in time partially explicit splitting scheme for high contrast linear multiscale diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving multiscale diffusion problems is often computationally expensive due to the spatial and temporal discretization challenges arising from high-contrast coefficients. To address this issue, a partially explicit temporal splitting scheme is proposed. By appropriately constructing multiscale spaces, the spatial multiscale property is effectively captured, and it has been demonstrated that the temporal step size is independent of the contrast. To enhance simulation speed, we propose a parallel algorithm for the multiscale flow problem that leverages the partially explicit temporal splitting scheme. The idea is first to evolve the partially explicit system using a coarse time step size, then correct the solution on each coarse time interval with a fine propagator, for which we consider the all-at-once solver. This procedure is then performed iteratively till convergence. We analyze the stability and convergence of the proposed algorithm. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high numerical accuracy for high-contrast problems and converges in a relatively small number of iterations. The number of iterations stays stable as the number of coarse intervals increases, thus significantly improving computational efficiency through parallel processing.</description>

      <title>A filtered two-step variational integrator for charged-particle dynamics in a moderate or strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with a new filtered two-step variational integrator for solving the charged-particle dynamics in a mildly non-uniform moderate or strong magnetic field with a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon$ inversely proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. In the case of a moderate magnetic field ($\varepsilon=1$), second-order error bounds and long-time near-conservation of energy and momentum are obtained. Moreover, the proof of the long-term analysis is accomplished by the backward error analysis. For $0&lt;\varepsilon \ll 1$, the proposed integrator achieves uniform second-order accuracy in the position and the parallel velocity for large step sizes, while attaining first-order accuracy with respect to the small parameter $\varepsilon$ for smaller step sizes. The error bounds are derived from a comparison of the modulated Fourier expansions of the exact and numerical solutions. Moreover, long-time near-conservation of the energy and the magnetic moment is established using modulated Fourier expansion and backward error analysis. All the theoretical results of the error behavior and long-time near-conservation are numerically demonstrated by four numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error analysis of a robust virtual element method for stress-assisted diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and analyse residual-based a posteriori error estimates for the virtual element discretisation of a nonlinear stress-assisted diffusion problem in two and three dimensions. The model problem involves a two-way coupling between elasticity and diffusion equations in perturbed saddle-point form. A robust global inf-sup condition and Helmholtz decomposition for $\mathbf{H}(\mathrm{div}, \Omega)$ lead to a reliable and efficient error estimator based on appropriately weighted norms that ensure parameter robustness. The a posteriori error analysis uses quasi-interpolation operators for Stokes and edge virtual element spaces, and we include the proofs of such operators with estimates in 3D for completeness. Finally, we present numerical experiments in both 2D and 3D to demonstrate the optimal performance of the proposed error estimator.</description>

      <title>Stability and convergence of multi-product expansion splitting methods with negative weights for semilinear parabolic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operator splitting method has been widely used to solve differential equations by splitting the equation into more manageable parts. In this work, we resolves a long-standing problem -- how to establish the stability of multi-product expansion (MPE) splitting methods with negative weights. The difficulty occurs because negative weights in high-order MPE method cause the sum of the absolute values of weights larger than one, making standard stability proofs fail. In particular, we take the semilinear parabolic equation as a typical model and establish the stability of arbitrarily high-order MPE splitting methods with positive time steps but possibly negative weights. Rigorous convergence analysis is subsequently obtained from the stability result. Several numerical experiments validate the stability and accuracy of various high-order MPE splitting methods, highlighting their efficiency and robustness.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on RBF-based meshless methods for approximating differential operators, one of the most popular being RBF-FD. Recently, a hybrid approach was introduced that combines RBF interpolation and traditional finite difference stencils.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide a firm mathematical foundation for the application of deep gradient flow methods (DGFMs) for the solution of (high-dimensional) partial differential equations (PDEs). We decompose the generalization error of DGFMs into an approximation and a training error. We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approximated by neural networks, thus the approximation error tends to zero as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity. These results combined show that the generalization error of DGFMs tends to zero as the number of neurons and the training time tend to infinity.</description>

      <title>On the Role of the Double Fourier Sphere Method in Fast Algorithms on SO(3)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) method on the rotation group $\mathcal{SO}(3)$ in the frequency domain and demonstrate its central role in fast algorithms. Fast Fourier algorithms on $\mathcal{SO}(3)$ are commonly formulated as a Wigner transform - mapping harmonic to Fourier coefficients - followed by a Fourier transform. We revisit this formulation and interpret the Wigner transform as an explicit realization of the DFS method, lifting functions from $\mathcal{SO}(3)$ to $\mathbb{T}^3$. In this context, we analyze the Sobolev regularity loss induced by this lifting. Furthermore, we compare different Wigner transform implementations, examine additional symmetry enhancements, and observe that the direct method is often faster and more stable than the fast polynomial transform approaches.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we review and analyze both the theoretical and numerical aspects of strongly and weakly coupled thermoelastic systems. By employing spectral analysis techniques and establishing uniform resolvent estimates, we derive uniform polynomial decay rates for the associated semigroups under a suitable class of boundary conditions. Particular attention is paid to the role of modal approximations in energy analysis. The theoretical results are complemented by numerical experiments that illustrate how the regularity of initial data, smooth versus nonsmooth, affects the observed decay rates, providing deeper insight into the interplay between spectral structure and energy dissipation.</description>

Abstract: The classical notion of extreme $L_p$ discrepancy is a quantitative measure for the irregularity of distribution of finite point sets in the $d$-dimensinal unit cube. In this paper we find a dual integration problem whose worst-case error is exactly the extreme $L_p$ discrepancy of the underlying integration nodes. Studying this integration problem we show that the extreme $L_p$ discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p \in (1,\infty)$. It is known that the problem is tractable for $p=\infty$; the case $p=1$ stays open.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order computational homogenization for hyperelastic media using gradient based sensitivity analysis of microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for the computational homogenization of locally periodic hyperelastic structures undergoing large deformations due to external quasi-static loading. The algorithm performs clustering of macroscopic deformations into subsets called "centroids", and, as a new ingredient, approximates the homogenized coefficients using sensitivity analysis of micro-configurations with respect to the macroscopic deformation. The novel "model-order reduction" approach significantly reduces the number of microscopic problems that must be solved in nonlinear simulations, thereby accelerating the overall computational process. The degree of reduction can be controlled by a user-defined error tolerance parameter. The algorithm is implemented in the finite element framework SfePy, and its performance effectiveness is demonstrated using two-dimensional test examples, when compared with solutions obtained by the proper orthogonal decomposition method, and by the full "FE-square" simulations. Extensions beyond the present implementations and the scope of tractable problems are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07835v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for low-precision arithmetic in computational science, we exploit lower-precision emulation in Python -- widely regarded as the dominant programming language for numerical analysis and machine learning. Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility.
  In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows. Software and experimental code are publicly available at https://github.com/inEXASCALE/pychop.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo confidence intervals using quantiles of randomized nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quasi-Monte Carlo integration have shown that for linearly scrambled digital net estimators, the convergence rate can be dramatically improved by taking the median rather than the mean of multiple independent replicates. In this work, we demonstrate that the quantiles of such estimators can be used to construct confidence intervals with asymptotically valid coverage for high-dimensional integrals. By analyzing the error distribution for a class of infinitely differentiable integrands, we prove that as the sample size increases, the integration error decomposes into an asymptotically symmetric component and a vanishing remainder. Consequently, the asymptotic error distribution is symmetric about zero, ensuring that a quantile-based interval constructed from independent replicates captures the true integral with probability converging to a nominal level determined by the binomial distribution.</description>

      <title>Identifying Memorization of Diffusion Models through $p$-Laplace Analysis: Estimators, Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08246</link>

Abstract: Diffusion models, today's leading image generative models, estimate the score function, i.e. the gradient of the log probability of (perturbed) data samples, without direct access to the underlying probability distribution. This work investigates whether the estimated score function can be leveraged to compute higher-order differentials, namely the p-Laplace operators. We show that these operators can be employed to identify memorized training data. We propose a numerical p-Laplace approximation based on the learned score functions, showing its effectiveness in identifying key features of the probability landscape. Furthermore, theoretical error-bounds to these estimators are proven and demonstrated numerically. We analyze the structured case of Gaussian mixture models, and demonstrate that the results carry-over to text-conditioned image generative models (text-to-image), where memorization identification based on the p-Laplace operator is performed for the first time, showing its advantage on 500 memorized prompts ($\sim$3000 generated images) in a post-generation regime, especially when the conditioning text is unavailable.</description>

      <title>A DC-Reformulation for Gradient-$L^0$-Constrained Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardinality constraints in optimization are commonly of $L^0$-type, and they lead to sparsely supported optimizers. An efficient way of dealing with these constraints algorithmically, when the objective functional is convex, is reformulating the constraint using the difference of suitable $L^1$- and largest-$K$-norms and subsequently solving a sequence of penalized subproblems in the difference-of-convex (DC) class. We extend this DC-reformulation approach to problems with $L^0$-type cardinality constraints on the support of the gradients, i.e., problems where sparsity of the gradient and thus piecewise constant solutions are the target.</description>
