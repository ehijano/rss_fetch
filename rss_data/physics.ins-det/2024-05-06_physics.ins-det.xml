      <title>Servo-based light shutters with Arduino control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optical experiments, shutters are devices that open or close a path of light. They are often used to limit the duration of light exposure onto a target or onto a detector in order to reduce possible light-induced damage. Many commercial shutters are available for different applications - some provide very fast opening and closing times, some can handle large optical powers, and others allow for fail-safe operation. Many of these devices are costly and offer limited control options. Here we provide an open-source design for a low-cost, general purpose shutter system based on ubiquitous servo motors that are connected to an Arduino-based controller. Several shutters can be controlled by one controller, further reducing system cost. The state of the shutters can be controlled via a display built into the controller, by serial commands via USB, or by electrical control lines. The use of a microcontroller makes the shutter controller adaptable - only control options that are used need to be included, and the design accommodates a selection of display and servo options. We provide designs for all required components, including 3D print files for the servo holders and cases, software for the Arduino, libraries for serial communication (C and python), and example graphical user interfaces for testing.</description>

      <title>Estimation of waveform deformation with the matched filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many particle physics experiments the data processing is based on the analysis of the digitized waveforms provided by the detector. While the waveform amplitude is usually correlated to the event energy, the shape may carry useful information for event discrimination. Thanks to the high signal to noise ratio they provide, matched filters are often applied. Their original design is however intended for the estimation of the waveform amplitude only.
  In this work we introduce an analytical extension of the original matched filter for the estimation of a possible shape deformation with respect to a reference template. The new filter is validated on simulations and, with respect to shape parameters calculated on unfiltered waveforms or derived from the original matched filter, it improves the discrimination capability by at least a factor 2 both at low and high signal to noise ratios, making it applicable to the data of several experiments.</description>

      <title>High-finesse nanofiber Fabry-Per\'{o}t resonator in a portable storage container</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present characterization and storage methods for a high-finesse nanofiber Fabry-Per\'{o}t resonator. Reflection spectroscopy from both ends of the resonator allows for evaluation of the mirror transmittances and optical loss inside the resonator. To maintain the quality of the nanofiber resonator after the fabrication, we have developed a portable storage container. By filling the container with dry, clean nitrogen gas, we can prevent contamination of the nanofiber during storage. This approach allows us to minimize the additional optical loss to less than 0.08% over a week. The portable container facilitates both the fabrication and subsequent experimentation with the resonator in different locations. This flexibility expands the range of applications, including quantum optics, communication, and sensing.</description>

      <title>A compact and open-source microcontroller-based rapid auto-alignment system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining stable and precise alignment of a laser beam is crucial in many optical setups. In this work, we present a microcontroller-based rapid auto-alignment system that detects and corrects for drifts in a laser beam trajectory using a pair of two-dimensional duo-lateral position sensing detectors (PSDs) and a pair of mirror mounts with piezoelectric actuators. We develop hardware and software for interfacing with the PSDs and for controlling the motion of the piezoelectric mirrors mounts. Our auto-alignment strategy -- implemented as a state machine on the microcontroller by a FreeRTOS kernel -- is based on a simple linearized geometrical optical model. We benchmark our system using the standard case of coupling laser light efficiently into the guided mode of a single-mode fiber optic patch cable. We can recover the maximum fiber coupling efficiency in $\sim10$ seconds, even for a laser beam that was misaligned to the point of zero fiber coupling.</description>

      <title>Helium Detection in Technical Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials used to study nuclear fusion can retain atmospheric helium unless pretreated before an experiment. Understanding helium outgassing is important for accurate diagnostics in experiments surrounding nuclear fusion. The presence of helium is often cited as the primary evidence that a nuclear reaction has occurred, so it is imperative that known sources of helium are mitigated prior to proceeding with novel nuclear experiments. It is also necessary to ensure hermiticity when transferring gas aliquots from an experiment to a mass spectrometer. In this article, we present studies of detecting helium leak rates in systems used in novel nuclear experiments. We also present studies of helium retention in materials subjected to various heating profiles and atmospheric concentrations. Without pretreatment, stainless-steel 316 retains between 15 $\unicode{x2013}$ 240 pmol of $^{ 4}$He or an areal outgassing amount of 0.07 $\unicode{x2013}$ 1.20 pmol/$cm^{ 2}$. It also may reabsorb $^{ 4}$He from the atmosphere in time. These studies also demonstrate that it is necessary to pretreat most materials prior to performing experiments where the presence of $^{ 4}$He is being used as an indicator for novel nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>Integrating embedded neural networks and self-mixing interferometry for smart sensors design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-mixing interferometry is a measurement approach in which a laser beam is re-injected into the emitting laser itself after reflection on a target. Information about the position of the target can be obtained from monitoring the voltage across the laser. However, analyzing this signal is difficult. In previous works, neural networks have been used with great success to process this data. In this article, we present the first prototype of an integrated sensor based on self-mixing interferometry with embedded neural networks. It consists of a semiconductor laser (acting both as light emitter and detector) equipped with an embedded platform for data processing. The platform includes an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and an STM32L476RG microcontroller. The microcontroller runs the neural network in charge of reconstructing the displacement of a target from the interferometric signal entering the ADC. We assess the robustness of the neural network to unwanted signal amplitude variations and the impact of different network weights quantization choices required to run the network on the microcontroller. Finally, we provide a demonstration of target displacement reconstruction fully running on the embedded platform. Our results pave the way towards robust, low power and versatile sensors based on self-mixing interferometry and embedded neural networks.</description>

      <title>YAP:Ce scintillator as an absolute ultracold neutron detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming UCNProBe experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory will measure the $\beta$-decay rate of free neutrons with different systematic uncertainties than previous beam-based neutron lifetime experiments. We have developed a new $^{10}$B-coated YAP:Ce scintillator whose properties are presented. The advantage of the YAP:Ce scintillator is its high Fermi potential, which reduces the probability for upscattering of ultracold neutrons, and its short decay time, which is important at high counting rates. Birks' coefficient of YAP:Ce was measured to be ($5.56^{+0.05}_{-0.30})\times 10^{-4}$ cm/MeV and light losses due to 120 nm of $^{10}$B-coating to be about 60%. The loss of light from YAP:Ce due to transmission through deuterated polystyrene scintillator was about 50%. The efficiency for counting neutrons that are captured on the $^{10}$B coating is (86.82 $\pm$ 2.61)%. Measurement with ultracold neutrons showed that YAP:Ce crystal counted 8% to 28% more UCNs compared to ZnS screen. This may be due to an uneven coating of $^{10}$B on the rough surface.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Low Energy Nuclear Recoil Events with the phonon-mediated Voltage-Assisted Hybrid Detector for Rare Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phonon-mediated hybrid detector is made out of a monolithic silicon crystal characterized by two interconnected regions linked through a narrow neck. Operating solely on phonon signal measurements, the hybrid design facilitates the differentiation between electron recoil and nuclear recoil events, effectively discerning two types of interaction down to low energy levels. With a newly implemented software triggering technique (SWT), low-energy nuclear recoil events of approximately $500~eV_{ee}$ have been measured. In addition to this, an electron recoil background reduction of up to $95\%$ has been successfully demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Gain suppression study on LGADs at the CENPA tandem accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are a type of thin silicon detector with a highly doped gain layer that provides moderate internal signal amplification. One recent challenge in the use of LGADs, studied by several research groups, is the gain suppression mechanism for large localized charge deposits. Using the CENPA Tandem accelerator at the University of Washington, the response of the LGADs to MeV-range energy deposits from a proton beam was studied. Two LGAD prototypes and a PIN diode were characterized, and the gain of the devices was determined as a function of bias voltage, incidence beam angle and proton energy. This study was conducted in the scope of the PIONEER experiment, an experiment proposed at the Paul Scherrer Institute to perform high-precision measurements of rare pion decays. %At the center of the experiment, a high-granularity active target (ATAR) will stop the pion and characterize its decay. A range of deposited charge from Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP, few 10s of KeV) from positrons to several MeV from the stopping pions/muons is expected in PIONEER; the detection and separation of close-by hits in such a wide dynamic range will be a main challenge of the experiment. To achieve this goal, the gain suppression mechanism has to be understood fully.</description>

      <title>Design and Simulation of TiN-Based Suspended Meander Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) for Visible and Near-Infrared Astronomy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on simulations of a novel design of optical titanium nitride (TiN)- based Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) in order to improve their response to optical photons. We propose to separate the meander from the substrate to trap hot phonons generated by optical photons, preventing their rapid propagation through the substrate. These phonons would in turn contribute to the breaking of more Cooper pairs, thereby increasing the response of the detector. In our design, the meander is suspended a few hundred nanometers above the substrate. Furthermore, reflective gold (Au) or aluminum (Al)-based layers can be placed under the meander to improve photon coupling in the optical wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel Studies through Massive Channel Upscaling with MEMS Microphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a large 6~m x 3~m aperture 7200 MEMS microphone array. The array is designed so that sub-arrays with optimized point spread functions can be used for beamforming and thus, enable the research of source directivity in wind tunnel facilities. The total array consists of modular 800 microphone panels, each consisting of four unique PCB board designs. This modular architecture allows for the time-synchronized measurement of an arbitrary number of panels and thus, aperture size and total number of sensors. The panels can be installed without a gap so that the array's microphone pattern avoids high sidelobes in the point spread function. The array's capabilities are evaluated on a 1:9.5 airframe half model in an open wind tunnel at DNW-NWB. The total source emission is quantified and the directivity is evaluated with beamforming. Additional far-field microphones are employed to validate the results.</description>

      <title>A beam-driven proton irradiation setup for precision radiation damage tests of silicon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proton irradiation site for silicon detectors has been developed and commissioned at the Bonn Isochronous Cyclotron. The accelerator provides 14 MeV proton beams of up to 1 $\mu$A at beam widths of a few mm to the setup. Devices Under Test (DUTs) are irradiated inside a cooled, thermally-insulated box at $\le$-20{\deg}C, while being moved through the beam in a row-based scan pattern to achieve uniform fluence distributions. Custom-made diagnostics allow for beam-based, on- and offline dosimetry, enabling a beam-driven irradiation routine which produces uniform fluence distributions with standard deviations $ \ll 1 \% $. Dedicated irradiations of thin titanium foils are performed to compare the commonly-used dosimetry via metallic foil activation to the beam-based approach. Within the error margins, both methods are in agreement, whereas the beam-based technique yields lower uncertainties of typically $ \le 2 \% $. Simulations indicate a reduction of the initial proton energy to 12.28(6) MeV on the DUT. Characterization of six, 150 $\mu$m-thin, passive LFoundry sensors before and after irradiation yield a proton hardness factor of $\kappa_\text{p}=3.71(11)$, which is in agreement with expectations, allowing to irradiate up to $10^{16} \text{n}_{eq} / \text{cm}^2$ within a few hours.</description>

      <title>First measurement of $\eta$ production in neutrino interactions on argon with MicroBooNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a measurement of $\eta$ production from neutrino interactions on argon with the MicroBooNE detector. The modeling of resonant neutrino interactions on argon is a critical aspect of the neutrino oscillation physics program being carried out by the DUNE and Short Baseline Neutrino programs. $\eta$ production in neutrino interactions provides a powerful new probe of resonant interactions, complementary to pion channels, and is particularly suited to the study of higher-order resonances beyond the $\Delta(1232)$. We measure a flux-integrated cross section for neutrino-induced $\eta$ production on argon of $3.22 \pm 0.84 \; \textrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.86 \; \textrm{(syst.)}$ $10^{-41}{\textrm{cm}}^{2}$/nucleon. By demonstrating the successful reconstruction of the two photons resulting from $\eta$ production, this analysis enables a novel calibration technique for electromagnetic showers in GeV accelerator neutrino experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present first results from a dark photon dark matter search in the mass range from 44 to 52 $\mu{\rm eV}$ ($10.7 - 12.5\,{\rm GHz}$) using a room-temperature dish antenna setup called GigaBREAD. Dark photon dark matter converts to ordinary photons on a cylindrical metallic emission surface with area $0.5\,{\rm m}^2$ and is focused by a novel parabolic reflector onto a horn antenna. Signals are read out with a low-noise receiver system. A first data taking run with 24 days of data does not show evidence for dark photon dark matter in this mass range, excluding dark photon - photon mixing parameters $\chi \gtrsim 10^{-12}$ in this range at 90% confidence level. This surpasses existing constraints by about two orders of magnitude and is the most stringent bound on dark photons in this range below 49 $\mu$eV.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Bayesian Active Learning for MeV-ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron diffraction using MeV energy beams(MeV-UED) has enabled unprecedented scientific opportunities in the study of ultrafast structural dynamics in a variety of gas, liquid and solid state systems. Broad scientific applications usually pose different requirements for electron probe properties. Due to the complex, nonlinear and correlated nature of accelerator systems, electron beam property optimization is a time-taking process and often relies on extensive hand-tuning by experienced human operators. Algorithm based efficient online tuning strategies are highly desired. Here, we demonstrate multi-objective Bayesian active learning for speeding up online beam tuning at the SLAC MeV-UED facility. The multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm was used for efficiently searching the parameter space and mapping out the Pareto Fronts which give the trade-offs between key beam properties. Such scheme enables an unprecedented overview of the global behavior of the experimental system and takes a significantly smaller number of measurements compared with traditional methods such as a grid scan. This methodology can be applied in other experimental scenarios that require simultaneously optimizing multiple objectives by explorations in high dimensional, nonlinear and correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the differential cross section for neutral pion production in charged-current muon neutrino interactions on argon with the MicroBooNE detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a measurement of neutral pion production in charged-current interactions using data recorded with the MicroBooNE detector exposed to Fermilab's booster neutrino beam. The signal comprises one muon, one neutral pion, any number of nucleons, and no charged pions. Studying neutral pion production in the MicroBooNE detector provides an opportunity to better understand neutrino-argon interactions, and is crucial for future accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiments. Using a dataset corresponding to $6.86 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target, we present single-differential cross sections in muon and neutral pion momenta, scattering angles with respect to the beam for the outgoing muon and neutral pion, as well as the opening angle between the muon and neutral pion. Data extracted cross sections are compared to generator predictions. We report good agreement between the data and the models for scattering angles, except for an over-prediction by generators at muon forward angles. Similarly, the agreement between data and the models as a function of momentum is good, except for an underprediction by generators in the medium momentum ranges, $200-400$ MeV for muons and $100-200$ MeV for pions.</description>

      <title>A Ramsey Neutron-Beam Experiment to Search for Ultralight Axion Dark Matter at the ESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-intensity neutron beams, such as those available at the European Spallation Source (ESS), provide new opportunities for fundamental discoveries. Here we discuss a novel Ramsey neutron-beam experiment to search for ultralight axion dark matter through its coupling to neutron spins, which would cause the neutron spins to rotate about the velocity of the neutrons relative to the dark matter halo. We estimate that experiments at the HIBEAM beamline at the ESS can improve the sensitivity to the axion-neutron coupling compared to the current best laboratory limits by up to $2-3$ orders of magnitude over the axion mass range $10^{-22} \, \textrm{eV} - 10^{-16}$ eV.</description>
