      <title>A Practical Computational Hemolysis Model Incorporating Biophysical Properties of the Red Blood Cell Membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Hemolysis is a key issue in the design of blood-handling medical devices. Computational prediction of this phenomenon is challenging due to the complex multiscale nature of blood. As a result, conventional approaches often fail to predict hemolysis accurately, commonly showing deviations of multiple orders of magnitude compared to experimental data. More accurate models are typically computationally expensive and thus impractical for real-world applications. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting accurate yet simple and efficient computational hemolysis models.
  Methods: Hemolysis modeling relies on two key components: a red blood cell model and a hemoglobin release model. In this work, we compare three red blood cell models: a common stress-based model (Bludszuweit), a simple strain-based model based on the Kelvin-Voigt constitutive law, and a more complex tensor-based model (TTM). Further, we compare two hemoglobin release models: the widely used power-law approach and a biophysical pore formation model.
  Results: We evaluate these models in two benchmark cases: the FDA blood pump and the FDA nozzle. In both benchmarks, the simple strain-based model combined with the pore formation model achieves absolute predictions of hemolysis within the standard deviation of experimental measurements. In contrast, stress-based power law models deviate by several orders of magnitude.
  Conclusion: The strain-based pore modeling approach takes into account the biophysical properties of red blood cell membranes, in particular their viscoelastic deformation behavior and hemoglobin release through membrane pores. This leads to significantly improved hemolysis predictions in a framework that can easily be integrated into common CFD workflows.</description>

      <title>Learning Differentiable Weak-Form Corrections to Accelerate Finite Element Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a differentiable weak-form learning approach for accelerating finite element simulations. Rather than introducing black-box source terms in the strong form of the governing equations, we augment the momentum equation directly in the variational (weak) form with parameterized bilinear operators. The coefficients of these operators are learned from high-resolution simulations so that unresolved small-scale dynamics can be represented on coarse grids. Applying the correction at the weak-form level aligns the learned model with the finite element discretization, preserving key numerical structure and better respecting the fundamental properties of incompressible flow. In the same setting, the approach yields solutions that are more accurate and more stable over long time horizons than comparable strong-form corrections. We implement the proposed method in the Firedrake finite element solver and evaluate it on benchmark problems, including the one-dimensional convection-diffusion equation and the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. End-to-end differentiable training is enabled by coupling PyTorch with the Firedrake adjoint framework. Across these tests, the learned variational operators improve long-term accuracy while reducing computational cost. Overall, our results suggest that weak-form learning provides a principled, structure-preserving route to accurate and stable coarse-grid simulations of incompressible flows.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of particle entrainment in confined gas-particle systems under moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle entrainment in confined gas-particle systems driven by moving boundaries is central to many industrial and natural processes, including pharmaceutical manufacturing, food processing, and chemical engineering. Although often termed a "suction effect," its physical origin remains unclear, especially under unsteady flow, strong particle interactions, and transient force networks. Here we study suction-induced entrainment in a prototypical confined system using high-fidelity coupled CFD-DEM simulations resolving unsteady gas flow and discrete particle motion with moving boundaries. By decomposing the forces on individual particles, we show that suction is not purely pressure-driven, but results from the combined action of pressure-gradient and unsteady drag forces generated by boundary-accelerated flow. Despite the heterogeneous and transient force fields, the final entrained mass is found to be governed primarily by a single energetic measure: the mechanical work performed on the particle assembly in the entrainment direction during boundary motion, rather than by peak instantaneous forces. Varying boundary kinematics demonstrates that changes in displacement or velocity history control entrainment mainly by modifying the duration over which fluid-particle forces perform work. These results reveal an organizing principle for suction-driven entrainment and establish a work-based framework for boundary-induced particle transport in confined gas-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Explainable deep learning reveals the physical mechanisms behind the turbulent kinetic energy equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the physical mechanisms governing turbulent kinetic energy transport using explainable deep learning (XDL). An XDL model based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to identify and percolate high-importance structures for the evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy budget terms of a turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of $Re_\tau = 125$. The results show that the important structures are predominantly located in the near-wall region and are more frequently associated with sweep-type events. In the viscous layer, the SHAP structures relevant for production and viscous diffusion are almost entirely contained within those relevant for dissipation, revealing a clear hierarchical organization of near-wall turbulence. In the outer layer, this hierarchical organization breaks down and only velocity-pressure-gradient correlation and turbulent transport SHAP structures remain, with a moderate spatial coincidence of approximately $60\%$. Finally, we show that none of the coherent structures classically studied in turbulence are capable of representing the mechanisms behind the various terms of the turbulent kinetic energy budget throughout the channel. These results reveal dissipation as the dominant organizing mechanism of near-wall turbulence, constraining production and viscous diffusion within a single structural hierarchy that breaks down in the outer layer.</description>

      <title>Effect of initial Rayleigh mode on drop deformation and breakup under impulsive acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental ways of representing a droplet shape is through its Rayleigh-mode decomposition, in which each mode corresponds to a distinct surface-energy content. The influence of these modes on free oscillation dynamics has been studied extensively; however, their role in droplet deformation, breakup, and fragmentation under impulsive acceleration remains largely unexplored. Here we systematically quantify how prescribed initial axisymmetric Rayleigh modes affect the deformation and breakup of an impulsively accelerated drop. Using experimentally validated, VOF-based multiphase direct numerical simulations, we isolate the coupled effects of finite-amplitude surface oscillation modes and the associated initial surface-energy state by initializing drops with well-defined $(n,0)$ modes (and phases) while conserving volume at finite amplitudes. We show that breakup is governed not simply by the initial drag of the imposed shape, but by the dynamic coupling between the free modal oscillations and the forced aerodynamic (or shear-driven) deformation: constructive superposition can strongly amplify deformation, whereas destructive superposition can stabilize the drop even under otherwise disruptive forcing. Across all systems studied, the outcome is controlled by how efficiently the external work is partitioned into recoverable oscillatory energy versus centre-of-mass translation and viscous dissipation, with viscosity and density ratio acting as key mediators that respectively damp modal interactions and restrict the time window for energy uptake.</description>

      <title>Clustering and surface distributions of buoyant particles in open-channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the clustering behaviour and surface distributions of buoyant particles at the air-water interface in open-channel turbulent flow, focusing on the interplay between capillary attraction, hydrodynamic drag, and flow-driven lateral transport. Using controlled laboratory flume experiments, we systematically examine clustering dynamics for two particle types differing in size and density. To interpret the observed behaviour, we extend capillary-based clustering frameworks to open-channel flows by introducing a dimensionless clustering Weber number (We_cl) that captures the balance between the flow-induced disruptive force and capillary attraction, providing a compact description of the observed clustering behaviour. In addition, we demonstrate that secondary currents play a central role in surface particle transport, producing systematic lateral accumulation that depends on channel aspect ratio. Together, these findings extend capillary-driven clustering theory to open-channel turbulence and reveal secondary currents as a key mechanism controlling particle surface distributions.</description>

      <title>Numerically Consistent Non-Boussinesq Subgrid-scale Stress Model with Enhanced Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the data-assimilation approach of Ling and Lozano-Dur\'an (AIAA 2025-1280) to develop machine-learning-based subgrid-scale stress (SGS) models for large-eddy simulation (LES) that are consistent with the numerical scheme of the flow solver. The method accounts for configurations with two inhomogeneous directions and is applied to turbulent boundary layers (TBL) under adverse pressure gradients (APG). To overcome the limitations of linear eddy-viscosity closures in complex flows, we adopt a non-Boussinesq SGS formulation along with a dissipation-matching training loss. A second improvement is the integration of a multi-task learning strategy that explicitly promotes monotonic convergence with grid refinement, a property that is often absent in conventional SGS models. A posteriori tests show that the proposed model improves predictions of the mean velocity and wall-shear stress relative to the Dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM), while also achieving monotonic convergence with grid refinement.</description>

      <title>Effect of wind turbulence on wave generation over a viscous liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When wind blows over the surface of a viscous liquid, a clear transition from irregular small-amplitude streamwise-oriented wrinkles to well-defined nearly two-dimensional regular waves is observed at a critical wind velocity. We examine how free-stream turbulence in the air influences the growth of wrinkles and regular waves, as well as the transition between these two regimes. Experiments are carried out in a wind tunnel, in which air is blown over a tank filled with silicone oil whose viscosity is fifty times higher than that of water. The free-stream turbulence is enhanced using upstream grids, achieving relative turbulence intensities up to 8%. Surface deformations are measured using Free-Surface Synthetic Schlieren with micrometer accuracy. Velocity measurements are performed using hot-wire anemometry above the interface and particle image velocimetry in the liquid. Results reveal two primary effects of grid-enhanced free-stream turbulence: an increase in the wrinkle amplitude, and a reduction in the critical wind speed at the onset of regular waves. Nevertheless, the wrinkle-wave transition still corresponds to an approximately constant friction velocity. Similar to a classical boundary layer over a flat plate, the friction velocity is found to decrease with fetch. From a wave energy balance, we develop a qualitative model explaining why, with the highly viscous liquid considered here, this decrease in the friction velocity results in a non-monotonic variation of the wave amplitude with the fetch.</description>

      <title>Higher order moments of scalar within a plume in a turbulent boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the statistical nature of instantaneous scalar concentration in an elevated point-source plume (neutral or buoyant) dispersing within a turbulent boundary layer. Using high-frequency long-duration experimental measurements, we extensively validate the gamma distribution as the appropriate probability density function of concentration, particularly at large scalar magnitudes. The two-parameter gamma distribution is shown to capture the PDF at all locations across the plume. The classical similarity of the mean and root-mean-square (RMS) concentration, often expressed through a Gaussian form, is recovered through similarity of the scale and shape parameters of the gamma distribution. In addition, statistics of extreme events, such as the 99th percentile of the instantaneous concentration signal, are also well predicted, and their observed invariance near the plume centreline is reasoned. Further, similarity is observed for the third- and higher-order central moments and standardised central moments from the experimental data. The framework of the gamma distribution is also analytically extended to higher-order statistics. The experimental data are in good agreement with the predicted central moments up to the eighth order. The results emphasise the importance of achieving statistical convergence for the intermittent concentration signal, directly influenced by finite sampling times in a measurement. A secondary result is obtained for the ratio of plume half-widths based on the mean and the RMS concentration to be $1/\sqrt{2}$, consistent with experimental observations. The results establish the gamma distribution as a consistent and unified model for all scalar concentration statistics in elevated point source plumes within a turbulent boundary layer.</description>

      <title>Impact-induced viscoelastic bungee-jumper jets with uniform extension and stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a "bungee-jumper" jet induced by an impulsive force, which retracts after reaching its peak extension. Despite the strongly extensional and highly nonequilibrium nature of this motion, the jet exhibits simple and uniform rheological responses. To elucidate its extensional behavior in a highly extensional regime quantified by large Deborah and Reynolds numbers ($De \approx 2.1 \times 10^1 - 3.3 \times 10^3$, $Re \approx 2.8 \times 10^1 - 4.6 \times 10^2$), we use high-speed velocimetry and polarization-based stress imaging to measure the spatial distribution of velocity and stress throughout jets made of dilute polyethylene oxide (PEO) solutions. The bungee-jumper jets are found to exhibit two uniform characteristics despite the extreme $De$ conditions: a consistent spatial distribution of the extensional rate and a nearly uniform stress distribution during the jetting motion. These uniformities indicate that the seemingly complex jet dynamics can in fact be effectively represented using a constitutive model with spatially uniform coefficients. Comparison of several viscoelastic models shows that the Voigt model provides the best agreement with the measured dynamics, while the single-spring model captures the essential behavior when elasticity dominates.</description>

      <title>Effective longitudinal slip over grooves encapsulated by a nearly inviscid lubricant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the effective slip length for a rectangularly grooved periodic surface encapsulated (i.e., fully wetted) by a lubricant fluid and subjected to exterior shear flow parallel to the grooves. Our focus is the limit of a nearly-inviscid lubricant, where the ratio $\mu$ of the lubricant viscosity to that of the exterior fluid is small. This limit is singular for an encapsulated surface, indicating a dominant lubricant-flow effect - a stark contrast to superhydrophobic surfaces where the role of the lubricant is typically negligible.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning wall model of large-eddy simulation for low- and high-speed flows over rough surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a wall model for large-eddy simulation that incorporates surface-roughness effects and is applicable across low- and high-speed flows, for both transitional and fully rough conditions. The model, implemented using an artificial neural network, is trained on a direct numerical simulation database of compressible turbulent channel flows over rough walls. The dataset contains 372 cases spanning a wide range of irregular roughness topographies, including Gaussian and Weibull distributions, Mach numbers 0~3.3, and friction Reynolds numbers 180~2000. We employ an information-theoretic, dimensionless learning method to identify the inputs with the highest predictive power for the dimensionless wall friction and wall heat flux. Predictions are accompanied by a confidence score derived from a spectrally normalized neural Gaussian process, which quantifies uncertainty in regions that deviate from the training dataset. The model performance is first evaluated a-priori on 110 turbulent channel flow cases, yielding prediction errors below 4%. The model is assessed a-posteriori in wall-modeled large-eddy simulations across diverse test cases. These include over 160 subsonic and supersonic turbulent channel flows with rough walls, a transonic high-pressure turbine (HPT) blade with Gaussian roughness, a high-speed compression ramp with sandpaper roughness, and three hypersonic blunt bodies with sand-grain roughness. Results show that the proposed wall model typically achieves a-posteriori predictive accuracy within 10% for wall shear stress and within 15% for wall heat flux, with high confidence in the channel flows and HPT blade cases. In the rough-wall compression ramp and hypersonic blunt bodies, the model captures the heating augmentation with errors ranging 0%~20%. In the cases with the highest errors, the reduced performance is correctly detected by a drop in the confidence score.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Diffusion: Fast Sampling and Reliable Prediction for 3D Keller--Segel and KPP Equations in Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fast and reliable generative transport for the 3D KS (Keller-Segel) and KPP (Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov) equations in the presence of fluid flows with the goal to approximate the map between initial and terminal distributions for a range of physical parameters $\sigma$ under the Wasserstein metric. To minimize the inaccuracy of direct Wasserstein solver, we propose a two-stage pipeline that retains one-step efficiency while reinstating an explicit $W_2$ objective where it is tractable. In Stage I, a Meanflow-style regressor yields a deterministic, one-step global transport that moves particles close to their terminal states. In Stage II, we freeze this initializer and train a near-identity corrector (Deep Particle, DP) that directly minimizes a mini-batch $W_2$ objective using warm-started optimal transport couplings computed on the Meanflow outputs. Crucially, after the one-step transport (from Stage I) concentrating mass on the approximated correct support, the induced geometry stabilizes high-dimensional $W_2$ computation of the direct Wasserstein solver. We validate our construction in the 3D KS and KPP equations subject to fluid flows with ordered and chaotic streamlines.</description>

      <title>Fast Solvers for the Reynolds Equation on Piecewise Linear Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Reynolds equation is derived from the incompressible Navier Stokes equations under the lubrication assumptions of a long and thin domain geometry and a small scaled Reynolds number. The Reynolds equation is an elliptic differential equation and a dramatic simplification from the governing equations. When the fluid domain is piecewise linear, the Reynolds equation has an exact solution that we formulate by coupling the exact solutions of each piecewise component. We consider a formulation specifically for piecewise constant heights, and a more general formulation for piecewise linear heights; in both cases the linear system is inverted using the Schur complement. These methods can also be applied in the case of non-linear heights by approximating the height as piecewise constant or piecewise linear, in which case the methods achieve second order accuracy. We assess the time complexity of the two methods, and determine that the method for piecewise linear heights is linear time for the number of piecewise components. As an application of these methods, we explore the limits of validity for lubrication theory by comparing the solutions of the Reynolds and the Stokes equations for a variety of linear and non-linear textured slider geometries.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation and analysis of mixing enhancement due to chaotic advection using an adaptive approach for approximating the dilution index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lagrangian particle-tracking methods are particularly suitable to study solute transport in velocity fields displaying chaotic advection. They can accurately resolve stretching and folding processes, the increase in the solute-solvent interface available for diffusion as well as Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) islands, non-mixing regions that limit the chaotic area in the domain and, thereby, the mixing enhancement. However, they also display limitations due to the finite number of discrete particles, particularly if we are interested in the quantification of mixing processes, which require an accurate description of the particle density or concentration gradients. In this work, we use the dilution index to quantify the temporal increase in mixing of a solute within its solvent. We introduce a new approach to select a suitable grid size for the approximation of the density function, motivated by the theory of representative elementary volumes. It preserves the central feature of the dilution index, which is monotonically increasing in time, highlighting the importance of a suitable choice for the grid size in the dilution index approximation. We use this approach to demonstrate the mixing enhancement for two chaotic injection-extraction systems that exhibit chaotic structures: a source-sink dipole and a rotated potential mixing. Using our new approach, we assess the choice of design parameters of the injection-extraction systems to effectively engineer chaotic mixing. We demonstrate the important role of diffusion in filling the KAM islands and reaching complete mixing and, consequently, the importance of avoiding numerical diffusion, which often affects Eulerian methods applied on the advection-diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>Green function and singularities in Stokes flow confined by cylindrical walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, the Green function for the Stokes flow in the interior, exterior, and annular regions bounded by cylindrical walls is derived as a function of the pole position and expressed invariantly both at the field and pole points. Specifically, the Green function is obtained using a cylindrical harmonic expansion of the Stokes flow within the bitensorial formulation. This formulation allows us to obtain higher-order singularities within the same domains, such as the confined Couplet and Stresslet, by simply differentiating the Green function at its pole. Moreover, the confined Sourcelet and its associated multipoles are derived from the Green function through a new method that enforces the reciprocal properties of the Stokes flow. The resulting singularities are then employed to address hydrodynamic problems involving active and passive colloids interacting with cylindrical walls, such as sedimenting particles in the annular cylindrical region and the attractive or repulsive hydrodynamic forces exerted by the cylindrical boundaries on a microswimmer.</description>

      <title>Virtual states and exponential decay in small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the Kazantsev theory of small-scale dynamo generation at small Prandtl numbers near the generation threshold and restore the concordance between the theory and numerical simulations: the theory predicted a power-law decay below the threshold, while simulations demonstrate exponential decay. We show that the exponential decay is temporary and owes its existence to the flattening of the velocity correlator at large scales. This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Transformer operator for the prediction of three-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven turbulence prediction methods often face challenges related to data dependency and lack of physical interpretability. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed Transformer operator (PITO) and its implicit variant (PIITO) for predicting three-dimensional (3D) turbulence, which are developed based on the vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with an appropriate patch size. Given the current flow field, the Transformer operator computes its prediction for the next time step. By embedding the large-eddy simulation (LES) equations into the loss function, PITO and PIITO can learn solution operators without using labeled data. Furthermore, PITO can automatically learn the subgrid scale (SGS) coefficient using a single set of flow data during training. Both PITO and PIITO exhibit excellent stability and accuracy on the predictions of various statistical properties and flow structures for the situation of long-term extrapolation exceeding 25 times the training horizon in decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), and outperform the physics-informed Fourier neural operator (PIFNO). Furthermore, PITO exhibits a remarkable accuracy on the predictions of forced HIT where PIFNO fails. Notably, PITO and PIITO reduce GPU memory consumption by 79.5\% and 91.3\% while requiring only 31.5\% and 3.1\% of the parameters, respectively, compared to PIFNO. Moreover, both PITO and PIITO models are much faster compared to traditional LES method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit and exact solution to the governing equations describing the vertical structure of the Arctic Ocean region centred around the North Pole. The solution describes a stratified water column with three constant-density regions: a motionless bottom layer, a middle layer - the halocline - described by nonhydrostatic, near-inertial Pollard waves, and an upper layer presenting a mean current and a wave motion associated with the one in the halocline layer.</description>

      <title>Time-varying sensitivity analysis for mixing in chaotic flows: a comparison study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Engineered injection and extraction systems that create chaotic advection are promising procedures for enhancing mixing between two species. Mixing efficiencies vary considerably, so carefully selecting the design parameters, like pumping rates, well locations, or operation times, is crucial. While numerous studies investigate the conditions required to achieve chaotic flow, sensitivity analyses addressing its impact on mixing have rarely been performed. However, selecting a suitable sensitivity analysis method depends on the underlying system and is often restricted by the computational cost, especially when considering complex, high-dimensional models. Moreover, the most appropriate metric to quantify mixing (e.g., plume area, peak concentration) can also be system-specific. We perform a time-varying sensitivity analysis on the mixing enhancement of two chaotic flow fields with different complexities. The rotated potential mixing (RPM) flow is parametrized using two or four hyperparameters, while the quadrupole flow utilizes 16 hyperparameters. We compare three global sensitivity analysis methods: Sobol indices, Morris scores, and a modification of the activity scores. We evaluate the temporal evolution of the sensitivity of the design parameters, compare the performance of the three methods, and highlight their potential in analyzing parameter interactions. The analysis of the RPM flow shows comparable sensitivities for all methods. Additionally, our numerical experiments show that Morris is the cheapest method, needing at most four times fewer model evaluations than Sobol to reach convergence. This motivates us to only use the computationally cheaper but as reliable Morris and activity scores on the 16-dimensional model, yielding again consistent results.</description>

      <title>Impacting spheres: from liquid drops to elastic beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a non-wetting rigid substrate laterally spreads, then retracts, and finally jumps off again. An elastic solid, by contrast, undergoes a slight deformation, contacts briefly, and bounces. The impact force on the substrate - crucial for engineering and natural processes - is classically described by Wagner's (liquids) and Hertz's (solids) theories. This work bridges these limits by considering a generic viscoelastic medium. Using direct numerical simulations, we study a viscoelastic sphere impacting a rigid, non-contacting surface and quantify how the elasticity number ($El$, dimensionless elastic modulus) and the Weissenberg number ($Wi$, dimensionless relaxation time) dictate the impact force. We recover the Newtonian liquid response as either $El \to 0$ or $Wi \to 0$, and obtain elastic-solid behavior in the limit $Wi \to \infty$ and $El \ne 0$. In this elastic-memory limit, three regimes emerge - capillary-dominated, Wagner scaling, and Hertz scaling - with a smooth transition from the Wagner to the Hertz regime. Sweeping $Wi$ from 0 to $\infty$ reveals a continuous shift from materials with no memory to materials with permanent memory of deformation, providing an alternate, controlled route from liquid drops to elastic beads. The study unifies liquid and solid impact processes and offers a general framework for the liquid-to-elastic transition relevant across systems and applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond solar metallicity: How enhanced solid content in disks re-shape low-mass planet torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The migration of low-mass planets is tightly controlled by the torques exerted by both gas and solids in their natal disks. While canonical models assume a solar solid-to-gas mass ratio (epsilon=0.01) and neglect the back-reaction of solid component of the disk, recent work suggests that enhanced metallicity can radically alter these torques. We quantify how elevated metallicities (epsilon=0.03 and epsilon=0.1) modify the gas and solid torques, test widely used linear scaling prescriptions, and identify the regimes where solid back-reaction becomes decisive. We performed global, 2D hydrodynamic simulations that treat solid material as a pressureless fluid fully coupled to the gas through drag and include the reciprocal back-reaction force. The planet was maintained on a fixed circular orbit, thus we computed static torques. The Stokes number was varied from 0.01 to 10, three surface-density slopes (p=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) and three accretion efficiencies (eta=0, 10, and 100%) were explored. Torques, obtained by rescaling canonical epsilon=0.01 results, were compared with direct simulations. Solid torques scale linearly with epsilon, but gas torques deviate by 50-100% and can even reverse sign for St&lt;=1 in epsilon=0.1 disks. These are due to strong, feedback-driven, asymmetric gas perturbations in the co-orbital region, amplified by rapid planetary accretion. Solid back-reaction in high-metallicity environments can dominate the migration torque budget of low-mass planets. Simple metallicity rescalings are therefore unreliable for St&lt;=2, implying that precise migration tracks - particularly in metal-rich disks -- require simulations that fully couple solid and gas dynamics. These results highlight metallicity as a key parameter in shaping the early orbital architecture of planetary systems.</description>
