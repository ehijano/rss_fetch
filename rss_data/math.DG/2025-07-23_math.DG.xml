      <title>Moduli spaces of flat Riemannian metrics on orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces of flat metrics on closed Riemannian orbifolds admitting such metrics. We show that for such orbifolds $\mathcal{O}$, the Teichm\"uller space of flat metrics $\mathcal{T}_{\text{flat}}(\mathcal{O})$ serves as a classifying space for proper actions of the mapping class group, $\operatorname{MCG}(\mathcal{O})$, in the appropriate category. We show that the moduli space of flat metrics, $\mathcal{M}_{\text{flat}}(\mathcal{O}) = \mathcal{T}_{\text{flat}}(\mathcal{O}) / \operatorname{MCG}(\mathcal{O})$, is itself a very good orbifold, and, under a technical assumption, describe this orbifold algebraically up to commensurability.</description>

      <title>A note on Einstein metrics and Riemannian twistor spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the problem of classifying Einstein manifolds with positive scalar curvature, we prove that an Einstein four-manifold whose associated twistor space has scalar curvature constant on the fibers of the twistor bundle is half conformally flat: in particular, the only compact Einstein four-manifolds with positive scalar curvature satisfying this twistorial condition are $\mathbb{S}^4$ and $\mathbb{CP}^2$. We also generalize a well-known result due to Friedrich and Grunewald, providing a classification of complete four-manifolds whose twistor space is Ricci parallel.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity and Schwarz Lemmas in Calibrated Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper has two main objectives. First, for an arbitrary calibrated manifold $(X,\phi)$, we define notions of $R_\phi$-hyperbolicity and $\phi$-hyperbolicity, which respectively generalize the notions of Kobayashi and Brody hyperbolicity from complex geometry. To make sense of the former, we introduce the "KR $\phi$-metric," a decreasing Finsler pseudo-metric that specializes to the Kobayashi-Royden pseudo-metric in the Kahler case. We prove that $R_\phi$-hyperbolicity implies $\phi$-hyperbolicity, and give examples showing that the converse fails in general. Moreover, for constant-coefficient, inner Mobius rigid calibrations $\phi$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we completely characterize those domains that are $\phi$-hyperbolic.
  Second, we derive a Schwarz lemma for Smith immersions (a.k.a. conformal $\phi$-curves) into an arbitrary calibrated manifold $(X, \phi)$, thereby extending the Schwarz lemma for holomorphic curves into Kahler manifolds. The relevant Bochner formula features the "$\phi$-sectional curvature," a new notion that includes both the scalar and holomorphic sectional curvatures as special cases. As an application, we prove that calibrated geometries with $\phi$-sectional curvature bounded above by a negative constant are $\phi$-hyperbolic, generalizing the corresponding result from complex geometry. As another application, we calculate the KR $\phi$-metric of real, complex, and quaternionic hyperbolic spaces equipped with their natural calibrations.</description>

      <title>A partitioned manifold index theorem for noncompact hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roe's partitioned manifold index theorem applies when a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ is cut into two pieces along a compact hypersurface $N$. It states that a version of the index of a Dirac operator on $M$ localized to $N$ equals the index of the corresponding Dirac operator on $N$. This yields obstructions to positive scalar curvature, and implies cobordism invariance of the index of Dirac operators on compact manifolds. We generalize this result to cases where $N$ may be noncompact, under assumptions on the way it is embedded into $M$. This results in an equality between two classes in the $K$-theory of the Roe algebra of $N$.</description>

      <title>Marginally outer trap surface with capillary boundary and rigidity of initial data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the several rigidity results of initial data sets with boundary when a marginally outer trap surface (MOTS) with capillary boundary is embedded. First, we establish estimates for the area of a MOTS with capillary boundary. Next, we prove a rigidity for 3-dimensional initial data sets with boundary. Furthermore, we extend our results from the 3-dimensional case to the high dimensional initial data sets using the Yamabe constant.</description>

      <title>Isometric immersions into three-dimensional unimodular metric Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study isometric immersions of surfaces into simply connected 3-dimensional unimodular Lie groups endowed with either Riemannian or Lorentzian left-invariant metrics, assuming that Milnor's operator is diagonalizable in the Lorentzian case. We provide global models in coordinates for all these metric Lie groups that depend analytically on the structure constants and establish some fundamental theorems characterizing such immersions. In this sense, we study up to what extent we can recover the immersion from (a) the tangent projections of the natural left-invariant ambient frame, (b) the left-invariant Gauss map, and (c) the shape operator. As an application, we prove that an isometric immersion is determined by its left-invariant Gauss map up to certain well controlled angular companions. We also we classify totally geodesic surfaces and introduce four Lorentzian analogues of the Daniel correspondence within two families of Lorentzian homogeneous 3-manifolds with 4-dimensional isometry group. We also classify isometric immersions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ or $\mathbb{S}^3$ whose left-invariant Gauss maps differ by a direct isometry of $\mathbb{S}^2$. Finally, we show that Daniel's is the furthest extension of the classical Lawson correspondence for constant mean curvature surfaces within Riemannian unimodular metric Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Random graphs, expanding families and the construction of noncompact hyperbolic surfaces with uniform spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a random graph model $\mathcal{F}_{\chi,n}$, which is a configuration model consisting of interior and boundary vertices. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues for graphs in $\mathcal{F}_{\chi,n}$ under various growth regimes of $\chi$ and $n$. When $n = o\left(\chi^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)$, we prove that almost every graph in the model is connected and forms an expander family. We also establish upper bounds for the first Steklov eigenvalue, identifying scenarios in which expanders cannot be constructed. Furthermore, we explicitly construct an expanding family in the critical regime $n \asymp g$, and apply it to build a sequence of complete, noncompact hyperbolic surfaces with uniformly positive spectral gaps.</description>

      <title>Backwards uniqueness for Mean curvature flow with asymptotically conical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that if two mean curvature flows of compact hypersurfaces $M^1_t$ and $M^2_t$ encounter only isolated, multiplicity one, asymptotically conical singularities at the first singular time $T$, and if $M^1_T=M^2_T$ then $M^1_t=M^2_t$ for every $t\in [0,T]$. This is seemingly the first backwards uniqueness result for any geometric flow with singularities, that assumes neither {self-shrinking} nor global asymptotically conical {behaviour}. This necessitates the development of new global tools to deal with both the core of the singularity, its asymptotic structure, and the smooth part of the flows simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Transverse groups preserving proper domains in flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a semisimple Lie group $G$ and a self-opposite flag manifold $\mathcal{F}$ of $G$, we establish a necessary condition for an infinite subgroup $H$ of $G$ to preserve a proper domain in $\mathcal{F}$. In the case where $G$ is a Hermitian Lie group of tube type, we introduce and study a notion of causal convexity in the Shilov boundary $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ of the symmetric space of $G$, inspired by the one already existing in conformal Lorentzian geometry. We show that subgroups $H$ of $G$ that are transverse with respect to a parabolic subgroup of $G$ defining $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ and that preserve a proper domain in $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ satisfy a geometric property with respect to this causal convexity, close to the strong projective convex cocompactness defined by Danciger--Gu\'eritaud--Kassel. This result highlights the spatial nature of the dynamics of $H$. We construct Zariski-dense examples of such transverse subgroups.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Riemannian Proximal Gradient Method for Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of (possibly strongly) geodesically convex optimization problems on Hadamard manifolds, where the objective function splits into the sum of a smooth and a possibly nonsmooth function. We introduce an intrinsic convex Riemannian proximal gradient (CRPG) method that employs the manifold proximal map for the nonsmooth step, without operating in the embedding or tangent space. A sublinear convergence rate for convex problems and a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems is established, and we derive fundamental proximal gradient inequalities that generalize the Euclidean case. Our numerical experiments on hyperbolic spaces and manifolds of symmetric positive definite matrices demonstrate substantial computational advantages over existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Higher Gauge Flow Models, a novel class of Generative Flow Models. Building upon ordinary Gauge Flow Models (arXiv:2507.13414), these Higher Gauge Flow Models leverage an L$_{\infty}$-algebra, effectively extending the Lie Algebra. This expansion allows for the integration of the higher geometry and higher symmetries associated with higher groups into the framework of Generative Flow Models. Experimental evaluation on a Gaussian Mixture Model dataset revealed substantial performance improvements compared to traditional Flow Models.</description>

      <title>The fully nonlinear Loewner-Nirenberg problem: Liouville theorems and counterexamples to local boundary estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give a complete classification of positive viscosity solutions $w$ to conformally invariant equations of the form
  \begin{align}\label{ab}\tag{$*$}
  \begin{cases}
  f(\lambda(-A_w)) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \lambda(-A_w)\in\Gamma &amp; \text{in }\mathbb{R}_+^n \newline
  w = 0 &amp; \text{on }\partial\mathbb{R}_+^n,
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}
  where $A_w$ is the Schouten tensor of the metric $g_w = w^{-2}|dx|^2$, $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a symmetric convex cone and $f$ is an associated defining function satisfying standard assumptions. Solutions to \eqref{ab} yield metrics $g_w$ of negative curvature-type which are locally complete near $\partial\mathbb{R}_+^n$. In particular, when $(f,\Gamma) = (\sigma_1,\Gamma_1^+)$, \eqref{ab} is the Loewner-Nirenberg problem in the upper half-space.
  More precisely, let $\mu_\Gamma^+$ denote the unique constant satisfying $(-\mu_\Gamma^+, 1,\dots,1)\in\partial\Gamma$. We show that when $\mu_\Gamma^+ &gt;1$ (e.g. when $\Gamma = \Gamma_k^+$ for $k&lt;\frac{n}{2}$), the hyperbolic solution $w^{(0)}(x) := x_n$ is the unique solution to \eqref{ab}. More surprisingly, we show that when $\mu_\Gamma^+ \leq 1$ (e.g. when $\Gamma = \Gamma_k^+$ for $k\geq \frac{n}{2}$), the solution set consists of a monotonically increasing one-parameter family $\{w^{(a)}(x_n)\}_{a\geq 0}$, of which the hyperbolic solution $w^{(0)}$ is the minimal solution. In either case, solutions of \eqref{ab} are functions of $x_n$. Our proof involves a novel application of the method of moving spheres for which we must establish new estimates and regularity near $\partial\mathbb{R}_+^n$, followed by a delicate ODE analysis. As an application, we give counterexamples to local boundary $C^0$ estimates on solutions to the fully nonlinear Loewner-Nirenberg problem when $\mu_\Gamma^+ \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>The $\sigma_k$-Loewner-Nirenberg problem on Riemannian manifolds for $k=\frac{n}{2}$ and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M^n,g_0)$ be a smooth compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$ with smooth non-empty boundary $\partial M$. Let $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a symmetric convex cone and $f$ a symmetric defining function for $\Gamma$ satisfying standard assumptions. Denoting by $A_{g_u}$ the Schouten tensor of a conformal metric $g_u = u^{-2}g_0$, we show that the associated fully nonlinear Loewner-Nirenberg problem
  \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  f(\lambda(-g_u^{-1}A_{g_u})) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \lambda(-g_u^{-1}A_{g_u})\in\Gamma &amp; \text{on }M\backslash \partial M \newline
  u = 0 &amp; \text{on }\partial M
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  admits a solution if $\mu_\Gamma^+ &gt; 1-\delta$, where $\mu_\Gamma^+$ is defined by $(-\mu_\Gamma^+,1,\dots,1)\in\partial\Gamma$ and $\delta&gt;0$ is a constant depending on certain geometric data. In particular, we solve the $\sigma_k$-Loewner-Nirenberg problem for all $k\leq \frac{n}{2}$, which extends recent work of the authors to include the important threshold case $k=\frac{n}{2}$. In the process, we establish that the fully nonlinear Loewner-Nirenberg problem and corresponding Dirichlet boundary value problem with positive boundary data admit solutions if there exists a conformal metric $g\in[g_0]$ such that $\lambda(-g^{-1}A_g)\in\Gamma$ on $M$; these latter results require no assumption on $\mu_\Gamma^+$ and are new when $(1,0,\dots,0)\in\partial\Gamma$.</description>

Abstract: The celebrated Minkowski problem for the torsional rigidity ($2$-torsional rigidity) was firstly studied by Colesanti and Fimiani \cite{CA} using variational method. Moreover, Hu, Liu and Ma \cite{HJ} also studied the Minkowski problem {\it w.r.t.} $2$-torsional rigidity by method of curvature flows and obtain the existence of smooth even solutions. Up to now, as far as we know, the study of the Minkowski problem for the $q$-torsional rigidity is still blank.
  In the present paper, we propose and investigate the Orlicz Minkowski problem for the $q$-torsional rigidity corresponding to the $q$-Laplace equation inspired by the foregoing works, and then confirm the existence of smooth non-even solutions to the Orlicz Minkowski problem for the $q$-torsional rigidity with $q&gt;1$ by the method of a Gauss curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on virtual moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type by Miyaoka (1977) and Yau (1978). Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>

      <title>Positivity of tangent sheaves of projective varieties -- the structure of MRC fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the structure theorem for smooth projective varieties with nef tangent bundle to projective klt varieties whose tangent sheaf is either positively curved or almost nef. Specifically, we show that such a variety $X$, up to a finite quasi-\'etale cover, admits a rationally connected fibration $X \to A$ onto an abelian variety $A$. For the proof, we develop the theory of positivity of coherent sheaves on projective varieties. As applications, we establish some relations between the geometric properties and positivity of tangent sheaves.</description>

      <title>On the blow-up formula of weighted stability for polarized toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective toric variety, and let $\widetilde{X}$ denote the blow-up of $X$ at finitely many distinct tours-invariant points. This paper provides an explicit combinatorial formula for the Chow weight of $\widetilde{X}$ in terms of the base toric manifold $X$ and the symplectic cuts of its associated Delzant polytope. We apply this blow-up formula to the projective plane and compare Chow stability of toric blow-ups with that of blow-ups at general points. Furthermore, we derive the blow-up formula of the Futaki-Ono invariant, which serves an obstruction to asymptotic Chow semistability of a polarized toric manifold. In the final section, we extend our approach to study blow-up formulas for weighted (Chow/K-) stability using our combinatorial framework.</description>

      <title>Abundance and SYZ conjecture in families of hyperkahler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle on a hyperkahler manifold $M$, with $c_1(L)$ nef and not big. SYZ conjecture predicts that $L$ is semiample. We prove that this is true, assuming that $(M,L)$ has a deformation $(M',L')$ with $L'$ semiample. We introduce a version of the Teichmuller space that parametrizes pairs $(M,L)$ up to isotopy. We prove a version of the global Torelli theorem for such Teichmuller spaces and use it to deduce the deformation invariance of semiampleness.</description>

      <title>Finite element form-valued forms: Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a finite element discretization of $\ell$-form-valued $k$-forms on triangulation in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for general $k$, $\ell$ and $n$ and any polynomial degree. The construction generalizes finite element Whitney forms for the de~Rham complex and their higher-order and distributional versions, the Regge finite elements and the Christiansen--Regge elasticity complex, the TDNNS element for symmetric stress tensors, the MCS element for traceless matrix fields, the Hellan--Herrmann--Johnson (HHJ) elements for biharmonic equations, and discrete divdiv and Hessian complexes in [Hu, Lin, and Zhang, 2025]. The construction discretizes the Bernstein--Gelfand--Gelfand (BGG) diagrams. Applications of the construction include discretization of strain and stress tensors in continuum mechanics and metric and curvature tensors in differential geometry in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Manifold Learning with Normalizing Flows: Towards Regularity, Expressivity and Iso-Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning increasingly leverages the insight that high-dimensional data often lie near low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds, an idea known as the manifold hypothesis. By explicitly modeling the geometric structure of data through learning Riemannian geometry algorithms can achieve improved performance and interpretability in tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and interpolation. In particular, learned pullback geometry has recently undergone transformative developments that now make it scalable to learn and scalable to evaluate, which further opens the door for principled non-linear data analysis and interpretable machine learning. However, there are still steps to be taken when considering real-world multi-modal data. This work focuses on addressing distortions and modeling errors that can arise in the multi-modal setting and proposes to alleviate both challenges through isometrizing the learned Riemannian structure and balancing regularity and expressivity of the diffeomorphism parametrization. We showcase the effectiveness of the synergy of the proposed approaches in several numerical experiments with both synthetic and real data.</description>
