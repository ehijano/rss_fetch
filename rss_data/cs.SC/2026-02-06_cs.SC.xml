      <title>Rule-Based Spatial Mixture-of-Experts U-Net for Explainable Edge Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models like U-Net and its variants, have established state-of-the-art performance in edge detection tasks and are used by Generative AI services world-wide for their image generation models. However, their decision-making processes remain opaque, operating as "black boxes" that obscure the rationale behind specific boundary predictions. This lack of transparency is a critical barrier in safety-critical applications where verification is mandatory. To bridge the gap between high-performance deep learning and interpretable logic, we propose the Rule-Based Spatial Mixture-of-Experts U-Net (sMoE U-Net). Our architecture introduces two key innovations: (1) Spatially-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (sMoE) blocks integrated into the decoder skip connections, which dynamically gate between "Context" (smooth) and "Boundary" (sharp) experts based on local feature statistics; and (2) a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) Fuzzy Head that replaces the standard classification layer. This fuzzy head fuses deep semantic features with heuristic edge signals using explicit IF-THEN rules. We evaluate our method on the BSDS500 benchmark, achieving an Optimal Dataset Scale (ODS) F-score of 0.7628, effectively matching purely deep baselines like HED (0.7688) while outperforming the standard U-Net (0.7437). Crucially, our model provides pixel-level explainability through "Rule Firing Maps" and "Strategy Maps," allowing users to visualize whether an edge was detected due to strong gradients, high semantic confidence, or specific logical rule combinations.</description>

      <title>SynPAT: A System for Generating Synthetic Physical Theories with Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-assisted methods for discovering physical laws from background theory and data have recently emerged, promising to advance our understanding of the physical world. However, training and benchmarking these systems remains challenging: real physical theories are limited in number. To address this need, we introduce SynPAT, a system for generating synthetic physical theories with accompanying data. SynPAT produces: (i) a consistent set of axioms forming a synthetic theory, (ii) a symbolic consequence of these axioms representing the discovery target, and (iii) noisy data approximating this consequence. Crucially, to mirror historically incorrect theories (e.g., Newtonian mechanics before Special Relativity), SynPAT can also generate theories whose axioms do not strictly entail, and in fact conflict with, the observed consequence, requiring a correction to the assumed axioms to bridge the gap. We detail SynPAT's methodology and benchmark several open-source symbolic regression systems on our generated theories and data.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Algebraic and Arithmetic Attributes of Hypergeometric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss algorithms for arithmetic properties of hypergeometric functions. Most notably, we are able to compute the p-adic valuation of a hypergeometric function on any disk of radius smaller than the p-adic radius of convergence. This we use, building on work of Christol, to determine the set of prime numbers modulo which it can be reduced. Moreover, we describe an algorithm to find an annihilating polynomial of the reduction of a hypergeometric function modulo p.</description>
