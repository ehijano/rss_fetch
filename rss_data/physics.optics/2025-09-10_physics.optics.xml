      <title>THz-PINNs: Time-Domain Forward Modeling of Terahertz Spectroscopy with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a powerful tool for extracting optical and electrical parameters, as well as probing internal structures and surface morphology of materials. However, conventional simulation techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD), face challenges in accurately modeling THz wave propagation. These difficulties arise from the broad operating bandwidth of THz-TDS (~0.1-10 THz), which demands extremely high temporal resolution to capture pulse dynamics and fine spatial resolution to resolve microstructures and interface effects. To address these limitations, we introduce physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into THz-TDS modeling for the first time. Through a comprehensive analysis of forward problems in the time domain, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of PINNs as a powerful framework for advancing THz wave simulation and analysis.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Wavelength Division Multiplexers Enabled by Co-Optimized Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavelength division multiplexers are fundamental to the functioning and performance of integrated photonic circuits, with applications ranging from optical interconnects to sensing and quantum technologies. Current solutions are limited by trade-offs between channel spacing, crosstalk, insertion loss, and device footprint. Here, we develop a novel design approach that co-optimizes inverse-designed wavelength division multiplexers and distributed Bragg gratings to achieve ultra-low crosstalk without compromising insertion loss. We experimentally demonstrate less than -40 dB crosstalk for wavelength channel spacing of 15 nm in foundry-compatible silicon devices across the telecommunications C- and L-bands. Our design process is highly adaptable, allowing for seamless scaling to a greater number of output channels, different spectral windows, and easy translation across various material platforms.</description>

      <title>Disorder-mediated synchronization resonance in coupled semiconductor lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between disorder and synchronization in nonlinear oscillator networks has long been known to give rise to counterintuitive phenomena, such as disorder-enhanced coherence. We uncover a frequency-disorder mediated synchronization resonance in coupled external-cavity semiconductor diode lasers. Specifically, we find that intrinsic random frequency detuning among the lasers can enhance synchronization, reaching a maximum at an optimal coupling strength in the weak-coupling regime. The resonance is genuinely disorder-mediated, as it vanishes in the corresponding disorder-free system. To explain this phenomenon, we develop a physical theory based on an effective thermodynamic potential, which also accounts for the associated scaling behavior. Our results establish semiconductor laser arrays as a versatile experimental platform for investigating disorder-driven collective dynamics, with potential implications for a broad class of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Toward Lifelong-Sustainable Electronic-Photonic AI Systems via Extreme Efficiency, Reconfigurability, and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relentless growth of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) has created unprecedented demand for computational power, straining the energy, bandwidth, and scaling limits of conventional electronic platforms. Electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for next-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and interconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for sustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and lower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon footprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits, while delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and interconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI systems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and cross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We present how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing both chip area and metal layer usage. We will also demonstrate how cross-layer device-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for photonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip area cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI workloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by tolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with EPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and robustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI systems. This perspective highlights how EPIC AI systems can simultaneously meet the performance demands of modern AI and the urgent imperative for sustainable computing.</description>

      <title>Near Field Enhancement via Plasmon Phonon Polariton Coupling with CdO Stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-infrared spectral region presents significant potential for sensing and spectroscopic applications. However, traditional plasmonic materials exhibit substantial optical losses within this range, thereby constraining their effectiveness. Emerging materials such as cadmium oxide (CdO) have demonstrated promise in overcoming these limitations. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to engineer large coupling between localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in CdO and localized surface phonon polaritons (LSPhP) in sapphire. By developing a successful dry etching protocol for CdO, we fabricate stripe arrays with tunable sizes, allowing the spectral alignment between the LSP and LSPhP modes. We demonstrate both experimentally and numerically that when these polaritons become resonant, hybrid modes emerge, resulting in coupling. Finite element simulations reveal near-field enhancements exceeding a factor of 1000, spatially extended hundreds of nanometers around the etched structures. Our approach bridges the plasmonic and phononic responses of two mid-IR active materials, paving the way for scalable, high-performance infrared sensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Spectral localization of single-nanoparticle plasmons through photonic substrate engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface plasmon resonances (SPRs) are crucial for confining light beyond the diffraction limit, yet heavy metal losses often limit their spectral localization. Here, we propose a practical strategy for enabling the spectral localization of single-nanoparticle SPRs through photonic substrate engineering, which creates distinct optical pathways (OPs) to tailor the electromagnetic environments around plasmonic nanoparticles. By analyzing the multiplication factor spectrum of the projected local density of states, we can trace and control these OPs, enabling strong spatial and spectral confinement of single-nanoparticle SPRs. Simulations reveal that a photonic crystal substrate can reduce the mode volume by fivefold and boost the quality factor by over 80 times compared to a metal nanoparticle on a dielectric substrate. Proof-of-concept experiments using two types of leaking Fabry-Perot photonic substrates demonstrate active manipulation of SPRs in both "open" and "closed" OP states. This multidimensional photonic substrate engineering establishes a customizable platform for single-nanoparticle plasmonics, potentially transforming applications that were previously limited by spectral localization.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Vapor Cells for Rydberg Atom-Based Electrometer Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical investigation into the radio frequency (RF) field behavior within miniaturized all-glass and hybrid vapor cell geometries designed for Rydberg atom-based electrometry. Using full-vector finite element modeling (FEM), we analyze electromagnetic field enhancement across a wide frequency range (0.05 GHz to 150 GHz) as a function of polarization, incidence angle, and structural configuration. Two primary vapor cell designs are evaluated: translationally invariant "open" cells and periodically structured "supported" cells composed entirely of low-loss glass, as well as hybrid structures incorporating highly doped silicon. Our simulations reveal that the structured all-glass vapor cells exhibit sharp, angle- and polarization-dependent resonant peaks due to guided-mode coupling, resulting in localized RF power enhancements exceeding 8x. In contrast, silicon-based structures demonstrate significant electric field attenuation and suppression of resonant features due to their high dielectric losses. Through k-vector and angle-resolved analyses, we show how cell geometry and material properties critically influence the RF field distribution and coupling efficiency. Our findings open new possibilities for optimizing vapor cell architectures to enhance field sensitivity, directional and polarization selectivity, and integration potential in chip-scale quantum sensing platforms based on Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Quantization of the electromagnetic fields from single atomic or molecular radiators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles, which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beyond Dark-Field RGB Capabilities: Deep Spectral Extrapolation of Ultrasmall Plasmonic Nanogaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localized surface plasmons can confine light within a deep-subwavelength volume comparable to the scale of atoms and molecules, enabling ultrasensitive responses to near-field variations. On the other hand, this extreme localization also inevitably amplifies the unwanted noise from the response of local morphological imperfections, leading to complex spectral variations and reduced consistency across the plasmonic nanostructures. Seeking uniform optical responses has therefore long been a sought-after goal in nanoplasmonics. However, conventional probing techniques by dark-field (DF) confocal microscopy, such as image analysis or spectral measurements, can be inaccurate and time-consuming, respectively. Here, we introduce SPARX, a deep-learning-powered paradigm that surpasses conventional imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. In particular, SPARX can batch-predict broadband DF spectra (e.g., 500-1000 nm) of numerous nanoparticles simultaneously from an information-limited RGB image (i.e., below 700 nm). It achieves this extrapolative inference beyond the camera's capture capabilities by learning the underlying physical relationships among multiple orders of optical resonances. The spectral predictions only take milliseconds, achieving a speedup of three to four orders of magnitude compared to traditional spectral acquisition, which may take from hours to days. As a proof-of-principle demonstration for screening identical resonances, the selection accuracy achieved by SPARX is comparable to that of conventional spectroscopy techniques. This breakthrough paves the way for consistent plasmonic applications and next-generation microscopies.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed PointNets for Modeling Electromagnetic Scattering from All-Dielectric Metasurfaces with Inclined Nanopillars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are innovative planar optical structures capable of manipulating incident light properties. Accurate and computationally efficient modeling of such metasurfaces, particularly those with irregular geometries, remains a challenge for conventional solvers. In this work, we present a mesh-free Physics-Informed PointNet (PIPN) to model electromagnetic scattering from all-dielectric metasurfaces that feature spatially varying nanopillars. Our approach uses the PointNet architecture to directly encode spatially varying material properties into the Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) framework. We demonstrate the generalization capability of our PIPN through evaluations on datasets; these datasets are generated with varying refractive indices representing common dielectric materials. Furthermore, the inclination angles are varied within each dataset, which represent expected manufacturing defects. Overall, our method provides a promising, mesh-free framework for accurate and efficient modeling of complex optical structures represented by irregular geometries.</description>

      <title>Generalised Geometric Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalised notion of geometric phase for pure states is proposed and its physical manifestations are shown. An appreciation of fact that the interference phenomenon also manifests in the average of an observable, allows us to define the argument of the matrix element of an observable as a generalised relative phase. This identification naturally paves the way for defining an operator generalisation of the geometric phase following Pancharatnam. The notion of natural connection finds an appropriate operator generalisation, and the generalised geometric phase is indeed found to be the (an)holonomy of the generalised connection. It is shown that in scenarios wherein the usual geometric phase is not defined, the generalised geometric phase manifests as a global phase acquired by a quantum state in course of time evolution. The generalised geometric phase is found to contribute to the shift in the energy spectrum due perturbation, and to the forward scattering amplitude in a scattering problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently [PRA 108, L051501 (2023)], it was shown that in a centrosymmetric cubic system, two photons from a broadband intense laser field can be converted into a pair of Stokes and anti-Stokes (SaS) entangled photons. While the previous work was based on symmetry arguments, here we present a fully quantum theory for the SaS scattering that properly explains, quantitatively describes, and provides a means to predict its spectral and polarization properties (for diamond). We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional moir\'{e} phonon polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) are hybrid light-matter modes. We investigate them in two-dimensional (2D) materials with twisted moir\'{e} structures, revealing that the moir\'{e} potential creates a new class of `moir\'{e} PhPs'. These exhibit a fundamental spectral reconstruction into multiple branches and, crucially, electromagnetic wavefunctions that are nano-patterned by the superlattice. Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. The inherent nanoscale structuring produces a robust, spatially varying near-field response, establishing moir\'{e} superlattices as a platform for engineering light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Position-correlated biphoton wavefront sensing for quantum adaptive imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum imaging with spatially entangled photons offers advantages such as enhanced spatial resolution, robustness against noise, and counter-intuitive phenomena, while a biphoton spatial aberration generally degrades its performance. Biphoton aberration correction has been achieved by using classical beams to detect the aberration source or scanning the correction phase on biphotons if the source is unreachable. Here, a new method named position-correlated biphoton Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing is introduced, where the phase pattern added on photon pairs with a strong position correlation is reconstructed from their position centroid distribution at the back focal plane of a microlens array. Experimentally, biphoton phase measurement and adaptive imaging against the disturbance of a plastic film are demonstrated. This single-shot method is a more direct and efficient approach toward quantum adaptive optics, suitable for integration into quantum microscopy, remote imaging, and communication.</description>

      <title>Towards an Experimental Device-Independent Verification of Indefinite Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical physics, events follow a definite causal order: the past influences the future, but not the reverse. Quantum theory, however, permits superpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which can provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such phenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted to refuting local realism and confirming quantum entanglement. To date, demonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called the quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or semi-device-independent protocols. A recent theoretical development introduced a Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of indefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this verification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we measure a value of $1.8328 \pm 0.0045$, which is 18 standard deviations above the classical bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a device-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the presence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards the device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides a context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the verification of indefinite causal order.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear-linear duality for multipath quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum optics, the postselection amplitude of a nondegenerate parametric down-conversion (PDC) process is linked to a beamsplitter (BS) via partial time reversal, up to a normalization coefficient which is related to the parametric gain [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product. Additional terms in the normalization coefficient are related to the contribution of looping photons inside the cavities. Then, we discuss the case of coherent state input and postselection for $Q$-function calculation. This theorem will be helpful in the development of quantum photonic devices beyond the low-gain limit.</description>
