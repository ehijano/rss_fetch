      <title>Deterministic Optimisation of Jastrow Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly flexible Jastrow factors have found significant use in stochastic electronic structure methods such as variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion Monte Carlo, as well as in quantum chemical transcorrelated (TC) approaches, which have recently seen great success in generating highly accurate electronic energies using moderately sized basis sets. In particular for the latter, the intrinsic noise in the Jastrow factor due to its optimisation by VMC can pose a problem, especially when targeting weak (non-covalent) interactions. In this paper, we propose a deterministic alternative to VMC Jastrow optimisation, based on minimising the "variance of the TC reference energy" in a standard basis set. Analytic expressions for the derivatives of the TC Hamiltonian matrix elements are derived and implemented. This approach can be used to optimise the parameters in the Jastrow functions, either from scratch or to refine an initial VMC-based guess, to produce noise-free Jastrows in a reproducible manner. Applied to the first row atoms and molecules, the results show that the method yields Slater-Jastrow wavefunctions whose variances are almost as low as those obtained from standard VMC variance optimisation, but whose energies are lower, and comparable to those obtained from energy-minimisation VMC. We propose that the method can be used both in the context of the transcorrelated method or in standard VMC as a new way to optimise Jastrow functions.</description>

      <title>Localised and Delocalised Charge Distribution in a Diamine Cation and Rydberg Excited State: A Challenging Test for Density Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balance between localised and delocalised electron distribution in the N,N'-dimethylpiperazine (DMP) molecule in the 3s Rydberg excited state and in the fully ionised DMP$^+$ provides a valuable test of density functionals, in particular the weight of Fock exchange (FE) in hybrid functionals and the scaling of explicit orbital-based self-interaction correction (SIC) applied to less elaborate functionals. We present results of calculations using density functionals of all rungs of Jacob's ladder, ranging from LDA to the DM21 machine learned local hybrid as well as double hybrids. For DMP$^+$, the commonly used hybrid functionals, such as PBE0(.25) with FE weight of 0.25, as well as PBE0(.32) with a weight of 0.32 only produce the more delocalised charge. The latter mimics the DM21 energy surface well. However, hybrid functionals with stronger FE, such as BHLYP and PBE0(.50) as well as some double hybrid functionals, also produce local energy minima corresponding to localised charge. When full SIC is applied to the PBE functional, an energy surface analogous to hybrid functionals with FE weight of 0.50 is obtained, while the scaling of SIC by 0.50, which has previously been shown to give improved atomisation energy and band gap of solids, only produces the more delocalised charge. For the 3s Rydberg excited state of DMP, two types of configurations with a localised hole are obtained in calculations using the PBE0(.32) functional, in addition to the delocalised hole, but only the latter is found with the PBE functional, showing that a significant reduction of the self-interaction error is needed in order to obtain agreement between density functional calculations and experimental measurements of the Rydberg state</description>

      <title>Excited State Densities from Time-Dependent Density Functional Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the variational principle for excited-state energies leads to a route to obtaining excited-state densities from time-dependent density functional theory, relatively little attention has been paid to the quality of the resulting densities in real space obtained with different exchange-correlation functional approximations, nor how non-adiabatic approximations developed for energies of states of double excitation character perform for their densities. Here we derive an expression directly in real space for the excited-state density, that includes the case of non-adiabatic kernels, and consequently is able, for the first time, to yield densities of states of double-excitation character. Under some well-defined simplifications, we compare the performance of the local-density approximation and exact-exchange approximation, which are in a sense at opposite extremes of the fundamental functional approximations, on local and charge-transfer excitations in one-dimensional model systems, and show that the dressed TDDFT approach gives good densities of double-excitations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Ostwald ripening by chemical activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation of biomolecular condensates is ubiquitous in living cells, promoting colocalization of enzymes and their substrates as well as achieving membrane-free compartmentalization. Energy-consuming processes are routinely used to regulate biocondensate growth by opposing the thermodynamic tendency toward coarsening. At the same time, cells often use energy to instead accelerate thermodynamic processes. Here, we theoretically explore the possibility of utilizing chemical reactions to accelerate biocondensate coarsening. We combine Lifshitz-Slyozov theory with a reaction-diffusion approach, wherein particles interconvert between phase-separating and inert forms. We find that mass conservation restricts the volume growth to be linear in time (as in the passive case) despite activity, though if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. Our acceleration theory is quantitatively supported by recent experiments on ripening in the presence of fueled interconversion reactions, under precisely the predicted conditions. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts as a regulator of metabolic channeling.</description>

      <title>Chronoamperometry with Room-Temperature Ionic Liquids: Sub-Second Inference Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and electrochemical analysis.</description>

      <title>Controlling rovibrational state populations of polar molecules in inhomogeneous electric fields of the Stark deceleration: molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modified Stark-chirped rapid adiabatic passage technique for a robust rovibrational population transfer in the gas phase molecules in the presence of certain inhomogeneous electric fields. As an example application, the new state switching scheme is shown to greatly enhance the process of slowing polar ammonia molecules in the Stark decelerator. High-level quantum mechanical simulations show that a virtually complete population inversion between a selected pair of weak-field and strong-field seeking states of NH$_3$ can be achieved. Strong dc electric fields within the Stark decelerator are used as part of the rovibrational population transfer protocol. Classical-dynamics simulations for ammonia demonstrate notable improvements in the longitudinal phase space acceptance of the Stark decelerator upgraded with the state switching and an increased deceleration efficiency with respect to the standard Stark deceleration technique.</description>

      <title>Tunable spin-phonon polarons in a chiral molecular qubit framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. However, direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that clearly indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence.</description>

      <title>Unified Deep Learning Framework for Many-Body Quantum Chemistry via Green's Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body methods provide a systematic route to computing electronic properties of molecules and materials, but high computational costs restrict their use in large-scale applications. Due to the complexity in many-electron wavefunctions, machine learning models capable of capturing fundamental many-body physics remain limited. Here, we present a deep learning framework targeting the many-body Green's function, which unifies predictions of electronic properties in ground and excited states, while offering physical insights into many-electron correlation effects. By learning the $GW$ or coupled-cluster self-energy from mean-field features, our graph neural network achieves competitive performance in predicting one- and two-particle excitations and quantities derivable from one-particle density matrix. We demonstrate its high data efficiency and good transferability across chemical species, system sizes, molecular conformations, and correlation strengths in bond breaking, through multiple molecular and nanomaterial benchmarks. This work opens up opportunities for utilizing machine learning to solve many-electron problems.</description>

      <title>Compositional Analysis of Fragrance Accords Using Femtosecond Thermal Lens Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond thermal lens spectroscopy (FTLS) is a powerful analytical tool, yet its application to complex, multi-component mixtures like fragrance accords remains limited. Here, we introduce and validate a unified metric, the Femtosecond Thermal Lens Integrated Magnitude (FTL-IM), to characterize such mixtures. The FTL-IM, derived from the integrated signal area, provides a direct, model-free measure of the total thermo-optical response, including critical convective effects. Applying the FTL-IM to complex six-component accords, we demonstrate its utility in predicting a mixture's thermal response from its composition through linear additivity with respect to component mole fractions. Our method quantifies the accords' behavior, revealing both the baseline contributions of components and the dominant, non-linear effects of highly-active species like Methyl Anthranilate. This consistency is validated across single-beam Z-scan, dual-beam Z-scan, and time-resolved FTLS measurements. The metric also demonstrates the necessity of single-beam measurements for interpreting dual-beam data. This work establishes a rapid, quantitative method for fragrance analysis, offering advantages for quality control by directly linking a mixture's bulk thermo-optical properties to its composition.</description>

      <title>Learning collective variables that preserve transition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective variables (CVs) play a crucial role in capturing rare events in high-dimensional systems, motivating the continual search for principled approaches to their design. In this work, we revisit the framework of quantitative coarse graining and identify the orthogonality condition from Legoll and Lelievre (2010) as a key criterion for constructing CVs that accurately preserve the statistical properties of the original process. We establish that satisfaction of the orthogonality condition enables error estimates for both relative entropy and pathwise distance to scale proportionally with the degree of scale separation. Building on this foundation, we introduce a general numerical method for designing neural network-based CVs that integrates tools from manifold learning with group-invariant featurization. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we construct CVs for butane and achieve a CV that reproduces the anti-gauche transition rate with less than ten percent relative error. Additionally, we provide empirical evidence challenging the necessity of uniform positive definiteness in diffusion tensors for transition rate reproduction and highlight the critical role of light atoms in CV design for molecular dynamics.</description>
