      <title>Vlasov-Poisson simulation study of phase-space hole coalescence in a cylindrically wave-guided plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, coalescence of phase-space holes of collision-less, one-dimensional plasmas is studied using kinetic simulation techniques. Phase-space holes are well-known Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal waves known for exhibiting coalescence, are numerically simulated and their coalescence is observed. Relations between the hole speed, potential, phase-space vorticity and phase-space depth are then obtained using the simulation data. This study involves the study of electron phase-space hole coalescence in a cylindrically wave-guided plasma. Using the recently developed phase-space hydrodynamic analogy, it is shown that the coalescence phenomena can be explored in terms of the fluid-analogous vortical nature of the phase-space holes. Coalescence occurs due to the interaction of the phase-space velocity fields associated with these phase-space vortices. Results obtained from the study describes various parametric relations between the coalesced hole characteristics and the characteristics of the colliding holes.</description>

      <title>Kinetic simulations underestimate the effects of waves during magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless plasma systems are often studied using fully kinetic simulations, where protons and electrons are treated as particles. Due to their computational expense, it is necessary to reduce the ion-to-electron mass ratio $m_i/m_e$ or the ratio between plasma and cyclotron frequencies in simulations of large systems. In this work we show that when electron-scale waves are present in larger-scale systems, numerical parameters affect their amplitudes and effects on the larger system. Using lower-hybrid drift waves during magnetic reconnection as an example, we find that the ratio between the wave electric field and the reconnection electric field scales like $\sqrt{m_i/m_e}$, while the phase relationship is also affected. The combination of these effects means that the anomalous drag that contributes to momentum balance in the reconnection region can be underestimated by an order of magnitude. The results are relevant to the coupling of electron-scale waves to ion-scale reconnection regions, and other systems such as collisionless shocks.</description>

      <title>Atoms in Dense Plasmas: Models, Applications, and Current Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling plasmas in terms of atoms or ions is theoretically appealing for several reasons. When it is relevant, the notion of atom or ion in a plasma provides us with an interpretation scheme of the plasma's microscopic structure. From the standpoint of quantitative estimation of plasma properties, atomic models of plasma allow extending many theoretical tools of atomic physics to plasmas. This notably includes the statistical approaches to the detailed accounting for excited states, or the collisional-radiative modeling of non-equilibrium plasmas, which is based on the notion of atomic processes.
  This habilitation thesis is mostly focused on the studies to which the author has contributed in the field of atomic modeling of dense, non-ideal plasmas. The studies to which the author contributed in the field of collisional-radiative modeling of non-LTE plasmas are also addressed, and the prospect of bridging with dense-plasma models is sketched.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of a heat flux closure for electrostatic plasma phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in understanding multi-scale collisionless plasma phenomena requires employing tools which balance computational efficiency and physics fidelity. Collisionless fluid models are able to resolve spatio-temporal scales that are unfeasible with fully kinetic models. However, constructing such models requires truncating the infinite hierarchy of moment equations and supplying an appropriate closure to approximate the unresolved physics. Data-driven methods have recently begun to see increased application to this end, enabling a systematic approach to constructing closures. Here, we utilise sparse regression to search for heat flux closures for one-dimensional electrostatic plasma phenomena. We examine OSIRIS particle-in-cell simulation data of Landau-damped Langmuir waves and two-stream instabilities. Sparse regression consistently identifies six terms as physically relevant, together regularly accounting for more than 95% of the variation in the heat flux. We further quantify the relative importance of these terms under various circumstances and examine their dependence on parameters such as thermal speed and growth/damping rate. The results are discussed in the context of previously known collisionless closures and linear collisionless theory.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>

      <title>Modelling of warm dense hydrogen via explicit real time electron dynamics: Dynamic structure factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two methods for computing the dynamic structure factor for warm dense hydrogen without invoking either the Born-Oppenheimer approximation or the Chihara decomposition, by employing a wave-packet description that resolves the electron dynamics during ion evolution. First, a semiclassical method is discussed, which is corrected based on known quantum constraints, and second, a direct computation of the density response function within the molecular dynamics. The wave packet models are compared to PIMC and DFT-MD for the static and low-frequency behaviour. For the high-frequency behaviour the models recover the expected behaviour in the limits of small and large momentum transfers and show the characteristic flattening of the plasmon dispersion for intermediate momentum transfers due to interactions, in agreement with commonly used models for x-ray Thomson scattering. By modelling the electrons and ions on an equal footing, both the ion and free electron part of the spectrum can now be treated within a single framework where we simultaneously resolve the ion-acoustic and plasmon mode, with a self-consistent description of collisions and screening.</description>
