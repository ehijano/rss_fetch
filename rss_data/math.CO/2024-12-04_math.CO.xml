      <title>Quasi-fixed points of substitutive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study automatic sequences and automatic systems generated by general constant length (nonprimitive) substitutions. While an automatic system is typically uncountable, the set of automatic sequences is countable, implying that most sequences within an automatic system are not themselves automatic. We provide a complete and succinct classification of automatic sequences that lie in a given automatic system in terms of the quasi-fixed points of the substitution defining the system. Our result extends to factor maps between automatic systems and highlights arithmetic properties underpinning these systems. We conjecture that a similar statement holds for general nonconstant length substitutions.</description>

      <title>Postnikov--Stanley polynomials are Lorentzian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postnikov--Stanley polynomials $D_u^w$ are a generalization of skew dual Schubert polynomials to the setting of arbitrary Weyl groups. We prove that Postnikov--Stanley polynomials are Lorentzian by showing that they are degree polynomials of Richardson varieties. Our result yields an interesting class of Lorentzian polynomials related to the geometry of Richardson varieties, generalizes the result that dual Schubert polynomials are Lorentzian (Huh--Matherne--M\'esz\'aros--St. Dizier 2022), and resolves the conjecture that Postnikov--Stanley polynomials are M-convex (An--Tung--Zhang 2024).</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Schubert Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schubert coefficients are nonnegative integers $c^w_{u,v}$ that arise in Algebraic Geometry and play a central role in Algebraic Combinatorics. It is a major open problem whether they have a combinatorial interpretation, i.e, whether $c^w_{u,v} \in \#{\sf P}$. We study the closely related vanishing problem of Schubert coefficients: $\{c^w_{u,v}=^?0\}$. Until this work it was open whether this problem is in the polynomial hierarchy ${\sf PH}$. We prove that $\{c^w_{u,v}=^?0\}$ in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, the vanishing problem is in ${\Sigma_2^{{\text{p}}}}$. Our approach is based on constructions lifted formulations, which give polynomial systems of equations for the problem. The result follows from a reduction to Parametric Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, recently studied in arXiv:2408.13027. We apply our construction to show that the vanishing problem is in ${\sf NP}_{\mathbb{C}} \cap {\sf P}_{\mathbb{R}}$ in the Blum--Shub--Smale (BSS) model of computation over complex and real numbers respectively. Similarly, we prove that computing Schubert coefficients is in $\#{\sf P}_{\mathbb{C}}$, a counting version of the BSS model. We also extend our results to classical types. With one notable exception of the vanishing problem in type $D$, all our results extend to all types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the classification of isomorphism classes of Schubert varieties from complete flag varieties G/B to a class of partial flag varieties G/P. In particular, we classify all Schubert varieties in G/P where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup, and all Schubert surfaces which are two-dimensional Schubert varieties.</description>

      <title>Maximization of the first Laplace eigenvalue of a finite graph II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a length function on the set of edges of a finite graph, the corresponding Fujiwara Laplacian is defined. We consider a problem of maximizing the first nonzero eigenvalue of this graph Laplacian over all choices of edge-length function subject to a certain normalization. In this paper we prove that the supremum of the first nonzero eigenvalue is infinite whenever the graph contains a cycle.</description>

      <title>A bound for the cops and robber problem in terms of 2-component order connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the cops and robber game, there are multiple cops and a single robber taking turns moving along the edges of a graph. The goal of the cops is to capture the robber (move to the same vertex as the robber) and the goal of the robber is to avoid capture. The cop number of a given graph is the smallest number of cops required to ensure the capture of the robber. The k-component order connectivity of a graph G = (V, E) is the size of a smallest set U, such that all the connected components of the induced graph on V \ U are of size at most k. In this brief note, we provide a bound on the cop number of graphs in terms of their 2-component order connectivity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cactus group acts combinatorially on crystals via partial Sch\"utzenberger involutions. This action has been studied extensively in type $A$ and described via Bender-Knuth involutions. We prove an analogous result for the family of crystals $B(n\varpi_1)$ in type $D$. Our main tools are combinatorial toggles acting on reverse plane partitions of height $n$. As a corollary, we show that the length one and two subdiagram elements generate the full cactus action, addressing conjectures of Dranowski, the second author, Kamnitzer, and Morton-Ferguson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that there is a duality map between the superstable configurations and the critical configurations of a graph. This was extended to all M-matrices in (Guzm\`an-Klivans 2015). We show a natural way to extend this to all $(L,M)$-chip firing pairs introduced in (Guzm\`an-Klivans 2016). In addition, we study various properties of this map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heckman-Polychronakos operators form a prominent family of commuting differential-difference operators defined in terms of the Dunkl operators $\mathcal D_i$ as $\mathcal P_m= \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i \mathcal D_i)^m$. They have been known since 1990s in connection with trigonometric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland Hamiltonian and Jack symmetric polynomials. We explicitly compute the eigenvalues of these operators for symmetric and skew-symmetric eigenfunctions, as well as partial sums of eigenvalues for general polynomial eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the reciprocal and shifted quotient of the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p(n)$ denote the partition function. In this paper our main goal is to derive an asymptotic expansion up to order $N$ (for any fixed positive integer $N$) along with estimates for error bounds for the shifted quotient of the partition function, namely $p(n+k)/p(n)$ with $k\in \mathbb{N}$, which generalizes a result of Gomez, Males, and Rolen. In order to do so, we derive asymptotic expansions with error bounds for the shifted version $p(n+k)$ and the multiplicative inverse $1/p(n)$, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On series expansions of zeros of the deformed exponential function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $q \in (0, 1)$, the deformed exponential function $f(x) = \sum_{n \geq 1} x^n q^{n(n-1)/2}/n!$ is known to have infinitely many simple and negative zeros $\{x_k(q)\}_{k \geq 1}$. In this paper, we analyze the series expansions of $-x_k(q)/k$ and $k/x_k(q)$ in powers of $q$. We prove that the coefficients of these expansions are rational functions of the form $P_n(k)/Q_n(k)$ and $\widehat{P}_n(k)/Q_n(k)$, where $Q_n(k) \in {\mathbb Z}[k]$ is explicitly defined and the polynomials $P_n(k), \widehat{P}_n(k)\in {\mathbb Z}[k]$ can be computed recursively. We provide explicit formulas for the leading coefficients of $P_n(k)$ and $\widehat{P}_n(k)$ and compute the coefficients of these polynomials for $n \leq 300$. Numerical verification shows that $P_n(k)$ and $\widehat{P}_n(k)$ take non-negative values for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n\le 300$, offering further evidence in support of conjectures by Alan Sokal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work builds on our previous developments regarding a notion of freeness for tensors. We aim to establish a tensorial free convolution for compactly supported measures. First, we define higher-order analogues of the semicircular (or Wigner) law and the free Poisson (or Marcenko-Pastur) law, giving their moments and free cumulants. We prove the convergence of a Wishart-type tensor to the free Poisson law and recall the convergence of a Wigner tensor to the semicircular law. We also present a free Central Limit Theorem in this context. Next, we introduce a tensorial free convolution, define the $R$-transform, and provide the first examples of free convolution of measures.</description>

      <title>Bounding Radon numbers via Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.01677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove general topological Radon-type theorems for sets in $\mathbb R^d$ or on a surface. Combined with a recent result of Holmsen and Lee, we also obtain fractional Helly theorem, and consequently the existence of weak $\varepsilon$-nets as well as a $(p,q)$-theorem for those sets.
  More precisely, given a family $\mathcal F$ of subsets of $\mathbb R^d$, we will measure the homological complexity of $\mathcal F$ by the supremum of the first $\lceil d/2\rceil$ reduced Betti numbers of $\bigcap \mathcal G$ over all nonempty $\mathcal G \subseteq \mathcal F$. We show that if $\mathcal F$ has homological complexity at most $b$, the Radon number of $\mathcal F$ is bounded in terms of $b$ and $d$. In case that $\mathcal F$ lives on a surface and the number of connected components of $\bigcap \mathcal G$ is at most $b$ for any nonempty $\mathcal G \subseteq \mathcal F$, then the Radon number of $\mathcal F$ is bounded by a function depending only on $b$ and the surface itself.
  For surfaces, if we moreover assume the sets in $\mathcal F$ are open, we show that the fractional Helly number of $\mathcal F$ is linear in $b$. The improvement is based on a recent result of the author and Kalai. Specifically, for $b=1$ we get that the fractional Helly number is at most three, which is optimal. This case further leads to solving a conjecture of Holmsen, Kim, and Lee about an existence of a $(p,q)$-theorem for open subsets of a surface.</description>

      <title>New results on graph matching from degree preserving growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently introduced \emph{Degree Preserving Growth} model (Nature Physics, \DOI{10.1038/s41567-021-01417-7}) uses matchings to insert new vertices of prescribed degrees into the current graph of an ever-growing graph sequence. The process depends both on the size of the largest available matchings, which is our focus here, as well as on the actual choice of the matching.
  First we show that the question whether a graphic degree sequence, extended with a new degree $2\delta$ remains graphic is closely related to the available matchings in the realizations of the sequence. Namely we prove that the extension problem is equivalent to the existence of a realization of the original degree sequence with a matching of size $\delta$.
  Second we present lower bounds for the \emph{forcible matching number} of degree sequences. This number is the size of the maximum matchings in any realization of the degree sequence. We then study bounds on the size of maximal matchings in \emph{some} realizations of the sequence, known as the \emph{potential matching number}. We also estimate the minimum size of both the maximal and the maximum matchings, as determined by the degree sequence, independently of graphical realizations. Along this line we answer a question raised by Biedl, Demaine \emph{et al.} (\DOI{10.1016/j.disc.2004.05.003}).</description>

Abstract: We introduce posets of simple vertex labeled minors of graphs and a generalization to the level of polymatroids, collectively termed minor posets. We show that any minor poset is isomorphic to the face poset of a regular CW sphere, and in particular, is Eulerian. We establish cd-index inequalities induced by strong maps, a tight upper bound for cd-indices of minor posets and a tight lower bound for cd-indices of minor posets arising from lattices of maximal length.</description>

Abstract: A geodesic cover, also known as an isometric path cover, of a graph is a set of geodesics which cover the vertex set of the graph. An edge geodesic cover of a graph is a set of geodesics which cover the edge set of the graph. The geodesic (edge) cover number of a graph is the cardinality of a minimum (edge) geodesic cover. The (edge) geodesic cover problem of a graph is to find the (edge) geodesic cover number of the graph. Surprisingly, only partial solutions for these problems are available for most situations. In this paper we demonstrate that the geodesic cover number of the $r$-dimensional butterfly is $\lceil (2/3)2^r\rceil$ and that its edge geodesic cover number is $2^r$.</description>

Abstract: We show that if $K\ge1$ is a parameter and $S$ is a finite symmetric subset of a group containing the identity such $|S^{2n}|\le K|S^n|$ for some integer $n\ge2K^2$, then $|S^{3n}|\le\exp(\exp(O(K^2)))|S^n|$. Such a result was previously known only under the stronger assumption that $|S^{2n+1}|\le K|S^n|$. We prove similar results for locally compact groups and vertex-transitive graphs. We indicate some results in the structure theory of vertex-transitive graphs of polynomial growth whose hypotheses can be weakened as a result.</description>

      <title>Rigged Horse Numbers and their Modular Periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fubini numbers count the permutations of horse racing where ties are possible. The closely related $r$-horse numbers count the finishes of a horse race where some subset of $r$ horses agree to finish the race in a specific relative strong ordering. We express the $r$-Fubini numbers as a sum of $r$ index-shifted sequences of Fubini numbers weighted with the signed Stirling numbers of the first kind. We use a novel shift operator counting. Further, we demonstrate the eventual modular periodicity of $r$-Fubini numbers. Their maximum period is determined to be the Carmichael function of the modulus. The maximum period occurs in the case of an odd modulus for Fubini numbers.</description>

      <title>The multiplicity of eigenvalues of nonnegative weakly irreducible tensors and uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hu and Ye conjectured that for a $k$-th order and $n$-dimensional tensor $\mathcal{A}$ with an eigenvalue $\lambda$ and the corresponding eigenvariety $\mathcal{V}_\lambda(\mathcal{A})$, $$\mathrm{am}(\lambda) \ge \sum_{i=1}^\kappa \mathrm{dim}(V_i)(k-1)^{\mathrm{dim}(V_i)-1},$$ where $\mathrm{am}(\lambda)$ is the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda$, and $V_1,\ldots,V_\kappa$ are all irreducible components of $\mathcal{V}_\lambda(\mathcal{A})$. In this paper, we prove that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a nonnegative weakly irreducible tensor with spectral radius $\rho$, then $\mathrm{am}(\lambda) \ge |\mathbb{V}_\lambda(\mathcal{A})|$ for all eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $\mathcal{A}$ with modulus $\rho$, where $\mathbb{V}_\lambda(\mathcal{A})$ is the projective eigenvariety of $\mathcal{A}$ associated with $\lambda$. Consequently we confirm Hu-Ye's conjecture for the above eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $\mathcal{A}$ and also the least H-eigenvalue of a weakly irreducible $Z$-tensor. We prove several equality cases in Hu-Ye's conjecture for the eigenvalues of the adjacency tensor or Laplacian tensor of uniform hypergraphs.</description>

Abstract: We generalize a classical result by Boris Delaunay that introduced Delaunay triangulations. In particular, we prove that for a locally finite and coarsely dense generic point set $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, every generic point of $\mathbb{R}^d$ belongs to exactly $\binom{d+k}{d}$ simplices whose vertices belong to $A$ and whose circumspheres enclose exactly $k$ points of $A$. We extend this result to the cases in which the points are weighted, and when $A$ contains only finitely many points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ or in $\mathbb{S}^d$. Furthermore, we use the result to give a new geometric proof for the fact that volumes of hypersimplices are Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <title>Multisets with few special directions and small weight codewords in Desarguesian planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we tie together two well studied topics related to finite Desarguesian affine and projective planes. The first topic concerns directions determined by a set, or even a multiset, of points in an affine plane. The second topic concerns the linear code generated by the incidence matrix of a projective plane. We show how a multiset determining only $k$ special directions, in a modular sense, gives rise to a codeword whose support can be covered by $k$ concurrent lines. The reverse operation of going from a codeword to a multiset of points is trickier, but we describe a possible strategy and show some fruitful applications.
  Given a multiset of affine points, we use a bound on the degree of its so-called projection function to yield lower bounds on the number of special directions, both in an ordinary and in a modular sense.
  In the codes related to projective planes of prime order $p$, there exists an odd codeword, whose support is covered by 3 concurrent lines, but which is not a linear combination of these 3 lines. We generalise this codeword to codewords whose support is contained in an arbitrary number of concurrent lines. In case $p$ is large enough, this allows us to extend the classification of codewords from weight at most $4p-22$ to weight at most $5p-36$.</description>

      <title>Points below a parabola in affine planes of prime order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elements of a finite field of prime order canonically correspond to the integers in an interval. This induces an ordering on the elements of the field. Using this ordering, Kiss and Somlai recently proved interesting properties of the set of points below the diagonal line. In this paper, we investigate the set of points lying below a parabola. We prove that in some sense, this set of points looks the same from all but two directions, despite having only one non-trivial automorphism. In addition, we study the sizes of these sets, and their intersection numbers with respect to lines.</description>

      <title>On Singh and Barman's Conjecture on Hook Length Biases in $t$-Regular Partitions</title>

Abstract: Let $b_{t,k}(n)$ denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular partitions of $n$, where $t\geq 2$ and $k\geq 1$. Recently, Singh and Barman proved that $b_{3,2}(n)\geq b_{2,2}(n)$ for all $n\geq 4$. They also conjectured that $b_{t+1,2}(n)\geq b_{t,2}(n)$ for $t\geq 3$ and for all $n\geq 0$. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture is true for $t=3$.</description>

      <title>Color-avoiding percolation on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16086v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently introduced model of color-avoiding percolation defined as follows. Every edge in a graph $G$ is colored in some of $k\ge 2$ colors. Two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$ are said to be CA-connected if $u$ and $v$ may be connected using any subset of $k-1$ colors. CA-connectivity defines an equivalence relation on the vertex set of $G$ whose classes are called CA-components.
  We study the component structure of a randomly colored Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph of constant average degree. We distinguish three regimes for the size of the largest component: a supercritical regime, a so-called intermediate regime, and a subcritical regime, in which the largest CA-component has respectively linear, logarithmic, and bounded size. Interestingly, in the subcritical regime, the bound is deterministic and given by the number of colors.</description>

      <title>Hyperplane Arrangements in the Grassmannian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Euler characteristic of a very affine variety encodes the algebraic complexity of solving likelihood (or scattering) equations on this variety. We study this quantity for the Grassmannian with $d$ hyperplane sections removed. We provide a combinatorial formula, and explain how to compute this Euler characteristic in practice, both symbolically and numerically. Our particular focus is on generic hyperplane sections and on Schubert divisors. We also consider special Schubert arrangements relevant for physics. We study both the complex and the real case.</description>

      <title>Paired-domination Problem on Circle and $k$-polygon Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A vertex set $D \subseteq V$ is considered a dominating set of $G$ if every vertex in $V - D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. We called a dominating set $D$ as a paired-dominating set if the subgraph of $G$ induced by $D$ contains a perfect matching. In this paper, we show that determining the minimum paired-dominating set on circle graphs is NP-complete. We further propose an $O(n(\frac{n}{k^2-k})^{2k^2-2k})$-time algorithm for $k$-polygon graphs, a subclass of circle graphs, for finding the minimum paired-dominating set. Moreover, we extend our method to improve the algorithm for finding the minimum dominating set on $k$-polygon graphs in~[\emph{E.S.~Elmallah and L.K.~Stewart, Independence and domination in polygon graphs, Discrete Appl. Math., 1993}] and reduce their time-complexity from $O(n^{4k^2+3})$ to $O(n(\frac{n}{k^2-k})^{2k^2-4k})$.</description>
