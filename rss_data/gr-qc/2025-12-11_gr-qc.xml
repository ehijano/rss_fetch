      <title>Degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories in metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the metric-affine analogue of the quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. We begin with a general metric-affine scalar-tensor action that is linear in curvature and contains all operators that are at most quadratic in the covariant second derivatives of the scalar field, ensuring that the connection enters only through curvature and through these second derivatives. Solving the connection equation by performing a full decomposition of the distortion tensor gives a closed-form effective metric theory. Imposing the standard metric DHOST degeneracy conditions then selects a Palatini Class Ia branch that is fully determined by two free functions in the original action. Analyzing the tensor sector shows that requiring gravitational waves to propagate at the speed of light further restricts the theory to a one-function family. These results provide a detailed and self-contained characterization of the quadratic metric-affine Class Ia sector within this operator basis and identify the theoretical conditions implied by gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>About possible measures in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Possible measures for Quantum Gravity are considered. Choices that are invariant under diffeomorphisms are analyzed, but the possibility of employing non invariant measures is also taken into account. The last possibility may be accepted if the anomaly in the measure is compensated by counter term redefinitions of the model under analysis. Particular attention is paid to some concrete examples of non covariant looking measures, which may be useful for generalizing the Veltmann identities when quantizing around curved space times. The results are specified for the Stelle gravity model [1]-[2], which is known to be renormalizable in flat space, although not known to be so in curved ones.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Massive Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) are an important component of the massive black hole population of the early universe, and their formation and early mergers will be prominent in the data stream of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). However, the population and binary properties of these early black holes are poorly understood, with masses, mass ratios, spins, and orbital eccentricities strongly dependent on the details of their formation, and the properties of the remaining exterior material (baryonic and non-baryonic), which may be substantial to the point of merger.
  We report on initial work to simulate the formation, collapse, and/or merger of such DCBH regions in order to extract the resulting gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>Massless Majorana spinors in the Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that massive Majorana spinors \eqref{1.2} do not exist if they are $t$-dependent or $\phi$-dependent in Kerr, or Kerr-(A)dS spacetimes. For massless Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime, the Dirac equation can be separated into radial and angular equations, parameterized by two complex constants $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$. If at least one of $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$ is zero, massless Majorana spinors can be solved explicitly. If $\epsilon_1$, $\epsilon_2$ are nonzero, we prove the nonexistence of massless time-periodic Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime which are $L^p$ outside the event horizon for $ 0&lt;p\le\frac{6}{|\epsilon_1|+|\epsilon_2| +2}$. We then provide the Hamiltonian formulation for massless Majorana spinors and prove that the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian leads to the angular momentum $a=0$ and spacetime reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime, moreover, the massless Majorana spinor must be $\phi$-independent. Finally, we show that, in the Schwarzschild spacetime, for initial data with $L^2$ decay at infinity, the probability of the massless Majorana spinors to be in any compact region of space tends to zero as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing in a warm plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical studies of light bending in a dispersive medium near compact objects, e.g., black holes or neutron stars, are most challenged by a suitable definition of the medium. The most realistic model would be a hot magnetized plasma. In such a medium, however, an analytical description of light rays is very difficult. Therefore, usually an isotropic dispersive medium is assumed in analytical calculations. While it is possible to formulate equations for a general refractive index, which some studies do, most attention in the literature is given to the particular case of a cold, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma. Whereas this model covers many astrophysically relevant situations, there are indications that in some cases the plasma temperature is so high that the approximation of a cold plasma is no longer valid. For this reason, we consider in this paper a warm, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma, where the temperature is not set equal to zero but assumed to be small enough, such that relevant equations can be linearized with respect to it. After discussing the general equations for light rays in such a medium on a general-relativistic spacetime, we specify to the axially symmetric and stationary case which includes the spherically symmetric and static case. In particular, we calculate the influence of a warm plasma on the bending angle. In the spherically symmetric and static case, we also calculate the shadow in a warm plasma. We illustrate the general results with a static (respectively corotating) and an infalling warm plasma on Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Warm Inflation in a Braneworld Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature, many warm inflationary models are formulated. In this piece of work, a warm inflationary model in the braneworld scenario is studied, considering constant and variable dissipation coefficients. Performance of the model has been considered in both strong and weak dissipative regimes. We study the dynamics of this scenario under slow-roll approximation and estimate cosmological observables, viz., the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio. In order to constrain the parameters in our model, we consider data from Planck 2018 and BICEP.</description>

      <title>Dual Effective Field Theory formulation of Metric--Affine and Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified algebraic and effective field theory (EFT) formulation for non--Riemannian extensions of General Relativity with an independent connection. For metric--affine $f(R,Q)$ gravity we show that the connection equations admit an exact matrix solution, whose square--root structure generates a convergent binomial/Neumann expansion in powers of the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. For the Eddington--inspired Born--Infeld (EiBI) theory we show that the connection can be solved algebraically as well, and that its determinantal field equations produce a parallel Neumann expansion with coefficients fixed by the underlying determinant operator. This allows us to rewrite the Einstein--like equations in the auxiliary metric as an effective Einstein equation for $g_{\mu\nu}$ with a local algebraic correction $(\Delta T)_{\mu\nu}$ that follows from a dual EFT built from the invariants $\{T,\,T^2,\,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu},\ldots\}$, organised by a characteristic density scale. We prove a convergence criterion based on the spectral radius of $\hat T^\mu{}_\nu$ and interpret EiBI gravity as a determinantal resummation of the same $T$--tower. Extending the framework to symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, we identify the EFT coefficients in terms of $f_Q$ and $f_{QQ}$ and present a background matching for $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q^2$. The resulting dual EFT provides a common algebraic language for metric--affine, Born--Infeld and non--metricity gravities.</description>

      <title>Improving the inference of the stellar quantities using the extended $I$-Love-$Q$-$\delta M$ relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic Astrophysics the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations refer to approximately EoS-independent relations involving the moment of inertia, Love number, and quadrupole moment through some quantities that are normalised by the mass $M_0$ of the background configuration of the perturbative scheme. Since $M_0$ is not an observable quantity, this normalisation hinders the direct applicability of the relations. A common remedy assumes that $M_0$ coincides with the actual mass of the star $M_S$; however, this approximation is only adequate for very slow rotation (when the dimensionless spin parameter is $\chi_S&lt;0.1$). The more accurate alternative approach, based on the $I$-Love-$Q$-$\delta M$ set of relations, circumvents this limitation by enabling the inference of $M_0$. Here we review both approaches and provide numerical comparisons.</description>

      <title>Relativistic accretion process onto rotating black holes in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we uncover the accretion dynamics and oscillatory behavior around rotating black holes within the EEH nonlinear electrodynamic framework by analyzing both the motion of test particles and numerically solving the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations.</description>

      <title>Static Charged Polytropic Spheres with a Cosmological Constant: Physical Acceptability and Trapped Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider static charged fluid spheres with a cosmological constant. We assume a polytropic equation of state, $p \propto \rho^\Gamma$, and a power law charge distribution, $q\propto r^n$. Using this, we convert the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation into a differential equation for the mass profile. By solving this equation numerically, we analyse both physical and geometric properties of these charged fluid spheres for different values of $n$ and $\Gamma$. By imposing subluminal sound speeds and energy conditions, we restrict ourselves to configurations that are physically acceptable. Then, within these physical models, we study internal trapping of circular geodesics and find the trapping regions in the $n$-$\Gamma$ parameter space. Going beyond the traditionally studied case of null geodesics, we consider orbits of charged and/or massive particles. We show that for neutral null particles (and only for them), their trapping depends purely on the properties of the space-time. In the other three cases, properties such as the particle's own charge and/or energy also play a role. In general, we find that trapping of all types of particles is allowed for a broad range of $n$ and $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Light trajectories and optical appearances in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild and black string space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) imaging of the central objects in the M87 and Milky Way galaxies provide compelling evidence that these objects are consistent with (Kerr) black holes. In view of these observations and the future expectations of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) on which the EHT observations are based, an intensive research work has been carried out in the literature to simulating light trajectories and reconstructing the corresponding optical appearance for a wide array of modified black holes and ultra-compact objects. The corresponding images are directly affected not only by the background space-time geometry but also by the physics of the accretion disk, whose combination yields a characteristic fingerprint. In this paper, we consider such a fingerprint for objects which are not asymptotically flat but instead approach a Anti-de Sitter space-time. This assumption significantly influences light trajectories and, consequently, the corresponding images of the objects as seen by an observer at some distance, which can be used in future VLBI observations for testing alternatives of this kind to the Kerr paradigm. We illustrate our considerations with the examples of a Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole and a black string, discussing their most notable departures from canonical, asymptotically-flat black hole space-times.</description>

      <title>From Asymptotically Flat Gravity to Finite Causal Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the phase space of the soft sector of asymptotically flat gravity in four spacetime dimensions can be identified with that of a spherically symmetric finite casual diamond in Minkowski spacetime. The leading soft graviton mode is identified with the radial fluctuation of the causal diamond size, while the Goldstone mode involves both the radial fluctuation and its symplectic partner. This allows us to relate the radial fluctuations of the causal diamond with the asymptotic transverse fluctuations parametrized by the soft modes.</description>

      <title>Notes On de-Sitter Mellin Barnes Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we create a Mellin space method for boundary correlation functions in de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. We demonstrate that the analytic continuation between AdS${}_{d+1}$ and dS${}_{d+1}$ is encoded in a set of simple relative phases using the Mellin-Barnes representation of correlators. It helps us to determine the scalar three-point and four-point functions and their corresponding Mellin-Barnes amplitudes in dS${}_{d+1}$ space using the known results from AdS${}_{d+1}$ space. The Mellin-Barnes representation reveals the analytic structure of boundary correlation functions over all $d$ and scaling dimensions. In the present discussion, the {\it split representation} have been used as an instrumental technique in particularly the evaluation of bulk Witten diagrams and is suitable to obtain the {\it Conformal Partial Wave decomposition} of tree-level exchange in the bulk Witten diagrams. The equivalent adjustment to the cosmological three-point and four-point function of generic external scalars may be further extracted from these results, assuming the weak breakdown of the de Sitter isometries. These findings offer a step towards a more methodical comprehension of de Sitter observables utilising Mellin space techniques at the tree level and beyond.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases.
  Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization--group and effective--action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics.
  A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity- motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically propose an experimentally viable scheme to explore the transfer of nonclassical correlations from a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to a pair of impurities immersed in it. Operating at ultra-low temperature, density fluctuations of the dipolar BEC emulate a vacuum field with Lorentz-violating dispersion, while the two impurities function as Unruh-DeWitt detectors for the BEC quasiparticles. We study the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum of this analogue Lorentz-violating quantum field by spatially separated Unruh-DeWitt detectors. Our analysis reveals key parameter dependencies that optimize the harvesting of entanglement. In particular, unlike the Lorentz-invariant case, smoother detector switchings does not enhance the entanglement harvesting efficiency from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum. Moreover, the strength of the Lorentz-invariant violation can shift the optimal energy structure of the detectors for harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum-a clear deviation from the Lorentz-invariant scenario. As a fundamental quantum mechanical setup, our quantum fluid platform provides an experimentally realizable testbed for examining the entanglement harvesting protocol from an effective Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum using a pair of impurity probers, which may also has potential implications for exploring the Lorentz-invariant violation in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Bimetric MOND as a framework for variable-$G$ theories -- local systems and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bimetric MOND (BIMOND) is used as a platform for variable-$G$ theories that have MOND-specific idiosyncrasies. E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\approx 2\pi G$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\approx 2\pi\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e&gt; G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era.</description>

      <title>Island of acoustic black hole in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an analogue information paradox in acoustic black holes which are emerged from the superfluid surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole. The resulting acoustic black hole contains both acoustic horizons and optical horizon, with analogue Hawking radiation, i.e. phonons, emitted from the outer acoustic horizon. By using the island formula, we calculate the entanglement entropy of analogue Hawking radiation of the acoustic black hole in both non-extremal and extremal cases. In the non-extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons follow the Page curve due to the emergence of islands, and it is approximately proportional to the area of the acoustic horizon at late time. While in the extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons diverges, leading to an ill-defined Page time. Our study verifies the unitarity of the analogue gravity system, and provides further insight into the connection between the entanglement entropy and the causal structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Spatial Curvature and Dark Energy Dynamics in the $w$CDM Model from DESI DR1 and DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the $w$CDM dynamical dark energy model with spatial curvature utilizing the recently released DESI Collaboration data (DR1 and DR2) in conjunction with other observational probes such as BBN, Observational Hubble Data (OHD), and Pantheon Plus (PP). Our investigation attempts to discover which DESI dataset gives a better match to the $w$CDM framework and assess the impact of spatial curvature on cosmological constraints. We find that the cosmic curvature parameter, $\Omega_k$, disfavors the cosmological constant for the DR2+BBN and DR2+BBN+OHD data combinations. However, the deviation from the cosmological constant remains below the $1\sigma$ level, indicating a mild preference for a open universe. In contrast, when using the DR1 based combinations namely DR1+BBN and DR1+BBN+OHD-the deviation from the cosmological constant increases to approximately $1.2\sigma$, suggesting a slightly stronger indication of a open geometry. Also, the best-fit values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) obtained from the DR1+BBN+OHD+PP and DR2+BBN+OHD+PP combinations within the dynamical dark energy model are consistent with the results reported by the Planck Collaboration. Our findings provide constraints on the dark energy EoS parameter $ w_{\mathrm{}0}$, reveal a mild but notable deviation from the vacuum energy ($w = -1$) scenario at a significance level $1.8\sigma$ from DR2+BBN+OHD+PP and $0.5\sigma$ from DR1+BBN+OHD+PP, both favoring the quintessence region of dark energy. Furthermore, the key physical distance measures $D_H$, $D_V$, and $D_M$ show better consistency with our model when analyzed with the DR2 data.</description>

      <title>The impact of AGN environmental effects on testing general relativity with space-borne gravitational wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09635v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as TianQin offers a new window to test General Relativity by observing the early inspiral phase of stellar-mass binary black holes. A key concern arises if these stellar-mass binary black holes reside in gaseous environments such as active galactic nucleus accretion disks, where environmental effects imprint detectable modulations on the gravita- tional waveform. Using Bayesian inference on simulated signals containing both environmental and dipole deviation, we have assessed the extent to which the presence of environmental effects affects the detectability of dipole radiation. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of strong environmental coupling, the dipole parameter can be recovered with high precision, and the evidence for dipole radiation remains distinguishable. Crucially, we find that the existence of environmental effects does not fundamentally impede the identification of dipole radiation, provided both effects are simultaneously modelled in the inference process. This study establishes that future tests of modified gravity with space-borne observatories can remain robust even for sources in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Correlations of Simulated Black-Hole Movies Reveal Extreme-Lensing Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A black hole's gravitational pull can deflect light rays to an arbitrary degree. As a result, any source fluctuation near the black hole creates multiple lagged images on an observer's screen. For optically thin stochastic emission, these light echoes give rise to correlations of brightness fluctuations across time-dependent images (movies). The correlation pattern disentangles source-specific characteristics from universal features dictated by general relativity. This picture has motivated a proposal to use the two-point image correlation function as a probe of extreme gravitational lensing in upcoming black-hole imaging campaigns. In this work, we test the feasibility of this method by computing the two-point correlation function of brightness fluctuations in a black-hole movie of state-of-the-art realism. The movie is generated by ray tracing a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, which can then be blurred to any angular resolution. At an effective resolution expected to be achieved by next-generation terrestrial very-long-baseline interferometric arrays, the lensing signatures appear in neither time-averaged images nor light-curve autocorrelations. However, we demonstrate that they are clearly visible in the more fine-grained two-point image correlation function. Our positive findings motivate a more comprehensive investigation into the instrument specifications and inference techniques needed to resolve extreme lensing effects through correlations.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. Review of forecast constraints on dark energy and modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euclid mission has been designed to provide, as one of its main deliverables, information on the nature of the gravitational interaction, which determines the expansion of the Universe and the formation of structures. Thus, Euclid has the potential to test deviations from general relativity that will allow us to shed light on long-lasting problems in the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Euclid will mainly do this by using two complementary probes: weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. In this paper we review pre-launch Euclid analyses for dark energy and modified gravity. These include forecast constraints with future Euclid data on cosmological parameters for different cosmological models, such as a time-varying dark energy component, phenomenological modifications of the perturbation sector and specific modified gravity models, with further extensions that include neutrino physics and the coupling to the electromagnetic sector through the fine-structure constant. We review the study of the impact of nonlinear clustering methods on beyond-$\Lambda$CDM constraints with Euclid. This is of fundamental importance to efficiently predict the large-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos, given that we will have access to a wealth of information on scales beyond the linear regime. We inspect the extension of theoretical predictions for observable quantities in alternative cosmologies to $\Lambda$CDM at fully nonlinear scales by means of $N$-body simulations. We discuss the impact of relativistic corrections in extended cosmological models. Overall, this review highlights the significant potential of the Euclid mission to tightly constrain parameters of dark energy and modified gravity models, or perhaps to detect possible signatures of a $\Lambda$CDM failure.</description>

      <title>Adding electromagnetic birefringence to pulsar timing and astrometry to detect gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that the time variation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves from pulsars can be used, in cross-correlation with pulsar timing, to probe the chirality of an isotropic gravitational wave background. Here, we show that the expression for the cross-correlation is derived efficiently with the total-angular-momentum formalism and use this framework to extend the formulation to cross-correlation with astrometry. We do so for spin-1 gravitational waves (that may arise in alternative-gravity theories) as well as the general-relativistic spin-2 gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Beyond Two Parameters: Revisiting Dark Energy with the Latest Cosmic Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark energy (DE) models with many free parameters are often considered excessive, as constraining all parameters poses a significant challenge. On the other hand, such models offer greater flexibility to probe the DE sector in more detail. With the rapid advancement of astronomical surveys and the availability of diverse datasets, it is timely to examine whether current combined observations can effectively constrain an extended parameter space in DE models. This article investigates a four-parameter dynamical dark energy (DDE) model that spans a broad region of the universe's expansion history through four key parameters: the present-day value of the DE equation of state ($w_0$), its initial value ($w_m$), the scale factor depicting transition from $w_m$ to $w_0$ occurs ($a_t$), and the steepness of this transition ($\Delta_{\rm de}$). We constrain the model using CMB data from Planck, BAO from DESI DR2, and three distinct compilations of Type Ia Supernovae: PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3. Our results show that constraining all four parameters remains difficult: $a_t$ is not constrained by any dataset, while the remaining three parameters can be constrained only when all observational probes are combined (with the exception of DESY5). The results further show that DE has a quintessential nature at present ($w_0 &gt; -1$), while $w_m$ is negative, indicating a phantom-like behaviour at early times. Interestingly, despite its larger parameter space, the proposed DDE model is preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, based on both $\Delta\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence, for certain combined datasets, particularly CMB+BAO+DESY5 and CMB+BAO+Union3.</description>

      <title>GFH-v2 Pipeline for Searches of Long-Transient Gravitational Waves from Newborn Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced methodology for searching long transient gravitational waves associated with a newborn magnetar using a strongly improved version of the generalized Frequency Hough Transform algorithm, called GFH-v2. We describe the main developments introduced relative to the original implementation and outline the optimized parameter-space selection used in the search. We then compute the theoretical sensitivity of the method and compare it with an empirical sensitivity estimate obtained by injecting simulated signals into LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a data. The updated framework achieves improved sensitivity and computational performance. These results provide a robust basis for future directed searches for long-transient gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae and other transient events in current and upcoming observing runs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the string-theory inspired Einstein-Maxwell-Maxwell-dilaton theory (EMMD) and show that we can derive the complete set of thermodynamic quantities of charged black holes, without having to solve for the black hole solutions. We argue that the technique can be applied more broadly to string theories, providing an accessible method for determining the thermodynamic properties of large classes of black holes for which exact solutions are typically unavailable.</description>

      <title>Ekpyrosis in Quantum Gravitational Anisotropic Bouncing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the isotropization of a model anisotropic universe in the bouncing models using the ekpyrotic potential without assuming initial conditions corresponding to an ekpyrotic phase. In particular, we explore the way the use of ekpyrotic potentials may dynamically help isotropization for the considered initial conditions corresponding to the macroscopic classical contracting universe with potentially large anisotropies. As an example of a concrete nonsingular bouncing mechanism, we consider the effective description of loop quantum cosmology for Bianchi-I and Bianchi-IX spacetimes for ekpyrotic and ekpyrotic-like potentials. Considering two different values of potential parameters and initial conditions corresponding to a classical macroscopic universe, we show that for both of these spacetimes, the cosmological singularity is resolved via multiple short-duration nonsingular bounces caused by quantum gravitational effects. We perform a large number of numerical simulations for a wide range of initial conditions which do not favor ekpyrosis initially. Even with such unfavorable initial conditions, we show that the relative strength of the anisotropies at the end of the bounce regime is noticeably reduced in more than 90% of the simulations. This provides a strong evidence for the isotropization ability of the ekpyrotic potentials. We find that isotropization can occur over cycles of rapid nonsingular bounces in the Planck regime via enhancement of the contribution of the (isotropic) energy density relative to the anisotropies at the bounces. Achieving isotropization is found to be easier in Bianchi-I spacetimes when compared to Bianchi-IX spacetimes. Our results demonstrate that, even with initial conditions which are not most favorable for the existence of ekpyrosis, an effective isotropization can occur in nonsingular anisotropic models with ekpyrotic and ekpyrotic-like potentials.</description>

Abstract: DECIGO (DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) is a space-based gravitational wave antenna concept targeting the 0.1-10 Hz band. It consists of three spacecraft arranged in an equilateral triangle with 1,000 km sides, forming Fabry-P\'erot cavities between them. A precursor mission, B-DECIGO, is also planned, featuring a smaller 100 km triangle. Operating these cavities requires ultra-precise formation flying, where inter-mirror distance and alignment must be precisely controlled. Achieving this necessitates a sequential improvement in precision using various sensors and actuators, from the deployment of the spacecraft to laser link acquisition and ultimately to the control of the Fabry-P\'erot cavities to maintain resonance. In this paper, we derive the precision requirements at each stage and discuss the feasibility of achieving them. We show that the relative speed between cavity mirrors must be controlled at the sub-micrometer-per-second level and that relative alignment must be maintained at the sub-microradian level to obtain control signals from the Fabry-P\'erot cavities of DECIGO and B-DECIGO.</description>

Abstract: Using a model-independent analysis method which bases on the Lagrange mean value theorem for obtaining the derivative of the Hubble function, we analyze $H(z)$ parameter data with some restrictive conditions. We find that: (a) the Universe may experience an accelerated expansion with a confidence level greater than 5 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{101}\in (0, 0.36)$ and greater than 1.9 $\sigma$ at redshifts $z_{3835}\in (1.3, 1.53)$ and $z_{3836}\in (1.43, 1.53)$, where $z_j&lt;z_{ij}&lt;z_i$ and $i$ marks the $i$-th Hubble parameter data we consider; (b) the Universe may experience a decelerated expansion with a confidence level greater than 1.5 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{2012}\in (0.40, 0.52)$; (c) $w_{\rm{x}}\leq w_{\rm{t}}&lt;-1$ with confidence level great than 1.6 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{3836}\in (1.43, 1.53)$. These results indicate that the evolution of dark energy may be oscillatory.</description>

      <title>Highly accurate simulations of asymmetric black-hole scattering and cross validation of effective-one-body models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a gauge-invariant approach to exploring strong-field gravitational interactions in two-body systems, which can subsequently inform waveform models for bound orbits. In this work, we present 60 new highly accurate numerical relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). Our simulations include 14 spin-aligned configurations, as well as 16 configurations with unequal masses, up to a mass ratio of 10. We perform the first direct comparison of scattering angles computed using different NR codes, finding good agreement. We compare our NR scattering angle results to the post-Minkowskian (PM)-based effective-one-body (EOB) closed-form models SEOB-PM and $w_{\rm EOB}$, finding less than 5% deviation except near the scatter-capture separatrix. Comparisons with the post-Newtonian-based EOB evolution models SEOBNRv5 and TEOBResumS-Dal\'{i} reveal that the former agrees within 8% accuracy with non-spinning NR results across most parameter ranges, whereas the latter matches similarly at lower energies but diverges significantly at higher energies. Both evolution EOB models exhibit increased deviations for spinning systems, predicting a notably different location of the capture separatrix compared to NR. Our key result is the first measurement of disparate scattering angles from NR simulations due to asymmetric gravitational-wave emission. We compare these results to SEOB-PM models constructed to calculate the scattering angle of a single black hole in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Large scale structure constraints and matter power spectrum in $f (Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we take into account the dynamical system analysis to investigate the matter power spectrum within the framework of the $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravitational theory. After obtaining autonomous dynamical system variables for two different particular pedagogical choices of $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ models (A and B), we derive the full system of perturbation equations using the $1+3$ covariant formalism to study the matter fluctuations. We present and solve the energy density perturbation equations to obtain the energy density contrast, which decays with redshift for both models for a particular choice of model parameters. After obtaining the numerical results of the density contrast, we computed the matter spectra for each model and conducted a comparative analysis with the $\Lambda$CDM. Furthermore, by employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis,the model parameters were constrained using a combination of different observational data sets to improve the robustness and accuracy of the parameter estimation. Our results indicate that only model A can be compatible with the considered observational data sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current models of quantum interference experiments in external gravitational fields lack a common framework: while matter-wave interferometers are commonly described using the Schr\"odinger equation with a Newtonian potential, gravitational effects in quantum optics are modeled using either post-Newtonian metrics or highly symmetric exact solutions to Einstein's field equations such as those of Schwarzschild and Kerr. To coherently describe both kinds of experiments, this paper develops a unified framework for modeling quantum interferometers in general stationary space-times. This model provides a rigorous description and coherent interpretation of the effects of classical gravity on quantum probes.</description>

      <title>First-Order Viscous Relativistic Hydrodynamics on the Two-Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A few years ago, Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) formulated the first causal, stable, strongly hyperbolic, and locally well-posed theory of first-order viscous relativistic hydrodynamics. Since their inception, there have been several numerical and analytic studies of the BDNK equations which have revealed their promise in modeling relativistic flows when viscous, first-order corrections to ideal hydrodynamics are important. In this paper, we present numerical solutions to the BDNK equations for a $4$D conformal fluid in Minkowski spacetime constrained to the surface of a geometric sphere. We numerically solve the underlying equations of motion by use of finite difference methods applied in cubed-sphere coordinates -- a multi-block grid structure which regularly and continuously covers the surface of a sphere. We present three test cases of our code: linearized fluid perturbations of equilibrium states, a smooth, stationary initial Gaussian pulse of energy density, and Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable initial data. In the Gaussian test case with sufficiently large entropy-normalized shear viscosity, the flow, though initialized in equilibrium, dynamically diverges away from equilibrium and the regime of validity of first-order hydrodynamics as very steep gradients form in the solution, causing convergence to be lost in the numerical simulation. This behavior persists at all grid resolutions we have considered, and also occurs at much higher resolutions in simulations of planar-symmetric ($1+1$)D conformal flows. These solutions provide numerical evidence that singularities in solutions to the BDNK equations can form in finite time from smooth initial data. The numerical methods we employ on the two-sphere can be readily extended to include variations in the radial direction, allowing for full ($3+1$)D simulations of the BDNK equations in astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Bayesian power spectral density estimation for LISA noise based on P-splines with a parametric boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexible and accurate noise characterization is crucial for the precise estimation of gravitational-wave parameters. We introduce a Bayesian method for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of long, stationary time series, explicitly tailored for LISA data analysis. Our approach models the PSD as the geometric mean of a parametric and a nonparametric component, combining the knowledge from parametric models with the flexibility to capture deviations from theoretical expectations. The nonparametric component is expressed by a mixture of penalized B-splines. Adaptive, data-driven knot placement, performed once at initialization, removes the need for reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, while hierarchical roughness-penalty priors prevent overfitting. Validation on simulated autoregressive AR(4) data demonstrates estimator consistency and shows that well-matched parametric components reduce the integrated absolute error compared to an uninformative baseline, requiring fewer spline knots to achieve comparable accuracy. Applied to one year of simulated LISA X-channel (univariate) noise, our method achieves relative integrated absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$, making it suitable for iterative analysis pipelines and multi-year mission data sets.</description>

      <title>Photon counting readout for detection and inference of gravitational waves from neutron star merger remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted after neutron star binary coalescences and the information they carry about dense matter are a high-priority target for next-generation detectors. Even though such detectors are expected to observe millions of signals, detectable post-merger emission will remain rare. In this work, we explore post-merger detectability and inference through an alternative detector readout scheme for data dominated by quantum-noise, which is the case above $1$\,kHz: photon-counting. In such a readout, signals and noise become quantized into discrete distributions corresponding to the detection of single photons measured in a chosen basis of modes. Through simulated data, we demonstrate that photon counting can be efficient even for weak signals. We find ${\sim}1$ in 100 signals with a post-merger signal-to-noise ratio of 0.2 can result in a single photon and thus be detected. Furthermore, after $2\times10^4$ signals -- equivalent to $10^{-2}$ to $1.5$ years of observation -- photon counting results in a twofold improvement in the measurement of the radius of a $1.6\,M_\odot$ neutron star. Constraints can be further tightened if the detector classical noise is reduced. Photon counting offers a promising alternative to traditional homodyne readout techniques for extracting information from low signal-to-noise ratio post-merger signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic nature of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a clean method for comparing different approaches for modeling the two-body problem in general relativity. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code, to explore the self-force and post-Minkowskian expansions of the scattering angle. First, we use a set of unequal-mass simulations to extract the self-force contributions to the scattering angle. Our main result is that using information up to second-order in the symmetric mass ratio (2SF) reproduces numerical relativity within the error bars across the full range of mass-ratios, including equal mass. Next, we compare our numerical relativity results to state-of-the-art post-Minkowskian predictions at larger impact parameters than previously explored. We find good agreement in the weak-field regime and discuss the relative importance of higher-order terms.</description>

Abstract: By using the heat kernel method, we construct diffeomorphism-covariant coherent states for the $SU(3)$ gauge group. We numerically demonstrate that these states exhibit the required semiclassical properties in the semiclassical limit: the peakedness property of the probability distribution and the peakedness property of the overlap function. We also provide the leading order term of the overlap amplitude in the combined limit where $t \rightarrow 0$ and $g\rightarrow g'$. This work provides the essential tool for deriving effective dynamics for $SU(3)$ gauge fields coupled to gravity via a coherent state path integral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit an analytical approximation scheme for computing nonlinearity ratios involving quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs). We compute these ratios for the general case when the QQNM is not one of the linear QNMs, for the $(l,m)$ channel $(2,2) \times (2,2) \to (4,4)$. We find an excellent match with numerical simulations. We also discuss where and why the method can fail, for example, for the channel $(2,0) \times (2,0) \to (2,0)$ where we can only get crude estimates for the nonlinearity ratio. Motivated by recent studies on nonlinear ringdown at the horizon, we also compute the nonlinearity ratios at the horizon. We find that the ratio both at the horizon and infinity is insensitive to different choices of regularization of the source term in the second order perturbations. We also discuss amplitudes of QQNMs sourced by linear overtones. Finally, we discuss the issues that must be resolved within this method to do precision analysis of nonlinear ringdown.</description>

      <title>The Unconditional Spacetime Penrose Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the unconditional spacetime Penrose inequality for three-dimensional asymptotically flat initial data sets satisfying the dominant energy condition. The result is unconditional in the sense that no additional geometric restrictions are imposed on the trapped surface -- it may be unstable, non-outermost, disconnected, or of arbitrary topology. Equality holds if and only if the data embeds isometrically into a slice of the Schwarzschild spacetime.
  The Penrose inequality, conjectured by Roger Penrose in 1973 as a strengthening of the positive mass theorem, has remained one of the central open problems in mathematical general relativity. While the Riemannian case (time-symmetric data) was resolved by Huisken--Ilmanen and Bray around 2001, the general spacetime case has resisted proof for over fifty years.
  Our approach synthesizes the generalized Jang equation of Bray--Khuri and Han--Khuri with the p-harmonic level set method of Agostiniani--Mazzieri--Oronzio. We establish mean curvature jump positivity at stable marginally outer trapped surfaces, the conformal factor bound via divergence identities, justification of the double limit using Mosco convergence, and extension to borderline decay via the harmonic coordinate approach of Bartnik--Chrusciel.</description>

      <title>Analytical Study for Primordial Non-Gaussianity in the gravity 4D Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An inflationary model can be constrained by non-gaussian statistics as a parameter in the LSS (Large Scale Structure) distribution, and in the radiation of CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) fluctuating temperature. Data on the CMB from Planck Collaboration provide up-to-date constraints on the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity in certain inflationary models, thus supporting or not supporting the model. Setting the non-Gaussianity parameter investigated in this study can be a reference whether or not it is a good parameter in constraining cosmological inflation models. This study attempts to examine the non-Gaussianity of the 3+1-dimensional 4DEGB gravitational cosmological inflation model starting from random field statistics. The non-Gaussian signature generated by the model is quantified, and the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity are constrained using data observation of Planck Collaboration. The method used in investigating non-Gaussianity is the in-in formalism, applied after obtaining the 3-point of $\zeta$ (curvature perturbation) terms of the perturbation expansion to the third order. The 3-point correlation function helps to create a bispectrum used to investigate the non-gaussinity of the inflation model. The results of this study show that the model tested is the slow roll pressed in the squeezed limit, because it witnesses a dominant local shape function. It has such as the non-gaussianity possessed by the single scalar field inflation as confirmation that Gauss-Bonnet term within Einstein-Hilbert action is topologically invariant in $D&lt;5$ spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional Euclidean and non-Euclidean structures in planar circuit quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.08854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a recent proposal for simulating planar hyperbolic lattices with circuit quantum electrodynamics can be extended to accommodate also higher dimensional lattices in Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces if one allows for circuits with more than three polygons at each vertex. The quantum dynamics of these circuits, which can be constructed with present-day technology, are governed by effective tight-binding Hamiltonians corresponding to higher-dimensional Kagom\'{e}-like structures ($n$-dimensional zeolites), which are well known to exhibit strong frustration and flat bands. We analyze the relevant spectra of these systems and derive an exact expression for the fraction of flat-band states. Our results expand considerably the range of non-Euclidean geometry realizations with circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Complementarity and ER/EPR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that wormholes must be entangled regardless of asymptotic boundary conditions. Assuming black hole complementarity, we argue that traversable wormholes instantiate entanglement-assisted quantum channels and that this entanglement must be present between the stretched horizons as an initial condition prior to traversability. This result demonstrates the forward direction of the ER/EPR conjectures.</description>

      <title>Comments on the de Sitter Double Cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the double cone geometry proposed by Saad, Shenker, and Stanford in de Sitter space. We demonstrate that with the inclusion of static patch observers, the double cone leads to a linear ramp consistent with random matrix behavior. This ramp arises from the relative time shift between two clocks located in opposite static patches.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Decoherence via Modified Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the effect of quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillations. We adopt a phenomenological approach that allows us to parametrize the energy dependence of the decoherence effects resulting from the modification of the neutrino dispersion relation. Using the open quantum system framework we derive decoherence parameters, which are usually connected to quantum gravitational effects. Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of decoherence on high-energy astrophysical neutrinos among all possible initial source compositions. We find that variation in the flux composition at neutrino telescopes can be a good probe to test such effects. Additionally, we show that a simple extension with heavy sterile neutrino decoherence produces verifiable signatures.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m\,s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m\,s$^{-2}$ representing $&gt;3.7\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton. Moreover, the inferred orbital true anomalies clearly favor modified gravity over Newton with the difference of Bayesian information criterion $&gt;10$. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring and testing gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>Geometric Symmetries for the Vanishing of the Black Hole Tidal Love Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified geometric perspective on the symmetries underlying the spin 0, 1 and 2 static perturbations around a Schwarzschild black hole. In all cases, the symmetries are exact, each forming an SO(3,1) group. They can be formulated at the level of the action, provided the appropriate field variables are chosen. For spin 1 and 2, the convenient variables are certain combinations of the gauge fields for even perturbations, and dual scalars for odd perturbations. The even and odd sector each has its own SO(3,1) symmetry. In addition, there is an SO(2) symmetry connecting them, furnishing an economical description of Chandrasekhar's duality. When decomposed in spherical harmonics, the perturbations form a non-trivial representation of SO(3,1), giving rise to ladder symmetries which explain the vanishing of the tidal Love numbers. Our work builds on earlier discussions of ladder symmetries, which were formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar at the level of the Teukolsky equation. Our formulation makes it possible to state the symmetries responsible for the vanishing of the Wilson coefficients characterizing the spin 0, 1 and 2 static tidal response, in the effective point particle description of a black hole.</description>

      <title>The frame-dragging vector potential on galaxy scales from DM-only Newtonian $N$-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effects of General Relativity are usually neglected in the non-linear evolution of structures, where Newtonian $N$-body simulations are traditionally employed. In the post-Friedmann expansion framework, a weak-field relativistic approximation purpose-built for cosmology, a frame-dragging gravito-magnetic vector potential arises at leading order, sourced by momentum currents, contributing to the metric even if the dynamics of matter fields at this order is Newtonian, and can thus be extracted from $N$-body simulations. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator code on the IllustrisTNG simulations, here we extend previous work in order to compute the power spectrum of this vector potential down to galactic scales. The magnitude of the vector potential is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by perturbation theory, and is a $1\% \sim 0.1\%$ effect compared to the non-linear Newtonian scalar gravitational potential. In the red-shift range considered here, the gravito-magnetic effect remains subdominant, without showing any enhancement during a particular phase in the evolution of structures, aside from the continuous growth of non-linearity at low redshift. Although this seems to suggest that, within the $\Lambda$CDM model, no significant gravito-magnetic effects contribute to the non-linear evolution of cosmic structures, i.e. to the dynamics of massive particles, possible observational consequences, e.g. in lensing, deserve further exploration.</description>
