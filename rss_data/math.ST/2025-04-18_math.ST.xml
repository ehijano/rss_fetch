      <title>Interpreting Network Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do we interpret the differential privacy (DP) guarantee for network data? We take a deep dive into a popular form of network DP ($\varepsilon$--edge DP) to find that many of its common interpretations are flawed. Drawing on prior work for privacy with correlated data, we interpret DP through the lens of adversarial hypothesis testing and demonstrate a gap between the pairs of hypotheses actually protected under DP (tests of complete networks) and the sorts of hypotheses implied to be protected by common claims (tests of individual edges). We demonstrate some conditions under which this gap can be bridged, while leaving some questions open. While some discussion is specific to edge DP, we offer selected results in terms of abstract DP definitions and provide discussion of the implications for other forms of network DP.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage priors for circulant correlation structure models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a new statistical model called the circulant correlation structure model, which is a multivariate Gaussian model with unknown covariance matrix and has a scale-invariance property. We construct shrinkage priors for the circulant correlation structure models and show that Bayesian predictive densities based on those priors asymptotically dominate Bayesian predictive densities based on Jeffreys priors under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk function. While shrinkage of eigenvalues of covariance matrices of Gaussian models has been successful, the proposed priors shrink a non-eigenvalue part of covariance matrices.</description>

      <title>On a new PGDUS transformed model using Inverse Weibull distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Power Generalized DUS (PGDUS) Transformation is significant in reliability theory, especially for analyzing parallel systems. From the Generalized Extreme Value distribution, Inverse Weibull model particularly has wide applicability in statistics and reliability theory. In this paper we consider PGDUS transformation of Inverse Weibull distribution. The basic statistical characteristics of the new model are derived, and unknown parameters are estimated using Maximum likelihood and Maximum product of spacings methods. Simulation analysis and the reliability parameter P(T2 &lt; T1) are explored. The effectiveness of the model in fitting a real-world dataset is demonstrated, showing better performance compared to other competing distributions.</description>

      <title>On perfect sampling: ROCFTP with Metropolis-multishift coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ROCFTP is a perfect sampling algorithm that employs various random operations, and requiring a specific Markov chain construction for each target. To overcome this requirement, the Metropolis algorithm is incorporated as a random operation within ROCFTP. While the Metropolis sampler functions as a random operation, it isn't a coupler. However, by employing normal multishift coupler as a symmetric proposal for Metropolis, we obtain ROCFTP with Metropolis-multishift. Initially designed for bounded state spaces, ROCFTP's applicability to targets with unbounded state spaces is extended through the introduction of the Most Interest Range (MIR) for practical use. It was demonstrated that selecting MIR decreases the likelihood of ROCFTP hitting $MIR^C$ by a factor of (1 - {\epsilon}), which is beneficial for practical implementation. The algorithm exhibits a convergence rate characterized by exponential decay. Its performance is rigorously evaluated across various targets, and tests ensure its goodness of fit. Lastly, an R package is provided for generating exact samples using ROCFTP Metropolis-multishift.</description>

      <title>Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating between two classical channels. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.</description>

      <title>Spatial Confidence Regions for Excursion Sets with False Discovery Rate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying areas where the signal is prominent is an important task in image analysis, with particular applications in brain mapping. In this work, we develop confidence regions for spatial excursion sets above and below a given level. We achieve this by treating the confidence procedure as a testing problem at the given level, allowing control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Methods are developed to control the FDR, separately for positive and negative excursions, as well as jointly over both. Furthermore, power is increased by incorporating a two-stage adaptive procedure. Simulation results with various signals show that our confidence regions successfully control the FDR under the nominal level. We showcase our methods with an application to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project illustrating the improvement in statistical power over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Bernstein's inequalities for general Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.10721v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish Bernstein's inequalities for functions of general (general-state-space and possibly non-reversible) Markov chains. These inequalities achieve sharp variance proxies and encompass the classical Bernstein inequality for independent random variables as special cases. The key analysis lies in bounding the operator norm of a perturbed Markov transition kernel by the exponential of sum of two convex functions. One coincides with what delivers the classical Bernstein inequality, and the other reflects the influence of the Markov dependence. A convex analysis on these two functions then derives our Bernstein inequalities. As applications, we apply our Bernstein inequalities to the Markov chain Monte Carlo integral estimation problem and the robust mean estimation problem with Markov-dependent samples, and achieve tight deviation bounds that previous inequalities can not.</description>

      <title>Inferring the dependence graph density of binary graphical models in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of binary interacting chains describing the dynamics of a group of $N$ components that, at each time unit, either send some signal to the others or remain silent otherwise. The interactions among the chains are encoded by a directed Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph with unknown parameter $ p \in (0, 1) .$ Moreover, the system is structured within two populations (excitatory chains versus inhibitory ones) which are coupled via a mean field interaction on the underlying Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph. In this paper, we address the question of inferring the connectivity parameter $p$ based only on the observation of the interacting chains over $T$ time units. In our main result, we show that the connectivity parameter $p$ can be estimated with rate $N^{-1/2}+N^{1/2}/T+(\log(T)/T)^{1/2}$ through an easy-to-compute estimator. Our analysis relies on a precise study of the spatio-temporal decay of correlations of the interacting chains. This is done through the study of coalescing random walks defining a backward regeneration representation of the system. Interestingly, we also show that this backward regeneration representation allows us to perfectly sample the system of interacting chains (conditionally on each realization of the underlying Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph) from its stationary distribution. These probabilistic results have an interest in its own.</description>

      <title>On the differentiability of $\phi$-projections in the discrete finite case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the case of finite measures on finite spaces, we state conditions under which {\phi}- projections are continuously differentiable. When the set on which one wishes to {\phi}- project is convex, we show that the required assumptions are implied by easily verifiable conditions. In particular, for input probability vectors and a rather large class of {\phi}-divergences, we obtain that {\phi}-projections are continuously differentiable when projecting on a set defined by linear equalities. The obtained results are applied to {\phi}- projection estimators (that is, minimum {\phi}-divergence estimators). A first application, rooted in robust statistics, concerns the computation of the influence functions of such estimators. In a second set of applications, we derive their asymptotics when projecting on parametric sets of probability vectors, on sets of probability vectors generated from distributions with certain moments fixed and on Fr\'echet classes of bivariate probability arrays. The resulting asymptotics hold whether the element to be {\phi}-projected belongs to the set on which one wishes to {\phi}-project or not.</description>

      <title>Dynamic angular synchronization under smoothness constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an undirected measurement graph $\mathcal{H} = ([n], \mathcal{E})$, the classical angular synchronization problem consists of recovering unknown angles $\theta_1^*,\dots,\theta_n^*$ from a collection of noisy pairwise measurements of the form $(\theta_i^* - \theta_j^*) \mod 2\pi$, for all $\{i,j\} \in \mathcal{E}$. This problem arises in a variety of applications, including computer vision, time synchronization of distributed networks, and ranking from pairwise comparisons. In this paper, we consider a dynamic version of this problem where the angles, and also the measurement graphs evolve over $T$ time points. Assuming a smoothness condition on the evolution of the latent angles, we derive three algorithms for joint estimation of the angles over all time points. Moreover, for one of the algorithms, we establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees for the mean-squared error (MSE) under different statistical models. In particular, we show that the MSE converges to zero as $T$ increases under milder conditions than in the static setting. This includes the setting where the measurement graphs are highly sparse and disconnected, and also when the measurement noise is large and can potentially increase with $T$. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>ScoreFusion: Fusing Score-based Generative Models via Kullback-Leibler Barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ScoreFusion, a theoretically grounded method for fusing multiple pre-trained diffusion models that are assumed to generate from auxiliary populations. ScoreFusion is particularly useful for enhancing the generative modeling of a target population with limited observed data. Our starting point considers the family of KL barycenters of the auxiliary populations, which is proven to be an optimal parametric class in the KL sense, but difficult to learn. Nevertheless, by recasting the learning problem as score matching in denoising diffusion, we obtain a tractable way of computing the optimal KL barycenter weights. We prove a dimension-free sample complexity bound in total variation distance, provided that the auxiliary models are well-fitted for their own task and the auxiliary tasks combined capture the target well. The sample efficiency of ScoreFusion is demonstrated by learning handwritten digits. We also provide a simple adaptation of a Stable Diffusion denoising pipeline that enables sampling from the KL barycenter of two auxiliary checkpoints; on a portrait generation task, our method produces faces that enhance population heterogeneity relative to the auxiliary distributions.</description>

      <title>Test-time Alignment of Diffusion Models without Reward Over-optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel in generative tasks, but aligning them with specific objectives while maintaining their versatility remains challenging. Existing fine-tuning methods often suffer from reward over-optimization, while approximate guidance approaches fail to optimize target rewards effectively. Addressing these limitations, we propose a training-free, test-time method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution. Our approach, tailored for diffusion sampling and incorporating tempering techniques, achieves comparable or superior target rewards to fine-tuning methods while preserving diversity and cross-reward generalization. We demonstrate its effectiveness in single-reward optimization, multi-objective scenarios, and online black-box optimization. This work offers a robust solution for aligning diffusion models with diverse downstream objectives without compromising their general capabilities.
