      <title>The number and location of two particle Schr\"odinger operators on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Schr\"odinger operators ${H}_{\lambda\mu}(K)$ with $K\in\mathbb{T}^2$ being the fixed quasimomentum of a pair of particles, associated with a system of two arbitrary particles on a two-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions of strengths $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$, respectively. We divide the $(\lambda,\mu)$-plane of parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$ into connected components, such that in each component, the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H_{\lambda\mu}(0)$ has a fixed number of eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are located both below the bottom of the essential spectrum and above its top. Additionally, we establish a sharp lower bound for the number of isolated eigenvalues of $H_{\lambda\mu}(K)$ within each connected component.</description>

      <title>Algebraic localization of generalized Wannier bases implies Roe triviality in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the aim of understanding the localization topology correspondence for non periodic gapped quantum systems, we investigate the relation between the existence of an algebraically well-localized generalized Wannier basis and the topological triviality of the corresponding projection operator. Inspired by the work of M. Ludewig and G.C. Thiang, we consider the triviality of a projection in the sense of coarse geometry, i.e. as triviality in the $K_0$-theory of the Roe $C^*$-algebra of $\mathrm{R}^d$. We obtain in Theorem 2.8 a threshold, depending on the dimension, for the decay rate of the generalized Wannier functions which implies topological triviality in Roe sense. This threshold reduces, for $d = 2$, to the almost optimal threshold appearing in the Localization Dichotomy Conjecture.</description>

      <title>A BGK-type model for multi-component gas mixtures undergoing a bimolecular chemical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new kinetic BGK-type model for a mixture of four monatomic gases, undergoing a bimolecular and reversible chemical reaction. The elastic and reactive interactions are described separately by distinct relaxation terms and the mechanical operator is the sum of binary BGK contributions, one for each pair of interacting species. In this way, our model separately incorporates the effects of mechanical processes and chemical reactions. Additionally, it retains the effects of interspecies interactions which are proper of the mixture. The dependence of Maxwellian attractors on the main macroscopic fields is explicitly expressed by assuming that the exchange rates for momentum and energy of mechanical and chemical operators coincide with the ones of the corresponding Boltzmann terms. Under suitable hypotheses, the entropy dissipation is proven by means of an H-functional prescribing the relaxation of the distribution functions to the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work I have shown that Herglotz actions reproduce the dynamics of classical mechanical theories which exhibit dynamical similarities. Recent work has shown how to extend field theories in both the Lagrangian and de Donder-Weyl formalism to contact geometry. In this article I show how dynamical similarity applies in field theory. This is applied in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, producing the contact equivalents. The result can be applied to general relativity where I demonstrate how to construct a complete description of the dynamics, equivalent to those derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action, without reference to the conformal factor.</description>

      <title>A novel translationally invariant supersymmetric chain with inverse-square interactions: partition function, thermodynamics and criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13827v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel family of translationally-invariant su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interaction not directly associated to a root system. We study the symmetries of these models, establishing in particular the existence of a boson-fermion duality characteristic of this type of systems. Taking advantage of the relation of the new chains with an associated many-body supersymmetric spin dynamical model, we are able to compute their partition function in closed form for all values of $m$ and $n$ and for an arbitrary number of spins. When both $m$ and $n$ are even, we show that the partition function factorizes as the product of the partition functions of two supersymmetric Haldane-Shastry spin chains, which in turn leads to a simple expression for the thermodynamic free energy per spin in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of a suitable transfer matrix. We use this expression to study the thermodynamics of a large class of these chains, showing in particular that the specific heat presents a single Schottky peak at approximately the same temperature as a suitable $k$-level model. We also analyze the critical behavior of the new chains, and in particular the ground state degeneracy and the existence of low energy excitations with a linear energy-momentum dispersion relation. In this way we are able to show that the only possible critical chains are the ones with $m=0,1,2$. In addition, using the explicit formula for the partition function we are able to establish the criticality of the su$(0|n)$ and su$(2|n)$ chains with even $n$, and to evaluate the central charge of their associated conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>On the field analogue of elliptic spin Calogero-Moser model: Lax pair and equations of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lax pair for the field analogue of the classical spin elliptic Calogero-Moser is proposed. Namely, using the previously known Lax matrix we suggest an ansatz for the accompany matrix. The presented construction is valid when the matrix of spin variables ${\mathcal S}\in{\rm Mat}(N,\mathbb C)$ satisfies the condition ${\mathcal S}^2=c_0{\mathcal S}$ with some constant $c_0\in\mathbb C$. It is proved that the Lax pair satisfies the Zakharov-Shabat equation with unwanted term, thus providing equations of motion on the unreduced phase space. The unwanted term vanishes after additional reduction. In the special case ${\rm rank}(\mathcal S)=1$ we show that the reduction provides the Lax pair of the spinless field Calogero-Moser model obtained earlier by Akhmetshin, Krichever and Volvovski.</description>

      <title>Nonmetricity and Poincare gauge gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in a spacetime geometry with general connection, there exist field redefinitions that replace the mixed-symmetry nonmetricity of the asymmetric connection with the sum of torsion and the field strength of special conformal transformations of a Lorentzian connection. In contrast to general relativity, generic action functionals give different results for metric versus Palatini-style variations. We consider some of the resulting issues in Poincar\`e gauge theory, where it is natural to vary both the solder form and the spin connection, and where the action may differ from the Einstein-Hilbert case. Independent variation may introduce nonmetricity as well as torsion. Appending the defining equation of nonmetricity to the Maurer-Cartan equations of the Poincar\`e Lie algebra, we show that the mixed symmetry components of nonmetricity can be absorbed into an altered torsion tensor, restoring local Lorentz symmetry and metric compatibility while including quadratic terms in the redefined curvature. In order to recover the original torsion and nonmetric fields, we replace the definition of nonmetricity by an additional structure equation. We show that the maximal Lie algebra compatible with the enlarged set is isomorphic to the conformal Lie algebra. Therefore, in a Lorentzian conformal geometry the sum of torsion and the field strength of special conformal transformations is given by the mixed symmetry nonmetricity of an equivalent asymmetric system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The friction force is derived using fractional calculus by considering the non-uniform flow of time in dissipative processes. The approach incorporates inhomogeneous velocity without unphysical approximations, resulting in a Lagrangian where the order of fractional derivatives measures time intervals. The fractional term in the Lagrangian provides correct Euler-Lagrange, and ultimately, the Hamilton equations, and vanishes during energy change measurements, like a ghost.</description>

      <title>A time-parallel multiple-shooting method for large-scale quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control plays a crucial role in quantum computing by employing control pulses to steer quantum systems and realize logical gate transformations, essential for quantum algorithms. However, this optimization task is computationally demanding due to challenges such as the exponential growth in computational complexity with the system's dimensionality and the deterioration of optimization convergence for multi-qubit systems. Various methods have been developed, including gradient-based and gradient-free reduced-space methods and full-space collocation methods. This paper introduces an intermediate approach based on multiple-shooting, aiming to balance solution accuracy and computational efficiency of previous approaches. Unlike conventional reduced-space methods, multiple-shooting divides the time domain into windows and introduces optimization variables for the initial state in each window. This enables parallel computation of state evolution across windows, significantly accelerating objective function and gradient evaluations. The initial state matrix in each window is only guaranteed to be unitary upon convergence of the optimization algorithm. For this reason the conventional gate trace infidelity is replaced by a generalized infidelity that is convex for non-unitary state matrices. Continuity of the state across window boundaries is enforced by equality constraints. A quadratic penalty optimization method is used to solve the constrained optimal control problem, and an efficient adjoint technique is employed to calculate the gradients in each iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments on quantum Fourier transform gates in systems with 2, 3, and 4 qubits. Parallel scalability and optimization performance are evaluated, highlighting the method's potential for optimizing control pulses in multi-qubit quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Distribution of Photon Spheres Near Spherically Symmetric Black Holes -- A Geometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon sphere has attracted significant attention since the discovery of black hole shadow images by Event Horizon Telescope. Recently, a number of studies have highlighted that the number of photon spheres and their distributions near black holes are strongly constrained by black hole properties. Specifically, for black holes with event horizons and proper asymptotic behaviors, the number of stable and unstable photon spheres satisfies the relation $n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}} = -1$. In this study, we provide a novel proof on this relation using a completely new geometric approach, in which the stable and unstable photon spheres are determined by Gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature in the optical geometry of black hole spacetimes. Firstly, we demonstrated the existence of photon spheres near black holes with proper asymptotic behaviors (asymptotically flat black holes, asymptotically de-Sitter and anti-de-Sitter black holes). Subsequently, we proved that the stable and unstable photon spheres near black holes must be one-to-one alternatively separated from each other, such that each unstable photon sphere is sandwiched between two stable photon spheres (and each stable photon sphere is sandwiched between two unstable photon spheres). Our analysis in this study is limited to the spherically symmetric black hole spacetime (with the spacetime metric $ds^{2}=g_{tt}dt^{2}+g_{rr}dr^{2}+g_{\theta\theta}d\theta^{2}+g_{\phi\phi}d\phi^{2}$).</description>

Abstract: Plasma sheaths are inhomogeneous equilibrium that form when a plasma is in contact with an absorbing wall. We prove linear and non linear stability of a kinetic sheath equilibrium for a Vlasov-Poisson type system in a bounded interval. Notably, in the linear setting, we obtain exponential decay of the fluctuation provided the rate of injection of particles at equilibrium is smaller that the rate of absorption at the wall. In the non linear setting, we prove a similar result for small enough equilibrium and small localized perturbation of the equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the well-posedness of a general class of bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard systems with singular potentials. For this model, we first prove the existence of a global-in-time weak solution by approximating the singular potentials via a Yosida approximation, applying the corresponding results for regular potentials, and eventually passing to the limit in this approximation scheme. Then, we prove the uniqueness of weak solutions and its continuous dependence on the velocity fields and the initial data. Afterwards, assuming additional regularity of the domain as well as the velocity fields, we establish higher regularity properties of weak solutions and eventually the existence of strong solutions. In the end, we discuss strict separation properties for logarithmic type potentials in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda_X(s)=\det(I-sX^{\dagger})$ be the characteristic polynomial of the unitary matrix $X$. It is believed that the distribution of values of $\Lambda_X(s)$ model the distribution of values of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. This principle motivates many avenues of study. Of particular interest is the behavior of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ and the distribution of its zeros (all of which lie inside or on the unit circle). In this article we present several identities for the moments of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ averaged over $U(N)$, for $x \in \mathbb{C}$ as well as specialized to $|x|=1$. Additionally, we prove, for positive integer $k$, that the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X(1)|^{2k} dX$ of degree $k^2$ in $N$ divides the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X'(1)|^{2k} dX$ which is of degree $k^2+2k$ in $N$ and that the ratio, $f(N,k)$, of these moments factors into linear factors modulo $4k-1$ if $4k-1$ is prime. We also discuss the relationship of these moments to a solution of a second order non-linear Painl\'{e}ve differential equation. Finally we give some formulas in terms of the $_3F_2$ hypergeometric series for the moments in the simplest case when $N=2$, and also study the radial distribution of the zeros of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ in that case.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Gluing with $\Lambda$ 1. Linearised Einstein equations on four-dimensional spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a gluing theorem for linearised vacuum gravitational fields in Bondi gauge on a class of characteristic surfaces in static vacuum four-dimensional backgrounds with cosmological constant $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ and arbitrary topology of the compact cross-sections of the null hypersurface. This generalises and complements, in the linearised case, the pioneering analysis of Aretakis, Czimek and Rodnianski, carried-out on light-cones in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Generation of Kochen-Specker contextual sets in higher dimensions by dimensional upscaling whose complexity does not scale with dimension and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, handling of contextual sets, in particular Kochen-Specker (KS) sets, in higher dimensions has been given an increasing attention, both theoretically and experimentally. However, methods of their generation are diverse, not generally applicable in every dimension, and of exponential complexity. Therefore, we design a dimensional upscaling method, whose complexity does not scale with dimension. As a proof of principle we generate manageable-sized KS master sets in up to 27 dimensional spaces and show that well over 32 dimensions can be reached. From these master sets we obtain an ample number of smaller KS sets. We discuss three kinds of applications that work with KS sets in higher dimensions. We anticipate other applications of KS sets for quantum information processing that make use of large families of nonisomorphic KS sets.</description>

      <title>Random covariant quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The group symmetries inherent in quantum channels often make them tractable and applicable to various problems in quantum information theory. In this paper, we introduce natural probability distributions for covariant quantum channels. Specifically, this is achieved through the application of ``twirling operations'' on random quantum channels derived from the Stinespring representation that use Haar-distributed random isometries. We explore various types of group symmetries, including unitary and orthogonal covariance, hyperoctahedral covariance, diagonal orthogonal covariance (DOC), and analyze their properties related to quantum entanglement based on the model parameters. In particular, we discuss the threshold phenomenon for positive partial transpose and entanglement breaking properties, comparing thresholds among different classes of random covariant channels. Finally, we contribute to the PPT$^2$ conjecture by showing that the composition between two random DOC channels is generically entanglement breaking.</description>

      <title>Similarities between projective quantum fields and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many homogeneous, four-dimensional space-time geometries can be considered within real projective geometry, which yields a mathematically well-defined framework for their deformations and limits without the appearance of singularities. Focussing on generalized unitary transformation behavior, projective quantum fields can be axiomatically introduced, which transform smoothly under geometry deformations and limits. Connections on the related projective frame bundles provide gauge fields with gauge group $\mathrm{PGL}_5\mathbb{R}$. For Poincar\'e geometry, on operator level only $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{GL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{GL}_3\mathbb{R})\cong \mathbb{R}_{\neq 0}\times \mathrm{PGL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{PGL}_3\mathbb{R}$ gauge bosons can interact non-trivially with other projective quantum fields from the non- to ultra-relativistic limits. The corresponding propagating, complexified gauge bosons come with the Standard Model gauge group $G_{\mathrm{SM}}=(\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)\times \mathrm{SU}(3))/\mathbb{Z}_6$. Physical scale transformations can act as global gauge transformations and their spontaneous breaking can lead to masses for the projective quantum fields including the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge bosons. Projective quantum fields, which are irreducible both with respect to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{pgl}_5\mathbb{R}$ and the Poincar\'e group, form Dirac fermions and $G_{\mathrm{SM}}$ gauge bosons interact with them similar to the Standard Model. For homogeneous, curved Lorentz geometries a gauge group similar to the gauge group of metric-affine gravity appears.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as a unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks are attracting the interest of scientific community since the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behavior in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work we present the preliminary results of a IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels.</description>
