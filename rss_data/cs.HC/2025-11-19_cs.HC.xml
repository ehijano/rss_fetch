      <title>Enhancing Decision Support in Construction through Industrial AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction industry is presently going through a transformation led by adopting digital technologies that leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI). These industrial AI solutions assist in various phases of the construction process, including planning, design, production and management. In particular, the production phase offers unique potential for the integration of such AI-based solutions. These AI-based solutions assist site managers, project engineers, coordinators and other key roles in making final decisions. To facilitate the decision-making process in the production phase of construction through a human-centric AI-based solution, it is important to understand the needs and challenges faced by the end users who interact with these AI-based solutions to enhance the effectiveness and usability of these systems. Without this understanding, the potential usage of these AI-based solutions may be limited. Hence, the purpose of this research study is to explore, identify and describe the key factors crucial for developing AI solutions in the construction industry. This study further identifies the correlation between these key factors. This was done by developing a demonstrator and collecting quantifiable feedback through a questionnaire targeting the end users, such as site managers and construction professionals. This research study will offer insights into developing and improving these industrial AI solutions, focusing on Human-System Interaction aspects to enhance decision support, usability, and overall AI solution adoption.</description>

      <title>Human-centric Maintenance Process Through Integration of AI, Speech, and AR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of Augmented Reality (AR) is increasing to enhance Human-System Interaction (HSI) by creating immersive experiences that improve efficiency and safety in various industries. In industrial maintenance, traditional practices involve physical documentation and device interactions, which might disrupt the task, affect efficiency, and increase the cognitive load for the maintenance personnel. AR has the potential to support and enhance industrial maintenance processes in these aspects. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to study and explore how advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), AR and speech processing can be integrated to support hands-free, real-time task logging and interaction in maintenance environments. This is done by developing a demonstrator for Microsoft HoloLens 2 using Unity, C#, Azure Cognitive Services, and Azure Functions, which enables speech-to-text transcription for hands-free maintenance support. Using Azures' speech recognition, the demonstrator can achieve high transcription accuracy in an AR environment, facilitating natural interactions between users and the augmented environment. The study aims to explore the potential of AR to reduce cognitive load, streamline workflows, and improve safety by enhancing HSI for maintenance personnel in high-stakes environments.</description>

      <title>Personality Pairing Improves Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we ask how AI agent "personalities" interact with human personalities, and other traits, to shape human-AI collaboration, productivity and performance. To estimate these relationships, we conducted a large-scale preregistered randomized experiment that paired 1,258 participants with AI agents that were prompted to exhibit varying levels of the Big Five personality traits. These human-AI teams produced 7,266 display ads for a real think tank, and the quality of these ads was evaluated by 1,995 independent human raters as well as in a field experiment conducted on X, which generated nearly 5 million impressions. We found, first, that personality pairing impacted teamwork quality. For example, neurotic AI improved teamwork for agreeable humans but impaired it for conscientious humans. Second, we found productivity effects of personality pairing and a "productivity-performance trade-off" in which certain pairings (e.g., agreeable human with neurotic AI) produced fewer ads but of higher quality. Third, personality pairing influenced ad quality and performance. For example, quality improved when open humans were paired with conscientious AI and when conscientious humans were paired with disagreeable AI. Some of these pairing effects were "jagged" in that they varied across text and visual tasks. For example open humans produced higher quality images but lower quality text when paired with agreeable AI. Pairing effects were also present in other human traits, like country of origin. For example, extroverted AI improved quality for Latin American workers, but degraded quality for East Asian workers. These findings demonstrate that human-AI personality alignment significantly improves collaboration, productivity, and performance and lay a foundation for future research on improving human-AI collaboration through AI personalization.</description>

      <title>Affective Color Scales for Colormap Data Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on affective visualization design has shown that color is an especially powerful feature for influencing the emotional connotation of visualizations. Associations between colors and emotions are largely driven by lightness (e.g., lighter colors are associated with positive emotions, whereas darker colors are associated with negative emotions). Designing visualizations to have all light or all dark colors to convey particular emotions may work well for visualizations in which colors represent categories and spatial channels encode data values. However, this approach poses a problem for visualizations that use color to represent spatial patterns in data (e.g., colormap data visualizations) because lightness contrast is needed to reveal fine details in spatial structure. In this study, we found it is possible to design colormaps that have strong lightness contrast to support spatial vision while communicating clear affective connotation. We also found that affective connotation depended not only on the color scales used to construct the colormaps, but also the frequency with which colors appeared in the map, as determined by the underlying dataset (data-dependence hypothesis). These results emphasize the importance of data-aware design, which accounts for not only the design features that encode data (e.g., colors, shapes, textures), but also how those design features are instantiated in a visualization, given the properties of the data.</description>

      <title>Developing a Grounded View of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a capability coming from computation, how does AI differ fundamentally from the capabilities delivered by rule-based software program? The paper examines the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) from engineering points of view to clarify its nature and limits. The paper argues that the rationality underlying humanity's impulse to pursue, articulate, and adhere to rules deserves to be valued and preserved. Identifying where rule-based practical rationality ends is the beginning of making it aware until action. Although the rules of AI behaviors are still hidden or only weakly observable, the paper has proposed a methodology to make a sense of discrimination possible and practical to identify the distinctions of the behavior of AI models with three types of decisions. It is a prerequisite for human responsibilities with alternative possibilities, considering how and when to use AI. It would be a solid start for people to ensure AI system soundness for the well-being of humans, society, and the environment.</description>

      <title>Gamified Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Mysophobia: Evaluating the Efficacy of a Simulated Sneeze Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mysophobia, or the fear of germs, is a prevalent anxiety disorder that significantly impacts daily life. This study investigates the potential of a gamified virtual reality (VR) intervention to simulate contamination-related scenarios and assess their emotional and psychological effects. A VR game based sneeze simulation was developed to evaluate its influence on participants' emotional states. Seven participants completed two versions of the game: a baseline version and an experimental version featuring the sneeze simulation. Emotional responses were measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State (STAI-S) questionnaires. The results revealed slight increases in negative affect and anxiety levels during the sneeze simulation. Also, a reduction in positive affect was revealed. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). This is likely due to small sample sizes, a lack of grossness in the simulation, or participants not being clinically mysophobes. This exploratory study highlights the potential of VR-based interventions for understanding and addressing contamination-related anxieties. It provides a foundation for future research with larger and more diverse participant pools.</description>

      <title>Final Happiness: What Intelligent User Interfaces Can Do for the lonely Dying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the design of Intelligent User Interfaces (IUIs) to address the profound existential loneliness of terminally ill individuals. While Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has made inroads in "Thanatechnology," current research often focuses on practical aspects like digital legacy management, overlooking the subjective, existential needs of those facing death in isolation. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 14 lonely, terminally ill individuals. Our core contributions are: (1) An empirically-grounded model articulating the complex psychological, practical, social, and spiritual needs of this group; (2) The "Three Pillars, Twelve Principles" framework for designing IUIs as "Existential Companions"; and (3) A critical design directive derived from user evaluations: technology in this context should aim for transcendence over simulation. The findings suggest that IUIs should create experiences that augment or surpass human capabilities, rather than attempting to simulate basic human connections, which can paradoxically deepen loneliness. This research provides a clear, user-centered path for designing technology that serves not as a "tool for dying," but as a "partner for living fully until the end".</description>

      <title>A Longitudinal Study on the Attitudes of Gay Men in Beijing Towards Gay Social Media Platforms: Lonely Souls in the Digital Concrete Jungle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, specialized social networking applications have become a cornerstone of life for many gay men in China. This paper employs a longitudinal mixed-methods approach to investigate how Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) have shifted their attitudes toward these platforms between approximately 2013 and 2023. Drawing on archival analysis of online discourses, a quantitative survey of 412 participants, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 32 participants, we trace the complex trajectory of this evolution. Our findings reveal a clear pattern: from the initial embrace of these applications as revolutionary tools for community building and identity affirmation (2014--2017), to a period of growing ambivalence and critique centered on commercialization, ``hookup culture,'' and multiple forms of discrimination (2017--2020), and finally to the present era (2020--2023), characterized by pragmatic, fragmented, yet simultaneously critical and reconstructive uses. Today, users strategically employ a repertoire of applications -- including global platforms (e.g., Grindr and Tinder), domestic mainstream platforms (e.g., Blued), and niche alternatives (e.g., Aloha) -- to fulfill differentiated needs. We develop a detailed temporal framework to capture this attitudinal evolution and discuss its design implications for creating more supportive, secure, and community-oriented digital environments for marginalized groups.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Management and the Future of Human Work: Implications for Autonomy, Collaboration, and Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the evolving impact of algorithmic management on human resource management (HRM) practices, with a focus on employee autonomy, procedural transparency, and the sociotechnical dynamics of performance evaluation. Rather than adopting a qualitative or empirical approach, the paper develops a conceptual integration of insights from HRM, human-computer interaction (HCI), and Science and Technology Studies. The analysis highlights that although algorithmic systems can enhance operational efficiency, they risk reinforcing biases and narrowing the relational and contextual dimensions of work. These systems often overlook intangible contributions such as creativity, empathy, and collaborative problem solving, revealing gaps in data-driven performance measurement. In response, the study proposes a sociotechnical perspective on algorithmic accountability that emphasizes procedural transparency, organizational justice, and employee agency. By revisiting foundational questions within the rapidly evolving landscape of algorithmic management, the paper contributes to ongoing debates about the future of work and the design of managerial technologies that support, rather than constrain, human autonomy and organizational life.</description>

      <title>Visionary Co-Driver: Enhancing Driver Perception of Potential Risks with LLM and HUD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drivers' perception of risky situations has always been a challenge in driving. Existing risk-detection methods excel at identifying collisions but face challenges in assessing the behavior of road users in non-collision situations. This paper introduces Visionary Co-Driver, a system that leverages large language models to identify non-collision roadside risks and alert drivers based on their eye movements. Specifically, the system combines video processing algorithms and LLMs to identify potentially risky road users. These risks are dynamically indicated on an adaptive heads-up display interface to enhance drivers' attention. A user study with 41 drivers confirms that Visionary Co-Driver improves drivers' risk perception and supports their recognition of roadside risks.</description>

      <title>TailCue: Exploring Animal-inspired Robotic Tail for Automated Vehicles Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) are gradually becoming part of our daily lives. However, effective communication between road users and AVs remains a significant challenge. Although various external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) have been developed to facilitate interactions, psychological factors, such as a lack of trust and inadequate emotional signaling, may still deter users from confidently engaging with AVs in certain contexts. To address this gap, we propose TailCue, an exploration of how tail-based eHMIs affect user interaction with AVs. We first investigated mappings between tail movements and emotional expressions from robotics and zoology, and accordingly developed a motion-emotion mapping scheme. A physical robotic tail was implemented, and specific tail motions were designed based on our scheme. An online, video-based user study with 21 participants was conducted. Our findings suggest that, although the intended emotions conveyed by the tail were not consistently recognized, open-ended feedback indicated that the tail motion needs to align with the scenarios and cues. Our result highlights the necessity of scenario-specific optimization to enhance tail-based eHMIs. Future work will refine tail movement strategies to maximize their effectiveness across diverse interaction contexts.</description>

      <title>Towards LLM-Based Usability Analysis for Recommender User Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usability is a key factor in the effectiveness of recommender systems. However, the analysis of user interfaces is a time-consuming process that requires expertise. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities to automate such evaluations. In this work, we explore the potential of multimodal LLMs to assess the usability of recommender system interfaces by considering a variety of publicly available systems as examples. We take user interface screenshots from multiple of these recommender platforms to cover both preference elicitation and recommendation presentation scenarios. An LLM is instructed to analyze these interfaces with regard to different usability criteria and provide explanatory feedback. Our evaluation demonstrates how LLMs can support heuristic-style usability assessments at scale to support the improvement of user experience.</description>

      <title>PACEE: Supporting Children's Personal Emotion Education through Parent-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion education is a crucial lesson for children aged 3 to 6. However, existing technologies primarily focus on promoting emotion education from the child's perspective, often neglecting the central role of parents in guiding early childhood emotion development. In this work, we conducted co-design sessions with five experienced kindergarten teachers and five parents to identify parental challenges and the roles that AI can play in family emotion education. Guided by these insights, we developed PACEE, an assistant for supporting parent-AI collaborative emotion education. PACEE enables parents to engage in emotional dialogues about common scenarios, with multiple forms of support provided by generative AI. It combines insights from parents and AI to model children's emotional states and collaboratively delivers personalized, parent-mediated guidance. In a user study involving 16 families, we found that PACEE significantly enhances parent-child engagement, encourages more in-depth emotional communication, and improves the parental experience. Our findings advance emotion coaching theory in both family settings and LLM-assisted contexts, offering valuable insights for designing AI-supported, parent-centered family education systems.</description>

      <title>Model Learning for Adjusting the Level of Automation in HCPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steadily increasing level of automation in human-centred systems demands rigorous design methods for analysing and controlling interactions between humans and automated components, especially in safety-critical applications. The variability of human behaviour poses particular challenges for formal verification and synthesis. We present a model-based framework that enables design-time exploration of safe shared-control strategies in human-automation systems. The approach combines active automata learning -- to derive coarse, finite-state abstractions of human behaviour from simulations -- with game-theoretic reactive synthesis to determine whether a controller can guarantee safety when interacting with these models. If no such strategy exists, the framework supports iterative refinement of the human model or adjustment of the automation's controllable actions. A driving case study, integrating automata learning with reactive synthesis in UPPAAL, illustrates the applicability of the framework on a simplified driving scenario and its potential for analysing shared-control strategies in human-centred cyber-physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14567v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing 3D models remains challenging for Screen Reader (SR) users. While some existing 3D viewers allow creators to provide alternative text, they often lack sufficient detail about the 3D models. Grounded on a formative study, this paper introduces SweeperBot, a system that enables SR users to leverage visual question answering to explore and compare 3D models. SweeperBot answers SR users' visual questions by combining an optimal view selection technique with the strength of generative- and recognition-based foundation models. An expert review with 10 Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) users with SR experience demonstrated the feasibility of using SweeperBot to assist BLV users in exploring and comparing 3D models. The quality of the descriptions generated by SweeperBot was validated by a second survey study with 30 sighted participants.</description>

      <title>Biased Minds Meet Biased AI: How Class Imbalance Shapes Appropriate Reliance and Interacts with Human Base Rate Neglect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans increasingly interact with artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making. However, both AI and humans are prone to biases. While AI and human biases have been studied extensively in isolation, this paper examines their complex interaction. Specifically, we examined how class imbalance as an AI bias affects people's ability to appropriately rely on an AI-based decision-support system, and how it interacts with base rate neglect as a human bias. In a within-subject online study (N= 46), participants classified three diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on either a balanced or unbalanced dataset. We found that class imbalance disrupted participants' calibration of AI reliance. Moreover, we observed mutually reinforcing effects between class imbalance and base rate neglect, offering evidence of a compound human-AI bias. Based on these findings, we advocate for an interactionist perspective and further research into the mutually reinforcing effects of biases in human-AI interaction.</description>

      <title>Theoretical basis for code presentation: A case for cognitive load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence supports that reducing cognitive load (CL) improves task performance for people of all abilities. This effect is specifically important for blind-and-low-vision (BLV) individuals because they cannot rely on many common methods of managing CL, which are frequently vision-based techniques. Current accessible "solutions" for BLV developers only sporadically consider CL in their design. There isn't a way to know whether CL is being alleviated by them. Neither do we know if alleviating CL is part of the mechanism behind why these solutions help BLV people. Using a strong foundation in psychological sciences, we identify aspects of CL that impact performance and learning in programming. These aspects are then examined when evaluating existing solutions for programming sub-tasks for BLV users. We propose an initial design "recommendations" for presentation of code which, when followed, will reduce cognitive load for BLV developers.</description>

      <title>M-CALLM: Multi-level Context Aware LLM Framework for Group Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores how large language models can leverage multi-level contextual information to predict group coordination patterns in collaborative mixed reality environments. We demonstrate that encoding individual behavioral profiles, group structural properties, and temporal dynamics as natural language enables LLMs to break through the performance ceiling of statistical models. We build M-CALLM, a framework that transforms multimodal sensor streams into hierarchical context for LLM-based prediction, and evaluate three paradigms (zero-shot prompting, few-shot learning, and supervised fine-tuning) against statistical baselines across intervention mode (real-time prediction) and simulation mode (autoregressive forecasting) Head-to-head comparison on 16 groups (64 participants, ~25 hours) demonstrates that context-aware LLMs achieve 96% accuracy for conversation prediction, a 3.2x improvement over LSTM baselines, while maintaining sub-35ms latency. However, simulation mode reveals brittleness with 83% degradation due to cascading errors. Deep-dive into modality-specific performance shows conversation depends on temporal patterns, proximity benefits from group structure (+6%), while shared attention fails completely (0% recall), exposing architectural limitations. We hope this work spawns new ideas for building intelligent collaborative sensing systems that balance semantic reasoning capabilities with fundamental constraints.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Use of ChatGPT by Computer Science Students in Software Development: Applications, Ethical Considerations, and Insights for Engineering Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ChatGPT has been increasingly used in computer science, offering efficient support across software development tasks. While it helps students navigate programming challenges, its use also raises concerns about academic integrity and overreliance. Despite growing interest in this topic, prior research has largely relied on surveys, emphasizing trends over in-depth analysis of students' strategies and ethical awareness. This study complements existing work through a qualitative investigation of how computer science students in one UK institution strategically and ethically engage with ChatGPT in software development projects. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, it explores two key questions: How do computer science students ethically and strategically report using ChatGPT in software development projects? How do students understand and perceive the ethical issues associated with using ChatGPT in academic and professional contexts? Findings reveal a shift in students' learning models, moving from traditional "independent thinking-manual coding-iterative debugging" to "AI-assisted ideation-interactive programming-collaborative optimization." Importantly, many use ChatGPT conversationally to deepen understanding, while consciously reserving creative and high-level decision-making tasks for themselves. Students tend to cap ChatGPT's contribution to roughly 30%, and evaluate its output to mitigate overreliance. However, only a minority thoroughly analyze AI-generated code, raising concerns about reduced critical engagement. Meanwhile, students reject uncredited use, highlight risks such as privacy breaches and skill degradation, and call for clear usage guidelines set by their teachers. This research offers novel insights into the evolving learner-AI dynamic and highlights the need for explicit guidance to support responsible and pedagogically sound use of such tools.</description>

      <title>MindCross: Fast New Subject Adaptation with Limited Data for Cross-subject Video Reconstruction from Brain Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing video from brain signals is an important brain decoding task. Existing brain decoding frameworks are primarily built on a subject-dependent paradigm, which requires large amounts of brain data for each subject. However, the expensive cost of collecting brain-video data causes severe data scarcity. Although some cross-subject methods being introduced, they often overfocus with subject-invariant information while neglecting subject-specific information, resulting in slow fine-tune-based adaptation strategy. To achieve fast and data-efficient new subject adaptation, we propose MindCross, a novel cross-subject framework. MindCross's N specific encoders and one shared encoder are designed to extract subject-specific and subject-invariant information, respectively. Additionally, a Top-K collaboration module is adopted to enhance new subject decoding with the knowledge learned from previous subjects' encoders. Extensive experiments on fMRI/EEG-to-video benchmarks demonstrate MindCross's efficacy and efficiency of cross-subject decoding and new subject adaptation using only one model.</description>

      <title>Tell Me: An LLM-powered Mental Well-being Assistant with RAG, Synthetic Dialogue Generation, and Agentic Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.</description>

      <title>SecureSign: Bridging Security and UX in Mobile Web3 through Emulated EIP-6963 Sandboxing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile Web3 faces catastrophic retention (&lt; 5%) yielding effective acquisition costs of \$500 - \$1,000 per retained user. Existing solutions force an impossible tradeoff: embedded wallets achieve moderate usability but suffer inherent click-jacking vulnerabilities; app wallets maintain security at the cost of 2 - 3% retention due to download friction and context-switching penalties. We present SecureSign, a PWA-based architecture that adapts desktop browser extension security to mobile via EIP-6963 provider sandboxing. SecureSign isolates dApp execution in iframes within a trusted parent application, achieving click-jacking immunity and transaction integrity while enabling native mobile capabilities (push notifications, home screen installation, zero context-switching). Our drop-in SDK requires no codebase changes for existing Web3 applications. Threat model analysis demonstrates immunity to click-jacking, overlay, and skimming attacks while maintaining wallet interoperability across dApps.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Interfaces for Databases: What Do Users Think?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Interfaces for Databases (NLIDBs) aim to make database querying accessible by allowing users to ask questions in everyday language rather than using formal SQL queries. Despite significant advancements in translation accuracy, critical usability challenges, such as user frustration, query refinement strategies, and error recovery, remain underexplored. To investigate these usability dimensions, we conducted a mixed-method user study comparing SQL-LLM, a state-of-the-art NL2SQL system, with Snowflake, a traditional SQL analytics platform. Our controlled evaluation involved 20 participants completing realistic database querying tasks across 12 queries each. Results show that SQL-LLM significantly reduced query completion times by 10 to 30 percent (mean: 418 s vs. 629 s, p = 0.036) and improved overall accuracy from 50 to 75 percent (p = 0.002). Additionally, participants using SQL-LLM exhibited fewer query reformulations, recovered from errors 30 to 40 seconds faster, and reported lower frustration levels compared to Snowflake users. Behavioral analysis revealed that SQL-LLM encouraged structured, schema-first querying strategies, enhancing user confidence and efficiency, particularly for complex queries. These findings underscore the practical significance of well-designed, user-friendly NLIDBs in business analytics settings, emphasizing the critical role of usability alongside technical accuracy in real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Colour Perception in Immersive Virtual Reality: Emotional and Physiological Responses to Fifteen Munsell Hues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colour is a fundamental determinant of affective experience in immersive virtual reality (VR), yet the emotional and physiological impact of individual hues remains poorly characterised. This study investigated how fifteen calibrated Munsell hues influence subjective and autonomic responses when presented in immersive VR. Thirty-six adults (18-45 years) viewed each hue in a within-subject design while pupil diameter and skin conductance were recorded continuously, and self-reported emotions were assessed using the Self-Assessment Manikin across pleasure, arousal, and dominance. Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed robust hue effects on all three self-report dimensions and on pupil dilation, with medium to large effect sizes. Reds and red-purple hues elicited the highest arousal and dominance, whereas blue-green hues were rated most pleasurable. Pupil dilation closely tracked arousal ratings, while skin conductance showed no reliable hue differentiation, likely due to the brief (30 s) exposures. Individual differences in cognitive style and personality modulated overall reactivity but did not alter the relative ranking of hues. Taken together, these findings provide the first systematic hue-by-hue mapping of affective and physiological responses in immersive VR. They demonstrate that calibrated colour shapes both experience and ocular physiology, while also offering practical guidance for educational, clinical, and interface design in virtual environments.</description>

      <title>The Social Gaze of LLMs: A Literature Review of Multimodal Approaches to Human Behavior Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-powered multimodal systems are increasingly used to interpret human behavior, yet how researchers apply the models' 'social competence' remains poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 176 publications across different application domains (e.g., healthcare, education, and entertainment). Using a four-dimensional coding framework (application, technical, evaluative, and ethical), we find (1) frequent use of pattern recognition and information extraction from multimodal sources, but limited support for adaptive, interactive reasoning; (2) a dominant 'modality-to-text' pipeline that privileges language over rich audiovisual cues, striping away nuanced social cues; (3) evaluation practices reliant on static benchmarks, with socially grounded, human-centered assessments rare; and (4) Ethical discussions focused mainly on legal and rights-related risks (e.g., privacy), leaving societal risks (e.g., deception) overlooked--or at best acknowledged but left unaddressed. We outline a research agenda for evaluating socially competent, ethically informed, and interaction-aware multi-modal systems.</description>

      <title>TalkSketch: Multimodal Generative AI for Real-time Sketch Ideation with Speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sketching is a widely used medium for generating and exploring early-stage design concepts. While generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are increasingly used for idea generation, designers often struggle to craft effective prompts and find it difficult to express evolving visual concepts through text alone. In the formative study (N=6), we examined how designers use GenAI during ideation, revealing that text-based prompting disrupts creative flow. To address these issues, we developed TalkSketch, an embedded multimodal AI sketching system that integrates freehand drawing with real-time speech input. TalkSketch aims to support a more fluid ideation process through capturing verbal descriptions during sketching and generating context-aware AI responses. Our work highlights the potential of GenAI tools to engage the design process itself rather than focusing on output.</description>

      <title>MedBuild AI: An Agent-Based Hybrid Intelligence Framework for Reshaping Agency in Healthcare Infrastructure Planning through Generative Design for Medical Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Globally, disparities in healthcare infrastructure remain stark, leaving countless communities without access to even basic services. Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture.</description>

      <title>BeautyGuard: Designing a Multi-Agent Roundtable System for Proactive Beauty Tech Compliance through Stakeholder Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As generative AI enters enterprise workflows, ensuring compliance with legal, ethical, and reputational standards becomes a pressing challenge. In beauty tech, where biometric and personal data are central, traditional reviews are often manual, fragmented, and reactive. To examine these challenges, we conducted a formative study with six experts (four IT managers, two legal managers) at a multinational beauty company. The study revealed pain points in rule checking, precedent use, and the lack of proactive guidance.
  Motivated by these findings, we designed a multi-agent "roundtable" system powered by a large language model. The system assigns role-specialized agents for legal interpretation, checklist review, precedent search, and risk mitigation, synthesizing their perspectives into structured compliance advice.
  We evaluated the prototype with the same experts using System Usability Scale(SUS), The Official NASA Task Load Index(NASA-TLX), and interviews. Results show exceptional usability (SUS: 77.5/100) and minimal cognitive workload, with three key findings: (1) multi-agent systems can preserve tacit knowledge into standardized workflows, (2) information augmentation achieves higher acceptance than decision automation, and (3) successful enterprise AI should mirror organizational structures. This work contributes design principles for human-AI collaboration in compliance review, with broader implications for regulated industries beyond beauty tech.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a focus on natural language processing (NLP) and the role of large language models (LLMs), we explore the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. As artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize fields from healthcare to finance, NLP techniques such as tokenization, text classification, and entity recognition are essential for processing and understanding human language. This paper discusses advanced data preprocessing techniques and the use of frameworks like Hugging Face for implementing transformer-based models. Additionally, it highlights challenges such as handling multilingual data, reducing bias, and ensuring model robustness. By addressing key aspects of data processing and model fine-tuning, this work aims to provide insights into deploying effective and ethically sound AI solutions.</description>

      <title>The EU AI Act, Stakeholder Needs, and Explainable AI: Aligning Regulatory Compliance in a Clinical Decision Support System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20311</link>

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is a promising route to comply with the EU AI Act, the first multinational AI regulation. XAI enhances transparency and human oversight of AI systems, especially ''black-box`` models criticized as incomprehensible. Yet discourse about the AI Act's stakeholders and XAI remains disconnected: XAI increasingly prioritizes end users' needs, while the AI Act focuses on providers' and deployers' obligations. We aim to bridge this divide and offer practical guidance on their relationship. Through interdisciplinary discussion in a cross functional team of XAI, AI Act, legal, and requirements-engineering experts, we outline steps to analyze an AI-based clinical decision support system, clarify end-user needs, and assess AI Act applicability. Using an AI system under development as a case study, we show how XAI techniques can help reconcile stakeholder needs with AI Act requirements and fill gaps between usability and regulatory demands. We compare similarities and differences between legal obligations and end-user needs, identify tensions, and point to concrete design choices and trade-offs. We invite researchers and practitioners in XAI to reflect on their role relative to the AI Act and to develop mutual understanding across disciplines. While XAI can help implement core AI Act principles such as transparency and human oversight, it should be considered one element of a broader compliance strategy that also requires standardization, legal interpretation, documentation, organizational processes, governance, testing, and ongoing monitoring and auditing practices. Our findings yield actionable recommendations for integrating XAI into product development, compliance workflows, and stakeholder communication, informing policy-making and standards development.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Human Evaluations in Gesture Generation: Insights from a Community-Driven State-of-the-Art Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review human evaluation practices in automated, speech-driven 3D gesture generation and find a lack of standardisation and frequent use of flawed experimental setups. This leads to a situation where it is impossible to know how different methods compare, or what the state of the art is. In order to address common shortcomings of evaluation design, and to standardise future user studies in gesture-generation works, we introduce a detailed human evaluation protocol for the widely-used BEAT2 motion-capture dataset. Using this protocol, we conduct large-scale crowdsourced evaluation to rank six recent gesture-generation models -- each trained by its original authors -- across two key evaluation dimensions: motion realism and speech-gesture alignment. Our results provide strong evidence that 1) newer models do not consistently outperform earlier approaches; 2) published claims of high motion realism or speech-gesture alignment may not hold up under rigorous evaluation; and 3) the field must adopt disentangled assessments of motion quality and multimodal alignment for accurate benchmarking in order to make progress. Finally, in order to drive standardisation and enable new evaluation research, we will release five hours of synthetic motion from the benchmarked models; over 750 rendered video stimuli from the user studies -- enabling new evaluations without model reimplementation required -- alongside our open-source rendering script, and the 16,000 pairwise human preference votes collected for our benchmark.</description>

      <title>Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a feature of cooperative interaction where users are intentional about the degree to which they specify queries. We develop a principled framework based on a shared responsibility of query specification between user and system, distinguishing unambiguous and ambiguous cooperative queries, which systems can resolve through reasonable inference, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved. Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. This conceptualization around cooperation in resolving queries informs how to design and evaluate natural language interfaces for tabular data analysis, for which we distill concrete directions for future research and broader implications.</description>

      <title>Embedding Explainable AI in NHS Clinical Safety: The Explainability-Enabled Clinical Safety Framework (ECSF)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly embedded in NHS workflows, but its probabilistic and adaptive behaviour conflicts with the deterministic assumptions underpinning existing clinical-safety standards. DCB0129 and DCB0160 provide strong governance for conventional software yet do not define how AI-specific transparency, interpretability, or model drift should be evidenced within Safety Cases, Hazard Logs, or post-market monitoring. This paper proposes an Explainability-Enabled Clinical Safety Framework (ECSF) that integrates explainability into the DCB0129/0160 lifecycle, enabling Clinical Safety Officers to use interpretability outputs as structured safety evidence without altering compliance pathways. A cross-regulatory synthesis mapped DCB clauses to principles from Good Machine Learning Practice, the NHS AI Assurance and T.E.S.T. frameworks, and the EU AI Act. The resulting matrix links regulatory clauses, principles, ECSF checkpoints, and suitable explainability outputs. ECSF introduces five checkpoints: global transparency for hazard identification, case-level interpretability for verification, clinician usability for evaluation, traceable decision pathways for risk control, and longitudinal interpretability monitoring for post-market surveillance. Techniques such as SHAP, LIME, Integrated Gradients, saliency mapping, and attention visualisation are mapped to corresponding DCB artefacts. ECSF reframes explainability as a core element of clinical-safety assurance, bridging deterministic risk governance with the probabilistic behaviour of AI and supporting alignment with GMLP, the EU AI Act, and NHS AI Assurance principles.</description>
