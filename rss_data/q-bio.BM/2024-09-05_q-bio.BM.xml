      <title>Computational Methods to Investigate Intrinsically Disordered Proteins and their Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1999 Wright and Dyson highlighted the fact that large sections of the proteome of all organisms are comprised of protein sequences that lack globular folded structures under physiological conditions. Since then the biophysics community has made significant strides in unraveling the intricate structural and dynamic characteristics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Unlike crystallographic beamlines and their role in streamlining acquisition of structures for folded proteins, an integrated experimental and computational approach aimed at IDPs/IDRs has emerged. In this Perspective we aim to provide a robust overview of current computational tools for IDPs and IDRs, and most recently their complexes and phase separated states, including statistical models, physics-based approaches, and machine learning methods that permit structural ensemble generation and validation against many solution experimental data types.</description>

      <title>Multiview Random Vector Functional Link Network for Predicting DNA-Binding Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) is a critical task due to their significant impact on various biological activities. Understanding the mechanisms underlying protein-DNA interactions is essential for elucidating various life activities. In recent years, machine learning-based models have been prominently utilized for DBP prediction. In this paper, to predict DBPs, we propose a novel framework termed a multiview random vector functional link (MvRVFL) network, which fuses neural network architecture with multiview learning. The proposed MvRVFL model combines the benefits of late and early fusion, allowing for distinct regularization parameters across different views while leveraging a closed-form solution to determine unknown parameters efficiently. The primal objective function incorporates a coupling term aimed at minimizing a composite of errors stemming from all views. From each of the three protein views of the DBP datasets, we extract five features. These features are then fused together by incorporating a hidden feature during the model training process. The performance of the proposed MvRVFL model on the DBP dataset surpasses that of baseline models, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. Furthermore, we extend our assessment to the UCI, KEEL, AwA, and Corel5k datasets, to establish the practicality of the proposed models. The consistency error bound, the generalization error bound, and empirical findings, coupled with rigorous statistical analyses, confirm the superior generalization capabilities of the MvRVFL model compared to the baseline models.</description>

      <title>CCPL: Cross-modal Contrastive Protein Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11783</link>

Abstract: Effective protein representation learning is crucial for predicting protein functions. Traditional methods often pretrain protein language models on large, unlabeled amino acid sequences, followed by finetuning on labeled data. While effective, these methods underutilize the potential of protein structures, which are vital for function determination. Common structural representation techniques rely heavily on annotated data, limiting their generalizability. Moreover, structural pretraining methods, similar to natural language pretraining, can distort actual protein structures. In this work, we introduce a novel unsupervised protein structure representation pretraining method, cross-modal contrastive protein learning (CCPL). CCPL leverages a robust protein language model and uses unsupervised contrastive alignment to enhance structure learning, incorporating self-supervised structural constraints to maintain intrinsic structural information. We evaluated our model across various benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's superiority.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of computational techniques, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as powerful tools in biomedical research, enabling in-depth investigations of biological systems at the atomic level. Among the diverse range of simulation software available, LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) has gained significant recognition for its versatility, scalability, and extensive range of functionalities. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the utilization of LAMMPS in the field of biomedical applications. This review begins by outlining the fundamental principles of MD simulations and highlighting the unique features of LAMMPS that make it suitable for biomedical research. Subsequently, a survey of the literature is conducted to identify key studies that have employed LAMMPS in various biomedical contexts, such as protein folding, drug design, biomaterials, and cellular processes. The reviewed studies demonstrate the remarkable contributions of LAMMPS in understanding the behavior of biological macromolecules, investigating drug-protein interactions, elucidating the mechanical properties of biomaterials, and studying cellular processes at the molecular level. Additionally, this review explores the integration of LAMMPS with other computational tools and experimental techniques, showcasing its potential for synergistic investigations that bridge the gap between theory and experiment. Moreover, this review discusses the challenges and limitations associated with using LAMMPS in biomedical simulations, including the parameterization of force fields, system size limitations, and computational efficiency. Strategies employed by researchers to mitigate these challenges are presented, along with potential future directions for enhancing LAMMPS capabilities in the biomedical field.</description>

      <title>Dynamic PDB: A New Dataset and a SE(3) Model Extension by Integrating Dynamic Behaviors and Physical Properties in Protein Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in static protein structure collection and prediction, the dynamic behavior of proteins, one of their most vital characteristics, has been largely overlooked in prior research. This oversight can be attributed to the limited availability, diversity, and heterogeneity of dynamic protein datasets. To address this gap, we propose to enhance existing prestigious static 3D protein structural databases, such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB), by integrating dynamic data and additional physical properties. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale dataset, Dynamic PDB, encompassing approximately 12.6K proteins, each subjected to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations lasting 1 microsecond to capture conformational changes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive suite of physical properties, including atomic velocities and forces, potential and kinetic energies of proteins, and the temperature of the simulation environment, recorded at 1 picosecond intervals throughout the simulations. For benchmarking purposes, we evaluate state-of-the-art methods on the proposed dataset for the task of trajectory prediction. To demonstrate the value of integrating richer physical properties in the study of protein dynamics and related model design, we base our approach on the SE(3) diffusion model and incorporate these physical properties into the trajectory prediction process. Preliminary results indicate that this straightforward extension of the SE(3) model yields improved accuracy, as measured by MAE and RMSD, when the proposed physical properties are taken into consideration. https://fudan-generative-vision.github.io/dynamicPDB/ .</description>
