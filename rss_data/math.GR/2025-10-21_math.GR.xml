      <title>A unit theorem for products of groups with several ends and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his $1994$ survey, Kleinert defined formally and formulated the problem to obtain unit theorems for unit groups of orders in a semisimple algebra $A$. If $A$ is a group algebra $FG$, it boils down to classifying all finite groups $G$ such that the unit groups of most orders in $FG$ belong to a prescribed class $\mathcal{G}$ of infinite groups. We solve this problem for $\mathcal{G}$ consisting of the groups which are virtually a direct product of groups whose Cayley graph has more than one end. Subsequently, we obtain two types of applications. A first type being about the existence of torsion-free normal complements and a second about obtaining short and uniform proofs of some of the main results in [13,18,14,15].</description>

      <title>Enhanced power graphs of finite groups with cograph structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhanced power graph, $\mathcal{E}(G)$, of a group $G$ has vertex set $G$ and two elements are adjacent if they generate a cyclic subgroup. In the case of finite groups, we identify some striking and unexpected properties of these graphs, as well as links between properties of $\mathcal{E}(G)$ and properties of the group $G$. We prove that if $\mathcal{E}(G)$ is a cograph then it is also a chordal graph. Making use of properties of simplicial vertices, we characterise the finite groups $G$ whose enhanced power graph is diamond-free or a block graph. We also characterise the finite groups having enhanced power graph a cograph or a quasi-threshold graph, and those with $C_4$-free enhanced power graph. We use these characterisations to classify the finite nonabelian simple groups whose enhanced power graph is a cograph and give information on the finite simple groups whose enhanced power graph is $C_4$-free. Some open problems are posed.</description>

      <title>Eventually periodic resolutions for groups of type $\textbf{VFP}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction of eventually periodic projective resolutions for modules of type $\textbf{FP}_{\infty}$ over the integral group rings of $\Gamma = G / (c)$ of type $\textbf{VFP}$, with $G$ of type $\textbf{FP}$ and $c$ a central element. Our approach also applies more generally to quotients of rings of finite left global dimension by a regular central element. It utilizes a construction of Shamash, combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically `purge' homology from a complex. We demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for several families of groups including hyperbolic triangle groups and mapping class groups of the punctured plane.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian expansion of congruence KMS complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coboundary expansion with non-Abelian coefficients is a strong version of high-dimensional expansion for simplicial complexes. One motivation for studying this notion is that it was recently shown to have deep connections to problems in theoretical computer science. However, very few examples of families of simplicial complexes with this type of expansion are known. Namely, prior to our work, the only known examples were quotients of symplectic buildings and a slight variation of the Kaufman-Oppenheim coset complexes construction associated with $\operatorname{SL}_{n} (\mathbb{F}_p [t])$.
  In this paper, we show that the Grave de Peralta and Valentiner-Branth constructions of KMS complexes have coboundary expansion with non-Abelian coefficients when it is performed with respect to congruence subgroups of Chevalley groups of classical type, i.e., of type $A_n, B_n, C_n$ and $D_n$. This gives four new sources of examples to this expansion phenomenon, thus significantly enriching our list of constructions.</description>

      <title>On colourings of cubic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the integral lattice $\Lambda^d$ in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, partitions of the lattice nodes into orbits of finite-index subgroups of $Aut(\Lambda^d)$ have been computed for $d \leq 4$. These partitions can be interpreted as colourings of orbits defined up to permutation of colours. Complete results are obtained for $d=2$ up to 64 orbits, for $d=3$ up to 8 orbits, and for 2 orbits in dimension 4. The automorphism groups of the partitions are also determined. Our results for two orbits in dimension 3 correct the old result of H. Heesch [Z. Kristallogr., (1933), 85, 335--344] who overlooked one partition.</description>

      <title>A Hurewicz-type Theorem for the Dynamic Asymptotic Dimension with Applications to Coarse Geometry and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13275v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Hurewicz-type theorem for the dynamic asymptotic dimension originally introduced by Guentner, Willett, and Yu. Calculations of (or simply upper bounds on) this dimension are known to have implications related to cohomology of group actions and the K-theory of their transformation group C*-algebras. Moreover, these implications are relevant to the current classification program for C*-algebras. As a corollary of our main theorem, we show the dynamic asymptotic dimension of actions by groups on profinite completions along sequential filtrations by normal subgroups is subadditive over extensions of groups, which shows that many such actions by elementary amenable groups are finite dimensional. We combine this with other novel results relating the dynamic asymptotic dimension of such an action to the asymptotic dimension of a corresponding box space. This allows us to give upper bounds on the asymptotic dimension of many box spaces (including examples from infinitely-many groups with exponential growth) using a generalization of the Hirsch length for elementary amenable groups. For some of these examples, we can also find lower bounds by utilizing the theory of ends of groups.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. A few years ago, Magee and the first named author discovered that the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices [arXiv:1802.04862]. But the random-matrix side of this equality can be naturally tweaked by considering $w$-random permutations, $w$-random orthogonal matrices and so on, to produce new invariants for any given word. Are these invariants new? interesting? Do they admit an intrinsic topological description as in the case of $w$-random unitaries and scl?
  The current paper formalizes the definition of these invariants coming from $w$-random matrices, answers the above questions in certain cases involving generalized symmetric groups, and poses detailed conjectures in many others. In particular, we present a plethora of topological, combinatorial and algebraic invariants of words which play, or are at least conjectured to play, a similar role to the one played by scl in the above-mentioned result. Among others, these invariants include two invariants recently defined by Wilton [arXiv:2210.09853]: the stable primitivity rank and a non-oriented analog of scl.</description>

Abstract: We construct an algorithm that, given a pair of homomorphisms between polycyclic-by-finite groups, determines whether their Reidemeister number is finite, and additionally returns a set of representatives of the twisted conjugacy classes if it is. Moreover, we show how this algorithm can be applied to compute double cosets and orbits of affine actions.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices II: Formulas and Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. As was revealed by Magee and Puder in [arXiv:1802.04862], the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices. In the first part of the current work [arXiv:2311.17733], we demonstrated how this phenomenon is much broader: we proved more instances of such results and conjectured others. These new results and conjectures involved other topological invariants (relatives of scl) and different families of groups.
  In the current paper we further extend and support this theory. We provide another instance of the theory and prove that the stable primitivity rank, too, can be expressed in terms of stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements of groups. We introduce concrete formulas for stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements in the symmetric group $S_N$ and its generalizations in the form of the wreath products $G\wr S_N$ where $G$ is an arbitrary compact group. We also define new stable invariants related to these groups, and prove they give bounds to many of the stable Fourier coefficients.
  As an aside, we generalize to tuples of words a result of Puder and Parzanchevski [arXiv:1202.3269] about the expected number of fixed points of $w$-random permutations.</description>

      <title>On the cabling of non-involutive set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the cabling method by Lebed, Ram\'irez and Vendramin from involutive to bijective non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation by working in the Yang--Baxter monoid $M(X,r)$ rather than the group $G(X,r)$. This shift in approach overcomes the obstruction that, for non-involutive solutions, the canonical map from $X$ to the Yang--Baxter group $G(X,r)$ need not be injective and yields a well-defined cabling. We prove that cabling is functorial on biquandles and that the diagonal map transforms as $q\mapsto q^k$. We also show that decomposability is preserved by injectivization and by passing to the associated biquandle, allowing us to work within that class without loss of generality. This leads to criteria for (in)decomposability. As an application, we obtain that square-free solutions with nilpotent derived monoid are decomposable.</description>

      <title>CayleyPy RL: Pathfinding and Reinforcement Learning on Cayley Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of studies on developing efficient artificial intelligence-based approaches to pathfinding on extremely large graphs (e.g. $10^{70}$ nodes) with a focus on Cayley graphs and mathematical applications. The open-source CayleyPy project is a central component of our research. The present paper proposes a novel combination of a reinforcement learning approach with a more direct diffusion distance approach from the first paper. Our analysis includes benchmarking various choices for the key building blocks of the approach: architectures of the neural network, generators for the random walks and beam search pathfinding. We compared these methods against the classical computer algebra system GAP, demonstrating that they "overcome the GAP" for the considered examples. As a particular mathematical application we examine the Cayley graph of the symmetric group with cyclic shift and transposition generators. We provide strong support for the OEIS-A186783 conjecture that the diameter is equal to n(n-1)/2 by machine learning and mathematical methods. We identify the conjectured longest element and generate its decomposition of the desired length. We prove a diameter lower bound of n(n-1)/2-n/2 and an upper bound of n(n-1)/2+ 3n by presenting the algorithm with given complexity. We also present several conjectures motivated by numerical experiments, including observations on the central limit phenomenon (with growth approximated by a Gumbel distribution), the uniform distribution for the spectrum of the graph, and a numerical study of sorting networks. To stimulate crowdsourcing activity, we create challenges on the Kaggle platform and invite contributions to improve and benchmark approaches on Cayley graph pathfinding and other tasks.</description>

Abstract: We establish a connection between two well-studied spaces of countable groups: the space of group operations and the space of marked groups. This connection shows that the two spaces are equivalent in terms of generic properties in the sense of Baire category, which allows us to translate several results from the former setting to the latter. As an application, we give new, shorter proofs of two theorems that concern the generic behavior of compact metrizable abelian groups.</description>

      <title>A generalized character related to the local structure and representation theory of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the generalized character $\Psi_{1,p,G}$ of a finite group $G$ which vanishes on all $p$-singular elements of $G$ and whose value at each $p$-regular $y \in G$ is the number of $p$-elements of $C_{G}(y)$. We conjecture that this is always a character, and may be afforded by a projective $RG$-module, where $R$ is an appropriate complete discrete valuation ring whose residue field has characteristic $p$. We examine a number of case where this is the case, and consider consequences for the representation theory and character theory of $G$ when this conjecture is known to hold. In particular, we prove, among other things, that the conjecture is valid for all primes $p$ in the case that $G \cong {\rm PSL}(2,q)$ or ${\rm SL}(2,q)$ for every prime power $q$.</description>
