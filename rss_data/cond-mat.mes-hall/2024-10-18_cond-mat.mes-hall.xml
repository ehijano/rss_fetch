      <title>Multihyperuniformity in high entropy MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MXenes are a large family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides that possess excellent electrical conductivity, high volumetric capacitance, great mechanical properties, and hydrophilicity. In this work, we generalize the concept of multihyperuniformity (MH), an exotic state that can exist in a disordered multi-component system, to two-dimensional materials MXenes. Disordered hyperuniform systems possess an isotropic local structure that lacks traditional translational and orientational order, yet they completely suppress infinite-wavelength density fluctuations as in perfect crystals and, in this sense, possess a hidden long-range order. In particular, we evaluate the static structure factor of the individual components present in the high entropy (HE) MXene experimental sample TiVCMoCr based on high-solution SEM imaging data, which suggests this HE MXene system is at least effectively multihyperuniform. We then devise a packing algorithm to generate multihyperuniform models of HE MXene systems. The MH HE MXenes are predicted to be energetically more stable compared to the prevailing (quasi)random models of the HE MXenes due to the hidden long-range order. Moreover, the MH structure exhibits a distinctly smaller lattice distortion, which has a vital effect on the electronic properties of HE MXenes, such as the density of states and charge distribution. This systematic study of HE MXenes strengthens our fundamental understanding of these systems, and suggests possible exotic physical properties, as endowed by the multihyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Variational Scarring in Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum eigenstate of a classically chaotic system is referred as scarred by an unstable periodic orbit if its probability density is concentrated in the vicinity of that orbit. Recently, a new class of scarring - variational scarring - was discovered in numerical studies of disordered quantum dots, arising from near-degeneracies in the quantum spectrum associated with classical resonances of the unperturbed system. Despite the increasing body of theoretical evidence on variational scarring, its experimental observation has remained out of reach. Motivated by this dearth, we argue and demonstrate that variational scarring can occur in an elliptical quantum dot fabricated on monolayer graphene, and locally perturbed by a nanotip. Then, we further show that the fingerprint of these variational scars can potentially be detected via scanning tunneling microscopy, thus offering an attractive experimental pathway for the first validation of this puzzling quantum-chaotic phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Thermally Interplayed Spin-Orbit Torque Driven Antiferromagnetic Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-induced antiferromagnetic (AFM) switching remains critical in spintronics, yet the interplay between thermal effects and spin torques still lacks clear clarification. Here we experimentally investigate the thermally interplayed spin-orbit torque induced AFM switching in magnetic tunnel junctions via pulse-width dependent reversal and time-resolved measurements. By introducing the Langevin random field into the AFM precession equation, we establish a novel AFM switching model that anatomically explains the experimental observations. Our findings elucidate the currentinduced AFM switching mechanism and offer significant promise for advancements in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance at the 10-9 level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.</description>

      <title>High-temperature ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity in ultraflexible atomically thin square-shaped lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of high-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetic ordering, large magnetic anisotropy, along with novel mechanical properties such as ferroelasticity and flexibility, in experimental feasible two-dimensional (2D) crystals is greatly appealing for nanoscale spintronics. However, the progress in identifying such materials is limited. Here, by first-principles calculations, we report the findings of an extraordinary combination of the above qualities for the first time in a new 2D exfoliated FeSi nanosheet in the P4/nmm space group. Due to the strong anion-mediated superexchange interaction, the monolayer FeSi (ML-FeSi) exhibits a Curie temperature Tc as high as 830 K, surpassing the current experimental record (344 K for ML-Cr3Te4). Furthermore, including FeSi, such isostructural lattices all demonstrate exceptional softness, as evidenced by their ultra-low in-plane stiffness. Remarkably, the transition metal atom and square-shaped crystal form work together to give this family of ML materials unique properties that can transition from Ising-like 2D ferromagnets in FeSi, MnP, MnAs, CrP, FeI, and VAs to 2D-XY ones in CrAs, VP, and multiferroic MnGe and TiTe. Overall, our work highlights such 2D lattices as promising candidates in emerging multifunctional device applications and nontrivial topological spintronics.</description>

      <title>Microsphere-assisted generation of localized optical emitters in 2D hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are emerging as versatile nanoscale optical probes with a wide application profile, spanning the fields of nanophotonics, biosensing, bioimaging and quantum information processing. However, generating these crystal defects as reliable optical emitters remains challenging due to the need for deterministic defect placement and precise control of the emission area. Here, we demonstrate an approach that integrates microspheres (MS) with hBN optical probes to enhance both defect generation and optical signal readout. This technique harnesses MS to amplify light-matter interactions at the nanoscale through 2 two mechanisms: focused femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation into a photonic nanojet for highly localized defect generation, and enhanced light collection via the whispering gallery mode effect. Our MS-assisted defect generation method reduces the emission area by a factor of 5 and increases the fluorescence collection efficiency by approximately 10 times compared to MS-free samples. These advancements in defect generation precision and signal collection efficiency open new possibilities for optical emitter manipulation in hBN, with potential applications in quantum technologies and nanoscale sensing.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning recognition and tracking of individual nanotubes in low-contrast microscopy videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of analyzing the growth kinetics of carbon nanotubes using in-situ homodyne polarization microscopy (HPM) by developing an automated deep learning (DL) approach. A Mask-RCNN architecture, enhanced with a ResNet-50 backbone, was employed to recognize and track individual nanotubes in microscopy videos, significantly improving the efficiency and reproducibility of kinetic data extraction. The method involves a series of video processing steps to enhance contrast and used differential treatment techniques to manage low signal and fast kinetics. The DL model demonstrates consistency with manual measurements and increased throughput, laying the foundation for statistical studies of nanotube growth. The approach can be adapted for other types of in-situ microscopy studies, emphasizing the importance of automation in high-throughput data acquisition for research on individual nano-objects.</description>

      <title>Automated classification of individual atoms on surfaces using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) for atomic-scale fabrication has led to many advancements such as the creation of atomic electron-spin qubit structures on surfaces. However, the time-consuming and tedious nature of this process calls for improvements, and this study explores the use of machine learning (ML) to automate certain steps, notably identifying appropriate atomic candidates for the structures. We classify titanium and iron atoms on a magnesium oxide (MgO) surface, which are prototypical on-surface spin qubit candidates, showing distinct topographic and spectroscopic features depending on the bonding sites of the MgO surface. Employing a semi-automated computer vision process, we train a convolutional neural network with STM topographic images and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) curves of several hundred atoms. After training, the topography model achieves an 86% validation accuracy in classifying 200 new images, and the STS model, a 100% accuracy for a sample size of 100 atoms. This method extends its applicability to various nanoscopic measurements, including atomically resolved imaging and local probing of electronic properties, offering a promising approach for classifying atoms and molecules on surfaces.</description>

      <title>On-chip cryogenic multiplexing of Si/SiGe quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenges of operating qubits in a cryogenic environment point to a looming bottleneck for large-scale quantum processors, limited by the number of input-output connections. Classical processors solve this problem via multiplexing; however, on-chip multiplexing circuits have not been shown to have similar benefits for cryogenic quantum devices. In this work we integrate classical circuitry and Si/SiGe quantum devices on the same chip, providing a test bed for qubit scale-up. Our method uses on-chip field-effect transistors (FETs) to multiplex a grid of work zones, achieving a nearly tenfold reduction in control wiring. We leverage this set-up to probe device properties across a 6x6mm$^2$ array of 16 Hall bars. We successfully operate the array at cryogenic temperatures and high magnetic fields where the quantum Hall effect is observed. Building upon these results, we propose a vision for readout in a large-scale silicon quantum processor with a limited number of control connections.</description>

      <title>Conductance in graphene through double laser barriers and magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-assisted charge transport through a double barrier laser structure, separated by a region assisted by a magnetic field, is studied. Employing Floquet theory and matrix formalism, the transmission probabilities for the central band and sidebands are calculated. The temporal periodicity of the laser fields creates an infinite number of transmission modes due to the degeneracy of the energy spectrum. The challenge of numerically addressing all modes necessitates the limitation to the first sideband corresponding to energies $\varepsilon\pm\varpi$. A critical phase difference between the two laser fields is found to cancel the transmission through the sidebands due to quantum interference. Varying the width of the region where the magnetic field is applied allows for the suppression of lateral transmission and control over the transmission mode. The intensity of the laser fields also allows for suppressing Klein tunneling and blocking transmission processes with zero photon exchange, as well as activating transmission processes with photon exchange. The conductance is also affected by changes in the system parameters. Increasing the intensity of the laser field reduces the conductance due to the confinement of the fermions by the laser fields. In addition, increasing the size of the region where the magnetic field is applied reduces the conductance because the increased distance gives the fermions a greater chance of diffusion and increases their interaction with the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Stabilization of Floquet States Using Static Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of non-classical states, such as high photon number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.</description>

      <title>Defect liquids in a weakly imbalanced bilayer Wigner Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a density-imbalanced bilayer Wigner crystal, where the ratio of electron densities in separate layers deviates slightly from unity, defects spontaneously form in one or both layers in the ground state of the system. Due to quantum tunneling, these defects become mobile and the system becomes a defect liquid. Motivated by this idea, we numerically study the semiclassical energetics of individual and paired point defects in the bilayer Wigner crystal system. We use these results in combination with a simple defect model to map the phase diagram of the defect liquid as a function of electron density and interlayer distance. Our results should be relevant for present experimental bilayer Wigner crystal systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring Non-Hermitian Topological Invariants Directly from Quench Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian (NH) topological phases and phenomena have been observed across various quantum systems, directly measuring NH topological invariants remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a generic and unified framework for the direct measurement of various NH topological invariants in odd-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. We demonstrate that in one-dimensional (1D) NH systems with sublattice symmetry, the line-gap winding number and point-gap braiding degree can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamically constructed field based on post-quench spin textures. Specifically, line-gap topology is characterized by integer-valued winding, whereas point-gap complex-band braiding is revealed by half-integer or integer winding with abrupt jumps. We also extend our approach to higher-dimensional winding numbers and non-Bloch topological invariants under open-boundary conditions. Additionally, we propose a practical cold-atom setup to realize and detect 1D NH topological phases, showing that our dynamical measurement scheme is feasible in current experimental settings. This work paves the way for the direct measurement of NH topological invariants in quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use several techniques to probe the wave functions proposed to describe the ${\cal A}$ phases by Das, Das, and Mandal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 056202 (2023); Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 106501 (2024); Phys. Rev. B 110, L121303 (2024).]. As opposed to representing fractional quantum Hall liquids, we find these wave functions to describe states that clearly display strong phase separation. In the process of exploring these wave functions, we have also constructed several new methods for diagnosing phase separation and generating such wave functions numerically. Finally, we uncover a new property of entanglement spectra that can be used as a check for the accuracy of numerics.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Magnetic Coupling in FePS$_{3}$ and NiPS$_{3}$ Stacked Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single layers of transition-metal thiophosphates (2D-TMPS$_{3}$) van der Waals magnets are an ideal platform for studying antiferromagnetic interactions in two dimensions. However, the magnetic coupling mechanism between two or more individual layers of these materials remains mostly unexplored. This study presents a density-functional based analysis and analytical models to describe the magnetic configurations of FePS$_{3}$ and NiPS$_{3}$ stacked bilayers. We explore the interplay between magnetic configurations and stacking shift, therefore identifying the mechanisms that result in either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling between layers. Our findings indicate that the stacking with the lowest energy is metal-dependent, and the interlayer magnetic configuration (ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic) varies based on the stacking type and the metal involved. Using an Ising-Hamiltonian model and a tight-binding model based on Wannier functions, we show that interlayer exchange interactions must be considered up to the third nearest neighbor and to elucidate the superexchange mechanism for the NiPS$_{3}$ system.</description>

      <title>Graphendofullerene: a novel molecular two-dimensional ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon chemistry has attracted a lot of attention by chemists, physicists and material scientists in the last decades. The recent discovery of graphullerene provides a promising platform for many applications due to its exceptional electronic properties and the possibility to host molecules or clusters inside the fullerene units. Herein, we introduce graphendofullerene, a novel molecular-based two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material formed by trimetallic nitrides clusters encapsulated on graphullerene. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the successful incorporation of the molecules into the 2D network formed by C$_{80}$ fullerenes, which leads to a robust long-range ferromagnetic order with a Curie temperature (Tc) of 38 K. Additionally, we achieve a 45% increase in Tc by strain engineering. These findings open the way for a new family of molecular 2D magnets based on graphendofullerene for advanced technologies.</description>

      <title>Path integral Monte Carlo in a discrete variable representation with Gibbs sampling: dipolar planar rotor chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach based on discretized continuous degrees of freedom and rejection-free Gibbs sampling. The ground state properties of a chain of planar rotors with dipole-dipole interactions are used to illustrate the approach. Energetic and structural properties are computed and compared to exact diagonalization and Numerical Matrix Multiplication for $N \leq 3$ to assess the systematic Trotter factorization error convergence. For larger chains with up to N = 100 rotors, Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations are used as a benchmark. We show that using Gibbs sampling is advantageous compared to traditional Metroplolis-Hastings rejection importance sampling. Indeed, Gibbs sampling leads to lower variance and correlation in the computed observables.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Automated Alloy Design with Graph Neural Network-Powered LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multi-agent AI model is used to automate the discovery of new metallic alloys, integrating multimodal data and external knowledge including insights from physics via atomistic simulations. Our multi-agent system features three key components: (a) a suite of LLMs responsible for tasks such as reasoning and planning, (b) a group of AI agents with distinct roles and expertise that dynamically collaborate, and (c) a newly developed graph neural network (GNN) model for rapid retrieval of key physical properties. A set of LLM-driven AI agents collaborate to automate the exploration of the vast design space of MPEAs, guided by predictions from the GNN. We focus on the NbMoTa family of body-centered cubic (bcc) alloys, modeled using an ML-based interatomic potential, and target two key properties: the Peierls barrier and solute/screw dislocation interaction energy. Our GNN model accurately predicts these atomic-scale properties, providing a faster alternative to costly brute-force calculations and reducing the computational burden on multi-agent systems for physics retrieval. This AI system revolutionizes materials discovery by reducing reliance on human expertise and overcoming the limitations of direct all-atom simulations. By synergizing the predictive power of GNNs with the dynamic collaboration of LLM-based agents, the system autonomously navigates vast alloy design spaces, identifying trends in atomic-scale material properties and predicting macro-scale mechanical strength, as demonstrated by several computational experiments. This approach accelerates the discovery of advanced alloys and holds promise for broader applications in other complex systems, marking a significant step forward in automated materials design.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we propose two strategies to determine complex refractive indexes along armchair and zigzag axes for BP flakes, aiming in predicting angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) intensity by explicitly considering birefringence, linear dichroism, and anisotropic cavity interference effects within multilayered structures. By leveraging this methodology, we have identified the intrinsic complex Raman tensors for phonon modes of BP flakes, independent of BP flake thickness (&gt;20 nm). We also elucidated the flake thickness-dependent effective complex Raman tensor elements, allowing for precise prediction of the observed ARPR intensity profile for specific BP flake. This framework can be extended to other ALM flakes deposited on dielectric substrate to determine the Raman tensors for fully predicting their ARPR response.</description>

      <title>Impact of potential and temperature fluctuations on charge and heat transport in quantum Hall edges in the heat Coulomb blockade regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a broad study of charge and heat transport in a mesoscopic system where one or several quantum Hall edge channels are strongly coupled to a floating Ohmic contact (OC). It is well known that charge-current fluctuations emanating from the OC along the edge channels are highly susceptible to the OC charge capacitance in the heat Coulomb blockade regime (an impeded ability of the OC to equilibrate edge channels). Here, we demonstrate how potential- and temperature fluctuations due to finite OC charge and heat capacities impact the heat-current fluctuations emitted from the OC. First, by assuming an infinite OC heat capacity, we show that the output heat-current noise is strongly dependent on the OC charge capacitance, following from a close relation between one-dimensional charge- and heat currents. When also the OC heat capacity is finite, an interplay of potential- and temperature fluctuations influences the heat transport. Concretely, we find that the effect of the charge capacitance on heat transport manifests in terms of a strongly increased energy relaxation time in the heat Coulomb blockade regime. Furthermore, we find expressions for a broad set of output observables, such as charge and heat auto- and cross correlations, as functions of input and OC fluctuations, depending on the relation between charge and energy relaxation times compared to the frequency of fluctuations and inverse (local) temperatures as well as on the number of edge channels attached to the OC. Finally, we show that a finite OC heat capacity transforms the full counting statistics of the output charge from Gaussian to non-Gaussian. Our findings provide novel opportunities to experimentally probe and harness the quantum nature of heat transport in strongly coupled electron circuits.</description>

      <title>Isolated zero-energy flat-bands and intrinsic magnetism in carbon monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat-band in twisted graphene bilayer has garnered widespread attention, and whether flat-bands can be realized in carbon monolayer is an interesting topic worth exploring in condensed matter physics. In this work, we demonstrate that, based on the theory of compact localized states, a series of two-dimensional carbon allotropes with flat-bands can be achieved. Two of them named as 191-8-66-C-r567x-1 and 191-10-90-C-r567x-1 are confirmed to be dynamically stable carbon phases with isolated or weakly overlapped flat-bands at the Fermi-level. The maximum Fermi velocities of the flat-band electrons are evaluated to be 1x10^4 m/s and 0.786x10^4 m/s, both of which are lower than the Fermi velocity of the flat-band electrons in magic-angle graphene (4x10^4 m/s). Furthermore, 191-8-66-C-r567x-1 has been confirmed to be a flat-band related magnetic half-metal with a magnetic moment of 1.854 miuB per cell, while 191-10-90-C-r567x-1 is a flat-band related magnetic normal metal with a magnetic moment of 1.663 miuB per cell. These results not only show that flat-bands can be constructed in carbon monolayer, but also indicate the potential for achieving metal-free magnetic materials with light elements based on flat-band theory.</description>

      <title>Exchange-enhanced spin-orbit splitting and its density dependence for electrons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that spin-orbit splitting (SOS) in monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is substantially enhanced by electron-electron interaction. This effect, similar to the exchange-enhancement of the electron g-factor, is most pronounced for conduction band electrons (in particular, in MoS$_2$), and it has a non-monotonic dependence on the carrier sheet density, $n$. That is, the SOS enhancement is peaked at the onset of filling of the higher-energy spin-split band by electrons, $n_*$, which also separates the regimes of slow (at $n&lt;n_*$) and fast (for $n&gt;n_*$) spin and valley relaxation of charge carriers. Moreover, this density itself is determined by the enhanced SOS value, making the account of exchange renormalisation important for the analysis of spintronic performance of field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional TMDs.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum States for the Interacting Hofstadter Model with Higher Local Occupations and Long-Range Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their immense representative power, neural network quantum states (NQS) have gained significant interest in current research. In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dissipative phase transition in a head-to-tail Bose Josephson junction. The quantum phase transition has the same origin as the one in a resistively shunted Josephson junction, but the intrinsic momentum coupling between the Josephson mode and the bath modes enables us to observe the dissipative phase transition without any synthetic dissipation. We show that the interatomic interaction strength plays the role of the damping parameter. Consequently, in contrast to a resistively shunted Josephson circuit, the Bose Josephson junction can exhibit an insulating phase in a wider parameter region by increasing the repulsive interaction strength, which is robust against nonperturbative effects. We argue that tight transverse confinement of the quasi-one-dimensional atomic gas allows us to reach the insulating phase.</description>

Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (PLG) has attracted significant attention due to its potential for observing exotic quantum states. In this work, we present a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory for the FQAH effect in rhombohedral PLG. In particular, we focus on the convergence of the Hartree-Fock calculation with various reference fields and discuss the stability of the FQAH states in PLG. We show that the so-called charge neutrality scheme provides an unambiguous result for the Hartree-Fock calculation, as it ensures a convergence with respect to the momentum cutoff. Based on the Hartree-Fock band structure, we further carry out exact diagonalization calculations to explore the stability of the FQAH states in PLG. Our work provides an improved and unified (minimal) theoretical framework to understand the FQAH effect in rhombohedral PLG and paves the way for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly modifies conserved currents, introducing new contributions. For Maxwell gauge fields, this leads to a contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the chiral magnetic effect, which is widely discussed in the literature. In the case of gravitational fields, as we demonstrate, the anomaly induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the potential manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and hydrodynamics in chiral media, and we also comment on backreaction effects in electrodynamics. In each case, we observe the systematic appearance of Beltrami-type fields. In electrodynamics and hydrodynamics, a Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector parallel to its own curl. We propose a generalization of Beltrami fields for tensorial gravitational perturbations, calling the respective solutions to the gravitational equations gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics of chiral media, vorticity asymptotically forms a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>
