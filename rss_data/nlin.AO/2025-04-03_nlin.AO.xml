      <title>On the threshold of excitable systems: An energy-based perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental characteristic of excitable systems is their ability to exhibit distinct subthreshold and suprathreshold behaviors. Precisely quantifying this distinction requires a proper definition of the threshold, which has remained elusive in neurodynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel, energy-based threshold definition for excitable circuits grounded in dissipativity theory, specifically using the classical concept of required supply. According to our definition, the threshold corresponds to a local maximum of the required supply, clearly separating subthreshold passive responses from suprathreshold regenerative spikes. We illustrate and validate the proposed definition through analytical and numerical studies of three canonical systems: a simple RC circuit, the FitzHugh--Nagumo model, and the biophysically detailed Hodgkin--Huxley model.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in bus systems with partially overlapping routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an increasingly interconnected world, understanding congestion-related phenomena in transportation and their underlying mechanisms is crucial for improving efficiency. As the transportation system becomes denser, different modes of transportation have more opportunities to interact with each other, giving rise to emergent dynamics that simple models cannot explain. In this study, we investigate the synchronized motion of indirectly coupled transportation modes. We develop a numerical simulation model on a one-dimensional periodic lattice, where each point represents a bus station. In this system, two types of buses operate: multiple local buses with non-overlapping routes, each serving a specific zone, and a single global bus that partially overlaps with the routes of the local buses. We perform numerical simulations to examine how close the arrival times of these buses are to each other -- that is, how synchronized their motions are. When the number of zones is two, three, or five, robust synchronization occurs not only between the global bus and the local buses, but also among the local buses themselves. In contrast, no synchronization is found for other numbers of zones. We developed a mathematical model using self-consistent equations and found that two distinct arrival patterns at the terminals must be considered. A stability analysis reveals which pattern is ultimately realized in the simulations. Our results show that transportation modes can exhibit coherent motion even when sharing only partial or no direct route overlaps. This outcome highlights that emergent behavior depends not only on local interactions but is also strongly shaped by the system's overall structural configuration.</description>

      <title>The Less Intelligent the Elements, the More Intelligent the Whole. Or, Possibly Not?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.12689v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We approach the debate on how ``intelligent'' artificial agents should be, by endowing the preys and predators of the Lotka-Volterra model with behavioural algorithms characterized by different levels of sophistication. We find that by endowing both preys and predators with the capability of making predictions based on linear extrapolation a novel sort of dynamic equilibrium appears, where both species co-exist while both populations grow indefinitely. While we confirm that, in general, simple agents favour the emergence of complex collective behaviour, we also suggest that the capability of individuals to take first-order derivatives of one other's behaviour may allow the collective computation of derivatives of any order.</description>

      <title>Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the pair of differential equations $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\'{e}nard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</description>
