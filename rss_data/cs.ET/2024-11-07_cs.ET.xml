      <title>Shem: A Hardware-Aware Optimization Framework for Analog Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for efficient data processing escalates, reconfigurable analog hardware which implements novel analog compute paradigms, is promising for energy-efficient computing at the sensing and actuation boundaries. These analog computing platforms embed information in physical properties and then use the physics of materials, devices, and circuits to perform computation. These hardware platforms are more sensitive to nonidealities, such as noise and fabrication variations, than their digital counterparts and accrue high resource costs when programmable elements are introduced. Identifying resource-efficient analog system designs that mitigate these nonidealities is done manually today.
  While design optimization frameworks have been enormously successful in other fields, such as photonics, they typically either target linear dynamical systems that have closed-form solutions or target a specific differential equation system and then derive the solution through hand analysis. In both cases, time-domain simulation is no longer needed to predict hardware behavior. In contrast, described analog hardware platforms have nonlinear time-evolving dynamics that vary substantially from design to design, lack closed-form solutions, and require the optimizer to consider time explicitly. We present Shem, an optimization framework for analog systems. Shem leverages differentiation methods recently popularized to train neural ODEs to enable the optimization of analog systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics, noise and mismatch, and discrete behavior. We evaluate Shem on oscillator-based pattern recognizer, CNN edge detector, and transmission-line security primitive design case studies and demonstrate it can improve designs. To our knowledge, the latter two design problems have not been optimized with automated methods before.</description>

      <title>UniTraj: Universal Human Trajectory Modeling from Billion-Scale Worldwide Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human trajectory modeling is essential for deciphering movement patterns and supporting advanced applications across various domains. However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</description>

      <title>Personal Data Protection in AI-Native 6G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As 6G evolves into an AI-native technology, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and Generative AI into cellular communication systems presents unparalleled opportunities for enhancing connectivity, network optimization, and personalized services. However, these advancements also introduce significant data protection challenges, as AI models increasingly depend on vast amounts of personal data for training and decision-making. In this context, ensuring compliance with stringent data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), becomes critical for the design and operational integrity of 6G networks. These regulations shape key system architecture aspects, including transparency, accountability, fairness, bias mitigation, and data security.
  This paper identifies and examines the primary data protection risks associated with AI-driven 6G networks, focusing on the complex data flows and processing activities throughout the 6G lifecycle. By exploring these risks, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the potential privacy implications and propose effective mitigation strategies. Our findings stress the necessity of embedding privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default principles in the development of 6G standards to ensure both regulatory compliance and the protection of individual rights.</description>

      <title>Two Sides of the Same Coin: Large-scale Measurements of Builder and Rollup after EIP-4844</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Web3 is reshaping decentralized ecosystems through innovations like Ethereum. Recently, EIP-4844 is implemented in Ethereum to support its Layer-2 scaling solutions, which introduces a new 128 KB data structure called blob. This upgrade incorporates type-3 transactions with blobs to verify data availability and reduce gas costs for rollups, significantly affecting the strategies of both builders and rollups. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of emerging strategies in builder and rollup markets after EIP-4844, containing hundred million transactions. We find that the efficiency of builder and rollup strategies is interdependent, akin to two sides of the same coin -- both cannot be optimized simultaneously. That is, when builders operate efficiently, rollups tend to overpay in fees, conversely, when rollups optimize their costs, builders may incur losses in inefficient transaction selection. From the side of builders, our results show that 29.48% of these blocks have been constructed inefficiently, which does not produce sufficient profits for builders. Through our evaluation from the side of rollups, we find that over 72.53% of type-3 transactions pay unnecessary fees, leading to notable economic costs of rollups. Our work provides critical insights into optimizing block construction and transaction strategies, advancing the economic efficiency and data scalability of Web3 infrastructures, yet, much like balancing a seesaw, the efficiency of builders and rollups cannot be optimized concurrently.</description>

      <title>Distributed Binary Optimization with In-Memory Computing: An Application for the SAT Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) has been shown to be a promising approach for solving binary optimization problems while significantly reducing energy and latency. Building on the advantages of parallel computation, we propose an IMC-compatible parallelism framework inspired by parallel tempering (PT), enabling cross-replica communication to improve the performance of IMC solvers. This framework enables an IMC solver not only to improve performance beyond what can be achieved through parallelization, but also affords greater flexibility for the search process with low hardware overhead. We justify that the framework can be applied to almost any IMC solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework for the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, using the WalkSAT heuristic as a proxy for existing IMC solvers. The resulting PT-inspired cooperative WalkSAT (PTIC-WalkSAT) algorithm outperforms the traditional WalkSAT heuristic in terms of the iterations-to-solution in 76.3% of the tested problem instances and its na\"ive parallel variant (PA-WalkSAT) does so in 68.4% of the instances. An estimate of the energy overhead of the PTIC framework for two hardware accelerator architectures indicates that in both cases the overhead of running the PTIC framework would be less than 1% of the total energy required to run each accelerator.</description>

      <title>The Roles of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Internet of Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advancements of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, their capabilities are expanding significantly beyond content generation and the models are increasingly being used across diverse applications. Particularly, GenAI shows great potential in addressing challenges in the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem ranging from charging management to cyber-attack prevention. In this paper, we specifically consider Internet of electric vehicles (IoEV) and we categorize GenAI for IoEV into four different layers namely, EV's battery layer, individual EV layer, smart grid layer, and security layer. We introduce various GenAI techniques used in each layer of IoEV applications. Subsequently, public datasets available for training the GenAI models are summarized. Finally, we provide recommendations for future directions. This survey not only categorizes the applications of GenAI in IoEV across different layers but also serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners by highlighting the design and implementation challenges within each layer. Furthermore, it provides a roadmap for future research directions, enabling the development of more robust and efficient IoEV systems through the integration of advanced GenAI techniques.</description>

      <title>GIS Copilot: Towards an Autonomous GIS Agent for Spatial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with established GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS as an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and code through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS tools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the development of a "GIS Copilot" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS using natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was evaluated based on three complexity levels: basic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to perform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes with multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which involve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user instructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes the necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates strong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success rate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks, while challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This study contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway for non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior expertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.</description>
