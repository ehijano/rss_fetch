      <title>Reducing Student Distraction Through Fuzzy Logic Based Seating Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial skill for primary school teachers is maintaining efficient classroom management. Teachers use classroom seating arrangements to help maintain this efficiency. However, developing classroom seating arrangements is both time-consuming and often non-optimal for distraction mitigation. Fuzzy logic-based approaches for the development of classroom seating arrangements can reduce development time and minimize classroom distraction. In this study, an original fuzzy logic-based software package named "CUB" is introduced and applied to a modern classroom using "cluster" seating arrangements. The combination of fuzzy inference systems, fuzzy c-means clustering, sequential, and iterative processes produce ready-to-use seating arrangements for the classroom in this study. The seating arrangements are compared with an existing set of seating arrangements to validate the results. The author's findings show that CUB is successful in generating applicable seating arrangements with a small liklihood of replicating arrangements. The findings also suggest that fuzz logic-based approaches may be successful in other styles of classroom arrangement.</description>

      <title>First Order Logic with Fuzzy Semantics for Describing and Recognizing Nerves in Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with the description and recognition of fiber bundles, in particular nerves, in medical images, based on the anatomical description of the fiber trajectories. To this end, we propose a logical formalization of this anatomical knowledge. The intrinsically imprecise description of nerves, as found in anatomical textbooks, leads us to propose fuzzy semantics combined with first-order logic. We define a language representing spatial entities, relations between these entities and quantifiers. A formula in this language is then a formalization of the natural language description. The semantics are given by fuzzy representations in a concrete domain and satisfaction degrees of relations. Based on this formalization, a spatial reasoning algorithm is proposed for segmentation and recognition of nerves from anatomical and diffusion magnetic resonance images, which is illustrated on pelvic nerves in pediatric imaging, enabling surgeons to plan surgery.</description>

      <title>A Generalised Framework for Property-Driven Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to satisfy critical safety and correctness properties after training, highlighting the pressing need for training methods that incorporate such properties directly. While adversarial training can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within $\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems and natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region specifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Meanwhile, differentiable logics offer a way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss terms that guide the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In this paper, we investigate how these two complementary approaches can be unified within a single framework for property-driven machine learning. We show that well-known properties from the literature are subcases of this general approach, and we demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study involving a neural network controller for a drone system. Our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.</description>

      <title>Decomposing graphs into stable and ordered parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connections between structural graph theory and finite model theory recently gained a lot of attention. In this setting, many interesting question remain on the properties of hereditary dependent (NIP) classes of graphs, in particular related to first-order transductions.
  Motivated by Simon's decomposition theorem of dependent types into a stable part and a distal (order-like) part, we conjecture that every hereditary dependent class of graphs is transduction-equivalent to a hereditary dependent class of partially ordered graphs, where the cover graph of the partial order has bounded treewidth and the unordered graph is (edge) stable.
  In this paper, we consider the first non-trivial case (classes with bounded linear cliquewidth) and prove that the conjecture holds in a strong form, where the cover graph of the partial order has bounded pathwidth. Then, we extend our study to classes that admit bounded-size bounded linear cliquewidth covers, and prove that the conjecture holds for these classes, too.</description>
