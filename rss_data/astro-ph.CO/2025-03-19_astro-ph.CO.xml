      <title>Searching for rotation in X-COP galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for evidence of rotational support by analyzing the thermodynamic profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM) in a sample of nearby, massive galaxy clusters. For each object of the XMM-Newton Cluster Outskirts Project (X-COP) sample, we present axisymmetric models of rotating ICM with composite polytropic distributions, in equilibrium in spherically symmetric dark halos, exploring cases both with and without turbulent support in the ICM. The profile of rotation velocity and the distribution of turbulent velocity dispersion are described with flexible functional forms, consistent with the properties of synthetic clusters formed in cosmological simulations. The models are tuned via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to reproduce the radial profiles of the thermodynamic variables as resolved in the XMM-Newton and Planck maps, and to be consistent with the mass distributions estimated either from weak lensing observations (when available) or under the assumption of a "universal" value of the baryon fraction. Our models indicate that there is room for non-negligible rotation in the ICM of massive clusters, with typical peak rotation speed 300 km/s and peak rotation-velocity-to-velocity-dispersion ratio of 0.3. According to our models, the ICM in Abell 2255 can have a rotation speed as high as 500 km/s, corresponding to a rotation-velocity-to-velocity-dispersion ratio of 0.3, at a distance of 100 kpc from the center, where the X-ray emissivity is still high. This makes Abell 2255 a very promising candidate for the presence of rotation in the ICM that could be detected with the currently operating XRISM observatory, as we demonstrate computing and analyzing a mock X-ray spectrum.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey: Modeling strategy for multiprobe cluster cosmology and validation for the Full Six-year Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an updated To&amp;Krause2021 model for joint analyses of cluster abundances and large-scale two-point correlations of weak lensing and galaxy and cluster clustering (termed CL+3x2pt analysis) and validate that this model meets the systematic accuracy requirements of analyses with the statistical precision of the final Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 6 (Y6) dataset. The validation program consists of two distinct approaches, (1) identification of modeling and parameterization choices and impact studies using simulated analyses with each possible model misspecification (2) end-to-end validation using mock catalogs from customized Cardinal simulations that incorporate realistic galaxy populations and DES-Y6-specific galaxy and cluster selection and photometric redshift modeling, which are the key observational systematics. In combination, these validation tests indicate that the model presented here meets the accuracy requirements of DES-Y6 for CL+3x2pt based on a large list of tests for known systematics. In addition, we also validate that the model is sufficient for several other data combinations: the CL+GC subset of this data vector (excluding galaxy--galaxy lensing and cosmic shear two-point statistics) and the CL+3x2pt+BAO+SN (combination of CL+3x2pt with the previously published Y6 DES baryonic acoustic oscillation and Y5 supernovae data).</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Cosmological Constraints from Cluster Abundances, Weak Lensing, and Galaxy Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters provide a unique probe of the late-time cosmic structure and serve as a powerful independent test of the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work presents the first set of cosmological constraints derived with ~16,000 optically selected redMaPPer clusters across nearly 5,000 $\rm{deg}^2$ using DES Year 3 data sets. Our analysis leverages a consistent modeling framework for galaxy cluster cosmology and DES-Y3 joint analyses of galaxy clustering and weak lensing (3x2pt), ensuring direct comparability with the DES-Y3 3x2pt analysis. We obtain constraints of $S_8 = 0.864 \pm 0.035$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}} = 0.265^{+0.019}_{-0.031}$ from the cluster-based data vector. We find that cluster constraints and 3x2pt constraints are consistent under the $\Lambda$CDM model with a Posterior Predictive Distribution (PPD) value of $0.53$. The consistency between clusters and 3x2pt provides a stringent test of $\Lambda$CDM across different mass and spatial scales. Jointly analyzing clusters with 3x2pt further improves cosmological constraints, yielding $S_8 = 0.811^{+0.022}_{-0.020}$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}} = 0.294^{+0.022}_{-0.033}$, a $24\%$ improvement in the $\Omega_{\rm{m}}-S_8$ figure-of-merit over 3x2pt alone. Moreover, we find no significant deviation from the Planck CMB constraints with a probability to exceed (PTE) value of $0.6$, significantly reducing previous $S_8$ tension claims. Finally, combining DES 3x2pt, DES clusters, and Planck CMB places an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.26$ eV at 95% confidence under the $\Lambda$CDM model. These results establish optically selected clusters as a key cosmological probe and pave the way for cluster-based analyses in upcoming Stage-IV surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman.</description>

      <title>Stringent Constraints on Self-Interacting Dark Matter Using Milky-Way Satellite Galaxies Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) has been proposed to address small-scale challenges faced by the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, such as the diverse density profiles observed in dwarf galaxies. In this study, we analyze the kinematics of dwarf galaxies by incorporating the effects of gravothermal core collapse into SIDM models using a semi-analytical subhalo framework. Our analysis covers the stellar kinematics of both classical and ultrafaint dwarf galaxies. The results indicate a bimodal preference for small and large self-interaction cross sections in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, while in classical dwarfs, larger cross sections progressively decrease the model's statistical support. The combined analysis decisively prefers CDM to SIDM when the self-interaction cross section per unit mass, $\sigma/m$, exceeds $\sim$0.2 cm$^2$/g, if a velocity-independent cross section is assumed. Our study significantly enhances our understanding of dark matter dynamics on small scales.</description>

      <title>Consistencies and inconsistencies in redshift-independent distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redshift-independent distances underpin much of astrophysics, and there exists a plethora of methods to estimate them. However, the extent to which the distances they imply are consistent, while crucial for the integrity of the distance ladder, has been little explored. We construct a statistical framework to assess both internal (between measurements with the same method) and external (between-method) consistency by comparing differences between distances to their quoted statistical uncertainties in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database of Distances (NED-D). 66 of the 76 indicators in NED-D are amenable to a consistency test by having at least two measurements to the same galaxy or at least one measurement to a galaxy also measured by another method. We find that only 12 of these methods produce self-consistent distances across literature determinations, of which 7 are also consistent with distances to the same galaxies measured by all other methods. The most consistent 6 methods (M-stars luminosity, Novae, Masers, Globular Cluster Fundamental Plane, O- and B-type Supergiants and BL Lac Luminosity) also give similar average distances to the mean of all indicators, while the 7th (Proper Motion) underestimates distances relative to the mean by 17.1%. We also investigate consistency of Cepheid distances in the SH0ES 2022 catalogue, finding no evidence for unaccounted-for systematics. Our NED-D results imply that considerable work remains to obtain reliable distances by a multitude of methods, a crucial endeavour for constructing a multiply cross checked and fully robust distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Deep Chandra observations of PLCKG287.0+32.9: a clear detection of a shock front in a heated former cool core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive, hot galaxy cluster PSZ2 G286.98+32.90 (hereafter PLCKG287, z=0.383) hosts a giant radio halo and two prominent radio relics which are signs of a disturbed dynamical state. However, despite optical and radio observations indicate a clear multiple merger, the X-ray emission of the cluster, derived from XMM-Newton observations, shows only moderate disturbance. We present new 200 ks Chandra observations of PLCKG287. We detect a shock front to the NW direction at a distance of ~390 kpc from the X-ray peak, characterized by a Mach number M~1.3, as well as a cold front at a distance of ~300 kpc from the X-ray peak, nested in the same direction of the shock in a typical configuration expected by a merger. We also find evidence for X-ray depressions to the E and W, that could be the signature of feedback from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The radial profile of the thermodynamic quantities show a temperature and abundance peak in the cluster center, where also the pressure and entropy have a rapid increase. Based on these properties, we argue that PLCKG287 is what remains of a cool core after a heating event. We estimate that both the shock energy and the AGN feedback energy, implied by the analysis of the X-ray cavities, are sufficient to heat the core to the observed temperature of ~17 keV in the central ~160 kpc. We discuss the possible origin of the detected shock by investigating alternative scenarios of merger and AGN outburst, finding that they are both energetically viable. However, no single model seems able to explain all the X-ray features detected in this system. This suggests that the combined action of merger and central AGN feedback is likely necessary to explain the reheated cool core, the large-scale shock and the cold front. The synergy of these two processes may act in shaping the distribution of cool core and non cool core clusters. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>How many simulations do we need for simulation-based inference in cosmology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How many simulations do we need to train machine learning methods to extract information available from summary statistics of the cosmological density field? Neural methods have shown the potential to extract non-linear information available from cosmological data. Success depends critically on having sufficient simulations for training the networks and appropriate network architectures. In the first detailed convergence study of neural network training for cosmological inference, we show that currently available simulation suites, such as the Quijote Latin Hypercube(LH) with 2000 simulations, do not provide sufficient training data for a generic neural network to reach the optimal regime, even for the dark matter power spectrum, and in an idealized case. We discover an empirical neural scaling law that predicts how much information a neural network can extract from a highly informative summary statistic, the dark matter power spectrum, as a function of the number of simulations used to train the network, for a wide range of architectures and hyperparameters. We combine this result with the Cramer-Rao information bound to forecast the number of training simulations needed for near-optimal information extraction. To verify our method we created the largest publicly released simulation data set in cosmology, the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ), consisting of 32,768 $\Lambda$CDM n-body simulations uniformly covering the $\Lambda$CDM parameter space. Our method enables efficient planning of simulation campaigns for machine learning applications in cosmology, while the BSQ dataset provides an unprecedented resource for studying the convergence behavior of neural networks in cosmological parameter inference. Our results suggest that new large simulation suites or new training approaches will be necessary to achieve information-optimal parameter inference from non-linear simulations.</description>

      <title>Over-Luminous Type Ia Supernovae and Standard Candle Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators due to their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light-curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe Ia as standard candles in measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of eight over-luminous SNe Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimates, exhibiting closer concordance with $H_0$ estimates derived from early-universe data. This investigation potentially represent a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Populating Large N-body Simulations with LRGs Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of state-of-the-art cosmological surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey requires high-resolution, large-volume simulations. However, the computational cost of hydrodynamical simulations at these scales is prohibitive. Instead, dark matter (DM)-only simulations are used, with galaxies populated a posteriori, typically via halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. While effective, HOD models are statistical in nature and lack full physical motivation.
  In this work, we explore using neural networks (NNs) to learn the complex, physically motivated relationships between DM haloes and galaxy properties. Trained on small-volume, high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, our NN predicts galaxy properties in a larger DM-only simulation and determines which galaxies should be classified as luminous red galaxies (LRGs).
  Comparing the original LRG sample to the one generated by our NN, we find that, while the subhalo mass distributions are similar, our NN selects fewer low-mass subhaloes as LRG hosts, possibly due to the absence of baryonic feedback effects in DM-only simulations. This feedback could brighten or redden galaxies, altering their classification.
  Finally, we generate a new LRG sample by fitting an HOD model to the NN-generated LRG sample. We verify that both the HOD- and NN-generated samples preserve a set of bias parameter relations, which assume that the higher-order parameters, $b_{s2}$ and $b_{3\rm{nl}}$, are determined by the linear bias parameter $b_{1}$. These relations are commonly used to simplify clustering analyses.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropy at arcminute resolution over three frequency bands centered on 98, 150 and 220 GHz. The maps are based on data collected with the AdvancedACT camera over the period 2017--2022 and cover 19,000 square degrees with a median combined depth of 10 uK arcmin. We describe the instrument, mapmaking and map properties and illustrate them with a number of figures and tables. The ACT DR6 maps and derived products are available on LAMBDA at https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/act/actadv_prod_table.html. We also provide an interactive web atlas at https://phy-act1.princeton.edu/public/snaess/actpol/dr6/atlas and HiPS data sets in Aladin (e.g. https://alasky.cds.unistra.fr/ACT/DR4DR6/color_CMB).</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Power Spectra, Likelihoods and $\Lambda$CDM Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy in temperature and polarization, measured from the Data Release 6 maps made from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. These cover 19,000 deg$^2$ of sky in bands centered at 98, 150 and 220 GHz, with white noise levels three times lower than Planck in polarization. We find that the ACT angular power spectra estimated over 10,000 deg$^2$, and measured to arcminute scales in TT, TE and EE, are well fit by the sum of CMB and foregrounds, where the CMB spectra are described by the $\Lambda$CDM model. Combining ACT with larger-scale Planck data, the joint P-ACT dataset provides tight limits on the ingredients, expansion rate, and initial conditions of the universe. We find similar constraining power, and consistent results, from either the Planck power spectra or from ACT combined with WMAP data, as well as from either temperature or polarization in the joint P-ACT dataset. When combined with CMB lensing from ACT and Planck, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Y1), we measure a baryon density of $\Omega_b h^2=0.0226\pm0.0001$, a cold dark matter density of $\Omega_c h^2=0.118\pm0.001$, a Hubble constant of $H_0=68.22\pm0.36$ km/s/Mpc, a spectral index of $n_s=0.974\pm0.003$, and an amplitude of density fluctuations of $\sigma_8=0.813\pm0.005$. We find no evidence for excess lensing in the power spectrum, and no departure from spatial flatness. The contribution from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) anisotropy is detected at high significance; we find evidence for a tilt with suppressed small-scale power compared to our baseline SZ template spectrum, consistent with hydrodynamical simulations with feedback.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Constraints on Extended Cosmological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use new cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) to test foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model and set constraints on extensions to it. We derive constraints from the ACT DR6 power spectra alone, as well as in combination with legacy data from Planck. To break geometric degeneracies, we include ACT and Planck CMB lensing data and baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI Year-1, and further add supernovae measurements from Pantheon+ for models that affect the late-time expansion history. We verify the near-scale-invariance (running of the spectral index $d n_s/d\ln k = 0.0062 \pm 0.0052$) and adiabaticity of the primordial perturbations. Neutrino properties are consistent with Standard Model predictions: we find no evidence for new light, relativistic species that are free-streaming ($N_{\rm eff} = 2.86 \pm 0.13$, which combined with external BBN data becomes $N_{\rm eff} = 2.89 \pm 0.11$), for non-zero neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.082$ eV at 95% CL), or for neutrino self-interactions. We also find no evidence for self-interacting dark radiation ($N_{\rm idr} &lt; 0.134$), early-universe variation of fundamental constants, early dark energy, primordial magnetic fields, or modified recombination. Our data are consistent with standard BBN, the FIRAS-inferred CMB temperature, a dark matter component that is collisionless and with only a small fraction allowed as axion-like particles, a cosmological constant, and the late-time growth rate predicted by general relativity. We find no statistically significant preference for a departure from the baseline $\Lambda$CDM model. In general, models introduced to increase the Hubble constant or to decrease the amplitude of density fluctuations inferred from the primary CMB are not favored by our data.</description>

      <title>What's the matter with $\Sigma m_{\nu}$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to non-zero neutrino rest masses we expect the energy density today in non-relativistic matter, $\omega_{\rm m}$, to be greater than the sum of baryon and cold dark matter densities, $\omega_{\rm cb}$. We also expect the amplitude of deflections of CMB photons due to gravitational lensing to be suppressed relative to expectations assuming massless neutrinos. The combination of CMB and BAO data, however, appear to be defying both of these expectations. Here we review how the neutrino rest mass is determined from cosmological observations, and emphasize the complementary roles played by BAO and lensing data in this process. We explain why, for current constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, the addition of BAO data to primary CMB data is much more informative than the addition of CMB lensing reconstruction data. We then use a phenomenological model to find that the preference from CMB and BAO data for a matter density that is below expectations from the CMB alone is at the $3\, \sigma$ level. We also show that if a fraction of the dark matter decays to dark radiation, the preference for $\omega_{\rm m} &gt; \omega_{\rm cb}$ can be restored, but with a small increase to the CMB lensing excess.</description>

      <title>On Gauge Theories of Neutrino Masses and Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the predictions in the simplest theory for neutrino masses based on the spontaneous breaking of local lepton number. This theory provides a simple theoretical framework to understand the possible relation between the origin of neutrino masses and the nature of the dark matter. In this theory, one of the fields needed for anomaly cancellation is a dark matter candidate and the local lepton number is broken at the low scale. We discuss in great detail the dark matter properties showing the allowed parameter space by the relic density bounds and the predictions for direct detection. The predictions for gamma and neutrino lines from dark matter annihilation are investigated. In the case of Dirac neutrinos, the bound on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom plays an important role and the predictions for gamma lines could be tested in the near future. We discuss the predictions in the case of Majorana neutrinos where the dark matter candidate has extra annihilation channels and compare all the predictions to the case with Dirac neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Constraints on violation of Lorentz symmetry with clock-comparison redshift experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz symmetry is a cornerstone of both the General relativity and Standard Model and its experimental verification deepens our understanding of nature. This paper focuses on the investigation of Lorentz violations with the context of clock comparison experiments in the framework of Standard Model Extension (SME). Considering matter-gravity coupling sector, we provide a generic frame to study the sensitivities of Lorentz-violating coefficients for three distinct types of clock redshift tests, including the traditional gravitational redshift test, null-redshift test I and null-redshift test II. Each of these tests is sensitivity to different combinations of Lorentz-violating coefficients. By using the current clock comparison results, we estimate the limits of SME coefficients at level of parts in $10^{4}$ down to parts in $10^{7}$. Better sensitivity may be achieved in the clock comparisons by using the state-of-the-art optical clocks. Additionally considering relativistic factors in null-redshift I, the frequency comparison result of E2 and E3 transitions of Yb$^{+}$ can set the limit $c^{e}_{00}=(7.4\pm9.3)\times10^{-9}$ in the electron sector. Our analysis demonstrates that clock-comparison redshift experiments may contribute to explore the vast parameters space on searching for the Lorentz violation.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Massive Red Galaxies in Clusters from z=1.0 to z=0.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical issue in studying the evolution of galaxy clusters is to find ways that enable meaningful comparisons of clusters observed at different redshifts, as well as in various stages of their growth. Studies in the past have typically suffered from uncertainties in cluster mass estimates due to the scatter between cluster observables and mass. Here we propose a novel and general approach that uses the probability distribution function of an observable-cluster mass relation, together with dark matter halo merger trees extracted from numerical simulations, such that one can trace the evolution in a self-contained fashion, for clusters chosen to lie in a specified range in mass and redshift. This method, when applied to clusters of different mass ranges, further allows one to examine the evolution of various observable-cluster mass scaling relations. We illustrate the potential of this method by studying the stellar mass content of red cluster member galaxies, as well as the growth of brightest cluster galaxies, from z=1.0 to z=0.3, using a large optically-detected cluster sample from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey, finding good agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature bubble nucleation with shifting scale hierarchies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focusing on supercooled phase transitions in models with classical scale symmetry, we formulate a state-of-the art framework for computing the bubble-nucleation rate, accounting for the presence of various energy scales. In particular, we examine the limitations of derivative expansions in constructing a thermal effective field theory for bubble nucleation. We show that for gauge field fluctuations, derivative expansions diverge after the leading two orders due to the strong variation in gauge field masses between the high- and low-temperature phases. By directly computing these contributions using the fluctuation determinant, we capture these effects while also accounting for large explicit logarithms at two loops, utilising the exact renormalisation group structure of the EFT. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach significantly improves nucleation rate calculations compared to leading-order results, providing a more robust framework for predicting gravitational-wave signals from supercooled phase transitions in models such as the SU(2)cSM.</description>

      <title>Central galaxy alignments. Dependence on the mass and the large-scale environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations indicate that central galaxies show a significant alignment of their main shape axes with other galaxies in their group, as well as with the large-scale structure of the universe. Simulations have corroborated this finding, providing further insights into how the shape of the stellar component aligns with the surrounding dark matter halo. Recent studies have also investigated the evolution of this alignment in bright central galaxies, revealing that the shapes of the dark matter halo and the stellar component can differ. In this work, we aim at gaining a deeper understanding of galaxy alignments by quantifying how this property is related to the mass of the haloes hosting central galaxies and to the large-scale environment measured at different scales. By studying different angles, we describe how the alignments of central galaxies depend on the mass of the haloes they inhabit. We explore how the main axes of central galaxies align across different scales, both in three-dimensional and two-dimensional projections. We examine how halo mass influences these alignments and how they vary in the surrounding large-scale environment. To conduct this study, we employ the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulations and compare our results with the spectroscopic data from the SDSS DR18. Three types of alignment were analysed: between stellar and dark matter components, between satellite galaxies and the central galaxy, and between the central galaxy and its host halo. The results show that the alignment increases with halo mass and varies with the environment (clusters, filaments, cluster periphery, and others). However, after controlling for local density, we found that most of the observed trends disappear. The SDSS observations confirm a mass dependence similar to the simulations, although observational biases limit the detection of differences between the different environments.</description>

      <title>Regularizing the induced GW spectrum with dissipative effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite mean free paths of light particles, like photons and neutrinos, lead to dissipative effects and damping of small-scale density fluctuations in the early universe. We study the impact of damping on the spectral density of gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations in the radiation-dominated universe. We show that the most important effects of damping are $(i)$ regularization of the resonant frequency and $(ii)$ a far low-frequency tail with no logarithmic running. The exact location of the break frequency below which the logarithmic running is lost depends on the damping rate. Both effects stem from the effective finite lifetime of the gravitational wave source caused by damping. Interestingly, we find that, for the standard model of particles, the effects of damping are most relevant at around or below the nHz frequencies. Our results showcase the importance of including the damping of primordial fluctuations in future analysis of induced gravitational waves. We provide detailed analytical formulas and approximations for the kernel of induced gravitational waves. Lastly, we discuss possible implications of damping in alleviating the gauge issue of induced gravitational waves and in suppressing the so-called poltergeist mechanism.</description>

      <title>Probing single-field inflation: predictions, constraints, and theoretical viewpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a single-field inflationary model, a specific class of the K-essence models where a coupling term exists between canonical Lagrangian and the potential. This coupling term has many effects on key inflationary parameters consisting of the power spectral, the spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the Hubble parameter, the equation of state parameter, and the slow-roll parameter. By solving the equations numerically and deriving analytical results, how this modification affects inflationary dynamics can be analyzed. Our results show that the coupling term, $\alpha$, decreases the inflationary parameters, such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and improves the consistency with observational constraints from Planck and BICEP/Keck at the $68 \%$ and $95 \%$ confidence. These findings indicate that the studied model provides a promising alternative to the early universe dynamics while aligning with recent cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Fractons and their Dust</title>

Abstract: We define a relativistic version of the global symmetries responsible for the restricted mobility of fracton quasiparticles. The theories have a symmetry current that is proportional to a vector field that spontaneously breaks Lorentz boost symmetry. We argue that the existence of a pressureless dust in the early universe could be a consequence of this symmetry. We provide an example of a fractonic scalar field with a quartic self-interaction evolving on a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background and show that the interaction gives rise to a separately conserved fluid with equation of state $w=1$.</description>

      <title>One never walks alone: the effect of the perturber population on subhalo measurements in strong gravitational lenses</title>

Abstract: Analyses of extended arcs in strong gravitational lensing images to date have constrained the properties of dark matter by measuring the parameters of one or two individual subhalos. However, since such analyses are reliant on likelihood-based methods like Markov-chain Monte Carlo or nested sampling, they require various compromises to the realism of lensing models for the sake of computational tractability, such as ignoring the numerous other subhalos and line-of-sight halos in the system, assuming a particular form for the source model and requiring the noise to have a known likelihood function. Here we show that a simulation-based inference method calledTruncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) makes it possible to relax these requirements by training neural networks to directly compute marginal posteriors for subhalo parameters from lensing images. By performing a set of inference tasks on mock data, we verify the accuracy of TMNRE and show it can compute posteriors for subhalo parameters marginalized over populations of hundreds of substructures, as well as lens and source uncertainties. We also find the \gls*{mlp} Mixer network works far better for such tasks than the convolutional architectures explored in other lensing analyses. Furthermore, we show that since \gls*{tmnre} learns a posterior function it enables direct statistical checks that would be extremely expensive with likelihood-based methods. Our results show that TMNRE is well-suited for analyzing complex lensing data, and that the full subhalo and line-of-sight halo population must be included when measuring the properties of individual dark matter substructures with this technique.</description>

      <title>A search for super-imposed oscillations to the primordial power spectrum in Planck and SPT-3G 2018 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for super-imposed oscillations linearly or logarithmically spaced in Fourier wavenumbers in Planck and South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G) 2018 temperature and polarization data. The SPT-3G temperature and polarization data provide a new window to test these oscillations at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. We consider both models with a constant and a Gaussian modulated amplitude, which correspond to three and four additional parameters beyond power-law primordial power spectrum for the templates considered, respectively. We find that each of the four models considered can provide an improved fit to Planck data, consistently with previous findings, and to SPT-3G data, always compared to power-law power spectrum. For a constant amplitude of the superimposed oscillations, we find tighter constraints on the amplitude of the oscillations from the combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than in each individual data sets. When the ranges of parameters which provide a better fit to Planck and SPT-3G data overlap, as in the case of Gaussian modulated oscillations, we find a larger $\Delta \chi^2 \sim - 17.5 \, (-14.7)$ for logarithmic (linear) oscillations - in a combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than %the one obtained in each individual data sets. These findings will be further tested with upcoming CMB temperature and polarization measurements at high multipoles provided by ongoing ground experiments.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dark energy on weighing neutrinos after DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, DESI has released baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, and DES has also published its five-year supernova (SN) data. These observations, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, support a dynamically evolving dark energy at a high confidence level. When using cosmological observations to weigh neutrinos, the results of weighing neutrinos will be significantly affected by the measurement of dark energy due to the degeneracy between neutrino mass and the dark-energy equation of state. Therefore, we need to understand how the dynamical evolution of dark energy in the current situation will affect the measurement of neutrino mass. In this work, we utilize these latest observations and other additional distance measurements to discuss the mutual influence between neutrinos and dark energy, then calculate the Bayes factor to compare models. We consider three neutrino mass hierarchies including degenerate hierarchy (DH), normal hierarchy (NH), and inverted hierarchy (IH), as well as three dark energy models including $\Lambda \rm CDM$, $w\rm CDM$, and $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ models. Cosmological data combined with the prior of particle physics experiments can provide strong to decisive evidence favoring the $w_0w_a {\rm CDM}+\sum m_\nu$ model with NH. In the $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ model, using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we obtain constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.171\ \rm eV,\ 0.204\ \rm eV,\ 0.220\ \rm eV$, for DH, NH, and IH, respectively. Furthermore, taking into account the neutrino hierarchy or incorporating additional distance measurements results in a more pronounced deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model for dark energy. The latter, particularly, exhibits a deviation at a confidence level that surpasses $4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Status Report on the Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program (CCHP): Measurement of the Hubble Constant Using the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the latest results from the Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program (\cchp) to measure the Hubble constant, using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The overall program aims to calibrate three independent methods: (1) Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) stars, (2) JAGB (J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch) stars, and (3) Cepheids. To date, our program includes 10 nearby galaxies, hosting 11 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) suitable for measuring the Hubble constant ($H_0$). It also includes the galaxy NGC 4258, whose geometric distance provides the zero-point calibration. In this paper we discuss our results from the TRGB and JAGB methods. Our current best (highest precision) estimate is $H_0$ = 70.39 $\pm$ 1.22 (stat) $\pm$ 1.33 (sys) $\pm$ 0.70 ($\sigma_{SN}$), based on the TRGB method alone, with a total of 24 SN Ia calibrators from both HST and JWST data. Based on our new JWST data only, and tying into SNe Ia, we find values of $H_0$ = 68.81 $\pm$ 1.79 (stat) $\pm$ 1.32 (sys) for the TRGB, and $H_0$ = 67.80 $\pm$ 2.17 (stat) $\pm$ 1.64 (sys) km/s/Mpc for the JAGB method. The distances measured using the TRGB and the JAGB method agree, on average, at a level better than 1%, and with the SH0ES Cepheid distances at just over the 1% level. Our results are consistent with the current standard LambdaCDM model, without the need for the inclusion of additional new physics. Future JWST data will be required to increase the precision and accuracy of the local distance scale.</description>

      <title>HOD-informed prior for EFT-based full-shape analyses of LSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To improve the performance of full-shape analyses of large-scale structure, we consider using a halo occupation distribution (HOD)-informed prior for the effective field theory (EFT) nuisance parameters. We generate 320 000 mock galaxy catalogs using 10 000 sets of HOD parameters across 32 simulation boxes with different cosmologies. We measure and fit the redshift-space power spectra using a fast emulator of the EFT model, and the resulting best-fit EFT parameter distributions are used to create the prior. This prior effectively constrains the EFT nuisance parameter space, limiting it to the space of HOD-mocks that can be well fit by a EFT model. We have tested the stability of the prior under different configurations, including the effect of varying the HOD sample distribution and the inclusion of the hexadecapole moment. We find that our HOD-informed prior and the cosmological parameter constraints derived using it are robust. While cosmological fits using the standard EFT prior suffer from prior effects, sometimes failing to recover the true cosmology within Bayesian credible intervals, the HOD-informed prior mitigates these issues and significantly improves cosmological parameter recovery for $\Lambda$CDM and beyond. This work lays the foundation for better full-shape large-scale structure analyses in current and upcoming galaxy surveys, making it a valuable tool for addressing key questions in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Are CMB derived cosmological parameters affected by foregrounds associated to nearby galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform cosmological parameters estimation on Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps masking the recently discovered foreground related to nearby spiral galaxies. In addition, we also analyse the association between these foreground regions and recent claims of cosmological causal horizons in localized CMB parameter estimates. Our analysis shows consistent cosmological parameter values regardless of the masking approach, though reduced sky areas introduce larger uncertainties. By modelling the new extragalactic foreground, we identify a resemblance with local parameter variation maps with a statistical significance at the 3 sigma level, suggesting that a simplified foreground model partially accounts, (40-50)% correlation with 15% uncertainty, for the observed causal horizons. These findings add new evidence to the existence of the new foreground associated with large spiral galaxies and show that estimates of cosmological parameters on smaller patches on the sky can be largely affected by these foregrounds, but that the parameters taken over the full sky are unaltered.</description>

      <title>Refined approaches in second leptogenesis for the baryon-lepton asymmetry discrepancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The temperature-dependent mass of the heavy neutrino can lead to the second leptogenesis occurring below the electroweak scale, potentially explaining the large discrepancy between baryon and lepton asymmetries. We investigate this scenario further, exploring the intricate interplay of the weak interaction processes within this framework. It includes notable shifts in the dominant decay channels of heavy neutrinos around the electroweak symmetry breaking, along with the resonance behavior of the scattering processes near the $W/Z$ mass. The $CP$ asymmetry can also vary over cosmic history due to the temperature-dependent mass, allowing the $B-L$ asymmetry generation to be amplified in the late epoch. These findings elucidate how such alterations in the dynamics of second leptogenesis contribute to addressing the observed discrepancies in baryon-lepton asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Axion-Photon Conversion Signals from Neutron Stars with Spacetime Curvature Accounted for in the Magnetosphere Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions are a well-motivated dark matter candidate. They may be detectable from radio line emission due to resonant conversion in neutron star magnetospheres. While radio data collection for this signal has begun, further efforts are required to solidify the theoretical predictions for the resulting radio lines. Usually, the flat spacetime Goldreich-Julian model of the neutron star magnetosphere is used, while a Schwarzschild geometry is assumed for the ray tracing. We assess the impact of incorporating the spacetime curvature into the magnetosphere model. We examine a range of neutron star and axion masses and find an average difference of $37\%$ and $22\%$ in radiated power compared to the standard Goldreich-Julian magnetosphere model for a $1\mu eV$ and $10\mu eV$ mass axion, respectively, in the case of a $2.2M_\odot$ mass neutron star. A much lesser difference is found for lower-mass neutron stars, as in that case axion-photon conversion occurs further from the Schwarzschild radius.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in tellurium-based dark matter searches stemming from nuclear structure uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using tellurium dioxide as a target, we calculate uncertainties on 90% upper confidence limits of Galilean effective field theory (Galilean EFT) couplings to a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter candidate due to uncertainties in nuclear shell models. We find that these uncertainties in naturally-occurring tellurium isotopes are comparable across the different Galilean EFT couplings to uncertainties in xenon, with some reaching over 100%. We also consider the effect these nuclear uncertainties have on estimates of the annual modulation of dark matter from these searches, finding that the uncertainties in the modulation amplitude are proportional to the non-modulating upper confidence limit uncertainties. We also show that the determination of the modulation phase is insensitive to changes in the nuclear model for a given isotope.</description>

      <title>Prospects of future MeV telescopes in probing weak-scale Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic weak-scale Dark Matter (DM) particles annihilating into lepton-rich channels not only produce gamma-rays via prompt radiation but also generate abundant energetic electrons and positrons, which subsequently emit through bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering (collectively called `secondary-radiation photons'). While the prompt gamma-rays concentrate at high-energy, the secondary emission falls in the MeV range, which a number of upcoming experiments (AMEGO, E-ASTROGAM, MAST...) will probe. We investigate the sensitivity of these future telescopes for weak-scale DM, focusing for definiteness on observations of the galactic center. We find that they have the potential of probing a wide region of the DM parameter space which is currently unconstrained. Namely, in rather optimistic configurations, future MeV telescopes could probe thermally-produced DM with a mass up to the TeV range, or GeV DM with an annihilation cross section 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds, precisely thanks to the significant leverage provided by their sensitivity to secondary emissions. We comment on astrophysical and methodological uncertainties, and compare with the reach of high-energy gamma ray experiments.</description>

      <title>Impacts of the Metagalactic Ultraviolet Background on Circumgalactic Medium Absorption Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the many different pieces of physics that go into simulations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), the metagalactic ultraviolet background (UVB) plays a significant role in determining the ionization state of different metal species. However, the UVB is uncertain with multiple models having been developed by various research groups over the past several decades. In this work, we examine how different UVB models influence the ionic column densities of CGM absorbers. We use these UVB models to infer ion number densities in the FOGGIE galaxy simulations at $z=2.5$ and use the Synthetic Absorption Line Surveyor Application (SALSA) package to identify absorbers. Absorbers are then matched across UVB models based on their line of sight position so that their column densities can be compared. From our analysis, we find that changing the UVB model produces significant changes in ionization, specifically at lower gas densities and higher temperatures where photoionization dominates over collisional ionization. We also find that the scatter of column density differences between models tends to increase with increasing ionization energy, with the exception of \hi, which has the highest scatter of all species we examined.</description>
