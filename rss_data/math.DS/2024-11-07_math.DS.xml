      <title>The $\beta$-transformation with a hole at $0$: the general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $\beta&gt;1$, let $T_\beta$ be the $\beta$-transformation on the unit circle $[0,1)$, defined by $T_\beta(x)=\beta x\pmod 1$. For each $t\in[0,1)$ let $K_\beta(t)$ be the survivor set consisting of all $x\in[0,1)$ whose orbit $\{T^n_\beta(x): n\ge 0\}$ never hits the interval $[0,t)$. Kalle et al.~[{\em Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems} {\bf 40} (2020), no.~9, 2482--2514] considered the case $\beta\in(1,2]$. They studied the set-valued bifurcation set $\mathscr{E}_\beta:=\{t\in[0,1): K_\beta(t')\ne K_\beta(t)~\forall t'&gt;t\}$ and proved that the Hausdorff dimension function $t\mapsto\dim_H K_\beta(t)$ is a non-increasing Devil's staircase. In a previous paper [{\em Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems} {\bf 43} (2023), no.~6, 1785--1828] we determined, for all $\beta\in(1,2]$, the critical value $\tau(\beta):=\min\{t&gt;0: \eta_\beta(t)=0\}$. The purpose of the present article is to extend these results to all $\beta&gt;1$. In addition to calculating $\tau(\beta)$, we show that (i) the function $\tau: \beta\mapsto\tau(\beta)$ is left continuous on $(1,\infty)$ with right-hand limits everywhere, but has countably infinitely many discontinuities; (ii) $\tau$ has no downward jumps; and (iii) there exists an open set $O\subset(1,\infty)$, whose complement $(1,\infty)\backslash O$ has zero Hausdorff dimension, such that $\tau$ is real-analytic, strictly convex and strictly decreasing on each connected component of $O$. We also prove several topological properties of the bifurcation set $\mathscr{E}_\beta$. The key to extending the results from $\beta\in(1,2]$ to all $\beta&gt;1$ is an appropriate generalization of the Farey words that are used to parametrize the connected components of the set $O$. Some of the original proofs from the above-mentioned papers are simplified.</description>

      <title>Effective density of surfaces near Teichm\"{u}ller curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ on the stratum of translation surfaces $\mathcal{H}(2)$. Especially, we obtain effective density theorems on $\mathcal{H}(2)$ for orbits of the upper triangular subgroup $P$ of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ with the based surfaces near a small Teichm\"{u}ller curve.
  The proof is based on the use of McMullen's classification theorem, together with the effective equidistribution theorems in homogeneous dynamics. In particular, we compare the $P$-orbit of a surface, and the $P$-orbit of its absolute periods using the Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang's effective equidistribution theorem.</description>

      <title>Non-transitive pseudo-Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study (topological) pseudo-Anosov flows from the perspective of the associated group actions on their orbit spaces and boundary at infinity. We extend the definition of Anosov-like action from [BFM22] from the transitive to the general non-transitive context and show that one can recover the basic sets of a flow, the Smale order on basic sets, and their essential features, from such general group actions. Using these tools, we prove that a pseudo-Anosov flow in a $3$ manifold is entirely determined by the associated action of the fundamental group on the boundary at infinity of its orbit space. We also give a proof that any topological pseudo-Anosov flow on an atoroidal 3-manifold is necessarily transitive, and prove that density of periodic orbits implies transitivity, in the topological rather than smooth case.</description>

      <title>Generic properties of vector fields identical on a compact set and codimension one partially hyperbolic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{X}^r(M)$ be the set of $C^r$ vector fields on a boundaryless compact Riemannian manifold $M$. Given a vector field $X_0\in\mathscr{X}^r(M)$ and a compact invariant set $\Gamma$ of $X_0$, we consider the closed subset $\mathscr{X}^r(M,\Gamma)$ of $\mathscr{X}^r(M)$, consisting of all $C^r$ vector fields which coincide with $X_0$ on $\Gamma$. Study of such a set naturally arises when one needs to perturb a system while keeping part of the dynamics untouched.
  A vector field $X\in\mathscr{X}^r(M,\Gamma)$ is called $\Gamma$-avoiding Kupka-Smale, if the dynamics away from $\Gamma$ is Kupka-Smale. We show that a generic vector field in $\mathscr{X}^r(M,\Gamma)$ is $\Gamma$-avoiding Kupka-Smale. In the $C^1$ topology, we obtain more generic properties for $\mathscr{X}^1(M,\Gamma)$. With these results, we further study codimension one partially hyperbolic dynamics for generic vector fields in $\mathscr{X}^1(M,\Gamma)$, giving a dichotomy of hyperbolicity and Newhouse phenomenon.
  As an application, we obtain that $C^1$ generically in $\mathscr{X}^1(M)$, a non-trivial Lyapunov stable chain recurrence class of a singularity which admits a codimension 2 partially hyperbolic splitting with respect to the tangent flow is a homoclinic class.</description>

      <title>Topology and dynamics of a flow that has a non-saddle set or a $W$-set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study dynamical and topological properties of a flow in the region of influence of an isolated non-saddle set or a $W$-set in a manifold. These are certain classes of compact invariant sets in whose vicinity the asymptotic behaviour of the flow is somewhat controlled. We are mainly concerned with global properties of the dynamics and establish cohomological relations between the non-saddle set and the manifold. As a consequence we obtain a dynamical classification of surfaces (orientable and non-orientable). We also examine robustness and bifurcation properties of non-saddle-sets and study in detail the behavior of $W$-sets in 2-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Koopman Operators for Global Analysis of Hybrid Limit-Cycling Systems: Construction and Spectral Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports a theory of Koopman operators for a class of hybrid dynamical systems with globally asymptotically stable periodic orbits, called hybrid limit-cycling systems. We leverage smooth structures intrinsic to the hybrid dynamical systems, thereby extending the existing theory of Koopman operators for smooth dynamical systems. Rigorous construction of an observable space is carried out to preserve the inherited smooth structures of the hybrid dynamical systems. Complete spectral characterization of the Koopman operators acting on the constructed space is then derived where the existence and uniqueness of their eigenfunctions are ensured. Our results facilitate global analysis of hybrid dynamical systems using the Koopman operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponential actions defined by vector configurations provide a universal framework for several constructions of holomorphic dynamics, non-Kaehler complex geometry, toric geometry and topology. These include leaf spaces of holomorphic foliations, intersections of real and Hermitian quadrics, the quotient construction of toric varieties, LVM and LVMB manifolds, complex-analytic structures on moment-angle manifolds and their partial quotients. In all of these cases, the geometry and topology of the appropriate quotient object can be described by combinatorial data including a pair of Gale dual vector configurations.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional cellular automata with a unique active transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A one-dimensional cellular automaton $\tau : A^\mathbb{Z} \to A^\mathbb{Z}$ is a transformation of the full shift defined via a finite neighborhood $S \subset \mathbb{Z}$ and a local function $\mu : A^S \to A$. We study the family of cellular automata whose finite neighborhood $S$ is an interval containing $0$, and there exists a pattern $p \in A^S$ satisfying that $\mu(z) = z(0)$ if and only if $z \neq p$; this means that these cellular automata have a unique \emph{active transition}. Despite its simplicity, this family presents interesting and subtle problems, as the behavior of the cellular automaton completely depends on the structure of $p$. We show that every cellular automaton $\tau$ with a unique active transition $p \in A^S$ is either idempotent or strictly almost equicontinuous, and we completely characterize each one of these situations in terms of $p$. In essence, the idempotence of $\tau$ depends on the existence of a certain subpattern of $p$ with a translational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of estimators of ergodic stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies asymptotic properties of estimators of multidimensional stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motions from high-frequency discrete data. Consistency and central limit properties of a class of estimators of the diffusion parameter and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator of the drift parameter based on a discretized likelihood function have been established in a suitable scaling regime involving the time-gap between the observations and the overall time span. Our framework is more general than that typically considered in the literature and, thus, has the potential to be applicable to a wider range of stochastic models.</description>

      <title>An efficient scheme for approximating long-time dynamics of a class of non-linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel, highly efficient, second-order accurate, long-time unconditionally stable numerical scheme for a class of finite-dimensional nonlinear models that are of importance in geophysical fluid dynamics. The scheme is highly efficient in the sense that only a (fixed) symmetric positive definite linear problem (with varying right hand sides) is involved at each time-step. The solutions to the scheme are uniformly bounded for all time. We show that the scheme is able to capture the long-time dynamics of the underlying geophysical model, with the global attractors as well as the invariant measures of the scheme converge to those of the original model as the step size approaches zero. In our numerical experiments, we take an indirect approach, using long-term statistics to approximate the invariant measures. Our results suggest that the convergence rate of the long-term statistics, as a function of terminal time, is approximately first order using the Jensen-Shannon metric and half-order using the L1 metric. This implies that very long time simulation is needed in order to capture a few significant digits of long time statistics (climate) correct. Nevertheless, the second order scheme's performance remains superior to that of the first order one, requiring significantly less time to reach a small neighborhood of statistical equilibrium for a given step size.</description>

      <title>Role of flow topology in wind-driven wildfire propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wildfires propagate through intricate interactions between wind, fuel, and terrain, resulting in complex behaviors that pose challenges for accurate predictions. This study investigates the interaction between wind velocity topology and wildfire spread dynamics, aiming to enhance our understanding of wildfire spread patterns. We revisited the non-dimensionalizion of the governing combustion model by incorporating three distinct time scales. This approach revealed two new non-dimensional numbers, contrasting with the conventional non-dimensionalization that considers only a single time scale. Through scaling analysis, we analytically identified the critical determinants of transient wildfire behavior and established a state-neutral curve, indicating where initial wildfires extinguish for specific combinations of the identified non-dimensional numbers. Subsequently, a wildfire transport solver was developed using a finite difference method, integrating compact schemes and implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods. We explored the influence of stable and unstable manifolds in wind velocity on wildfire transport under steady wind conditions defined using a saddle-type fixed point flow, emphasizing the role of the non-dimensional numbers. Additionally, we considered the benchmark unsteady double-gyre flow and examined the effect of unsteady wind topology on wildfire propagation, and quantified the wildfire response to varying wind oscillation frequencies and amplitudes using a transfer function approach. The results were compared to Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) used to characterize the correspondence of manifolds with wildfire propagation. The comprehensive approach of utilizing the manifolds computed from wind topology provides valuable insights into wildfire dynamics across diverse wind scenarios, offering a potential tool for improved predictive modeling and management strategies.</description>

      <title>Log Baum--Bott Residues for foliations by curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Baum-Bott type residual formula for one-dimensional holomorphic foliations, with isolated singularities, and logarithmic along free divisors. More precisely, this provides a Baum--Bott theorem for a foliated triple $(X,\mathscr{F}, D)$, where $ \mathscr{F}$ is a foliation by curves and $D $ is a free divisor on a complex manifold $X$. From the local point of view, we show that the log Baum--Bott residues are a generalization of the Aleksandrov logarithmic index for vector fields with isolated singularities on hypersurfaces. We also show how these new indices are related to Poincar\'e's Problem for foliations by curves. In the case of foliated surfaces, we show that the differences between the logarithmic residues and Baum--Bott indices along invariant curves can be expressed in terms of the GSV and Camacho--Sad indices. We also obtain a Baum--Bott type formula for singular varieties via log resolutions. Finally, we prove a weak global version of the Lipman--Zariski conjecture for compact algebraic surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple real algebraic group. We prove the continuity of limit cones along deformations of Anosov subgroups of $G$ under a certain convexity assumption. This convexity assumption turns out to be necessary. We discuss an application to the notion of sharpness of an action of a discrete subgroup on a non-Riemannian homogeneous space. We also obtain that growth indicators and certain critical exponents vary continuously in the space of Anosov representations.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the frame flow on a closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with negative sectional curvature is ergodic if $n$ is odd and $n \neq 7$. In this paper we study its ergodicity in the remaining cases. For $n$ even and $n \neq 8, 134$, we show that: if $n \equiv 2$ mod $4$ or $n=4$, the frame flow is ergodic if the manifold is $\sim 0.3$-pinched, if $n \equiv 0$ mod $4$, it is ergodic if the manifold is $\sim 0.6$-pinched. In the three dimensions $n=7,8,134$, the respective pinching bounds that we need in order to prove ergodicity are $0.4962...$, $0.6212...$, and $0.5788...$. This is a significant improvement over the previously known results and a step forward towards solving a long-standing conjecture of Brin asserting that $0.25$-pinched even-dimensional manifolds have an ergodic frame flow.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{S}$-adic characterization of minimal dendric shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dendric shifts are defined by combinatorial restrictions of the extensions of the words in their languages. This family generalizes well-known families of shifts such as Sturmian shifts, Arnoux-Rauzy shifts and codings of interval exchange transformations. It is known that any minimal dendric shift has a primitive $\mathcal{S}$-adic representation where the morphisms in $\mathcal{S}$ are positive tame automorphisms of the free group generated by the alphabet. In this paper we give an $\mathcal{S}$-adic characterization of this family by means of two finite graphs. As an application, we are able to decide whether a shift space generated by a uniformly recurrent morphic word is (eventually) dendric.</description>

      <title>Around Furstenberg's times $p$, times $q$ conjecture: times $p$-invariant measures with some large Fourier coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each integer $n\ge 1$, denote by $T_{n}$ the map $x\mapsto nx\mod 1$ from the circle group $\mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ into itself. Let $p,q\ge 2$ be two multiplicatively independent integers. Using Baire Category arguments, we show that generically a $T_{p}$-invariant probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{T}$ with no atom has some large Fourier coefficients along the sequence $(q^n)_{n\ge 0}$. In particular, $(T_{q^{n}}\mu )_{n\ge 0}$ does not converges weak-star to the normalised Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{T}$. This disproves a conjecture of Furstenberg and complements previous results of Johnson and Rudolph. In the spirit of previous work by Meiri and Lindenstrauss-Meiri-Peres, we study generalisations of our main result to certain classes of sequences $(c_n)_{n\ge 0}$ other than the sequences $(q^{n})_{n\ge 0}$, and also investigate the multidimensional setting.</description>

Abstract: A question of F. Kwakkel and V. Markovic on existence of C^1-diffeomorphisms of closed surfaces that permute a dense collection of domains with bounded geometry is answered in the negative. In fact, it is proved that for closed surfaces of genus at least one such diffeomorphisms do not exist regardless of whether they have positive or zero topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds for Glass networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that chaotic Glass networks (a class of piecewise-linear Ordinary Differential Equations) are good candidates for the design of true random number generators. A Glass network design has the advantage of involving only standard Boolean logic gates. Furthermore, an already chaotic (deterministic) system combined with random ``jitter'' due to thermal noise can be used to generate random bit sequences in a more robust way than noisy limit-cycle oscillators. Since the goal is to generate bit sequences with as large a positive entropy as possible, it is desirable to have a theoretical method to assess the irregularity of a large class of networks. We develop a procedure here to calculate good upper bounds on the entropy of a Glass network, by means of symbolic representations of the continuous dynamics. Our method improves on a result by Farcot (2006), and allows in principle for an arbitrary level of precision by refinements of the estimate, and we show that in the limiting case, these estimates converge to the true entropy of the symbolic system corresponding to the continuous dynamics. As a check on the method, we demonstrate for an example network that our upper bound after only a few refinement steps is very close to the entropy estimated from a long numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Area spectral rigidity for axially symmetric and Radon domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that $(a)$ any finitely smooth axially symmetric strictly convex domain, with everywhere positive curvature and sufficiently close to an ellipse, and $(b)$ any finitely smooth centrally symmetric strictly convex domain, even-rationally integrable, with everywhere positive curvature and sufficiently close to an ellipse is area spectrally rigid. This means that any area-isospectral family of domains in these classes is necessarily equi-affine. We use the same technique -- adapted to symplectic billiards -- of the paper by De Simoi, Kaloshin, and Wei (2017). The novelty is that the result holds for axially symmetric domains, as in the cited paper, as well as for a subset of centrally symmetric ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every natural $n&gt;1$, there is an operator $T$ of dynamical origin such that its tensor power $T^{\otimes n}$ has singular spectrum, and $T^{\otimes (n+1)}$ has absolutely continuous one. For a set $D$ of positive measure there are mixing zero entropy automorphisms $S,T$ such that $S^nD\cap T^nD=\varnothing$ for all $n&gt;0$. The following answers, in particular, Frantzikinakis-Host's question. If $ p(n+1)- p(n), \ \ q(n+1)- q(n)\ \to\ +\infty$, then there is a divergent sequence $ \sum_{n=1}^{N} \mu(S^{ p(n)}C\cap T^{ q(n)}C)/N$ for some set $C$ and automorphisms $S,T$ of simple singular spectrum.</description>

      <title>Models of Opinion Dynamics with Random Parametrisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse a generalisation of the Galam model of binary opinion dynamics in which iterative discussions take place in local groups of individuals and study the effects of random deviations from the group majority. The probability of a deviation or flip depends on the magnitude of the majority. Depending on the values of the flip parameters which give the probability of a deviation, the model shows a wide variety of behaviour. We are interested in the characteristics of the model when the flip parameters are themselves randomly selected, following some probability distribution. Examples of these characteristics are whether large majorities and ties are attractors or repulsors, or the number of fixed points in the dynamics of the model. Which of the features of the model are likely to appear? Which ones are unlikely because they only present as events of low probability with respect to the distribution of the flip parameters? Answers to such questions allow us to distinguish mathematical properties which are stable under a variety of assumptions on the distribution of the flip parameters from features which are very rare and thus more of theoretical than practical interest. In this article, we present both exact numerical results for specific distributions of the flip parameters and small discussion groups and rigorous results in the form of limit theorems for large discussion groups. Small discussion groups model friend or work groups -- people that personally know each other and frequently spend time together. Large groups represent scenarios such as social media or political entities such as cities, states, or countries.</description>

      <title>Unicritical polynomials over $abc$-fields: from uniform boundedness to dynamical Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a function field of characteristic $p\geq0$ or a number field over which the $abc$ conjecture holds, and let $\phi(x)=x^d+c \in K[x]$ be a unicritical polynomial of degree $d\geq2$ with $d \not\equiv 0,1\pmod{p}$. We completely classify all portraits of $K$-rational preperiodic points for such $\phi$ for all sufficiently large degrees $d$. More precisely, we prove that, up to accounting for the natural action of $d$th roots of unity on the preperiodic points for $\phi$, there are exactly thirteen such portraits up to isomorphism. In particular, for all such global fields $K$, it follows from our results together with earlier work of Doyle-Poonen and Looper that the number of $K$-rational preperiodic points for $\phi$ is uniformly bounded -- independent of $d$. That is, there is a constant $B(K)$ depending only on $K$ such that \[\big|\text{PrePer}(x^d+c,K)\big|\leq B(K)\] for all $d\geq2$ and all $c\in K$. Moreover, we apply this work to construct many irreducible polynomials with large dynamical Galois groups in semigroups generated by sets of unicritical polynomials under composition.</description>

      <title>On the study of the limit cycles for a class of population models with time-varying factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of population models with time-varying factors, represented by one-dimensional piecewise smooth autonomous differential equations.
  We provide several derivative formulas in "discrete" form for the Poincar\'{e} map of such equations, and establish a criterion for the existence of limit cycles.
  These two tools, together with the known ones, are then combined in a preliminary procedure that can provide a simple and unified way to analyze the equations.
  As an application, we prove that a general model of single species with seasonal constant-yield harvesting can only possess at most two limit cycles, which improves the work of Xiao in 2016.
  We also apply our results to a general model described by the Abel equations with periodic step function coefficients, showing that its maximum number of limit cycles, is three.
  Finally, a population suppression model for mosquitos considered by Yu and Li in 2020 and Zheng et al. in 2021 is studied using our approach.</description>
