      <title>Shared Hardships Strengthen Bonds: Negative Shocks, Embeddedness and Employee Retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unexpected events -- "shocks" -- are the motive force in explaining changes in embeddedness and retention within the unfolding model of labor turnover. Substantial research effort has examined strategies for insulating valued employees from adverse shocks. However, this paper provides empirical evidence that unambiguously negative shocks can increase employee retention when underlying firm and employee incentives with respect to these shocks are aligned. Using survival analysis on a unique data set of 466,236 communication records and 45,873 employment spells from 21 trucking companies, we show how equipment-related shocks tend to increase the duration of employment. Equipment shocks also generate paradoxically positive sentiments that demonstrate an increase in employees' affective commitment to the firm. Our results highlight the important moderating role aligned incentives have in how shocks ultimately translate into retention. Shared hardships strengthen bonds in employment as in other areas.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of algorithmic pricing raises concerns of algorithmic collusion. We conduct experiments with algorithmic pricing agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), and specifically GPT-4. We find that (1) LLM-based agents are adept at pricing tasks, (2) LLM-based pricing agents autonomously collude in oligopoly settings to the detriment of consumers, and (3) variation in seemingly innocuous phrases in LLM instructions ("prompts") may increase collusion. These results extend to auction settings. Our findings underscore the need for antitrust regulation regarding algorithmic pricing, and uncover regulatory challenges unique to LLM-based pricing agents.</description>

      <title>Antinetwork among China A-shares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation-based financial networks, constructed with the correlation relationships among the time series of fluctuations of daily logarithmic prices of stocks, are intensively studied. However, these studies ignore the importance of negative correlations. This paper is the first time to consider the negative and positive correlations separately, and accordingly to construct weighted temporal antinetwork and network among stocks listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. For (anti)networks during the first 24 years of the 21st century, the node's degree and strength, the assortativity coefficient, the average local clustering coefficient, and the average shortest path length are analyzed systematically. This paper unveils some essential differences in these topological measurements between antinetwork and network. The findings of the differences between antinetwork and network have an important role in understanding the dynamics of a financial complex system. The observation of antinetwork is of great importance in optimizing investment portfolios and risk management. More importantly, this paper proposes a new direction for studying complex systems, namely the correlation-based antinetwork.</description>

      <title>Influencing Competition Through Shelf Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.09227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shelf design decisions strongly influence product demand. In particular, placing products in desirable locations increases demand. This primary effect on shelf position is clear, but there is a secondary effect based on the relative positioning of nearby products. Intuitively, products located next to each other are more likely to be compared having positive and negative effects. On the one hand, locations closer to relatively strong products will be undesirable, as these strong products will draw demand from others -- an effect that is stronger for those in close proximity. On the other hand, because strong products tend to attract more traffic, locations closer to them elicit high consumer attention by increased visibility. Modifying the GEV class of models to allow demand to be moderated by competitors' proximity, these two effects emerge naturally. We found that although the competition effect is usually stronger, it is not always the dominating effect. Shelf displays can achieve higher profits by exploiting the relative influence on competition from shelf design to shift demand to higher profitability products. In the paper towel category, we found profitability differences of up to 7\% and displays with 3\% higher gross profits over the best shelf design present in our data.</description>

      <title>A Pomeranzian Growth Theory of the Great Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.03110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study constructs a growth model of the Great Divergence that formalizes Pomeranz's (2000) hypothesis that the relief of land constraints in Europe has caused divergence in economic growth between Europe and China since the 19th century. The model consists of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. The agricultural sector produces subsistence goods from land, intermediate goods from the manufacturing sector, and labor. The manufacturing sector produces goods from labor, and its productivity grows through the learning-by-doing of full-time manufacturing workers. Households make fertility decisions. In the model, a large exogenous positive shock in land supply causes the transition of the economy from the Malthusian state, in which all workers are engaged in agricultural production and per capita income is constant, to the non-Malthusian state, in which the share of workers engaged in agricultural production gradually decreases and per capita income grows at a roughly constant growth rate. The quantitative predictions of the model provide several insights into the causes of the Great Divergence.</description>

      <title>Labor Market Effects of the Venezuelan Refugee Crisis in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use administrative panel data on the universe of Brazilian formal workers to investigate the labor market effects of the Venezuelan crisis in Brazil, focusing on the border state of Roraima. The results using difference-in-differences show that the monthly wages of Brazilians in Roraima increased by around 2 percent, which was mostly driven by those working in sectors and occupations with no refugee involvement. The study finds negligible job displacement for Brazilians but finds evidence of native workers moving to occupations without immigrants. We also find that immigrants in the informal market offset the substitution effects in the formal market.</description>

      <title>Do Productivity Shocks Cause Inputs Misallocation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how productivity dispersion relates to input misallocation using a model with staggered productivity shocks that create wedges between anticipated and realized productivity for any production input. With inputs allocated optimally ex ante but suboptimally ex post, dispersion in realized productivity contributes to ex post input misallocation. Analyzing European firm data from 2000-2017 reveals significant co-movement between productivity dispersion and capital/labor misallocation across industries. Productivity dispersion explains a substantial share of capital and labor misallocation (40% and 70%), and 10% of materials misallocation, confirming its key role in allocation frictions.</description>
