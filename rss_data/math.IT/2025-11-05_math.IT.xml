      <title>Fibbinary-Based Compression and Quantization for Efficient Neural Radio Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural receivers have shown outstanding performance compared to the conventional ones but this comes with a high network complexity leading to a heavy computational cost. This poses significant challenges in their deployment on hardware-constrained devices. To address the issue, this paper explores two optimization strategies: quantization and compression. We introduce both uniform and non-uniform quantization such as the Fibonacci Code word Quantization (FCQ). A novel fine-grained approach to the Incremental Network Quantization (INQ) strategy is then proposed to compensate for the losses introduced by the above mentioned quantization techniques. Additionally, we introduce two novel lossless compression algorithms that effectively reduce the memory size by compressing sequences of Fibonacci quantized parameters characterized by a huge redundancy. The quantization technique provides a saving of 45\% and 44\% in the multiplier's power and area, respectively, and its combination with the compression determines a 63.4\% reduction in memory footprint, while still providing higher performances than a conventional receiver.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Beam Misalignment Effect in Inter-Satellite FSO Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-space optical (FSO) communication has emerged as a promising technology for inter-satellite links (ISLs) due to its high data rate, low power consumption, and reduced interference. However, the performance of inter-satellite FSO systems is highly sensitive to beam misalignment. While pointing-ahead angle (PAA) compensation is commonly employed, the effectiveness of PAA compensation depends on precise orbital knowledge and advanced alignment hardware, which are not always feasible in practice. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the impact of beam misalignment on inter-satellite FSO communication. We derive a closed-form expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the FSO channel under the joint jitter and misalignment-induced pointing error, and introduce a truncated CDF formulation with a bisection algorithm to efficiently compute outage probabilities with guaranteed convergence and minimal computational overhead. To make the analysis more practical, we quantify displacement based on orbital dynamics. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model closely matches Monte Carlo simulations, making the proposed model highly useful to design inter-satellite FSO systems in practice.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cooperative Transmission Design for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless communication systems must support ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) service for mission-critical applications. Meeting stringent URLLC requirements is challenging, especially for two-hop cooperative communication. In this paper, we develop an adaptive transmission design for a two-hop relaying communication system. Each hop transmission adaptively configures its transmission parameters separately, including numerology, mini-slot size, and modulation and coding scheme, for reliable packet transmission within a strict latency constraint. We formulate the hop-specific transceiver configuration as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a dual-agent reinforcement learning-based cooperative latency-aware transmission (DRL-CoLA) algorithm to learn latency-aware transmission policies in a distributed manner. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves the near-optimal reliability while satisfying strict latency requirements.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Wireless-Powered MEC: A Cooperative Energy Recycling Framework for Task-Energy Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative energy recycling (CER) offers a new way to boost energy utilization in wireless-powered multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks, yet its integration with computation-communication co-design remains underexplored. This paper proposes a CER-enabled MEC framework that maximizes the minimum computable data among users under energy causality, latency, and power constraints. The intractable problem is reformulated into a convex form through relaxation, maximum ratio combining, and variable substitution, and closed-form solutions are derived via Lagrangian duality and alternating optimization, offering analytical insights. Simulation results verify that the proposed CER mechanism markedly increases total computable data while maintaining equitable performance across heterogeneous users.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Computation Offloading in Wireless-Powered MEC Systems with Cooperative Energy Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, cooperative energy recycling (CER) is investigated in wireless-powered mobile edge computing systems. Unlike conventional architectures that rely solely on a dedicated power source, wireless sensors are additionally enabled to recycle energy from peer transmissions. To evaluate system performance, a joint computation optimization problem is formulated that integrates local computing and computation offloading, under an alpha-fairness objective that balances total computable data and user fairness while satisfying energy, latency, and task size constraints. Due to the inherent non-convexity introduced by coupled resource variables and fairness regularization, a variable-substitution technique is employed to transform the problem into a convex structure, which is then efficiently solved using Lagrangian duality and alternating optimization. To characterize the fairness-efficiency tradeoff, closed-form solutions are derived for three representative regimes: zero fairness, common fairness, and max-min fairness, each offering distinct system-level insights. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed CER-enabled framework, demonstrating significant gains in throughput and adaptability over benchmark schemes. The tunable alpha fairness mechanism provides flexible control over performance-fairness trade-offs across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Downlink Channel Estimation for mmWave Systems with Impulsive Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a channel estimation problem in a downlink millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which suffers from impulsive interference caused by hardware non-idealities or external disruptions. Specifically, impulsive interference presents a significant challenge to channel estimation due to its sporadic, unpredictable, and high-power nature. To tackle this issue, we develop a Bayesian channel estimation technique based on variational inference (VI) that leverages the sparsity of the mmWave channel in the angular domain and the intermittent nature of impulsive interference to minimize channel estimation errors. The proposed technique employs mean-field approximation to approximate posterior inference and integrates VI into the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms baselines in terms of channel estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Two-Parameter R\'enyi Information Quantities with Applications to Privacy Amplification and Soft Covering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are no universally accepted definitions of R\'enyi conditional entropy and R\'enyi mutual information, although motivated by different applications, several definitions have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we consider a family of two-parameter R\'enyi conditional entropy and a family of two-parameter R\'enyi mutual information. By performing a change of variables for the parameters, the two-parameter R\'enyi conditional entropy we study coincides precisely with the definition introduced by Hayashi and Tan [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2016], and it also emerges naturally as the classical specialization of the three-parameter quantum R\'enyi conditional entropy recently put forward by Rubboli, Goodarzi, and Tomamichel [arXiv:2410.21976 (2024)]. We establish several fundamental properties of the two-parameter R\'enyi conditional entropy, including monotonicity with respect to the parameters and variational expression. The associated two-parameter R\'enyi mutual information considered in this paper is new and it unifies three commonly used variants of R\'enyi mutual information. For this quantity, we prove several important properties, including the non-negativity, additivity, data processing inequality, monotonicity with respect to the parameters, variational expression, as well as convexity and concavity. Finally, we demonstrate that these two-parameter R\'enyi information quantities can be used to characterize the strong converse exponents in privacy amplification and soft covering problems under R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha \in (0, \infty)$.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection-Based UE-Centric Inter-Cell Interference Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing spectral reuse can cause significant performance degradation due to interference from neighboring cells. In such scenarios, developing effective interference suppression schemes is necessary to improve overall system performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel user equipment-centric interference suppression scheme, which effectively detects inter-cell interference (ICI) and subsequently applies interference whitening to mitigate ICI. The proposed scheme, named Z-refined deep support vector data description, exploits a one-class classification-based anomaly detection technique. Numerical results verify that the proposed scheme outperforms various baselines in terms of interference detection performance with limited time or frequency resources for training and is comparable to the performance based on an ideal genie-aided interference suppression scheme. Furthermore, we demonstrate through test equipment experiments using a commercial fifth-generation modem chipset that the proposed scheme shows performance improvements across various 3rd generation partnership project standard channel environments, including tapped delay line-A, -B, and -C models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate additive cyclic codes over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_{q}\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $q$ is a prime power. First, its generator polynomials and minimal spanning set are determined. Then, examples of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-additive cyclic codes that satisfy the well-known Singleton bound are constructed. Using a Gray map, we produce certain optimal linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_{3}$. Finally, we obtain a few optimal ternary linear complementary dual (LCD) codes from $\mathbb{F}_{3}\mathbb{F}_{9}$-additive codes.</description>

      <title>Generalized informational functionals and new monotone measures of statistical complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a biparametric family of transformations which can be seen as an extension of the so-called up and down transformations. This new class of transformations allows to us to introduce new informational functionals, which we have called \textit{down-moments} and \textit{cumulative upper-moments}. A remarkable fact is that the down-moments provide, in some cases, an interpolation between the $p$-th moments and the power R\'enyi entropies of a probability density. We establish new and sharp inequalities relating these new functionals to the classical informational measures such as moments, R\'enyi and Shannon entropies and Fisher information measures. We also give the optimal bounds as well as the minimizing densities, which are in some cases expressed in terms of the generalized trigonometric functions. We furthermore define new classes of measures of statistical complexity obtained as quotients of the new functionals, and establish monotonicity properties for them through an algebraic conjugation of up and down transformations. All of these properties highlight an intricate structure of functional inequalities.</description>

      <title>Improved AntiGriesmer Bounds for Linear Anticodes and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper improves the antiGriesmer bound for linear anticodes previously established by Chen and Xie (Journal of Algebra, 673 (2025) 304-320). While the original bound required the code length to satisfy $n &lt; q^{k-1}$ and the dual code to have minimum distance at least 3, our main result removes the length restriction and relaxes the dual distance condition to at least 2. Specifically, we prove that for any $[n,k]_q$ linear anticode $\mathcal{C}$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with diameter $\delta$ and $d(\mathcal{C}^\perp) \geq 2$, the inequality \[ n \leq \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left\lfloor \frac{\delta}{q^i} \right\rfloor \] holds. This generalization significantly broadens the applicability of the antiGriesmer bound. We derive several corollaries, including lower bounds on the diameter $\delta$ in terms of $n$ and $k$, upper bounds on the code length $n$, and constraints on the dimension $k$. Applications to the construction and classification of linear codes with few weights are also discussed, along with examples demonstrating that our new bound can be sharper than previous ones. Our work unifies and extends earlier findings, providing a more comprehensive framework for studying linear anticodes and their properties.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Single-Antenna Fluid Antenna Systems via Extreme Value Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In single-antenna fluid antenna systems (FASs), the transceiver dynamically selects the antenna port with the strongest instantaneous channel to enhance link reliability. However, deriving accurate yet tractable performance expressions under fully correlated fading remains challenging, primarily due to the absence of a closed-form distribution for the FAS channel. To address this gap, this paper develops a novel performance evaluation framework for FAS operating under fully correlated Rayleigh fading, by modeling the FAS channel through extreme value distributions (EVDs). We first justify the suitability of EVD modeling and approximate the FAS channel through the Gumbel distribution, with parameters expressed as functions of the number of ports and the antenna aperture size via the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. Closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) are then derived. While the Gumbel model provides an excellent fit, minor deviations arise in the extreme-probability regions. To further improve accuracy, we extend the framework using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution and obtain closed-form OP and EC approximations based on ML-derived parameters. Simulation results confirm that the proposed GEV-based framework achieves superior accuracy over the Gumbel-based model, while both EVD-based approaches offer computationally efficient and analytically tractable tools for evaluating the performance of FAS under realistic correlated fading conditions.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Maximization as a Principle of Associative Memory Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Associative memory, traditionally modeled by Hopfield networks, enables the retrieval of previously stored patterns from partial or noisy cues. Yet, the local computational principles which are required to enable this function remain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information processing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory - Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of different inputs to an output into unique information from each input, redundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges from combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons in classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the information in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between the external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and unique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and performance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as an information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each neuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more than tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks and even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield networks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new design principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new associative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.</description>

      <title>Optimal Source Coding of Markov Chains for Real-Time Remote Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the source coding problem for a Markov chain under the assumption that the transmission times and how fast the Markov chain transitions its state happen at the same time-scale. Specifically, we assume that the transmission of each bit takes a single time slot, and the Markov chain updates its state in the same time slot. Thus, the length of the codeword assigned to a symbol determines the number of non-transmitted symbols, as well as, the probability of the realization of the next symbol to be transmitted. We aim to minimize the average transmission duration over an infinite horizon by proposing an optimal source coding policy based on the last transmitted symbol and its transmission duration. To find the optimal policy, we formulate the problem with a Markov decision process (MDP) by augmenting the symbols alongside the transmission duration of the symbols. Finally, we analyze two Huffman-based benchmark policies and compare their performances with the proposed optimal policy. We observe that, in randomly generated processes, our proposed optimal policy decreases the average transmission duration compared to benchmark policies. The performance gain varies based on the parameters of the Markov process.</description>

      <title>A Construction of Infinite Families of Self-Orthogonal Quasi-Cyclic Codes Using Constituent Codes.pdf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-cyclic codes have been recently employed in the constructions of quantum error-correcting codes. In this paper, we propose a construction of infinite families of quasi-cyclic codes which are self-orthogonal with respect to the Euclidean and Hermitian inner products. In particular, their dimension and a lower bound for their minimum distance are computed using their constituent codes defined over field extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also show that the lower bound for the minimum distance satisfies the square-root-like lower bound and also show how self-dual quasi-cyclic codes can arise from our construction. Using the CSS construction, we show the existence of quantum error-correcting codes with good parameters.</description>

      <title>DiffPace: Diffusion-based Plug-and-play Augmented Channel Estimation in mmWave and Terahertz Ultra-Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz)-band communications hold great promise in meeting the growing data-rate demands of next-generation wireless networks, offering abundant bandwidth. To mitigate the severe path loss inherent to these high frequencies and reduce hardware costs, ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming architectures can deliver substantial beamforming gains and enhanced spectral efficiency. However, accurate channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO systems is challenging due to high channel dimensionality and compressed observations from a limited number of RF chains, while the hybrid near- and far-field radiation patterns, arising from large array apertures and high carrier frequencies, further complicate CE. Conventional compressive sensing based frameworks rely on predefined sparsifying matrices, which cannot faithfully capture the hybrid near-field and far-field channel structures, leading to degraded estimation performance. This paper introduces DiffPace, a diffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation. DiffPace uses a diffusion model (DM) to capture the channel distribution based on the hybrid spherical and planar-wave (HPSM) model. By applying the plug-and-play approach, it leverages the DM as prior knowledge, improving CE accuracy. Moreover, DM performs inference by solving an ordinary differential equation, minimizing the number of required inference steps compared with stochastic sampling method. Experimental results show that DiffPace achieves competitive CE performance, attaining -15 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB, with 90\% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art schemes, simultaneously providing high estimation precision and enhanced computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Design of an M-ary Chaos Shift Keying System Using Combined Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional chaos shift keying (CSK) communication systems, implementing chaotic synchronization techniques is costly but practically unattainable in a noisy environment. This paper proposes a combined chaotic sequences-based $M$-ary CSK (CCS-$M$-CSK) system that eliminates the need for chaotic synchronization. At the transmitter, the chaotic sequence is constructed by combining two chaotic segments of different lengths, where each is generated from distinct chaotic systems and only one kind of chaotic segment modulates the information signal. At the receiver, a deep learning unit with binary classification is meticulously designed to recover information symbols. The symbol error rate (SER) performance of the proposed system is evaluated over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Specifically, the impact of varying misalignment lengths on the SER performance of the system is analyzed when the received sequence is misaligned. Furthermore, the proposed system demonstrates significant performance advantages over existing CSK-based systems in multipath Rayleigh fading channels. These features establish CCS-$M$-CSK as a promising candidate for various applications, including Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X).</description>

      <title>Measuring the Intrinsic Dimension of Earth Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02101v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation, geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact, learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability, regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training. Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts, facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.</description>

      <title>Radon random sampling and reconstruction in local shift-invariant signal space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the problem of reconstruction from Radon random samples in local shift-invariant signal space. Different from sampling after Radon transform, we consider sampling before Radon transform, where the sample set is randomly selected from a square domain with a general probability distribution. First, we prove that the sampling set is stable with high probability under a sufficiently large sample size. Second, we address the problem of signal reconstruction in two-dimensional computed tomography. We demonstrate that the sample values used for this reconstruction process can be determined completely from its Radon transform data. Consequently, we develop an explicit formula to reconstruct the signal using Radon random samples.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of NOMA-Assisted Optical OFDM ISAC Systems with Clipping Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Due to their inherent high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), OFDM waveforms are clipped to fit the limited dynamic range of the optical transmitters (e.g., light-emitting diodes (LEDs)), resulting in clipping distortion. To alleviate the impact of the distortion, we propose a novel transmitter architecture where the clipping processes are performed before NOMA superposition coding. We then analyze the performance of the proposed optical ISAC systems considering the effects of power allocation and clipping distortion. For the communication subsystem, we analyze the effect of NOMA on the achievable sum rate and bit error rate (BER). For the sensing subsystem, the root mean square error (RMSE) and Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) of estimating the transmission distance accuracy are obtained. Simulation results reveal that allocating more power to the strong user yields a higher sum rate, lower BER, and better sensing performance, whereas a more balanced power allocation among users results in degraded BER and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>A Kullback-Leibler divergence method for input-system-state identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence method is examined herein within the Kalman filter framework to select the input-parameter-state estimation execution with the most plausible results. This identification suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining different results from different initial parameter set guesses, and the examined approach uses the information gained from the data in going from the prior to the posterior distribution to address the issue. Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most plausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information applications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring.</description>

      <title>Short Blocks, Fast Sensing: Finite Blocklength Tradeoffs in RIS-Assisted ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous connectivity and environmental awareness. However, practical realization faces significant challenges, including residual self-interference (SI) in full-duplex systems and performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite blocklength (FBL) constraints. This work studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex ISAC system serving multiple downlink users while tracking a moving target, explicitly accounting for SI and FBL effects in both communication and sensing. We formulate an optimization framework to minimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability, solved via alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but raise radar outage from fewer pulses and motion sensitivity. Longer blocklengths improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and reduce outages but allow motion to degrade sensing. A "sweet spot" arises where blocklength and beamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing, seen as a local minimum in radar SINR variance. RIS-assisted optimization identifies this balance, achieving reliable communication and radar sensing jointly.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Copula-Based Outage Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna Systems: Channel Coefficient- or Envelope-Level Correlation Matrix?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian copula has been employed to evaluate the outage performance of Fluid Antenna Systems (FAS), with the covariance matrix reflecting the dependence among multivariate normal random variables (RVs). While prior studies approximate this matrix using the channel coefficient correlation matrix from Jake's model, this work instead employs the channel envelope correlation matrix, motivated by the fact that the multivariate normal RVs are generated by transforming correlated channel envelopes. This raises an open question of whether using the coefficient- or envelope-level correlation matrix yields better accuracy in accessing FAS performance. Toward this end, this paper explores the benefits of using the envelope-level correlation matrix under fully correlated Nakagami-m fading, and develops a method for generating such fading channels for Monte Carlo simulations, which serve as a benchmark for validating the theoretical results. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed channel modeling approach and demonstrate the superior accuracy of using the envelope-level correlation matrix, particularly in sparse port deployment and low-outage regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Levenshtein's sequence reconstruction problem in the case where the transmitted codeword is chosen from $\{0,1\}^n$ and the channel can delete up to $t$ symbols from the transmitted codeword. We determine the minimum number of channel outputs (assuming that they are distinct) required to reconstruct a list of size $\ell-1$ of candidate sequences, one of which corresponds to the original transmitted sequence. More specifically, we determine the maximum possible size of the intersection of $\ell \geq 3$ deletion balls of radius $t$ centered at $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{\ell}$, where $x_i \in \{0,1\}^n$ for all $i \in \{1,2,\dots,\ell\}$ and $x_i \neq x_j$ for $i \neq j$, with $n \geq t+ \ell-1$ and $t \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Testing with Non-identically Distributed Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the extent to which sublinear-sample property testing and estimation apply to settings where samples are independently but not identically distributed. Specifically, we consider the following distributional property testing framework: Suppose there is a set of distributions over a discrete support of size $k$, $p_1, p_2,\ldots,p_T$, and we obtain $c$ independent draws from each distribution. Suppose the goal is to learn or test a property of the average distribution, $p_{avg}$. This setup models a number of important practical settings where the individual distributions correspond to heterogeneous entities -- either individuals, chronologically distinct time periods, spatially separated data sources, etc. From a learning standpoint, even with $c=1$ samples from each distribution, $\Theta(k/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary and sufficient to learn $p_{avg}$ to within error $\varepsilon$ in $\ell_1$ distance. To test uniformity or identity -- distinguishing the case that $p_{avg}$ is equal to some reference distribution, versus has $\ell_1$ distance at least $\varepsilon$ from the reference distribution, we show that a linear number of samples in $k$ is necessary given $c=1$ samples from each distribution. In contrast, for $c \ge 2$, we recover the usual sublinear sample testing guarantees of the i.i.d.\ setting: we show that $O(\sqrt{k}/\varepsilon^2 + 1/\varepsilon^4)$ total samples are sufficient, matching the optimal sample complexity in the i.i.d.\ case in the regime where $\varepsilon \ge k^{-1/4}$. Additionally, we show that in the $c=2$ case, there is a constant $\rho &gt; 0$ such that even in the linear regime with $\rho k$ samples, no tester that considers the multiset of samples (ignoring which samples were drawn from the same $p_i$) can perform uniformity testing. We also extend our techniques to the problem of testing "closeness" of two distributions.</description>

      <title>Feature compression is the root cause of adversarial fragility in neural network classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we uniquely study the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks (NN) for classification tasks against that of optimal classifiers. We look at the smallest magnitude of possible additive perturbations that can change a classifier's output. We provide a matrix-theoretic explanation of the adversarial fragility of deep neural networks for classification. In particular, our theoretical results show that a neural network's adversarial robustness can degrade as the input dimension $d$ increases. Analytically, we show that neural networks' adversarial robustness can be only $1/\sqrt{d}$ of the best possible adversarial robustness of optimal classifiers. Our theories match remarkably well with numerical experiments of practically trained NN, including NN for ImageNet images. The matrix-theoretic explanation is consistent with an earlier information-theoretic feature-compression-based explanation for the adversarial fragility of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Application of the Lov\'asz-Schrijver Lift-and-Project Operator to Compact Stable Set Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz theta function $\theta(G)$ provides a very good upper bound on the stability number of a graph $G$. It can be computed in polynomial time by solving a semidefinite program (SDP), which also turns out to be fairly tractable in practice. Consequently, $\theta(G)$ achieves a hard-to-beat trade-off between computational effort and strength of the bound. Indeed, several attempts to improve the theta bound are documented, mainly based on playing around the application of the $N_+(\cdot)$ lifting operator of Lov\'asz and Schrijver to the classical formulation of the maximum stable set problem. Experience shows that solving such SDP-s often struggles against practical intractability and requires highly specialized methods. We investigate the application of such an operator to two different linear formulations based on clique and nodal inequalities, respectively. Fewer inequalities describe these two and yet guarantee that the resulting SDP bound is at least as strong as $\theta(G)$. Our computational experience, including larger graphs than those previously documented, shows that upper bounds stronger than $\theta(G)$ can be accessed by a reasonable additional effort using the clique-based formulation on sparse graphs and the nodal-based one on dense graphs.</description>
