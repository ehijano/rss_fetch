      <title>von Neumann entropy and quantum version of thermodynamic entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The debate whether the von Neumann (VN) entropy is a suitable quantum version of the thermodynamic (TH) entropy has a long history. In this regard, we briefly review some of the main reservations about the VN entropy and explain that the objections about its time-invariance and subadditivity properties can be either avoided or addressed convincingly. In a broader context, we analyze here whether and when the VN entropy is the same or equivalent to the TH entropy. For a thermalized isolated or open system, the VN entropy for an appropriately chosen density operator is the same as the quantum version of, respectively, the Boltzmann or Gibbs entropy (these latter entropies are equivalent to the TH entropy for large thermalized systems). Since the quantum thermalization is essentially defined for a subsystem of a much larger system, it is important to investigate if the VN entropy of a subsystem is equivalent to its TH entropy. We here show that the VN entropy of a small subsystem of a large thermalized system is proportional to the quantum statistical entropy (Boltzmann's version) of the subsystem. For relevant numerical results, we take a one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain with next-nearest neighbor interactions.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between quantum error correcting codes and quantum reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a gauge theory, a collection of kinematical degrees of freedom is used to redundantly describe a smaller amount of gauge-invariant information. In a quantum error correcting code (QECC), a collection of computational degrees of freedom that make up a device's physical layer is used to redundantly encode a smaller amount of logical information. We elaborate this clear parallel in terms of quantum reference frames (QRFs), which are a universal toolkit for quantization in the presence of symmetries. The result is a precise dictionary between QECCs and QRFs within the perspective-neutral framework for constrained systems. Concepts from quantum error correction like error sets and correctability translate to novel insights into the informational architecture of gauge theories. Conversely, the dictionary provides a systematic procedure for constructing symmetry-based QECCs and characterizing their error correcting properties. In this initial work, we scrutinize the dictionary between Pauli stabilizer codes and their corresponding QRF setups, which possess symmetry groups that are isomorphic to the stabilizer group. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal correctable error sets and tensor factorizations splitting system from frame degrees of freedom, relative to which errors corrupt only redundant frame data. When passed through the dictionary, standard Pauli errors from the code essentially behave as electric excitations that are exactly dual, via Pontryagin duality, to magnetic excitations related to gauge-fixing. We comprehensively illustrate our findings in surface codes, which themselves manifestly connect quantum error correction with gauge systems. The exploratory investigations in this article pave the way for deeper foundational applications to quantum gauge theories and for eventual practical applications to quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulating continuum field theories with large-spin lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) is one of the most promising applications of quantum simulators. Regularizing a bosonic QFT for quantum simulation purposes typically involves a truncation in Hilbert space in addition to a discretization of space. Here, we discuss how to perform such a regularization of scalar QFTs using multi-level or qudit systems, and show that this enables quantitative predictions in the continuum limit by extrapolating results obtained for large-spin lattice models. With extensive matrix-product state simulations, we numerically demonstrate the sequence of extrapolations that leads to quantitative agreement of observables for the integrable sine-Gordon (sG) QFT. We further show how to prepare static and moving soliton excitations, and analyze their scattering dynamics, in agreement with a semi-classical model and analytical predictions. Finally, we illustrate how a non-integrable perturbation of the sG model gives rise to dynamics reminiscent of string breaking and plasma oscillations in gauge theories. Our methods are directly applicable in state-of-the-art analog quantum simulators, opening the door to implementing a wide variety of scalar field theories and tackling long-standing questions in non-equilibrium QFT like the fate of the false vacuum.</description>

      <title>Rotational stability in nanorotor and spin contrast in one-loop interferometry in the Stern-Gerlach setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotation of a nanoparticle in a quantum system has many applications, from theory to experiments. This paper will treat nanoparticle rotational dynamics for spin-embedded nanorotors. We will model it as a rigid body that properly treats the rotation in the co-frame of the nanorotor in the presence of external fields. Besides rotation, we will further investigate how to create large spatial superpositions in the inhomogeneous external magnetic field, such as in the case of the Stern-Gerlach apparatus. The spin-embedded nanorotors play a crucial role in creating matter-wave interferometers through their spin and external magnetic field interaction Hamiltonian. We aim to provide a holistic interpretation of the dynamics of three Euler angles, their quantum evolution, and the nanorotor's spatial motion in a Stern-Gerlach-type setup where we will consider one-full-loop interferometry. We will then study how the quantum evolution of all the Euler angles leads to a spin coherence loss upon interference and what manifests the Einstein-de Haas effect in an external magnetic field. In particular, we show that by imparting rotation along the direction of the magnetic field, we can stabilise the nanorotor's libration mode. We will also extend our analysis to a case where the initial state of the libration mode is thermal and discuss the contrast loss due to interference of the nanorotor upon one-loop completion.</description>

      <title>Reliable quantum advantage in quantum battery charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries represent one of the most promising applications of quantum thermodynamics, whose goal is not only to store energy inside small quantum systems but also to potentially leverage genuine quantum effects to outperform classical counterparts. In this context, however, energy fluctuations become extremely relevant and have a significant impact on the charging efficiency. In our work, we consider a simple yet paradigmatic model in which a flying qubit (the battery) coherently interacts with a single mode optical cavity (the charger) through a number conserving Jaynes-Cummings interaction. By making use of full-counting statistics techniques, we fully characterize the average charging power, its fluctuations and the associated charging efficiency for several different choices of initial states of the optical cavity, demonstrating that preparing the latter in a genuinely quantum non-Gaussian Fock state (rather than a classical or even non-classical Gaussian state) leads to a definite and (in principle) measurable advantage in all these figures of merit.</description>

      <title>Second-law-allowed temporal cooling of the coldest reservoir without external refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics is an intensively developing field with many existing applications. We study the dynamics of temperatures and chemical potentials of fermionic reservoirs coupled to an open quantum system. We show that heat transfer from the coldest reservoir to the hottest one is allowed by the Clausius inequality and results in transient cooling of the coldest reservoir without additional external refrigeration. We show that during the establishment of thermal and chemical equilibrium, non-monotone evolution of reservoirs' temperatures and chemical potentials is possible, including changes in reservoirs' temperatures and chemical potentials orderliness. Achieved results can be used in the design of quantum thermal machines and nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the dynamics of a single harmonically trapped ion interacting with a laser, considering a linear combination of two eigenstates of the system as the initial state. The conditions on the physical parameters that allow for the evolution of the system are discussed. We are able to obtain analytical results even though no approximations are realized and are able to show Rabi oscillations for such initial states.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic construction of SSA-compatible extreme rays of the subadditivity cone and the ${\sf N}=6$ solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the set of all extreme rays of the 6-party subadditivity cone that are compatible with strong subadditivity. In total, we identify 208 new (genuine 6-party) orbits, 52 of which violate at least one known holographic entropy inequality. For the remaining 156 orbits, which do not violate any such inequalities, we construct holographic graph models for 150 of them. For the final 6 orbits, it remains an open question whether they are holographic. Consistent with the strong form of the conjecture in \cite{Hernandez-Cuenca:2022pst}, 148 of these graph models are trees. However, 2 of the graphs contain a "bulk cycle", leaving open the question of whether equivalent models with tree topology exist, or if these extreme rays are counterexamples to the conjecture. The paper includes a detailed description of the algorithm used for the computation, which is presented in a general framework and can be applied to any situation involving a polyhedral cone defined by a set of linear inequalities and a partial order among them to find extreme rays corresponding to down-sets in this poset.</description>

      <title>Wave function evolution from source to detection and the measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of a particle wave function when it propagates through free space in the longitudinal z-direction from a thin entrance slit to a detector behind a thin exit slit parallel to the horizontal y-axis. We consider an extra aperture slit between the two slits to probe the evolution of the wave function and close the aperture slit starting from wide open until the detection counting rate in a repeated experiment drops to half. When all the slits are long and thin, the 1D Schroedinger equation gives the wave function evolution until the final detection. The width of the aperture slit in the vertical x-direction depends on the z-position of the slit providing an approximate description of the wave function evolution. The width of the function characterizing this dependence starts from the entrance slit. It grows wider until it reaches a maximum and then shrinks narrower and finally collapses into the exit slit where the particle is detected. Thus the envelope of this function has a spindle shape with its pointed ends at the two slits. Hence it is very different from the well-known wave function of the Schroedinger equation with the initial condition at the entrance slit, which is narrow only at the beginning, then grows wider until it reaches the exit slit, where it is much larger than the slit width. However, the phase information is lost because the aperture slit distorts the wave function. To keep the phase information, we replace the aperture slit with a thin pin (parallel to the y-axis) that blocks the wave function. We then study its perturbative effect on the counting rate of the detector. This analysis provides a function to probe the process of the wave function collapse right before the detection. We show this function is real-valued, with amplitude and phase information, and is closely related to the wave function.</description>

      <title>Optimizing FTQC Programs through QEC Transpiler and Architecture Codesign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is essential for executing reliable quantum computations of meaningful scale. Widely adopted QEC codes for FTQC, such as the surface code and color codes, utilize Clifford+T gate sets, where T gates are generally considered as the primary bottleneck due to their high resource costs. Recent advances in T gate optimization have significantly reduced this overhead, making Clifford gate complexity an increasingly critical bottleneck that remains largely unaddressed in present FTQC compiler and architecture designs. To address this new bottleneck, this paper introduces TACO, a \textbf{T}ranspiler-\textbf{A}rchitecture \textbf{C}odesign \textbf{O}ptimization framework, to reduce Clifford cost. Specifically, we observe that, through codesign, insights rooted in the FTQC architecture can inform novel circuit-level optimizations for FTQC compilers. These optimizations, in turn, provide new opportunities to redesign and improve the underlying architecture. Evaluations show that TACO achieves an average 91.7% reduction in Clifford gates across diverse quantum circuits and significantly enhances gate parallelism compared to Pauli-based approaches. These improvements enable an efficient FTQC architecture that can achieve single-gate-per-cycle throughput using only $1.5n+4$ logical qubit tiles, considerably pushing forward upon previously proposed designs that require $2n+\sqrt{8n}+1$ tiles. These results highlight the benefits of bidirectional optimization through codesign. TACO will be open-source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce a scheme to construct unitary matrices, leveraging the supermap formalism, to implement a twirl with respect to the qubit unitary group. As an application, this construction is employed to estimate the average gate fidelity of a noisy gate. This work integrates the supermap formalism into gate characterisation. The construction extends to potential applications in qudit twirling operations and comparisons with unitary two-design applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-object operational tasks for measurement incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce multi-object operational tasks for measurement incompatibility in the form of multi-object quantum subchannel discrimination and exclusion games with prior information, where a player can simultaneously harness the resources contained within both a quantum state and a set of measurements. We show that any fully or partially resourceful pair of objects is useful for a suitably chosen multi-object subchannel discrimination and exclusion game with prior information. The advantage provided by a fully or partially resourceful object against all possible fully free objects in such a game can be quantified in a multiplicative manner by the resource quantifiers of generalised robustness and weight of resource for discrimination and exclusion games, respectively. These results hold for arbitrary properties of quantum states as well as for arbitrary properties of sets of measurements closed under classical pre and post-processing and, consequently, include measurement incompatibility as a particular case. We furthermore show that these results are not exclusive to quantum theory, but that can also be extended to the realm of general probabilistic theories.</description>

      <title>Simulating Three-Flavor Neutrino Oscillations on an NMR Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer using the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) theory in close analogy to the physical processes realized in experiments. We simulate three-flavor neutrino oscillations on a two-qubit NMR quantum information processor. The three-flavor neutrino states were encoded into the two-qubit system, leaving one redundant basis state (representing an unphysical sterile neutrino). We simulated the neutrino oscillations in different scenarios, including propagation in vacuum and through surrounding matter, and both with and without a CP violating phase $\delta$ at a Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) baseline distance of L = 1285 km. The oscillation probabilities were obtained after unitarily time evolving the initial flavor state and and comparisons were performed between different scenarios. Further, we design and implement an optimized quantum circuit encoding all four parameters (three mixing angles-$\theta_{12},\theta_{23},\theta_{13}$ and one complex phase $\delta$) to implement the PMNS unitary matrix, which relates the flavor and mass eigenstates. The interaction with matter is considered as a perturbation to the vacuum Hamiltonian, and the same quantum circuit is employed with an approximation of two mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{13}$ ) and mass eigenvalues. Our experimental results match well with numerical simulations and highlight the potential of quantum computers for exploring the physics of neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>New Design of three-qubit system with three transmons and a single fixed-frequency resonator coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmon, which has a short gate time and remarkable scalability, is the most commonly utilized superconducting qubit, based on the Cooper pair box as a qubit or coupler in superconducting quantum computers. Lattice and heavy-hexagon structures are well-known large-scale configurations for transmon-based quantum computers that classical computers cannot simulate. These structures share a common feature: a resonator coupler that connects two transmon qubits. Although significant progress has been made in implementing quantum error correction and quantum computing using quantum error mitigation, fault-tolerant quantum computing remains unachieved due to the inherent vulnerability of these structures. This raises the question of whether the transmon-resonator-transmon structure is the best option for constructing a transmon-based quantum computer. To address this, we demonstrate that the average fidelity of CNOT gates can exceed 0.98 in a structure where a resonator coupler mediates the coupling of three transmon qubits. This result suggests that our novel structure could be a key method for increasing the number of connections among qubits while preserving gate performance in a transmon-based quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in quantum hardware and algorithms researchers have developed quantum heuristics for optimization problems, aiming for advantages over classical methods. To date, quantum hardware is still error-prone and limited in size such that quantum heuristics cannot be scaled to relevant problem sizes and are often outperformed by their classical counterparts. Moreover, if provably optimal solutions are desired, one has to resort to classical exact methods. As however quantum technologies may improve considerably in future, we demonstrate in this work how quantum heuristics with limited resources can be integrated in large-scale exact optimization algorithms for NP-hard problems. To this end, we consider vehicle routing as prototypical NP-hard problem. We model the pricing and separation subproblems arising in a branch-price-and-cut algorithm as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. This allows to use established quantum heuristics like quantum annealing or the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for their solution. A key feature of our algorithm is that it profits not only from the best solution returned by the quantum heuristic but from all solutions below a certain cost threshold, thereby exploiting the inherent randomness is quantum algorithms. Moreover, we reduce the requirements on quantum hardware since the subproblems, which are solved via quantum heuristics, are smaller than the original problem. We provide an experimental study comparing quantum annealing to simulated annealing and to established classical algorithms in our framework. While our hybrid quantum-classical approach is still outperformed by purely classical methods, our results reveal that both pricing and separation may be well suited for quantum heuristics if quantum hardware improves.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Magic State Injection within Heavy-Hexagon Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magic state injection process is a critical component of fault-tolerant quantum computing, and numerous studies have been conducted on this topic. Many existing studies have focused on square-lattice structures, where each qubit connects directly to four other qubits via two-qubit gates. However, hardware that does not follow a lattice structure, such as IBM's heavy-hexagon structure, is also under development. In these non-lattice structures, many quantum error correction (QEC) codes designed for lattice-based system cannot be directly applied. Adapting these codes often requires incorporating additional qubits, such as flag qubits. This alters the properties of the QEC code and introduces new variables into the magic state injection process. In this study, we implemented and compared the magic state injection process on a heavy-hexagon structure with flag qubits and a lattice structure without flag qubits. Additionally, we considered biased errors in superconducting hardware and investigated the impact of flag qubits under these conditions. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion of flag qubits introduces distinct characteristics into the magic state injection process, which are absent in systems without flag qubits. Based on these findings, we identify several critical considerations for performing magic state injection on heavy-hexagon systems incorporating flag qubits. Furthermore, we propose an optimized approach to maximize the efficacy of this process in such systems.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishable MHz-narrow heralded photon pairs from a whispering gallery resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel interference plays a vital role in many quantum optical applications where indistinguishability of two photons is important. Such photon pairs are commonly generated as the signal and idler in the frequency and polarization-degenerate spontaneous parametric down conversion~(SPDC). To scale this approach to a larger number of photons we demonstrate how two independent signal photons radiated into different spatial modes can be rendered conditionally indistinguishable by a heralding measurement performed on their respective idlers. We use the SPDC in a whispering gallery resonator, which is already proven to be versatile sources of quantum states. Its extreme conversion efficiency allowed us to perform our measurements with only \qty{50}{nW} of in-coupled pump power in each propagation direction. The Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of two counter-propagating signal photons manifested itself in the four-fold coincidence rate, where the two idler photons detection heralds a pair of signal photons with a desired temporal overlap. We achieved the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip contrast of \(74\pm 5\%\). Importantly, the optical bandwidth of all involved photons is of the order of a MHz and is continuously tunable. This, on the one hand, makes it possible to achieve the necessary temporal measurements resolution with standard electronics, and on the other hand, creates a quantum states source compatible with other candidates for qubit implementation, such as optical transitions in solid-state or vaporous systems. We also discuss the possibility of generating photon pairs with similar temporal modes from two different whispering gallery resonators.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishability of remote quantum dot-cavity single-photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating identical photons from remote emitter-based bright single-photon sources is an important step for scaling up optical quantum technologies. Here, we study the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of photons emitted from remote sources based on semiconductor quantum dots. We make use of a deterministic fabrication technique to position the quantum dots in a spectrally resonant micropillar cavity and fine tune their operation wavelength electrically. Doing so, we can match four pairs of sources between five distinct sources, study them under various excitation schemes and measure their degree of indistinguishability. We demonstrate remote indistinguishabiltiy between 44$\pm$1% and 69$\pm$1% depending on the pair of sources and excitation conditions, record values for quantum dots in cavities. The relative contribution of pure dephasing and spectral diffusion is then analysed, revealing that the remaining distinguishability is mostly due to low frequency noise</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy scaling laws from fluctuations of non-conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement patterns reveal essential information on many-body states and provide a way to classify quantum phases of matter. However, experimental studies of many-body entanglement remain scarce due to their unscalable nature. The present work aims to mitigate this theoretical and experimental divide by introducing reduced fluctuations of observables, consisting of a sum of on-site operators, as a scalable experimental probe of the entanglement entropy. Specifically, we illustrate by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations in spin chains that the reduced fluctuations exhibit the same size scaling properties as the entanglement entropy. Generalizing previous observations restricted to special systems with conserved quantities, our work introduces experimentally feasible protocol to extract entanglement scaling laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sum of quantum computing errors is the key element both for the estimation and control of errors in quantum computing and for its statistical study. In this article we analyze the sum of two independent quantum computing errors, $X_1$ and $X_2$, and we obtain the formula of the variance of the sum of these errors: $$ V(X_1+X_2)=V(X_1)+V(X_2)-\frac{V(X_1)V(X_2)}{2}. $$ We conjecture that this result holds true for general quantum computing errors and we prove the formula for independent isotropic quantum computing errors.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hamiltonian Simulation: A Utility Scale Perspective for Covalent Inhibitor Reactivity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing applications in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era demand algorithms capable of generating shallower circuits that are feasible to run on today's quantum systems. This is a challenge, particularly for quantum chemistry applications, considering the inherent complexity of molecular systems. In this paper, we demonstrate advancements that expand the size of chemistry problems that can be run on today's quantum systems by applying hardware-efficient approaches, such as Quantum-Centric Data-Driven Research and Development (QDDRD), optimized algorithms with reduced circuit depth, and execute the experiments with middleware-supported quantum error mitigation. We report up to a 29-fold reduction in circuit depth for covalent drug molecules, enabling Hamiltonian dynamics for reactivity predictions, assuming all-to-all connectivity of quantum hardware. When employed on IBMQ's Heron architecture, we see up to a 16-fold reduction. The overarching impact of this work is that it highlights promising methods that allow researchers to explore the dynamics of commercially relevant chemistry on real quantum hardware via Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Two-Qubit Gates in Tunable-Coupler Architectures Using Single Flux Quantum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a gradient-based method to construct high-fidelity, two-qubit quantum gates in a system consisting of two transmon qubits coupled via a tunable coupler. In particular, we focus on single flux quantum (SFQ) pulses as a promising and scalable alternative to traditional control schemes that use microwave electronics. We develop a continuous embedding scheme to optimize these discrete pulses, taking advantage of auto-differentiation of our model. This approach allows us to achieve fSim-type gates with average gate fidelities on the order of 99.99% and CZ and CNOT gates with fidelities above 99.9%. Furthermore, we provide an alternative semi-analytical construction of these gates via an exact decomposition using a pair of fSim gates which leads to the reduction in memory required to store the associated pulse sequences.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical dark-mode-breaking cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanical cooling of multiple degenerate mechanical modes is prevented by the mechanical dark mode due to destructive interference. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of simultaneous cooling of two near-degenerate mechanical modes by breaking the mechanical dark mode in a two-membrane cavity optomechanical system. The dark mode is generated as the system passes the exceptional point of the antiparity-time symmetric scheme. By introducing a second cavity mode for the additional dissipative channel, the dark mode is broken and the total phonon number is reduced by more than an order of magnitude below the dark mode cooling limit. Owing to the flexible tunability of the optomechanical coupling rates of such a four-mode coupled system, the optimized cooling efficiency can be achieved by investigating different parameter ranges. Our results provide an important step towards the ground state cooling and entanglement among multiple degenerate mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle in the wrong box (or: the perils of finite-dimensional approximations)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When numerically simulating the unitary time evolution of an infinite-dimensional quantum system, one is usually led to treat the Hamiltonian $H$ as an ''infinite-dimensional matrix'' by expressing it in some orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space, and then truncate it to some finite dimensions. However, the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equations generated by the truncated Hamiltonians need not converge, in general, to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation corresponding to the actual Hamiltonian.
  In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, they converge to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation generated by a specific Hamiltonian which crucially depends on the particular choice of basis: the Friedrichs extension of the restriction of $H$ to the space of finite linear combinations of elements of the basis. Importantly, this is generally different from $H$ itself; in all such cases, numerical simulations will unavoidably reproduce the wrong dynamics in the limit, and yet there is no numerical test that can reveal this failure, unless one has the analytical solution to compare with.
  As a practical demonstration of such results, we consider the quantum particle in the box, and we show that, for a wide class of bases (which include associated Legendre polynomials as a concrete example) the dynamics generated by the truncated Hamiltonians will always converge to the one corresponding to the particle with Dirichlet boundary conditions, regardless the initial choice of boundary conditions. Other such examples are discussed.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties and Magic Generation in $T$-doped Random Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of complexity in deep random $N$-qubit $T$-gate doped Clifford circuits, as reflected in their spectral properties and in magic generation, characterized by the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For pure (undoped) Clifford circuits, a unique periodic orbit structure in the space of Pauli strings implies peculiar spectral correlations and level statistics with large degeneracies. $T$-gate doping induces an exponentially fast transition to chaotic behavior, described by random matrix theory. To characterize magic generation properties of the Clifford+$T$ ensemble, we determine the distribution of magic, as well as the average nonstabilizing power of the quantum circuit ensemble. In the dilute limit, $N_T \ll N$, magic generation is governed by single-qubit behavior, and magic increases linearly with the number of $T$-gates, $N_T$. For $N_T\gg N$, magic distribution converges to that of Haar-random unitaries, and averages to a finite magic density, $\mu$, $\lim_{N\to\infty} \langle\mu\rangle_\text{Haar} = 1$. Although our numerics has large finite-size effects, finite size scaling reveals a magic density phase transition at a critical $T$-gate density, $n^{*}_T = (N_T/N)^* \approx 2.41$ in the $N \to \infty$ limit. This is in contrast to the spectral transition, where ${\cal O} (1)$ $T$-gates suffice to remove spectral degeneracies and to induce a transition to chaotic behavior in the thermodynamic limit. Magic is therefore a more sensitive indicator of complexity.</description>

      <title>Advantages and limitations of channel multiplexing for discrete-variable quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typically practical realizations of discrete-variable quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, based on exchanging single-photon signals between the trusted parties, can provide its users with only very low key generation rates. One of the potential solutions for this problem, that can be adapted for the case of entanglement-based QKD schemes using broadband photon-pair sources, is to utilize wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) modules in order to split the photons with different wavelengths to separate detection channels and generate multiple keys in parallel. Here, we theoretically investigate this idea in the case of pulsed laser used to pump spontaneous parametric down-conversion source. We optimize the effective phase-matching function width of the nonlinear crystal, and the intensity and duration of the pump laser pulses in order to maximize the advantage of the overall key generation rate provided by the WDM-based QKD scheme over the traditional no-WDM scenario. The results of our analysis show that the considered method can significantly accelerate the production of cryptographic keys, but proper optimization of the photon-pair source is needed to exploit its full potential.</description>

      <title>Hole burning experiments and modeling in erbium-doped silica glass fibers down to millikelvin temperatures: evidence for ultra-long population storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use spectral hole burning to investigate spin dynamics within the electronic Zeeman sublevels of the ground state of the erbium ions in erbium-doped fibers (EDF). Conducted at ultra-low temperatures and under varying magnetic fields, our study reveals distinct changes in spin relaxation dynamics across different conditions. We identified three decay components at approximately 7 mK, with one achieving spin lifetimes of over 9 hours under optimal conditions, while two components were observed at higher temperatures. The fairly stable relative weights of the decay components across conditions suggest distinct ion populations contributing to the observed relaxation dynamics. While earlier studies struggled to account for all decay components at higher temperatures, our approach successfully models spin dynamics across all observed decay components, using a consistent set of underlying mechanisms, including spin flip-flop interactions, direct coupling to two-level systems, and Raman-type processes, and distinguishes the decay components by the strengths with which these mechanisms contribute. These results suggest EDFs' potential as a promising candidate for quantum memory applications, with further room for optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When estimating an unknown phase rotation of a continuous-variable system with homodyne detection, the optimal probe state strongly depends on the value of the estimated parameter. In this article, we identify the optimal pure single-mode Gaussian probe states depending on the knowledge of the estimated phase parameter before the measurement. We find that for a large prior uncertainty, the optimal probe states are close to coherent states, a result in line with findings from noisy parameter estimation. But with increasingly precise estimates of the parameter it becomes beneficial to put more of the available energy into the squeezing of the probe state. Surprisingly, there is a clear jump, where the optimal probe state changes abruptly to a squeezed vacuum state, which maximizes the Fisher information for this estimation task. We use our results to study repeated measurements and compare different methods to adapt the probe state based on the changing knowledge of the parameter according to the previous findings.</description>

      <title>Millikelvin Nb nanoSQUID-embedded tuneable resonator fabricated with a neon focused-ion-beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SQUID-embedded superconducting resonators are of great interest due to their potential for coupling highly scalable superconducting circuits with quantum memories based on solid-state spin ensembles. Such an application requires a high-$Q$, frequency-tuneable resonator which is both resilient to magnetic field, and able to operate at millikelvin temperatures. These requirements motivate the use of a higher $H_{c}$ metal such as niobium, however the challenge then becomes to sufficiently reduce the operating temperature. We address this by presenting a monolithic Nb nanoSQUID-embedded resonator, where neon focused-ion-beam fabrication of the nanoSQUID results in a device displaying frequency tuneability at $T = 16$ mK. In order to assess the applicability of the device for coupling to small spin clusters, we characterise the flux sensitivity as a function of microwave drive power and externally applied magnetic field, and find that the noise is dominated by dielectric noise in the resonator. Finally, we discuss improvements to the device design which can dramatically improve the flux sensitivity, which highlights the promise of Nb SQUID-embedded resonators for hybrid superconductor-spin applications.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement structure of monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits have attracted significant interest as an example of synthetic quantum matter, intrinsically defined by their quantum information content. Here, we propose a multipartite entanglement perspective on monitored phases through the lens of quantum Fisher information. Our findings reveal that unstructured monitored random circuits fail to exhibit divergent multipartite entanglement even at criticality, highlighting their departure from standard quantum critical behavior. However, we demonstrate that genuinely multipartite entangled phases can be realized through two-site measurements, provided a protection mechanism is in place. This work positions multipartite entanglement as a valuable perspective for the study of interacting monitored circuits and broader frameworks of noisy quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Error-corrected fermionic quantum processors with neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body fermionic systems can be simulated in a hardware-efficient manner using a fermionic quantum processor. Neutral atoms trapped in optical potentials can realize such processors, where non-local fermionic statistics are guaranteed at the hardware level. Implementing quantum error correction in this setup is however challenging, due to the atom-number superselection present in atomic systems, that is, the impossibility of creating coherent superpositions of different particle numbers. In this work, we overcome this constraint and present a blueprint for an error-corrected fermionic quantum computer that can be implemented using current experimental capabilities. To achieve this, we first consider an ancillary set of fermionic modes and design a fermionic reference, which we then use to construct superpositions of different numbers of referenced fermions. This allows us to build logical fermionic modes that can be error corrected using standard atomic operations. Here, we focus on phase errors, which we expect to be a dominant source of errors in neutral-atom quantum processors. We then construct logical fermionic gates, and show their implementation for the logical particle-number conserving processes relevant for quantum simulation. Finally, our protocol is illustrated using a minimal fermionic circuit, where it leads to a quadratic suppression of the logical error rate.</description>

      <title>Bounds on concatenated entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) make use of pre-shared entanglement to enhance the rate of error correction and communication. We study the concatenation of EAQECCs, in specific showing how the order of concatenation affects the number of ebits consumed, the logical error probability, the pseudo-threshold, and the violation of the quantum Hamming bound. We find that if the quaternary code from which an EAQECC is derived saturates the Griesmer (resp., Plotkin) bound, then the derived code will saturate the Griesmer (resp., linear Plotkin) bound for EAQECCs. We present families of concatenated EAQECCs that saturate the quantum Singleton, Griesmer, and linear Plotkin bounds for EAQECCs.</description>

      <title>Sparse Non-Markovian Noise Modeling of Transmon-Based Multi-Qubit Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of noise on quantum dynamics is one of the main factors preventing current quantum processors from performing accurate quantum computations. Sufficient noise characterization and modeling can provide key insights into the effect of noise on quantum algorithms and inform the design of targeted error protection protocols. However, constructing effective noise models that are sparse in model parameters, yet predictive can be challenging. In this work, we present an approach for effective noise modeling of multi-qubit operations on transmon-based devices. Through a comprehensive characterization of seven devices offered by the IBM Quantum Platform, we show that the model can capture and predict a wide range of single- and two-qubit behaviors, including non-Markovian effects resulting from spatio-temporally correlated noise sources. The model's predictive power is further highlighted through multi-qubit dynamical decoupling demonstrations and an implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver. As a training proxy for the hardware, we show that the model can predict expectation values within a relative error of 0.5%; this is a 7$\times$ improvement over default hardware noise models. Through these demonstrations, we highlight key error sources in superconducting qubits and illustrate the utility of reduced noise models for predicting hardware dynamics.</description>

      <title>Engineering high-Q superconducting tantalum microwave coplanar waveguide resonators for compact coherent quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has recently received considerable attention in manufacturing robust superconducting quantum circuits. Ta offers low microwave loss, high kinetic inductance compared to aluminium (Al) and niobium (Nb), and good compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which is essential for quantum computing applications. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication engineering of thickness-dependent high quality factor (high-Q_i) Ta superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonators. All films are deposited on high-resistivity silicon substrates at room temperature without additional substrate heating. Before Ta deposition, a niobium (Nb) seed layer is used to ensure a body-centred cubic lattice ({\alpha}-Ta) formation. We further engineer the kinetic inductance (L_K) resonators by varying Ta film thicknesses. High L_K is a key advantage for applications because it facilitates the realisation of high-impedance, compact quantum circuits with enhanced coupling to qubits. The maximum internal quality factor Q_i of ~ 3.6 * 10^6 is achieved at the high power regime for 100 nm Ta, while the highest kinetic inductance is obtained to be 0.6 pH/sq for the thinnest film, which is 40 nm. This combination of high Q_i and high L_K highlights the potential of Ta microwave circuits for high-fidelity operations of compact quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Kramers-protected hardware-efficient error correction with Andreev spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for bit flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit flip code. Thereby, without detuning from the Kramers' point, reflectometry off a single coupled resonator accomplishes a projective measurement of multiple stabilizers. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of logical quantum gates. The concept is experimentally feasible.</description>

      <title>C-R-T Fractionalization in the First Quantized Hamiltonian Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a fractionalization distinct from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{C}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{T}}$ for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the spacetime dimension $d+1=5,6,7\bmod8$, the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\chi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d,0)}$) aligns with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\psi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d)}$), rather than being half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in $n_{\mathbb{R}}$ and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Operator K-complexity in DSSYK: Krylov complexity equals bulk length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the notion of complexity under time evolution in chaotic quantum systems with holographic duals. Continuing on from our previous work, we turn our attention to the issue of Krylov complexity upon the insertion of a class of single-particle operators in the double-scaled SYK model. Such an operator is described by a matter-chord insertion, which splits the theory into left/right sectors, allowing us, via chord-diagram technology, to compute two different notions of complexity associated to the operator insertion: firstly the Krylov complexity of Heisenberg evolution, and secondly the complexity of a state obtained by an operator acting on the thermofield double state. We will provide both an analytical proof and detailed numerical evidence, that both Krylov complexities arise from a recursively defined basis of states characterized by a constant total chord number. As a consequence, in all cases we are able to establish that Krylov complexity is given by the expectation value of a length operator acting on the Hilbert space of the theory, expressed in terms of basis states, organized by left and right chord number. We find analytical expressions for the semiclassical limit of K-complexity, and study how the size of the operator encodes the scrambling dynamics upon the matter insertion in Krylov language. We furthermore determine the effective Hamiltonian governing the evolution of K-complexity, showing that evolution on the Krylov chain can equivalently be understood as a particle moving in a Morse potential. A particular type of triple scaling limit allows to access the gravitational sector of the theory, in which the geometrical nature of K-complexity is assured by virtue of being a total chord length, in an analogous fashion to what was found for the K-complexity of the thermofield double state.</description>

      <title>Abelian Spectral Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of non-Hermitian physics has enriched the plethora of topological phases to include phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. Despite being among the most well-studied uniquely non-Hermitian features, the topological properties of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s) at which also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce, were only recently revealed in terms of topological resultant winding numbers and concomitant Abelian doubling theorems. Nevertheless, a more mathematically fundamental description of EP$n$s and their topological nature has remained an open question. To fill this void, in this article, we revisit the topological classification of EP$n$s in generic systems and systems with local symmetries, generalize it in terms of more mathematically tractable (local) similarity relations, and extend it to include all such similarities as well as non-local symmetries. Through the resultant vector, whose components are given in terms of the resultants between the corresponding characteristic polynomial and its derivatives, the topological nature of the resultant winding number is understood in several ways: in terms of i) the tenfold classification of (Hermitian) topological matter, ii) the framework of Mayer--Vietoris sequence, and iii) the classification of vector bundles. Our work reveals the mathematical foundations on which the topological nature of EP$n$s resides, enriches the theoretical understanding of non-Hermitian spectral features, and will therefore find great use in modern experiments within both classical and quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Scaling theory of fading ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most noninteracting quantum systems, the scaling theory of localization predicts one-parameter scaling flow in both ergodic and localized regimes. On the other hand, it is expected that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis breaks down for interacting systems that exhibit the many-body ergodicity breaking transition. Here we introduce a scaling theory of fading ergodicity, which is a precursor regime of many-body ergodicity breaking. We argue that the two-parameter scaling governs the entire ergodic regime; however, (i) it evolves into the one-parameter scaling at the ergodicity breaking critical point with the critical exponent $\nu=1$, and (ii) it gives rise to the resilient one-parameter scaling close to the ETH point. Our theoretical framework may serve as a building block for two-parameter scaling theories of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable optical amplification and group delay in cavity magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically investigate the controllable output probe transmission and group delay in a hybrid cavity magnomechanics (CMM) system. The setup comprises a gain (active) cavity and a passive (loss) cavity, which incorporates an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and two yttrium iron garnet spheres to facilitate magnon-photon coupling. Unlike the single transparency window typically resulting from magnon-photon interactions, we also observe magnomechanically induced transparency due to nonlinear magnon-phonon interactions. Additionally, two absorption dips on either side of the central absorption dip can be asymmetrically modulated into amplification and absorption by varying different system parameters. A PT-symmetric to broken-PT-symmetric phase transition is observed in both balanced and unbalanced gain-to-loss scenarios. Notably, replacing the second passive cavity with an active one mitigates high absorption and introduces effective gain into the system. Our findings reveal that the group delay of the probe light can be adjusted between positive and negative values by modifying various system parameters. This study provides a robust platform for controlling light propagation in CMM systems, highlighting potential applications in optical communication and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Giant number-parity effect leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking in finite-size quantum spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs when a many-body system governed by a symmetric Hamiltonian, and prepared in a symmetry-broken state by the application of a field coupling to its order parameter $O$, retains a finite $O$ value even after the field is switched off. SSB is generally thought to occur only in the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ (for $N$ degrees of freedom). In this limit, the time to restore the symmetry once the field is turned off, either via thermal or quantum fluctuations, is expected to diverge. Here we show that SSB can also be observed in \emph{finite-size} quantum spin systems, provided that three conditions are met: 1) the ground state of the system has long-range correlations; 2) the Hamiltonian conserves the (spin) parity of the order parameter; and 3) $N$ is odd. Using a combination of analytical arguments and numerical results (based on time-dependent variational Monte Carlo and rotor+spin-wave theory), we show that SSB on finite-size systems can be achieved via a quasi-adiabatic preparation of the ground state -- which, in U(1)-symmetric systems, is shown to require a symmetry breaking field vanishing over time scales $\tau \sim O(N)$. In these systems, the symmetry-broken state exhibits spin squeezing with Heisenberg scaling.</description>

      <title>Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the observer-dependence of gravitational entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy was recently achieved by a series of works showing that a proper accounting of gauge invariance and observer degrees of freedom converts the Type III algebra of QFT observables in a gravitational subregion to a Type II crossed product, whose entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. The observers thus used are also known as quantum reference frames (QRFs); as noted in our companion work [arXiv:2405.00114], using different QRFs result in different algebras, and hence different entropies -- so gravitational entropy is observer-dependent. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, with full derivations of many new results. Using the perspective-neutral QRF formalism, we extend previous constructions to allow for arbitrarily many observers, each carrying a clock with possibly degenerate energy spectra. We consider a semiclassical regime characterized by clocks whose energy fluctuations dominate over the fluctuations of the energy of the QFT. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. At leading order the von Neumann entropy still reduces to the generalized entropy, but linear corrections are typically non-vanishing and quantify the degree of entanglement between the clocks and fields. We also describe an `antisemiclassical' regime as the opposite of the semiclassical one, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy; in this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. Four explicit examples of observer-dependent entropy are then given, involving a gravitational interferometer, degenerate clock superselection, a semiclassical approximation applying to some clocks but not others, and differences between monotonic and periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>Algebras and states in super-JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In bosonic JT gravity, minimally coupled to bulk matter, there exists a single, delta-function-normalisable state in each $SL(2,R)$ representation of the matter QFT for any pair of positive energies $E_L, E_R$ at the left and right boundaries. In $\mathcal{N} = 2$ super-JT gravity coupled to matter, we show that there exists a single normalisable state in each $SU(1,1|1)$ matter representation (given appropriate R-charges) that has exactly zero energy at both boundaries. For non-BPS representations, these states have the peculiar property that they break all supersymmetry in the bulk, while preserving supersymmetry at both boundaries. Projecting the algebras of boundary observables onto these zero-energy states leads to a Type II$_1$ von Neumann factor at each boundary that contains a single operator for each supersymmetric matter boundary primary with sufficiently small R-charge. For neutral boundary primaries, the Type II$_1$ factor has a natural action on the matter QFT Hilbert space (with no additional gravitational degrees of freedom) such that the QFT vacuum is the unique tracial state. Moreover, the product of neutral matter operators can be found very explicitly and has a remarkably simple form. When primaries with nonzero matter R-charge are included, the trace can be written as a sum over matter vacuum expectation values associated to each allowed boundary R-charge $J_R$, with the terms in the sum weighted by $\mathrm{cos}(\pi J_R)$. In this way, the ground state algebras encode the ratios of the number of BPS microstates within each R-charge sector. In addition to the results on super-JT gravity described above, we provide a purely Lorentzian derivation of the algebraic structure of canonically quantised (bosonic) JT gravity plus matter, without appeal to the Euclidean gravitational path integrals used in previous work.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the order parameter in symmetry breaking phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects in second-order phase transitions can be investigated by solving partial differential equations for the evolution of the order parameter in space and time, such as the Langevin equation. We demonstrate that the ordinary differential equations governing either the temporal or spatial dependence in the Langevin equation provide surprisingly substantial insights into the dynamics of the phase transition. The temporal evolution of the order parameter predicts the essence of the adiabatic-impulse scenario, including the scaling of the freeze-out time, which is crucial to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In particular, Bernoulli differential equations that arise in the overdamped case can be solved analytically. The spatial part of the evolution, in turn, leads to the characteristic size of domains that choose the same broken symmetry. Apart from the fundamental insights into the KZM, this finding enables the exploration of Kibble-Zurek scaling using ordinary differential equations over a large range of quench timescales, which would otherwise be difficult to achieve with numerical simulations of the full partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Classical Combinatorial Optimization Scaling for Random Ising Models on 2D Heavy-Hex Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by near term quantum computing hardware limitations, combinatorial optimization problems that can be addressed by current quantum algorithms and noisy hardware with little or no overhead are used to probe capabilities of quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this study, a specific class of near term quantum computing hardware defined combinatorial optimization problems, Ising models on heavy-hex graphs both with and without geometrically local cubic terms, are examined for their classical computational hardness via empirical computation time scaling quantification. Specifically the Time-to-Solution metric using the classical heuristic simulated annealing is measured for finding optimal variable assignments (ground states), as well as the time required for the optimization software Gurobi to find an optimal variable assignment. Because of the sparsity of these Ising models, the classical algorithms are able to find optimal solutions efficiently even for large instances (i.e. $100,000$ variables). The Ising models both with and without geometrically local cubic terms exhibit average-case linear-time or weakly quadratic scaling when solved exactly using Gurobi, and the Ising models with no cubic terms show evidence of exponential-time Time-to-Solution scaling when sampled using simulated annealing. These findings point to the necessity of developing and testing more complex, namely more densely connected, optimization problems in order for quantum computing to ever have a practical advantage over classical computing. Our results are another illustration that different classical algorithms can indeed have exponentially different running times, thus making the identification of the best practical classical technique important in any quantum computing vs. classical computing comparison.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport characteristics of boron-doped diamond (BDD) across frequencies ranging from direct current to 3 GHz to explore the potential of BDD circuits as microwave waveguides. Three homoepitaxial BDD films with varying boron concentrations, exhibiting insulating to metallic properties, are fabricated on a single-crystalline diamond substrate containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. The $\Omega$-shaped BDD circuit demonstrates an approximately 30 $\Omega$ impedance at the resonance frequency of the NV center, facilitating the propagation of microwaves over the circuit, even with a standard 50 $\Omega$ reference impedance. We successfully perform optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) on NV centers within diamonds using BDD circuits and observed continuous-wave ODMR spectra across all circuits. Additionally, we record Rabi oscillations in pulsed ODMR measurements using the metallic BDD circuit. The integration of NV centers with BDDs presents a compact, robust, and adaptable platform for quantum sensing in challenging environments and for quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to do computation with a potential advantage over classical computers. While a single classical computer transforms one particular binary input into an output after applying one operator to the input, a quantum computer can apply the operator to a superposition of binary strings to provide a superposition of binary outputs, doing computation apparently in parallel. This feature allows quantum computers to speed up the computation compared to classical algorithms. Unsurprisingly, quantum algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization problems in quantum computers. Furthermore, a family of quantum machines called quantum annealers are specially designed to solve optimization problems. In this paper, we provide an introduction to quantum optimization from a practical point of view. We introduce the reader to the use of quantum annealers and quantum gate-based machines to solve optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: While ballistic electrons are a key tool for applications in sensing and flying qubits, sub-nanosecond propagation times and complicated interactions make control of ballistic single electrons challenging. Recent experiments have revealed Coulomb collisions of counterpropagating electrons in a beam splitter, giving time resolved control of interactions between single electrons. Here we use remote Coulomb interactions to demonstrate a scheme for sensing single ballistic electrons. We show that interactions are highly controllable via electron energy and emission timing. We use a weakly-coupled `sensing' regime to characterise the nanoscale potential landscape of the beam splitter and the strength of the Coulomb interaction, and show multi-electron sensing with picosecond resolution.</description>

      <title>Using matrix-product states for time-series machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product states (MPS) have proven to be a versatile ansatz for modeling quantum many-body physics. For many applications, and particularly in one-dimension, they capture relevant quantum correlations in many-body wavefunctions while remaining tractable to store and manipulate on a classical computer. This has motivated researchers to also apply the MPS ansatz to machine learning (ML) problems where capturing complex correlations in datasets is also a key requirement. Here, we develop and apply an MPS-based algorithm, MPSTime, for learning a joint probability distribution underlying an observed time-series dataset, and show how it can be used to tackle important time-series ML problems, including classification and imputation. MPSTime can efficiently learn complicated time-series probability distributions directly from data, requires only moderate maximum MPS bond dimension $\chi_{\rm max}$, with values for our applications ranging between $\chi_{\rm max} = 20-150$, and can be trained for both classification and imputation tasks under a single logarithmic loss function. Using synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets, spanning applications in medicine, energy, and astronomy, we demonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art ML approaches, but with the key advantage of encoding the full joint probability distribution learned from the data. By sampling from the joint probability distribution and calculating its conditional entanglement entropy, we show how its underlying structure can be uncovered and interpreted. This manuscript is supplemented with the release of a publicly available code package MPSTime that implements our approach. The efficiency of the MPS-based ansatz for learning complex correlation structures from time-series data is likely to underpin interpretable advances to challenging time-series ML problems across science, industry, and medicine.</description>

      <title>Revealing spin-flip two-level systems using ultra-thin film superconducting resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material disorders are one of the major sources of noise and loss in solid-state quantum devices, whose behaviors are often modeled as two-level systems (TLSs) formed by charge tunneling between neighboring sites. However, the role of their spins in tunneling and its impact on device performance remain highly unexplored. In this work, employing ultra-thin TiN superconducting resonators, we reveal anomalous TLS behaviors by demonstrating an unexpected increase in resonant frequency at low magnetic fields. Furthermore, a spin-flip TLS model is proposed, in which an effective spin-orbit coupling is generated by inhomogeneous local magnetic fields from defect spins. This mechanism mixes charge tunnelings and spin flips, quantitatively reproducing the observed frequency-field relationship and its temperature dependence. This work deepens the understanding of spin-dependent TLS behaviors, offering the possibility of magnetically engineering noise and loss in solid-state quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of entanglement harvesting for a spacetime in quantum superposition, using two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum scalar field where the spacetime background is modeled as a superposition of two quotient Minkowski spaces which are not related by diffeomorphisms. Our results demonstrate that the superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can significantly enhance entanglement for both twisted and untwisted field. We compute the concurrence, which quantifies the harvested entanglement, as function of the energy gap of detectors and their separation. We find that it reaches its maximum when we condition the final spacetime superposition state to match the initial spacetime state. Notably, for the twisted field, the parameter region without entanglement exhibits a significant deviation from that observed in classical Minkowski space or a single quotient Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Estimate of equilibration times of quantum correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit based on Lanczos coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equilibration times $T_\text{eq}$ of local observables in quantum chaotic systems by considering their auto-correlation functions. Based on the recursion method, we suggest a scheme to estimate $T_\text{eq}$ from the corresponding Lanczos coefficients that is expected to hold in the thermodynamic limit. We numerically find that if the observable eventually shows smoothly growing Lanczos coefficients, a finite number of the former is sufficient for a reasonable estimate of the equilibration time. This implies that equilibration occurs on a realistic time scale much shorter than the life of the universe. The numerical findings are further supported by analytical arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the collective photon decay of multiple quantum emitters embedded in a thin high-index dielectric layer such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with and without a metal substrate. We first explore the significant role that guided modes including surface plasmon modes play in the collective decay of identical singlephoton emitters (super- and subradiance). Surprisingly, on distances relevant for collective emission, the guided or surface-plasmon modes do not always enhance the collective emission. We identify configurations with inhibition, and others with enhancement of the dipole interaction due to the guided modes. We interpret our results in terms of local and cross densities of optical states. In the same structure, we show a remarkably favorable configuration for enhanced F\"orster resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor in the dielectric layer on a metallic substrate. We compare our results to theoretical limits for energy transfer efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad description of an open quantum system gives rise to two types of integrability, since the nonequilibrium steady state can be integrable independently of the Liouvillian. Taking boundary-driven and dephasing spin chains as a representative example, we discriminate Liouvillian and steady-state chaos by combining level spacing statistics and an extension of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to open quantum systems. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the steady states by expanding it in the basis of Pauli strings and comparing the weight of strings of different lengths. We show that the natural expectation that integrable steady states are "simple" (i.e., built from few-body local operators) does not hold: the steady states of both chaotic and integrable models have relevant contributions coming from Pauli strings of all possible lengths, including long-range and many-body interactions. Nevertheless, we show that one can effectively use the operator-size distribution to distinguish chaotic and integrable steady states.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional 10-qubit array in germanium with robust and localised qubit control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers require the systematic operation of qubits with high fidelity. For holes in germanium, the spin-orbit interaction allows for \textit{in situ} electric fast and high-fidelity qubit gates. However, the interaction also causes a large qubit variability due to strong g-tensor anisotropy and dependence on the environment. Here, we leverage advances in material growth, device fabrication, and qubit control to realise a two-dimensional 10-spin qubit array, with qubits coupled up to four neighbours that can be controlled with high fidelity. By exploring the large parameter space of gate voltages and quantum dot occupancies, we demonstrate that plunger gate driving in the three-hole occupation enhances electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR), creating a highly localised qubit drive. Our findings, confirmed with analytical and numerical models, highlight the crucial role of intradot Coulomb interaction and magnetic field direction. Furthermore, the ability to engineer qubits for robust control is a key asset for further scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a queueing model for quantum communication networks, a rapidly growing field of research inspired by its technological promise and recent experimental successes. The model consists of a primary queue and a service queue where Bell pairs are formed and stored. The Bell pairs are by nature extremely short-lived rendering the service queue (the quantum queue) much faster than the primary queue. We study the asymptotic behaviour of this multi-scale queueing system utilizing the theory of stochastic averaging principle. We prove a Functional Law of Large Numbers (FLLN) and a Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT) for the standard queue averaging the dynamics of the fast service queue. Our proofs are probablistic and rely on the stochastic analysis of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) driven by Poisson Random Measures.</description>

Abstract: A random access code (RAC), corresponding to a communication primitive with various applications in quantum information theory, is an instance of a preparation-and-measurement scenario. In this work, we consider (n,d)-RACs constituting an "n"-length string, constructed from a "d" size set of letters, and send an encoding of the string in a single d-level physical system and present their quantum advantages. We first characterize optimal classical RACs, proving that the well-known classical strategy known as majority-encoding-identity-decoding is indeed optimal. We then construct a quantum protocol by exploiting only two incompatible measurements, the minimal requirement, and show the advantages beyond the classical one. We also discuss the generality of our results and whether quantum advantages are valid for all types of (n, d)-&gt;1 RACs.</description>

      <title>Shallow shadows: Expectation estimation using low-depth random Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide practical and powerful schemes for learning many properties of an unknown n-qubit quantum state using a sparing number of copies of the state. Specifically, we present a depth-modulated randomized measurement scheme that interpolates between two known classical shadows schemes based on random Pauli measurements and random Clifford measurements. These can be seen within our scheme as the special cases of zero and infinite depth, respectively. We focus on the regime where depth scales logarithmically in n and provide evidence that this retains the desirable properties of both extremal schemes whilst, in contrast to the random Clifford scheme, also being experimentally feasible. We present methods for two key tasks; estimating expectation values of certain observables from generated classical shadows and, computing upper bounds on the depth-modulated shadow norm, thus providing rigorous guarantees on the accuracy of the output estimates. We consider observables that can be written as a linear combination of poly(n) Paulis and observables that can be written as a low bond dimension matrix product operator. For the former class of observables both tasks are solved efficiently in n. For the latter class, we do not guarantee efficiency but present a method that works in practice; by variationally computing a heralded approximate inverses of a tensor network that can then be used for efficiently executing both these tasks.</description>

      <title>Many-body enhancement in a spin-chain quantum heat engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that ferromagnetic interactions can enhance the adiabatic performance of a quantum spin chain engine at low temperatures. The enhancement in work output is particular pronounced, increasing exponentially with interaction strength. The performance enhancement occurs in the paramagnetic phase and is qualitatively explained by considering just the ground and first excited state, in which case the system exhibits bipartite entanglement. As the temperature is increased, thermal occupation of higher energy states diminishes performance. We find that these thermal fluctuations are smallest for long-range interactions, resulting in the highest efficiency. Diabatic work extraction degrades performance due to quantum friction. We identify an approximate, experimentally realisable counterdiabatic drive that can mitigate friction for weak interactions.</description>

Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) offers a fundamentally unique paradigm to design quantum algorithms. Indeed, due to the inherent randomness of quantum measurements, the natural operations in MBQC are not deterministic and unitary, but are rather augmented with probabilistic byproducts. Yet, the main algorithmic use of MBQC so far has been to completely counteract this probabilistic nature in order to simulate unitary computations expressed in the circuit model. In this work, we propose designing MBQC algorithms that embrace this inherent randomness and treat the random byproducts in MBQC as a resource for computation. As a natural application where randomness can be beneficial, we consider generative modeling, a task in machine learning centered around generating complex probability distributions. To address this task, we propose a variational MBQC algorithm equipped with control parameters that allow one to directly adjust the degree of randomness to be admitted in the computation. Our algebraic and numerical findings indicate that this additional randomness can lead to significant gains in expressivity and learning performance for certain generative modeling tasks, respectively. These results highlight the potential advantages in exploiting the inherent randomness of MBQC and motivate further research into MBQC-based algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of the non-Hermitian Floquet Wannier-Stark system in the framework of the tight-binding approximation, where the hopping strength is a periodic function of time with Floquet frequency $\omega$. It is shown that the energy level of the instantaneous Hamiltonian is still equally spaced and independent of time $t$ and the Hermiticity of the hopping term. In the case of off resonance, the dynamics are still periodic, while the occupied energy levels spread out at the resonance, exhibiting $t^z$ behavior. Analytic analysis and numerical simulation show that the level-spreading dynamics for real and complex hopping strengths exhibit distinct behaviors and are well described by the dynamical exponents $z=1$ and $z=1/2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fast, robust and laser-free universal entangling gates for trapped-ion quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel two-qubit entangling gate for trapped-ion quantum processors is proposed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. During the gate, double-dressed quantum states are created by applying a phase-modulated continuous driving field. The speed of this gate is an order of magnitude higher than that of previously demonstrated radio frequency (RF) controlled two-qubit entangling gates in static magnetic field gradients. At the same time, the field driving the gate, dynamically decouples the qubits from amplitude and frequency noise, increasing the qubits' coherence time by three orders of magnitude. The gate requires only a single continuous RF field per qubit, making it well suited for scaling a quantum processor to large numbers of qubits. Implementing this entangling gate, we generate the Bell states $|\Phi^+ \rangle$ and $|\Psi^+\rangle$ in $\leq 313$ $\mathrm{\mathrm{\mu}}$s with fidelities up to $98^{+2}_{-3}$ \% in a static magnetic gradient of only 19.09 T/m. At higher magnetic field gradients, the entangling gate speed can be further improved to match that of laser-based counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work deals with quantum transport in open quantum graphs. We consider the case of complete graphs on $n$ vertices with an edge removed and attached to two leads, to represent the entrance and exit channels, from where we calculate the transmission coefficient. We include the possibility of several vertices being connected or not and associate it with a randomization parameter $p$. To implement the calculation, we had to introduce the transmission coefficient of randomized quantum graphs (RQG), and we also proposed a procedure to obtain the exact and approximate but reliable results for such transmission coefficients. The main results show that the transport is importantly affected by the removal of connections between pairs of vertices, but they also indicate the presence of a region where the transmission is fully suppressed, even when the number of edge removal is not too small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge in performing quantum error correction (QEC) is implementing reliable measurements and conditional feed-forward operations. In quantum computing platforms supporting unconditional qubit resets, or a constant supply of fresh qubits, alternative schemes which do not require measurements are possible. In such schemes, the error correction is realized via crafted coherent quantum feedback. We propose implementations of small measurement-free QEC schemes, which are fault-tolerant to circuit-level noise. These implementations are guided by several heuristics to achieve fault-tolerance: redundant syndrome information is extracted, and additional single-shot flag qubits are used. By carefully designing the circuit, the additional overhead of these measurement-free schemes is moderate compared to their conventional measurement-and-feed-forward counterparts. We highlight how this alternative approach paves the way towards implementing resource-efficient measurement-free QEC on neutral-atom arrays.</description>

Abstract: Objective collapse theories propose modifications to Schr\"odinger's equation that solve the quantum measurement problem by interpolating between microscopic quantum dynamics and projective evolution of macroscopic objects. Colored noise driven collapse theories extending the equilibrium description of spontaneous symmetry breaking to spontaneous violations of unitarity (SUV) in quantum dynamics were recently shown to possess a Markovian white noise limit when applied to initial two-state superpositions. Here, we show that this limit coincides with a subclass of continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) models. We also extend this model to a form that can be applied to any initial state. We show that as for the SUV models, the emergence of Born rule statistics in the Markovian limit is enforced by a fluctuation-dissipation relation which results in ensemble averaged probability densities following a linear quantum semi-group guaranteeing the absence of superluminal signaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are believed to bring computational advantages in simulating quantum many body systems. However, recent works have shown that classical machine learning algorithms are able to predict numerous properties of quantum systems with classical data. Despite various examples of learning tasks with provable quantum advantages being proposed, they all involve cryptographic functions and do not represent any physical scenarios encountered in laboratory settings. In this paper we prove quantum advantages for the physically relevant task of learning quantum observables from classical (measured out) data. We consider two types of observables: first we prove a learning advantage for linear combinations of Pauli strings, then we extend the result for a broader case of unitarily parametrized observables. For each type of observable we delineate the boundaries that separate physically relevant tasks which classical computers can solve using data from quantum measurements, from those where a quantum computer is still necessary for data analysis. Differently from previous works, we base our classical hardness results on the weaker assumption that $\mathsf{BQP}$ hard processes cannot be simulated by polynomial-size classical circuits and provide a non-trivial quantum learning algorithm. Our results shed light on the utility of quantum computers for machine learning problems in the domain of quantum many body physics, thereby suggesting new directions where quantum learning improvements may emerge.</description>

Abstract: The rotation of trapped molecules offers a promising platform for quantum technologies and quantum information processing. In parallel, quantum error correction codes that can protect quantum information encoded in rotational states of a single molecule have been developed. These codes are currently an abstract concept, as no implementation strategy is yet known. Here, we present a step towards experimental implementation of one family of such codes, namely absorption-emission codes. We first construct architecture-agnostic check and correction operators. These operators are then decomposed into elements of the quantum logic spectroscopy toolbox that is available for molecular ions. We then describe and analyze a measurement-based sequential as well as an autonomous implementation strategy in the presence of thermal background radiation, a major noise source for rotation in polar molecules. The presented strategies and methods might enable robust sensing or even fault-tolerant quantum computing using the rotation of individual molecules.</description>

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum algorithm for estimating gaps in many-body energy spectra, supported by an analytic proof of its inherent resilience to state preparation and measurement errors, as well as global multi-qubit depolarizing noise. Our analysis extends to a broader class of Markovian noise using numerical methods. By leveraging trial-state optimization and classical signal processing, we amplify the signal peak corresponding to the exact target gap beyond the noise threshold, significantly reducing gap estimate errors. The algorithm's robustness is demonstrated through noisy simulations on the Qiskit Aer simulator and demonstrations on IBM Quantum processors. These results underscore its potential for enabling accurate quantum simulations on near-term noisy quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermal effects of the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) using a thermofield dynamics (TFD) method. Letting the initial state of the whole system for the multiphoton JCM be a product of the ground state of an atom and a coherent state of a cavity field at finite temperature, we compute its time evolution. We evaluate a period of the collapse and revival of the Rabi oscillations and the relative entropy of coherence of the atom up to the second-order perturbation of the low-temperature expansion. We show that an intuitive estimation of the period matches the result of the perturbation theory of TFD well. In particular, we see that the period of the two-photon JCM hardly depends on the amplitude of the coherent state of the cavity field or the temperature. Numerical calculations suggest that the relative entropy of coherence of the two-photon JCM does not decay even for nonzero-temperature cases as time proceeds. By contrast, the relative entropyies of coherence for single-, three-, and four-photon JCMs decay as time proceeds for zero- and finite-temperature cases.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Zero-Rate Hashing Bound with Holographic Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial insight for practical quantum error correction is that different types of errors, such as single-qubit Pauli operators, typically occur with different probabilities. Finding an optimal quantum code under such biased noise is a challenging problem, related to finding the (generally unknown) maximum capacity of the corresponding noisy channel. A benchmark for this capacity is given by the hashing bound, describing the performance of random stabilizer codes, which leads to the challenge of finding codes that reach or exceed this bound while also being efficiently decodable. In this work, we show that asymptotically zero-rate holographic codes, built from hyperbolic tensor networks that model holographic bulk/boundary dualities, fulfill both conditions. Of the five holographic code models considered, all are found to reach the hashing bound in some bias regime and one, the holographic surface-code fragment, appears to even exceed the capacity of previously known codes in the 2-Pauli-dominated noise regime. In addition, we consider Clifford deformations that allow all considered codes to reach the hashing bound for 1-Pauli-dominated noise as well. Our results thus establish that holographic codes, which were previously shown to possess efficient tensor-network decoders, also exhibit competitive thresholds under biased noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a noise model that ensures the functioning of an echo state network employing a gate-based quantum computer for reservoir computing applications. Energy dissipation induced by amplitude damping drastically improves the short-term memory capacity and expressivity of the network, by simultaneously providing fading memory and richer dynamics. There is an ideal dissipation rate that ensures the best operation of the echo state network around $\gamma\sim$ 0.03. Nevertheless, these beneficial effects are stable as the intensity of the applied noise increases. The improvement of the learning is confirmed by emulating a realistic noise model applied to superconducting qubits, paving the way for the application of reservoir computing methods in current non-fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent generator of Lindblad form, is generally an NP-hard problem. The difficulty is related to the fact that one has to search through all possible branches of the operator logarithm of the map, in order to identify, if any of the resulting effective generators is of Lindblad form. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective generator of Lindblad form. This significantly reduces the complexity of the search for an effective generator of Lindblad form in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Mapping of a many-qubit state onto an oscillator using controlled displacements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the controlled displacement interaction between a qubit and a harmonic oscillator to the multi-qubit (qudit) case. We define discrete quadratures of the qudit and show how the qudit state can be displaced in these quadratures controlled by an oscillator quadrature. Using this interaction, a periodic repetition of the state encoded in the qudit, can be deterministically mapped onto the oscillator, which is initialized in a squeezed state. Based on this controlled displacement interaction, we present a full circuit that encodes quantum information in a superposition of qudit quadrature states, and successively prepares the oscillator in the corresponding superposition of approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states. This preparation scheme is found to be similar to phase estimation, with the addition of a disentanglement gate. Our protocol for GKP state preparation is efficient in the sense, that the set of qubits need only interact with the oscillator through two time-independent interactions, and in the sense that the squeeze factor (in dB) of the produced GKP state grows linearly in the number of qubits used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01183v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the frequency configuration of qubits and quantum gates in superconducting quantum chips presents a complex NP-complete optimization challenge. This process is critical for enabling practical control while minimizing decoherence and suppressing significant crosstalk. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based frequency configuration approach. A trained neural network model estimates frequency configuration errors, and an intermediate optimization strategy identifies optimal configurations within localized regions of the chip. The effectiveness of our method is validated through randomized benchmarking and cross-entropy benchmarking. Furthermore, we design a crosstalk-aware hardware-efficient ansatz for variational quantum eigensolvers, achieving improved energy computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits incorporating Josephson elements represent a promising hardware platform for quantum technologies. Potential applications include scalable quantum computing, microwave quantum networks, and quantum-limited amplifiers. However, progress in Josephson junction-based quantum technologies is facing the ongoing challenge of minimizing loss channels. This is also true for parametric superconducting devices based on nonlinear Josephson resonators. In this work, we report on the fabrication and characterization of low-loss Josephson parametric devices operated in the GHz frequency range, showing record internal quality factors. Specifically, we achieve internal quality factors significantly above $10^5$ for both Josephson parametric converters and the Josephson parametric amplifiers at low microwave power ranging in the single-photon regime. These low-loss devices mark a significant step forward in realizing high-performance quantum circuits, enabling further advancements in superconducting quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Building on the approach of stochastic thermodynamics, we define entropy production for arbitrary quantum processes, using Bayesian tools to capture the inherent subjective element. First, we show that the classical expression for average entropy production involves only comparisons of statistics at the input or output, and thus can be formally generalized by replacing probability distributions by quantum states. To go beyond the mere average, we construct an entropy production operator, that generalizes the value of entropy to the non-commutative case. The operator is Hermitian; its average is non-negative, so that the Second Law takes its usual form $\langle\Sigma\rangle\geq 0$; it formally satisfies the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks fluctuation theorem; and recovers the classical expression for classical processes. We also present features whose fully quantum version is not a straightforward translation of the classical one: these may point to the core difference between classical and quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply covariant affine integral quantization to study motion in the 2D punctured plane. The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), representing transformations of the plane composed of translations, rotations, and dilations. Near the punctured point, we observe that the topology influencing quantum fluctuations gives rise to an affine vector potential, which can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge potential generated by an infinite coil. This finding suggests that the AB effect originates from the topology enforced by the impenetrable coil, rather than from a classical gauge potential. Our results offer a novel perspective on the AB effect, emphasizing the fundamental role of topology in quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Hardware efficient methods for high fidelity quantum state measurements are crucial for superconducting qubit experiments, as qubit numbers grow and feedback and state reset begin to be employed for quantum error correction. We present a 3D re-entrant cavity filter designed for frequency-multiplexed readout of superconducting qubits. The cavity filter is situated out of the plane of the qubit circuit and capacitively couples to an array of on-chip readout resonators in a manner that can scale to large qubit arrays. The re-entrant cavity functions as a large-linewidth bandpass filter with intrinsic Purcell filtering. We demonstrate the concept with a four-qubit multiplexed device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are known for their potential to achieve up-to-exponential speedup compared to classical computers for certain problems. To exploit the advantages of quantum computers, we propose quantum algorithms for linear stochastic differential equations, utilizing the Schr\"odingerisation method for the corresponding approximate equation by treating the noise term as a (discrete-in-time) forcing term. Our algorithms are applicable to stochastic differential equations with both Gaussian noise and $\alpha$-stable L\'evy noise. The gate complexity of our algorithms exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(d\log(Nd))$ dependence on the dimensions $d$ and sample sizes $N$, where its corresponding classical counterpart requires nearly exponentially larger complexity in scenarios involving large sample sizes. In the Gaussian noise case, we show the strong convergence of first order in the mean square norm for the approximate equations. The algorithms are numerically verified for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, geometric Brownian motions, and one-dimensional L\'evy flights.</description>

      <title>Short two-qubit pulse sequences for exchange-only spin qubits in 2D layouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction. Our work guides hardware and software design choices for future implementations of scalable quantum dot architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a numerical analysis of a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for a transformed master equation modeling an open quantum system: a quantum sub-system interacting with a noisy environment. It is shown that the presented transformed master equation has a reduced computational cost in comparison to a Wigner-Fokker-Planck model of the same system for the general case of non-harmonic potentials via DG schemes. Specifics of a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) numerical scheme adequate for the system of convection-diffusion equations obtained for our Lindblad master equation in position basis are presented. This lets us solve computationally the transformed system of interest modeling our open quantum system problem. The benchmark case of a harmonic potential is then presented, for which the numerical results are compared against the analytical steady-state solution of this problem. Two non-harmonic cases are then presented: the linear and quartic potentials are modeled via our DG framework, for which we show our numerical results.</description>

Abstract: The generation of robust entanglement in quantum system arrays is a crucial aspect of the realization of efficient quantum information processing. Recently, the field of quantum magnonics has garnered significant attention as a promising platform for advancing in this direction. In our proposed scheme, we utilize a one-dimensional array of coupled cavities, with each cavity housing a single yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to the cavity mode through magnetic dipole interaction. To induce entanglement between YIGs, we employ a local squeezed reservoir, which provides the necessary nonlinearity for entanglement generation. Our results demonstrate the successful generation of bipartite and tripartite entanglement between distant magnon modes, all achieved through a single quantum reservoir. Furthermore, the steady-state entanglement between magnon modes is robust against magnon dissipation rates and environment temperature. Our results may lead to applications of cavity-magnon arrays in quantum information processing and quantum communication systems.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is one of the powerful computational approaches to study electron correlation effects in solid-state materials and molecules. Its practical applicability is, however, limited by the quantity of numerical resources required for the solution of the underlying auxiliary Anderson impurity model. Here, the one-to-one mapping between electronic orbitals and the state of a qubit register suggests a significant computational advantage for the use of a Quantum Computer (QC) for solving this task. In this work we present a QC approach to solve a two-site DMFT model based on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. We analyse the propagation of stachastic and device errors through the algorithm and their effects on the calculated self-energy. Therefore, we systematically compare results obtained on simulators with calculations on the IBMQ Ehningen QC hardware. We suggest a means to overcome unphysical features in the self-energy which already result from purely stochastic noise. Based heron, we demonstrate the feasibility to obtain self-consistent results of the two-site DMFT model based on VQE simulations with a finite number of shots.</description>

Abstract: Placing a black hole in a cavity provides a natural framework for exploring gravitational scales, thermodynamic instabilities, and effective gravity theories. In this paper, we examine the evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement islands in a two-sided extension of the Schwarzschild black hole in a cavity. By introducing a reflecting boundary in the eternal black hole exteriors, we regulate the infrared modes of Hawking radiation, finding that the entanglement entropy eventually saturates at a constant value. This value can be lower than the black hole thermodynamic entropy, thus avoiding the Page formulation of the information paradox. Regarding entanglement islands, we identify a universal effect induced by the boundary, which we term the ``blinking island'' -- where the entanglement island temporarily disappears, resulting in a short-time information paradox.</description>

Abstract: Quantum noise plays a pivotal role in understanding quantum transport phenomena, including current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this domain is $\Delta_T$ noise, which arises due to a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. This paper investigates $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions with insulators, where the average charge current is zero at zero voltage bias, through the measurement of quantum shot noise, i.e., $\Delta_T$ noise. Notably, we find that the $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor junctions is significantly larger than in metal-insulator-metal junctions. Furthermore, our results reveal that $\Delta_T$ noise initially increases with barrier strength, peaks, and then decreases, while it shows a steady increase with temperature bias, highlighting the nuanced interplay between barrier characteristics and thermal gradients.</description>

      <title>Agent-based Modelling of Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What happens when an infinite number of players play a quantum game? In this tutorial, we will answer this question by looking at the emergence of cooperation, in the presence of noise, in a one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma (QuPD). We will use the numerical Agent-based model (ABM), and compare it with the analytical Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM) technique. To measure cooperation, we consider five indicators, i.e., game magnetization, entanglement susceptibility, correlation, player's payoff average and payoff capacity, respectively. In quantum social dilemmas, entanglement plays a non-trivial role in determining the behaviour of the quantum players (or, \textit{qubits}) in the thermodynamic limit, and for QuPD, we consider the existence of bipartite entanglement between neighbouring quantum players. For the five indicators in question, we observe \textit{first}-order phase transitions at two entanglement values, and these phase transition points depend on the payoffs associated with the QuPD game. We numerically analyze and study the properties of both the \textit{Quantum} and the \textit{Defect} phases of the QuPD via the five indicators. The results of this tutorial demonstrate that both ABM and NEM, in conjunction with the chosen five indicators, provide insightful information on cooperative behaviour in an infinite-player one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma.</description>

      <title>Steady-state dynamics and non-local correlations in thermoelectric Cooper pair splitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on Cooper pair splitters using superconductor-quantum dot hybrids have embarked on creating entanglement in the solid-state, by engineering the sub-gap processes in the superconducting region. Using the thermoelectric Cooper pair splitter setup [Nat. Comm., 12, 21, (2021)] as a prototype, we present a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental components of the observed transport signal, aiming to critically clarify the operating regimes and confirm the nonlocal and nonclassical nature of correlations arising from crossed Andreev processes. By making a nexus with quantum discord, we identify operating points of nonlocal quantum correlations in the CPS device -- information that cannot be extracted from the transport signal alone. A notable consequence of our analysis is the finding that contact-induced level broadening of the quantum dot's discrete energy spectrum, along with its hybridization with the superconducting segment, can lead to shifted resonances in the crossed Andreev process as well as a parity reversal in the thermoelectric current. Our work thereby provides detailed insights into the gate voltage control of the quantum correlations in superconducting-hybrid Cooper pair splitters, revealing new avenues for harnessing quantum correlations in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics and eigenstate correlations in strongly disordered quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The many-body localised phase of quantum systems is an unusual dynamical phase wherein the system fails to thermalise and yet, entanglement grows unboundedly albeit very slowly in time. We present a microscopic theory of this ultraslow growth of entanglement in terms of dynamical eigenstate correlations of strongly disordered, interacting quantum systems in the many-body localised regime. These correlations involve sets of four or more eigenstates and hence, go beyond correlations involving pairs of eigenstates which are usually studied in the context of eigenstate thermalisation or lack thereof. We consider the minimal case, namely the second R\'enyi entropy of entanglement, of an initial product state as well as that of the time-evolution operator, wherein the correlations involve quartets of four eigenstates. We identify that the dynamics of the entanglement entropy is dominated by the spectral correlations within certain special quartets of eigenstates. We uncover the spatial structure of these special quartets and the ensuing statistics of the spectral correlations amongst the eigenstates therein, which reveals a hierarchy of timescales or equivalently, energyscales. We show that the hierarchy of these timescales along with their non-trivial distributions conspire to produce the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement, characteristic of the many-body localised regime. The underlying spatial structures in the set of special quartets also provides a microscopic understanding of the spacetime picture of the entanglement growth. The theory therefore provides a much richer perspective on entanglement growth in strongly disordered systems compared to the commonly employed phenomenological approach based on the $\ell$-bit picture.</description>

      <title>Extracting work from coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how work can be extracted from number-state coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate. With careful tuning of parameters, a sequence of thermodynamically reversible steps transforms a Glauber coherent state into a thermal state with the same energy probability distribution. The work extracted during this process arises entirely from the removal of quantum coherence. More generally, we characterise quantum (from coherence) and classical (remaining) contributions to work output, and find that in this system the quantum contribution can be dominant over a broad range of parameters. The proportion of quantum work output can be further enhanced by squeezing the initial state. Due to the many-body nature of the system, the work from coherence can equivalently be understood as work from entanglement.</description>

      <title>Cheshire qudits from fractional quantum spin Hall states in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted MoTe$_2$ homobilayers exhibit transport signatures consistent with a fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) state. We describe a route to construct topological quantum memory elements, dubbed Cheshire qudits, formed from punching holes in such a FQSH state and using proximity-induced superconductivity to gap out the resulting helical edge states. Cheshire qudits encode quantum information in states that differ by a fractional topological "Cheshire" charge that is hidden from local detection within a condensate anyons. Control of inter-edge tunneling by gates enables both supercurrent-based readout of a Cheshire qudit, and capacitive measurement of the thermal entropy associated with its topological ground-space degeneracy. Additionally, we systematically classify different types of gapped boundaries, Cheshire qudits, and parafermionic twist defects for various Abelian and non-Abelian candidate FQSH orders that are consistent with the transport data, and describe experimental signatures to distinguish these orders.</description>

      <title>Better bounds on Grothendieck constants of finite orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grothendieck constants $K_G(d)$ bound the advantage of $d$-dimensional strategies over $1$-dimensional ones in a specific optimisation task. They have applications ranging from approximation algorithms to quantum nonlocality. However, apart from $d=2$, their values are unknown. Here, we exploit a recent Frank-Wolfe approach to provide good candidates for lower bounding some of these constants. The complete proof relies on solving difficult binary quadratic optimisation problems. For $d\in\{3,4,5\}$, we construct specific rectangular instances that we can solve to certify better bounds than those previously known; by monotonicity, our lower bounds improve on the state of the art for $d\leqslant9$. For $d\in\{4,7,8\}$, we exploit elegant structures to build highly symmetric instances achieving even greater bounds; however, we can only solve them heuristically. We also recall the standard relation with violations of Bell inequalities and elaborate on it to interpret generalised Grothendieck constants $K_G(d\mapsto2)$ as the advantage of complex quantum mechanics over real quantum mechanics. Motivated by this connection, we also improve the bounds on $K_G(d\mapsto2)$.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Nuclear Magnetism at Ultralow and Zero Field using SQUIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetism underpins areas such as medicine in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hyperpolarization of nuclei enhances the quantity and quality of information that can be determined from these techniques by increasing their signal to noise ratios by orders of magnitude. However, some of these hyperpolarization techniques rely on the use of low to ultralow magnetic fields (ULF) (nTs-mTs). The broadband character and ultrasensitive field sensitivity of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) allow for probing nuclear magnetism at these fields, where other magnetometers, such as Faraday coils and flux gates do not. To this end, we designed a reactor to hyperpolarize [1-$^{13}$C]pyruvate with the technique, signal amplification by reversible exchange in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH). Hyperpolarized pyruvate has been shown to be very powerful for the diagnosis of tumours with MRI as its metabolism is associated with various pathologies. We were able to characterize the field sensitivity of our setup by simulating the filled reactor in relation to its placement in our ultralow noise, ULF MRI setup. Using the simulations, we determined that our hyperpolarization setup results in a $^{13}$C polarization of 0.4 %, a signal enhancement of $\sim$100~000~000 versus the predicted thermal equilibrium signal at earth field ($\sim$50 $\mu$T). This results in a $^{13}$C signal of 6.20$\pm$0.34~pT, which with our ultralow noise setup, opens the possibility for direct observation of the hyperpolarization and the subsequent spin-lattice relaxation without system perturbation.</description>

      <title>BATIS: Bootstrapping, Autonomous Testing, and Initialization System for Quantum Dot Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. As the complexity of QD devices grows, manual tuning becomes increasingly infeasible, necessitating robust and scalable autotuning solutions. Tuning large arrays of QD qubits depends on efficient choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD device evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing and gate characterization. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard approach that requires a single measurement regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at 1.3 K on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.</description>

      <title>Commercial CMOS Process for Quantum Computing: Quantum Dots and Charge Sensing in a 22 nm Fully Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confining electrons or holes in quantum dots formed in the channel of industry-standard fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS structures is a promising approach to scalable qubit architectures. In this communication, we present measurement results of a commercial nanostructure fabricated using the GlobalFoundries 22FDX(TM) industrial process. We demonstrate here that quantum dots are formed in the device channel by applying a combination of a back- and gate voltages. We report our results on an effective detuning of the energy levels in the quantum dots by varying the barrier gate voltages in combination with the back-gate voltage. Given the need and importance of scaling to larger numbers of qubits, we demonstrate here the feasibility of single-electron box sensors at the edge of the quantum dot array for effective charge sensing in different operation modes -- sensing charge transitions in a single- and double quantum dots forming the quantum dot array. We also report measurement results demonstrating bias triangle pair formation and precise control over coupled quantum dots with variations in the inter-dot barrier. The reported measurement results demonstrate the ability to control the formation and coupling of multiple quantum dots in a quantum dot array and to sense their charge state via a Single Electron Box sensor in a commercial process for the first time.</description>

      <title>Quantum sampling on a quantum annealer for large volumes in the strong coupling limit for gauge group U(3)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous studies [1, 2], we confirmed that a quantum annealer can be used for importance sampling of gauge theories. In this paper, we extend the previous results to larger 2-dimensional and 4-dimensional lattices to generate ensembles for U(3) gauge theory in the strong coupling limit. We make use of the D-Wave quantum annealer to generate histograms for sub-lattices, and use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to determine thermodynamic observables and their dependence on the physical parameters on large volumes. We benchmark our results to those obtained from classical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>
