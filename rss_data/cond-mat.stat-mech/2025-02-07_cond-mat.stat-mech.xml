      <title>Realizing Quantitative Quasiparticle Modeling of Skyrmion Dynamics in Arbitrary Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate fully quantitative Thiele model simulations of magnetic skyrmion dynamics on previously unattainable experimentally relevant large length and time scales by ascertaining the key missing parameters needed to calibrate the experimental and simulation time scales and current-induced forces. Our work allows us to determine complete spatial pinning energy landscapes that enable quantification of experimental studies of diffusion in arbitrary potentials within the Lifson-Jackson framework. Our method enables us to ascertain the time scales, and by isolating the effect of ultra-low current density (order $10^6 A/m^2$) generated torques we directly infer the total force acting on the skyrmion for a quantitative modelling.</description>

      <title>Information-optimal mixing at low Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual information between particle positions before and after mixing provides a universal assumption-free measure of mixing efficiency at low Reynolds number which accounts for the kinematic reversibility of the Stokes equation. For a generic planar shear flow with time-dependent shear rate, we derive a compact expression for the mutual information as a nonlinear functional of the shearing protocol and solve the associated extremisation problem exactly to determine the optimal control under both linear and non-linear constraints, specifically total shear and total dissipation per unit volume. Remarkably, optimal protocols turn out to be universal and time-reversal symmetric in both cases. Our results establish a minimum energetic cost of erasing information through mixing.</description>

      <title>Improving noisy free-energy measurements by adding more noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating free-energy differences using nonequilibrium work relations, such as the Jarzynski equality, is hindered by poor convergence when work fluctuations are large. For systems governed by overdamped Langevin dynamics, we propose the counterintuitive approach of adding noise in order to increase the precision of such calculations. By introducing additional stochastic fluctuations to the system and rescaling its potential energy, we leave the thermodynamics of the system unchanged while increasing its relaxation rate. For a given time-dependent protocol this modification reduces dissipated work, leading to more accurate free-energy estimates. We demonstrate this principle using computer simulations applied to two model systems. However, the regime of applicability of this strategy is likely limited, because it requires control of the system's potential energy in a way that is feasible in only a few experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced current reversal of Brownian motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetics of biological motors such as kinesin or dynein is notably influenced by viscoelastic intracellular environment. The characteristic relaxation time of the cytosol is not separable from the colloidal timescale and therefore their dynamics is inherently non-Markovian. In this paper we consider a variant of a Brownian motor model, namely a Brownian ratchet immersed in a correlated thermal bath and analyze how memory influences its dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate the memory-induced current reversal effect and explain this phenomenon by applying the effective mass approximation as well as uncovering the memory-induced dynamical localization of the motor trajectories in the phase space. Our results reveal new aspects of the role of memory in microscopic systems out of thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Leading and beyond leading-order spectral form factor in chaotic quantum many-body systems across all Dyson symmetry classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) spectral correlations in the chaotic phase of generic periodically kicked interacting quantum many-body systems by analytically calculating spectral form factor (SFF), $K(t)$, up to two leading orders in time, $t$. We explicitly consider the presence or absence of time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry to investigate all three Dyson's symmetry classes. Our derivation only assumes random phase approximation to enable ensemble average. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=1$, we show that beyond the Thouless time $t^*$, the SFF takes the form $K(t)\simeq 2t-2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to second order in time, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the Hilbert space dimension. This is identical to the result from circular orthogonal ensemble of RMT. In the absence of $\mathcal{T}$-symmetry, we show that $K(t)\simeq t$ beyond $t^*$, and there is no universal term in the second order, unlike the $\mathcal{T}^2=1$ case, in agreement with the result of circular unitary ensemble. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=-1$, we show that $K(t)\simeq 2t+2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to two orders in time beyond $t^*$, in agreement with the result of circular symplectic ensemble. In all three cases, the system-size, $L$, scaling of $t^*$ is determined by eigenvalues of a doubly stochastic matrix $\mathcal{M}$. For strongly interacting fermionic chains, $\mathcal{M}$ is $SU(2)$ invariant in all three cases, leading to $t^*\propto L^2$ in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry. In the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, we find $t^*\propto L^0$, due to gapped non-degenerate second-largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal{M}$ or $t^*\propto \ln(L)$ due to gapped second-largest eigenvalue with degeneracy $\propto L^\zeta$. Our calculation of SFF is plausible in higher space dimensions as well, where similar system-size scalings of $t^*$ can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Mutual Multilinearity of Nonequilibrium Network Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains have been successful in modelling systems across numerous fields, with currents being fundamental entities that describe the flows of energy, particles, individuals, chemical species, information, or other quantities. They apply to systems described by agents transitioning between vertices along the edges of a network (at some rate in each direction). It has recently been shown by the authors that, at stationarity, a hidden linearity exists between currents that flow along edges: if one controls the current of a specific "input" edge (by tuning transition rates along it), any other current is a linear-affine function of the input current [PRL 133, 047401 (2024)]. In this paper, we extend this result to the situation where one controls the currents of several edges, and prove that other currents are in linear-affine relation with the input ones. Two proofs with distinct insights are provided: the first relies on Kirchhoff's current law and reduces the input set inductively through graph analysis, while the second utilizes the resolvent approach via a Laplace transform in time. We obtain explicit expressions for the current-to-current susceptibilities, which allow one to map current dependencies through the network. We also verify from our expression that Kirchhoff's current law is recovered as a limiting case of our mutual linearity. Last, we uncover that susceptibilities can be obtained from fluctuations when the reference system is originally at equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Soft gravitons as Goldstone modes of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate that soft graviton modes in de Sitter are the Goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetry group of de Sitter. I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter is, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states, and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter.</description>

      <title>Sharp Page transitions in generic Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the entanglement dynamics of a subsystem initialized in a pure state at high energy density (corresponding to negative temperature) and coupled to a cold bath. The subsystem's R\'enyi entropies $S_\alpha$ first rise as the subsystem gets entangled with the bath and then fall as the subsystem cools. We find that the peak of the min-entropy, $\lim_{\alpha \to \infty} S_\alpha$, sharpens to a cusp in the thermodynamic limit, at a well-defined time we call the Page time. We construct a hydrodynamic ansatz for the evolution of the entanglement Hamiltonian, which accounts for the sharp Page transition as well as the intricate dynamics of the entanglement spectrum before the Page time. Our results hold both when the bath has the same Hamiltonian as the system and when the bath is taken to be Markovian. Our ansatz suggests conditions under which the Page transition should remain sharp even for R\'enyi entropies of finite index $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Generic Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Kogut--Susskind Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the heart of quantum many-body physics lies the understanding of mechanisms that avoid quantum thermalization in an isolated system quenched far from equilibrium. A prominent example is Hilbert space fragmentation, which has recently emerged as an ergodicity-breaking mechanism in constrained spin models. Here, we show that Kogut--Susskind formulations of lattice gauge theories in $d+1$D ($d$ spatial and one temporal dimensions) give rise to Hilbert space fragmentation, and discuss possible implications for understanding continuum physics. Our findings not only prove that lattice gauge theories are a natural platform for Hilbert space fragmentation, they also serve as a guide to the conditions under which these models can be faithfully used to infer the thermalization properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>The anomalously slow dynamics of inhomogeneous quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum annealing (IQA), in which transverse fields are turned off one by one rather than simultaneously, has been proposed as an effective way to avoid the first-order phase transitions that impede conventional quantum annealing (QA). Here we explicitly study the dynamics of IQA, rather than merely the thermodynamics, and find that it is appreciably slower than the phase diagram would suggest. Interestingly, this slowdown manifests both when IQA succeeds in circumventing phase transitions and when it fails. Even in the absence of transitions, such as for the mean-field models that have been analyzed previously, IQA is slower than expected by a factor of the number of spins $N$. More significantly, we show that in non-mean-field models, first-order transitions are likely to be quite common, and the gap at such transitions is not merely exponential in $N$ but exactly zero. Thus IQA cannot reach the ground state on any timescale. Both of these results can be understood through the simple observation that a spin's magnetization becomes conserved once its field is turned off during the IQA protocol.</description>

      <title>Aging in coevolving voter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aging, understood as the tendency to remain in a given state the longer the persistence time in that state, plays a crucial role in the dynamics of complex systems. In this paper, we explore the influence of aging on coevolution models, that is, models in which the dynamics of the states of the nodes in a complex network is coupled to the dynamics of the structure of the network. In particular we consider the coevolving voter model, and we introduce two versions of this model that include aging effects: the Link Aging Model (LAM) and the Node Aging Model (NAM). In the LAM, aging is associated with the persistence time of a link in the evolving network, while in the NAM, aging is associated with the persistence time of a node in a given state. We show that aging significantly affects the absorbing phase transition of the coevolution voter model, shifting the transition point in opposite directions for the LAM and NAM. We also show that the generic absorbing phase transition can disappear due to aging effects.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the interacting partially directed self-avoiding walk attracted by a vertical wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we consider the interacting partially-directed self-avoiding walk (IPDSAW) attracted by a vertical wall. The IPDSAW was introduced by Zwanzig and Lauritzen (J. Chem. Phys., 1968) as a manner of investigating the collapse transition of a homopolymer dipped in a repulsive solvent. We prove in particular that a surface transition occurs inside the collapsed phase between (i) a regime where the attractive vertical wall does not influence the geometry of the polymer and (ii) a regime where the polymer is partially attached at the wall on a length that is comparable to its horizontal extension, modifying its asymptotic Wulff shape. The latter rigorously confirms the conjecture exposed by physicists in (Physica A: Stat. Mech. \\&amp;amp; App., 2002). We push the analysis even further by providing sharp asymptotics of the partition function inside the collapsed phase.</description>

      <title>Continuously varying critical exponents in an exactly solvable long-range cluster XY mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized antiferromagnetic cluster XY model in a transverse magnetic field, where long-range interactions decay algebraically with distance. This model can be exactly solvable within a free fermion framework. By analyzing the gap, we explicitly derive the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$, finding that the relationship $\nu z = 1$ still holds. However, the values of $\nu$ and $z$ depend on the decaying exponent $\alpha$, in contrast to those for the quantum long-range antiferromagnetic Ising chain. To optimize scaling behavior, we verify these critical exponents using correlation functions and fidelity susceptibility, achieving excellent data collapse across various system sizes by adjusting fitting parameters. Finally, we compute the entanglement entropy at the critical point to determine the central charge $c$, and find it also varies with $\alpha$. This study provides insights into the unique effect of long-range cluster interactions on the critical properties of quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Non-unitary time dynamics of topological modes in open planar quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nontrivial topological invariant of bulk electronic wavefunctions in two-dimensional quantum crystals leaves its footprints on the edge, dislocation, and corner modes. Here we investigate non-unitary time dynamics of these topological modes in square lattice-based open quantum systems in which the time-dependent Hamiltonian smoothly interpolates between topologically distinct insulators across band gap closing quantum critical points. The temporal dynamics of these modes is described by a Lindblad equation in which the instantaneous Hamiltonian plays the role of the Lindblad operator, thereby allowing the environment to couple with the system through the energy channels (weak measurement protocol). We show that in the presence of such a real time ramp, the survival probability of these modes decreases (increases) in short (long) time scale where the dephasing (quantum Zeno) effect dominates with the increasing amplitude of the system-to-environment coupling, for both slow and fast ramps from a topological to a normal insulating state. For a reverse course of the time evolution, the revival or condensation probability of nucleating such topological modes, otherwise absent in the initial system, increases for stronger system-to-environment coupling. This phenomenon can be attributed to the strong decoherence of the initial mixed state among all the energy eigenstates of the final Hamiltonian which also includes the topological modes, causing their enhanced condensation probability. Our findings can be germane to real open topological materials with time-tunable band gap, and should be applicable to open topological crystals of arbitrary dimension and belonging to any symmetry class.</description>

Abstract: Systems with nonreciprocal interactions generically display time-dependent states. These are routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to active matter, in which globally ordered oscillations exist. However, the stability of these uniform nonreciprocal phases in noisy spatially-extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the critical behavior of the corresponding phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address these questions by introducing a nonreciprocal generalization of the Ising model and study its phase transitions by means of numerical and analytical approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous phases (disordered, ordered and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale numerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed in any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets unless the symmetry between the two spin types is broken triggering a stabilizing droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of spiral defects but stabilized in three dimensions where nonreciprocity changes the critical exponents from Ising to XY, thus giving rise to a robust spatially-distributed clock.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transitions in the nonreciprocal Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions in many-body systems lead to time-dependent states, commonly observed in biological, chemical, and ecological systems. The stability of these states in the thermodynamic limit and the critical behavior of the phase transition from static to time-dependent states are not yet fully understood. To address these questions, we study a minimalistic system endowed with nonreciprocal interactions: an Ising model with two spin species having opposing goals. The mean-field equation predicts three stable phases: disorder, static order, and a time-dependent swap phase. Large scale numerical simulations support the following: (i) in 2D, the swap phase is destabilized by defects; (ii) in 3D, the swap phase is stable, and has the properties of a time crystal; (iii) the transition from disorder to swap in 3D is characterized by the critical exponents of the 3D XY model, and corresponds to the breaking of a continuous symmetry, time translation invariance; (iv) when the two species have fully anti-symmetric couplings, the static-order phase is unstable in any finite dimension due to droplet growth; (v) in the general case of asymmetric couplings, static order can be restored by a droplet-capture mechanism preventing the droplets from growing indefinitely. We provide details on the full phase diagram which includes first- and second-order-like phase transitions and study how the system coarsens into swap and static-order states.</description>

      <title>Local Properties of the Rapidity Distribution in the Lieb-Liniger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the rapidity distribution in the Lieb-Liniger model and derive exact relations for its derivatives at the Fermi level. The latter enables us to treat analytically the free energy of the system at low temperatures and arbitrary interactions. We calculated the leading-order correction to the well-known result obtained using conformal field theory. In contrast to the leading-order term controlled by the sound velocity or the Luttinger liquid parameter, the new term is controlled by an additional dimensionless parameter. We calculated its series expansions in the limiting cases of weak and strong interactions. Our results are generalized to other Galilean-invariant integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Collective Foraging and Behavioural Heterogeneity in Ants: First-Passage Statistics with Heterogeneous Walkers on a Honeycomb Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individual behavioural heterogeneity is key to understanding how natural populations adapt flexibly to environmental changes. In ant species like \textit{Aphaenogaster senilis}, two key roles in collective foraging are commonly recognized: scouts, who discover food patches, and recruits, who exploit these patches and transport food back to the nest. These roles involve distinct movement patterns and exploratory behaviours. In this chapter, we develop a correlated random walk model on a bounded honeycomb lattice to interpret and replicate empirical observations of foraging ants in an enclosed arena with honeycomb tiling. We do so by extending the theory of first-passage processes for $\mathcal{N}$ random walkers when individuals belong to a heterogeneous population. We apply this theory to examine how individual behavioural heterogeneity in ants affects collective foraging efficiency, focusing on first-passage time statistics for nest-to-patch and patch-to-patch movements. With the combined use of the mathematical model and the controlled experimental setup we evaluate (i) the impact of distinct movement strategies by scouts and recruits on finding food items and (ii) whether ants practice strict central place foraging or utilise previously discovered patches as starting points for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Heat exchange for oscillator strongly coupled to thermal bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The heat exchange fluctuation theorem (XFT) by Jarzynski and W\'ojcik [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 230602 (2004)] addresses the setting where two systems with different temperatures are brought in thermal contact at time $t=0$ and then disconnected at later time $\tau$. The theorem asserts that the probability of an anomalous heat flux (from cold to hot), while nonzero, is exponentially smaller than the probability of the corresponding normal flux (from hot to cold). As a result, the average heat flux is always normal. In that way, the theorem demonstrates how irreversible heat transfer, observed on the macroscopic scale, emerges from the underlying reversible dynamics. The XFT was proved under the assumption that the coupling work required to connect and then disconnect the systems is small compared to the change of the internal energies of the systems. That condition is often valid for macroscopic systems, but may be violated for microscopic ones. We examine the validity of the XFT's assumption for a specific model of the Caldeira-Leggett type, where one system is a classical harmonic oscillator and the other is a thermal bath comprised of a large number of oscillators. The coupling between the system and the bath, which is bilinear, is instantaneously turned on at $t=0$ and off at $t=\tau$. For that model, we found that the assumption of the XFT can be satisfied only for a rather restricted range of parameters. In general, the work involved in the process is not negligible and the energy exchange may be anomalous in the sense that the internal energy of the system, which is initially hotter than the bath, may further increase.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Response Theory: From Precision Limits to Strong Perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19602v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the response of nonequilibrium systems to external perturbations remains a fundamental challenge in statistical physics. Here, we prove a novel universal bound stating that the response precision for state observable is fundamentally constrained to 1/2 under single edge or vertex perturbations, independent of system size. Furthermore, we develop exact relations connecting responses to perturbations of arbitrary strengths, extending nonequilibrium response theory beyond the weak-perturbation regime. Through response equalities, we also provide a novel physical interpretation of response sensitivity and recover bounds previously obtained using graph-theoretical methods and extensive linear algebra. Our results provide a general mathematical framework applicable across diverse nonequilibrium systems and offer design principles for optimal sensing and information processing in biochemical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report first exact volume-entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen--type scar states hosted by PXP and related Hamiltonians corresponding to various geometric configurations of Rydberg-blockaded atom systems, including the most extensively studied ones such as the chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and square lattice. We start by introducing a new zero-energy eigenstate of the PBC chain and proceed by generalizing it to a wide variety of geometries and Hamiltonians. We point out the potential experimental relevance of our states by providing a protocol for their preparation on near-term Rydberg quantum devices, which relies only on strictly local measurements and evolution under native Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the utility of these states for the study of quantum dynamics by describing a protocol for measuring infinite-temperature out-of-time-order correlator functions.</description>

      <title>Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha &lt; D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha &gt; D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha &gt; (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We perform a tensor renormalization group simulation of non-Abelian gauge theory in three dimensions using a formulation based on the `armillary sphere.' In this formulation, matrix indices are completely traced out, eliminating the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum of the initial tensor. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by computing the average plaquette at zero temperature and the Polyakov loop susceptibility at finite temperatures for 2+1D SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. The deconfinement transition is identified for both gauge groups, with the SU(2) case being consistent with previous Monte Carlo results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov space methods provide an efficient framework for analyzing the dynamical aspects of quantum systems, with tridiagonal matrices playing a key role. Despite their importance, the behavior of such matrices from chaotic to integrable states, transitioning through an intermediate phase, remains unexplored. We aim to fill this gap by considering the properties of the tridiagonal matrix elements and the associated basis vectors for appropriate random matrix ensembles. We utilize the Rosenzweig-Porter model as our primary example, which hosts a fractal regime in addition to the ergodic and localized phases. We discuss the characteristics of the matrix elements and basis vectors across the three (ergodic, fractal, and localized) regimes and introduce tools to identify the transition points. The exact expressions of the Lanczos coefficients are provided in terms of $q$-logarithmic function across the full parameter regime. The numerical results are corroborated with analytical reasoning for certain features of the Krylov spectra. Additionally, we investigate the Krylov state complexity within these regimes, showcasing the efficacy of our methods in pinpointing these transitions.</description>

      <title>Initial tensor construction and dependence of the tensor renormalization group on initial tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to construct a tensor network representation of partition functions without singular value decompositions nor series expansions. The approach is demonstrated for one- and two-dimensional Ising models and we study the dependence of the tensor renormalization group (TRG) on the form of the initial tensors and their symmetries. We further introduce variants of several tensor renormalization algorithms. Our benchmarks reveal a significant dependence of various TRG algorithms on the choice of initial tensors and their symmetries. However, we show that the boundary TRG technique can eliminate the initial tensor dependence for all TRG methods. The numerical results of TRG calculations can thus be made significantly more robust with only a few changes in the code. Furthermore, we study a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory without gauge-fixing and confirm the applicability of the initial tensor construction. Our method can straightforwardly be applied to systems with longer range and multi-site interactions, such as the next-nearest neighbor Ising model.</description>

      <title>Viscous liquid dynamics modeled as random walks within overlapping hyperspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypersphere model is a simple one-parameter model of the potential energy landscape of viscous liquids, which is defined as a percolating system of same-radius hyperspheres randomly distributed in $\mathbb{R}^{3N}$ in which $N$ is the number of particles. We study random walks within overlapping hyperspheres in 12 to 45 dimensions, i.e., above the percolation threshold, utilizing an algorithm for on-the-fly placement of the hyperspheres in conjunction with the kinetic Monte Carlo method. We find behavior typical of viscous liquids; thus decreasing the hypersphere density (corresponding to decreasing the temperature) leads to a slowing down of the dynamics by many orders of magnitude. The shape of the mean-square displacement as a function of time is found to be similar to that of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture and the Random Barrier Model, which predicts well the frequency-dependent fluidity of nine glass-forming liquids of different chemistry [Bierwirth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{119}, 248001\,(2017)$].</description>

      <title>Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and implement a reformulation of the strong disorder renormalization group (SDRG) method in real space, which is well suited to study bond disordered power law long range coupled, antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. We derive the distribution function of couplings $J$ with corrections to the previously derived strong disorder fixed point distribution, which depend on power exponent $\alpha$ and coupling anisotropy $\gamma.$ As a consequence, the low temperature magnetic susceptibility is found to diverge with an anomalous power law. The distribution of singlet lengths is found to decay more slowly than obtained previously, with consequences for physical properties. The entanglement entropy of a subsystem of length $n$ is thereby found to increase with a power law, rather than logarithmically, corresponding to a subvolume law. While we find no volume law entanglement entropy for the ground state for any $\alpha$, we derive a finite probability that excited states are rainbow states below a critical value $\alpha_c\approx 1.5$, which leads to volume law entanglement for $\alpha &lt; 0.4$, where the rainbow state formation is certain.</description>

      <title>Symmetric tensor scars with tunable entanglement from volume to area law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. Using a symmetric superposition of the antipodal triplet states, we construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. These states exhibit non-thermal correlations, and by tuning the distribution of triplets we induce extensive, logarithmic, or area-law entanglement. Quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and quantum state constructions.</description>
