      <title>Multiplier Modules of extended Rees algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a local ring $(R, \mathfrak{m})$ and an ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of positive height, we give a way of computing multiplier module ${J}(\omega_{{T}}, t^{-\lambda})$ for the extended Rees algebra ${T} =R[\mathfrak{a} t, t^{-1}]$ for an ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ by proving a decomposition theorem for ${J}(\omega_{{T}}, t^{-\lambda})$, (also see the works of Budur, Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Saito). We compute the multiplier module ${J}(\omega_{{S}}, (\mathfrak{a} \cdot {S})^{\lambda})$ for the Rees algebra ${S} =R[\mathfrak{a} t]$ as well (also see the works of Hyry and Kotal-Kummini). We use these decompositions to understand relationships between associated graded rings, Rees and extended Rees algebras having rational singularities (also see the works of Hara, Watanabe, and Yoshida).</description>

      <title>Embeddings and intersections of adelic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the embeddings of adelic groups $\mathbb{A}_I(X, \mathcal{F})\hookrightarrow \mathbb{A}_J(X, \mathcal{F})$ on an excellent scheme $X$ of special type, where $I\subset J$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is a flat quasicoherent sheaf on $X$. We prove the equality $\mathbb{A}_I(X, \mathcal{F})\cap \mathbb{A}_J(X, \mathcal{F}) = \mathbb{A}_{I\setminus 0}(X, \mathcal{F})$ for a normal excellent scheme of special type $X$ and a flat quasicoherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on it, where $I\cap J = I\setminus 0$. We show that the limit of restrictions of global sections of a locally free sheaf on a Cohen-Macaulay projective scheme to power thickenings of integral subschemes is equal to the group of global sections of this sheaf. Using this result, we prove the equality $\mathbb{A}_{\dim X - 1}(X, \mathcal{F})\cap\mathbb{A}_{\dim X}(X, \mathcal{F}) = H^0(X, \mathcal{F})$ for a Cohen-Macaulay projective variety $X$ and a locally free sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on it. Hence we deduce a theorem on intersections of adelic groups for the case of a normal projective surface. We also compute cohomology groups for a particular case of a curtailed adelic complex. Hence we show that on a three-dimensional regular projective variety over a countable field $X$ there is an equality $\mathbb{A}_I(X, \mathcal{F})\cap \mathbb{A}_J(X, \mathcal{F}) = \mathbb{A}_{I\cap J}(X, \mathcal{F})$ for any $I, J\subset \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ and any locally free sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$.</description>

      <title>Bridgeland stability conditions on some higher-dimensional Calabi--Yau manifolds and generalized Kummer varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Bridgeland stability conditions on the the following hyper-K\"ahler or strict Calabi--Yau manifolds:
  - Generalized Kummer varieties associated to an abelian surface that is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves.
  - Universal covers of Hilbert schemes of some Enriques surfaces; this provides examples of stability conditions on strict Calabi--Yau manifolds in each even dimension.
  - Albanese fibers of some finite \'etale covering of Hilbert schemes of some bielliptic surfaces; this provides examples of stability conditions on strict Calabi-Yau manifolds in each odd dimension.
  - Cynk--Hulek Calabi--Yau manifolds with an automorphism of order $2$ or $3$.</description>

      <title>Rationality of cycles modulo 2 on products of generically smooth quadrics in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2022 result of Karpenko establishes a conjecture of Hoffmann-Totaro on the possible values of the first higher isotropy index of an arbitrary anisotropic quadratic form of given dimension over an arbitrary field. For nondegenerate forms, this essentially goes back to a 2003 article of the same author on quadratic forms over fields of characteristic not $2$. To handle the more involved case of degenerate forms in characteristic $2$, Karpenko showed that certain aspects of the algebraic-geometric approach to nondegenerate quadratic forms developed by Karpenko, Merkurjev, Rost, Vishik and others can be adapted to a study of rational cycles modulo $2$ on powers of a given generically smooth quadric. In this paper, we extend this to a broader study of rational cycles modulo $2$ on arbitrary products of generically smooth quadrics in characteristic $2$. A basic objective is to have tools available to study correspondences between general quadrics, in particular, between smooth and non-smooth quadrics. Applications of the theory to the study of degenerate quadratic forms in characteristic $2$ are provided, and a number of open problems on forms of this type are also formulated and discussed.</description>

      <title>Derived isogenies between abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a derived Torelli Theorem for twisted abelian varieties. Starting from this, we explore the relation between derived isogenies and classical isogenies. We show that two abelian varieties of dimension $\geq 2$ are derived isogenous if and only if they are principally isogenous over fields of characteristic zero. This generalized the result for abelian surfaces and completely solves the question raised in [arXiv:2108.08710].</description>

      <title>Essential dimension relative to branched covers of degree at most n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove for various finite groups $G$ and integers $n\geq 1$ that there are families of equations with Galois group $G$ that cannot be simplified to a one-parameter family even after adjoining a root of a polynomial of degree at most $n$. In more geometric language, there are $G$-varieties $X$ with the following property: for any $G$-equivariant branched cover $\widetilde{X}\to X$ of degree $\leq n$, there is no dominant rational $G$-map $\widetilde{X}\dashrightarrow C$ to any $G$-curve $C$. The method of proof is new, and applies in cases where previous methods do not.</description>

      <title>Induced additive actions on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An induced additive action on a projective variety X in P^n is a regular action of the group G_a^n on X with an open orbit that can be extended to a regular action on P^n. Such actions are described with pairs (A, U), where A is a local algebra and U is a generating subspace lying in the maximal ideal. Such pairs are called S-pairs. We study additive actions on projective toric varieties and on Hirzebruch surfaces in particular. We prove that for any linearly normal toric variety with an additive action normalized by a torus, the corresponding S-pair consists of a monomial algebra and a subspace generated by variables. Also, we describe S-pairs for normalized and non-normalized induced additive actions on Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

      <title>Singularities of Landau-Ginzburg models for complete intersections and derived categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry predicts that bounded derived category of a smooth Fano variety is equivalent to Fukaya-Seidel category of its Landau-Ginzburg model. It is expected that fibers of Landau-Ginzburg model with ordinary double points correspond to an exceptional collection of a Fano variety. We verify this expectation on a numerical level for Fano complete intersections and Calabi-Yau compactifications of their toric Landau-Ginzburg models of Givental's type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to give a description of the locally trivial monodromy group of irreducible symplectic varieties arising from moduli spaces of semistable sheaves on Abelian surfaces with non-primitive Mukai vector. The outcome is that the locally trivial monodromy group of a singular moduli space of this type is isomorphic to the monodromy group of a smooth moduli space, extending Markman's and Mongardi's description to the non-primitive case.</description>

      <title>The derived $\infty$-category of Frobenius modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for $X$ a quasi-compact $\mathbb{F}_p$-scheme with affine diagonal (e.g.\ $X$ quasi-compact
  and separated) there is a t-exact equivalence
  $\mathcal D(\mathrm{Frob}(\mathrm{QCoh}(X),F_*)) \to \mathrm{Frob}(\mathcal D(\mathrm{QCoh}(X)),\mathcal D(F_*))$
  of stable $\infty$-categories.
  Here, $\mathrm{Frob}(-,-)$ denotes the $\infty$-category of generalized Frobenius modules
  as introduced in arXiv:2410.17102.
  This generalizes our result from arXiv:2410.17102,
  where we proved the above for regular Noetherian $\mathbb{F}_p$-schemes.
  As a byproduct we prove that the derived $\infty$-category of Frobenius (and Cartier) modules
  satisfies Zariski descent.</description>

      <title>Border Bases in the Rational Weyl Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Border bases are a generalization of Gr\"obner bases for polynomial rings. In this article, we introduce border bases for a non-commutative ring of linear differential operators, namely the rational Weyl algebra. We elaborate on their properties and present algorithms to compute with them. We apply this theory to represent integrable connections as cyclic $D$-modules explicitly. As an application, we visit differential equations behind a stringy, a Feynman as well as a cosmological integral. We also address the classification of particular $D$-ideals of a fixed holonomic rank, namely the case of linear PDEs with constant coefficients as well as Frobenius ideals. Our approach rests on the theory of Hilbert schemes of points in affine space.</description>

      <title>The Euler characteristic of Milnor fibers over 2-generic symmetric determinantal varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a formula to compute the Euler characteristic of the Milnor fiber of non-degenerate functions $f: X \to \mathbb{C}$ with isolated critical set, where $X$ is a $2$-generic symmetric determinantal variety. The formula is obtained in two steps. Firstly, we explicitly describe the toric structure of those varieties. Secondly, we compute volumes of Newton polyhedra arising from the toric structure. The result then follows from Matsui-Takeuchi's formula for the Milnor fibers over toric varieties. As an application, we compute the local Euler obstruction of $X$ at the origin. This, in turn, allow us to provide a family of odd-dimensional normal toric varieties with isolated singular point not satisfying Matsui-Takeuchi's conjecture of the characterization of smoothness through the local Euler obstruction.</description>

      <title>The Proj of the Rees algebra of a graded family of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the condition that the Proj of a Rees algebra of a graded family of ideals in a Noetherian local ring $R$ is Noetherian. In many cases, the Proj will be Noetherian even when the Rees algebra is not. For instance, the Proj of the Rees algebra of a graded filtration of ideals will alway be Noetherian if the analytic spread of the filtration is zero.
  The Proj of a Rees algebra of a divisorial filtration on a two dimensional normal excellent local ring is always Noetherian, as was proven by Russo and later with a different proof by the author. We give examples in this paper of divisorial filtrations on three dimensional normal excellent local rings whose Proj is not Noetherian, showing that this theorem does not extend to higher dimensions.
  A consequence of the fact that the Proj of a divisorial filtration over a two dimensional excellent normal local ring is always Noetherian is that the preimage of the maximal ideal of $R$ in the Proj has only finitely many irreducible components. As a consequence, the fiber cone of such a filtration has only finitely many minimal primes. We give an example of a graded filtration of ideals in a two dimensional regular local ring such that the preimage of the maximal ideal in the Proj of the Rees algebra of the filtration has infinitely many irreducible components, so that the Proj is not Noetherian, and the fiber cone of the filtration has infinitely many minimal primes.</description>

      <title>The existence of valuative interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, using key tools including Zhou valuations, Tian functions and a convergence result for relative types, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of valuative interpolations on the rings of germs of holomorphic functions and real analytic functions at the origin in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, respectively. For the cases of polynomial rings with complex and real coefficients, we establish separate necessary conditions and sufficient conditions, which become both necessary and sufficient when the intersection of the zero sets of the given polynomials is the set of the origin in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$.
  Furthermore, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a valuation to be of the form given by a relative type with respect to a tame maximal weight. We demonstrate a result of Boucksom--Favre--Jonsson on quasimonomial valuations also holds for quasimonomial Zhou valuations. Finally, we obtain a relationship between Zhou valuations and the differentiable points of Tian functions.</description>

Abstract: We propose the notion of perverse coherent sheaves for symplectic singularities and study its properties. In particular, it gives a basis of simple objects in the Grothendieck group of Poisson sheaves. We show that perverse coherent bases for the nilpotent cone and for the affine Grassmannian arise as particular cases of our construction.</description>

      <title>Abhyankar valuations, Pr\"ufer-Manis valuations, and perfectoid Tate algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let \(K\) be a perfectoid field. We describe all quotient fields of the perfectoid Tate algebra \begin{equation*}T_{n, K}^{\text{perfd}}=K\langle X_{1}^{1/p^{\infty}},\dots,
  X_{n}^{1/p^{\infty}}\rangle \end{equation*}in any number $n\geq1$ of variables in terms of (completed perfections of) the nonarchimedean fields $K_{r_1,\dots, r_l}$ occuring in Berkovich geometry. We prove that every quotient field \begin{equation*}L=T_{n, K}^{\text{perfd}}/\mathfrak{m}\end{equation*}is a so-called semi-immediate extension of $K_{r_1,\dots, r_l}^{\text{perfd}}$ for some \begin{equation*} l \leq \max(0, n-\text{ht}(\mathfrak{m}^{\flat} \cap (T_{n, K^{\flat}})^{\text{coperf}})-1), \end{equation*}which pins down the value groups and the residue fields of the possible quotient fields $L$.
  The main ingredient in our proof is a qualitative generalization of Berkovich's classification of points on the nonarchimedean closed unit ball. Namely, we introduce the notion of topologically simple valuations, which generalize type (IV) points in the classification of points on $\text{Spa}(K\langle T\rangle)$. We also consider Abhyankar valuations (i.e., those for which Abhyankar's inequality is an equality), which generalize type (II) and (III) points. We prove that, on an affinoid algebra in the sense of Tate which is not a field, the topologically simple valuations are never Abhyankar, and we derive our result on the perfectoid Tate algebra from this statement. Along the way, we also show that our topologically simple valuations are the same as Pr\"ufer-Manis valuations in the sense of \cite{Knebusch-Zhang}.
  Finally, we also show that all allowed possibilities for the quotient fields $L$ do indeed occur (i.e., the above bound on $l$ is optimal) by generalizing an example of Gleason in \cite{Gleason22N}.</description>

      <title>A Galois Criterion for Good Reduction via Orbital Arboreal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let K be a non-archimedean local field and phi: P^1 -&gt; P^1 a rational endomorphism of degree d &gt;= 2 defined over K. We relate the reduction of phi to the Galois action on its preimage towers by introducing the *orbital colimit* G_{O+(x)} := colim_n Im(rho_{phi^n(x)}), a canonical Galois object encoding the dynamics along a forward orbit. Our main theorem (Theorem 3.1) gives a precise equivalence: phi has *strict good reduction* if and only if there exists a nonempty open set of integral points x in P^1(O_K) whose reductions avoid the reduced postcritical set PC(tilde{phi}), such that the reduced level-1 fibers have degree d and are etale -- equivalently, the associated fiber polynomials have unit leading coefficient and unit discriminant. In particular, for every such x, the extensions K(X_n(x))/K are unramified for all n &gt;= 1. This yields a dynamical Neron--Ogg--Shafarevich criterion in arboreal terms, valid on the natural open locus. We provide complete proofs and explicit examples over Q_p.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian skeleta of very affine complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Z^\circ$ be a complete intersection inside $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ that compactifies to a smooth Calabi-Yau subvariety $Z$ inside a Fano toric variety $X$. We compute the skeleton of $Z^\circ$ and describe its decomposition into standard pieces that are mirror to toric varieties, which generalises the existing results in the case of hypersurfaces. This set-up was first considered by Batyrev and Borisov, who used combinatorial techniques to construct a mirror pair $(Z,\check{Z})$ of such complete intersections. We use our main result to establish homological mirror symmetry for Batyrev-Borisov pairs in the large-volume limit.</description>

Abstract: We produce full strong exceptional collections consisting of vector bundles on the geometric invariant theory quotient of certain linear actions of a split reductive group $G$ of rank two. The vector bundles correspond to irreducible $G$-representations whose weights lie in an explicit bounded region in the weight space of $G$. We also describe a method for constructing more examples of linear GIT quotients with full strong exceptional collections of this kind as "decorated" quiver varieties.</description>

      <title>Volumes of Subvarieties of Complex Ball Quotients and Sparsity of Rational Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X=\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{B}^{n} $ be an $n$-dimensional complex ball quotient by a torsion-free non-uniform lattice $\Gamma$ whose parabolic subgroups are unipotent. We prove that the volumes of subvarieties of $X$ are controlled by the systole of $X,$ which is the length of the shortest closed geodesic of $X$.
  There are a number of arithmetic and geometric consequences: the systole of $X$ controls the growth rate of rational points on $X,$ uniformly in the field of definition. Also, we obtain effective global generation and very ampleness results for multiples of the canonical bundle $K_{\overline{X}},$ where $\overline{X}$ is the toroidal compactification of $X.$ These results follow from the bound we find for the Seshadri constant of $K_{\overline{X}}$ in terms of the systole.</description>

      <title>A Miyaoka-Yau inequality for hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{CP}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{CP}^n$. We define a quadratic form $Q$ on $\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ that is entirely determined by the intersection poset of $\mathcal{H}$. Using the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for parabolic bundles, we show that if $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ is such that the weighted arrangement $(\mathcal{H}, \mathbf{a})$ is stable, then $Q(\mathbf{a}) \leq 0$.
  As an application, we consider the symmetric case where all the weights are equal. The inequality $Q(a, \ldots, a) \leq 0$ gives a lower bound for the total sum of multiplicities of codimension $2$ intersection subspaces of $\mathcal{H}$. The lower bound is attained when every $H \in \mathcal{H}$ intersects all the other members of $\mathcal{H} \setminus \{H\}$ along $(1-2/(n+1))|\mathcal{H}| + 1$ codimension $2$ subspaces; extending from $n=2$ to higher dimensions a condition found by Hirzebruch for line arrangements in the complex projective plane.</description>

      <title>The rationality problem for multinorm one tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rationality problem for multinorm one tori, a natural generalization of norm one tori. For multinorm one tori that split over finite Galois extensions with nilpotent Galois group, we prove that stable rationality and retract rationality are equivalent, and give a criterion for the validity of the above two conditions. This generalizes the result of Endo (2011) on the rationality problem for norm one tori. To accomplish it, we introduce a generalization of character groups of multinorm one tori. Moreover, we establish systematic reduction methods originating in work of Endo (2001) for an investigation of the rationality problem for arbitrary multinorm one tori. In addition, we provide a new example for which the multinorm principle holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19907v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work begins by studying the vanishing of higher cohomology for the derived pushforward of a torsion free sheaf along a modification of integral Noetherian schemes. Leveraging this, we establish a relatively simple recipe for constructing varieties with (mild) rational or Du Bois singularities, some of which is applicable in both zero and nonzero characteristic. Furthermore, we explore notions of singularities that lie in the same cohomological veins of rational singularities for varieties in characteristic zero, including Bhatt's derived splinters and Kov\'{a}cs' birational derived splinters.</description>

      <title>De Rham Theory in Derived Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the question: What is the de Rham theory for general differentiable spaces? We identify two potential answers and study them. In the first part, we show that the de Rham cohomology calculated using (the completion of) the exterior algebra of the cotangent complex yields non-trivial local invariants for singular differentiable spaces. In particular, in some cases, it differs from the constant sheaf cohomology, which provides an obstruction for the de Rham comparison map to be an equivalence. Moreover, we provide conditions under which this local invariant trivializes, yielding a de Rham-type isomorphism. In the second part, we show that for a suitably defined de Rham stack, there is always an isomorphism between functions on it and constant sheaf cohomology of the underlying topological space. Consequently, there exists a version of the de Rham theorem for singular differentiable spaces which holds with almost no restrictions. Finally, we sketch a generalization of this result to other theories of smooth functions, such as holomorphic or analytic functions. The last part is thus related to analytic de Rham stacks of Rodriguez Camargo used by Scholze to geometrize the local Langlands correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we resolve a conjecture of Khovanskii--Monin on the Chern classes of toric variety bundles. The main result is a formula for the total Chern class of the tangent bundle of a toric variety bundle in terms of the total Chern class of the base and the total Chern class of the toric fibre. The result serves as a simultaneous generalization of the description of the total Chern class of a projectivized vector bundle and of the formula for the total Chern class of a toric variety in terms of the Chern classes of the toric divisors. We also establish a topological version of this statement for stably complex quasitoric manifolds. As an immediate application, we obtain a formula for the total Chern class of a toroidal horospherical variety in terms of the Chern classes of the generalized flag variety and the total Chern class of the toric fibre, as well as a new proof of Masuda's formula for equivariant Chern classes. This paper is written with a view towards finding polytopal models for various numeric invariants of spherical varieties.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study Clifford algebra construction from the perspective of adjunctions motivated by the general framework of Krashen and Lieblich. We introduce a category of weighted polynomial laws whose associated Clifford algebra functor is a left adjoint on this category. We introduce a notion of lifting weighted polynomial laws generalizing explicit constructions of Krashen and Lieblich. As another application, we construct derived Clifford algebras of derived homogeneous polynomial forms of arbitrary degree with noncommutative coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of $C_n(X)$, the moduli space of commuting $n$-by-$n$ matrices satisfying the equations defining a variety $X$. This space can be viewed as a non-commutative Weil restriction from the algebra of $n$-by-$n$ matrices to the ground field. We introduce a ``Fermionic" counterpart $S_n(X)$, constructed as a convolution $X^n \times^{S_n} \mathrm{GL}_n/\mathrm{T}_n$. Our main result establishes that a natural map $\sigma \colon S_n(X) \to C_n(X)$ induces an isomorphism on $\ell$-adic cohomology under mild conditions on $X$ or the characteristic of the field. This confirms a heuristic derived from the classical theory of Weil restrictions and highlights a version of Boson-Fermion correspondence. Furthermore, we derive explicit combinatorial formulae for the Betti numbers of $C_n(X)$ and a Macdonald-type generating series. Finally we prove a Hermitian variant of our main result.</description>

      <title>Solid realization of motives with modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a covariant realization functor, denoted \textsc{Solidm}, from the category of motives with modulus to the derived category of solid modules in the sense of Clausen--Scholze. For any smooth modulus pair (X, D), the dual of Solidm(X, D) recovers the Hodge realization of Kelly--Miyazaki for (X, D). Using Ren's pro-solid comparison theorem, we give an explicit description of Solidm(X, D) and compute Solidm of the cone of M(U, D restricted to U) $\to$ M(X, D), in the setting where X is a smooth proper variety over a field, D $\subset$ X is a simple normal crossings divisor, and U $\subset$ X is an open immersion. We identify the result via the formal completion of X along the complement X $\setminus$ U.</description>

      <title>Higher characteristic classes of multisingularity loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A map between manifolds induces stratifications of both the source and the target according to the occurring multisingularities. In this paper, we study universal expressions-called higher Thom polynomials-that describe the Segre-Schwartz-MacPherson class of such multisingularity loci. We prove a Structure Theorem reducing these Thom polynomials to the data of a linear series associated with each multisingularity. The series corresponding to the empty multisingularity, referred to as the Master Series, plays a distinguished role. Motivated by connections with geometric representation theory, we further prove an Interpolation Theorem that allows Thom polynomials to be computed algorithmically within Mather's range of nice dimensions. As an application, we derive an explicit formula for the image Milnor number of quasihomogeneous germs, providing one side of the celebrated Mond conjecture, computable up to the theoretical bound.</description>

      <title>Prime Fano $4$-folds with semi-free torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex prime Fano fourfold having a semi-free action of $\mathbb{C}^*$, then $X$ is contained in one of the families $\mathbb{P}^4,Q^4,W_5, X^{m}_{8}$. All of the families contain members that have a semi-free $\mathbb{C}^*$-action.
  This is mostly proved by an analysis of closed symplectic $8$-manifolds with $b_{2}(M)=1$ with a semi-free Hamiltonian $S^1$-action using methods of equivariant symplectic geometry. In this setting some notable restrictions are obtained: the index is greater than $1$, $b_{4}(M)$ is bounded above and all fixed components are shown to be symplectomorphic to products of projective spaces. The proof of the main result appeals in the last step to the classification of prime Fano $4$-folds with index greater than $1$.</description>

      <title>Moore-Tachikawa Varieties: Beyond Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalisation of the Moore-Tachikawa varieties for the case in which the target category of the 2D TFT is a hyperk$\ddot{\text{a}}$hler quotient. The setup requires generalising the bordism operators of Moore and Segal to the case involving lack of reparametrisation-invariance on the Riemann surface, ultimately enabling to relate this to the issue of defining a Drinfeld center for composite class ${\cal S}$ theories.</description>

      <title>A note on $\mathbb{G}_a$-actions in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12555v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Miyanishi proved that the ring of invariants of any $\mathbb{G}_a$ action on $\mathbb{A}^3$ is $\mathbb{A}^2$, when the field $k$ has zero characteristic. However, it is not known if this result holds when $k$ has positive characteristic. We provide a sufficient condition under which this result holds in positive characteristic. We also prove the following results related to the rigidity of the ring of invariants of an exponential map of a polynomial ring.
  (1) Let $B=R^{[n]}$, where $R$ is a $k$-domain and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}_R(B)$ is a triangular exponential map. Then $B^{\delta}$ is non-rigid. In particular, for any field $k$ of zero characteristic the kernel of any triangular $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.
  (2) Let $k$ be a field of zero characteristic and $R$ be a $k$-domain. Then the kernel of any linear locally nilpotent $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.
  When $k$ is an algebraically closed of zero characteristic, the commuting derivations conjecture for $k^{[3]}$ has been proved by Maubach and El Kahoui proved that the weak Abhyankar Sathaye conjecture is equivalent to the commuting derivations conjecture. By introducing the notion of commuting exponential maps and formulating the commuting exponential maps conjecture, we show that the weak Abhyankar-Sathaye conjecture is equivalent to the commuting exponential maps conjecture for any field of arbitrary characteristic. In particular, we prove the commuting derivations conjecture$(CD(3))$ for any field of zero characteristic.</description>

      <title>The Batyrev-Manin conjecture for DM stacks II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new framework for studying the distribution of rational points on DM stacks of positive characteristic. Our primary focus is on wild stacks, which existing frameworks do not address. There was not even a satisfactory notion of heights for such stacks. First, we introduce a new kind of height function that extends the authors' idea from their preceding paper on characteristic-zero stacks. This new height function is more general and flexible than the previous one. Examples of the new height function include discriminants of torsors, minimal discriminants, and conductors of elliptic curves in characteristic three. Next, we formulate a generalization of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture for rational points of DM stacks in positive characteristic relative to this new type of height function. We provide several pieces of evidence for this generalization.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Deep Polynomial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) possess a rich algebraic and geometric structure. However, their identifiability -- a key property for ensuring interpretability -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the identifiability of deep PNNs, including architectures with and without bias terms. Our results reveal an intricate interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions, while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not grow too rapidly compared to the activation degrees. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type uniqueness theorems. We also settle an open conjecture on the dimension of PNN's neurovarieties, and provide new bounds on the activation degrees required for it to reach the expected dimension.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Closure of Matrix Sets Recognized by 1-VASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known how to compute the Zariski closure of a finitely generated monoid of matrices and, more generally, of a set of matrices specified by a regular language. This result was recently used to give a procedure to compute all polynomial invariants of a given affine program. Decidability of the more general problem of computing all polynomial invariants of affine programs with recursive procedure calls remains open. Mathematically speaking, the core challenge is to compute the Zariski closure of a set of matrices defined by a context-free language. In this paper, we approach the problem from two sides: Towards decidability, we give a procedure to compute the Zariski closure of sets of matrices given by one-counter languages (that is, languages accepted by one-dimensional vector addition systems with states and zero tests), a proper subclass of context-free languages. On the other side, we show that the problem becomes undecidable for indexed languages, a natural extension of context-free languages corresponding to nested pushdown automata. One of our main technical tools is a novel adaptation of Simon's factorization forests to infinite monoids of matrices.</description>

      <title>Affine \'{e}tale group schemes over Tambara fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify finite \'{e}tale extensions and finite affine \'{e}tale group schemes over the $G$-Tambara functor $\underline{\mathbb{F}}$, for $\mathbb{F}$ any algebraically closed field and $G$ any finite group. This establishes $G$-Galois descent from the Tambara functor algebraic closure of $\underline{\mathbb{F}}$. In particular, we find new families of \'{e}tale extensions of any $G$-Tambara functor and show that, together with one of the families discovered by Lindenstrauss--Richter--Zou, these give all finite \'{e}tale extensions of $\underline{\mathbb{F}}$. Our arguments also show that the map $\underline{K} \rightarrow \mathrm{FP}(L)$ associated to any $G$-Galois extension $L$ of $K$ is \'{e}tale, generalizing a result of Lindenstrauss--Richter--Zou when $G$ is cyclic. Lastly, we classify flat finitely generated $\underline{\mathbb{F}}$-modules when $G = C_p$.</description>

      <title>Tilting theory for hypersurface singularities of dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any $\mathbb{N}$-graded commutative Gorenstein ring $R$ of Krull dimension one with $R_0$ a field admits a standard silting object $V$ in the stable category $\underline{\mathrm{CM}}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$, and the object $V$ is tilting if and only if the $a$-invariant $a$ is non-negative, as shown by Buchweitz, the first author, and Yamaura. In this article, under the additional assumption that $R$ is a hypersurface singularity, we prove that endomorphism algebra of $V$ is Iwanaga-Gorenstein of self-injective dimension at most $2$, and we give its explicit presentation in terms of a quiver with relation. In the case of where $a$ is negative, we prove that the dg endomorphism algebra of $V$ is Gorenstein, and we give its explicit presentation in terms of a dg path algebra. We explain our results by several examples including numerical semigroup algebras generated by two elements. Moreover, for each finite and countable Cohen-Macaulay representation type, we include the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the category $\mathrm{CM}_0^{\mathbb{Z}}R$ with the position of the standard silting object. As a step of the proof of our results, we give a characterization of Gorensteinness of homologically finite dg algebras in terms of Serre functors.</description>

      <title>On modular invariants of the truncated polynomial ring in rank four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" ($\mathrm{H_{match}}$), relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</description>
