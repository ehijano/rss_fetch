      <title>Graph learning methods to extract empathy supporting regions in a naturalistic stimuli fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional MRI (fMRI) research, employing naturalistic stimuli like movies, explores brain network interactions in complex cognitive processes such as empathy. The empathy network encompasses multiple brain areas, including the Insula, PFC, ACC, and parietal regions. Our novel processing pipeline applies graph learning methods to whole-brain timeseries signals, incorporating high-pass filtering, voxel-level clustering, and windowed graph learning with a sparsity-based approach. The study involves two short movies shown to 14 healthy volunteers, considering 54 regions extracted from the AAL Atlas. The sparsity-based graph learning consistently outperforms, achieving over 88% accuracy in capturing emotion contagion variations. Temporal analysis reveals a gradual induction of empathy, supported by the method's effectiveness in capturing dynamic connectomes through graph clustering. Edge-weight dynamics analysis underscores sparsity-based learning's superiority, while connectome-network analysis highlights the pivotal role of the Insula, Amygdala, and Thalamus in empathy. Spectral filtering analysis emphasizes the band-pass filter's significance in isolating regions linked to emotional and empathetic processing during empathy HIGH states. Key regions like Amygdala, Insula, and Angular Gyrus consistently activate, supporting their critical role in immediate emotional responses. Strong similarities across movies in graph cluster labels, connectome-network analysis, and spectral filtering-based analyses reveal robust neural correlates of empathy. These findings advance our understanding of empathy-related neural dynamics and identify specific regions in empathetic responses, offering insights for targeted interventions and treatments associated with empathetic processing.</description>

      <title>Enabling self-identification in intelligent agent: insights from computational psychoanalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon prior framework of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis with the theory of active inference, this paper aims to further explore the concept of self-identification and its potential applications. Beginning with two classic paradigms in psychology, mirror self-recognition and rubber hand illusion, we suggest that imaginary identification is characterized by an integrated body schema with minimal free energy. Next, we briefly survey three dimensions of symbolic identification (sociological, psychoanalytic, and linguistical) and corresponding active inference accounts. To provide intuition, we respectively employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) supervised by ChatGPT to showcase optimization of free energy during motor skill and language mastery underlying identification formation. We then introduce Lacan's Graph II of desire, unifying imaginary and symbolic identification, and propose an illustrative model called FreeAgent. In concluding remarks, we discuss some key issues in the potential of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis to advance mental health and artificial intelligence, including digital twin mind, large language models as avatars of the Lacanian Other, and the feasibility of human-level artificial general intelligence with self-awareness in the context of post-structuralism.</description>

      <title>Linear and non-linear integrate-and-fire neurons driven by synaptic shot noise with reversal potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady-state firing rate and firing-rate response of the leaky and exponential integrate-and-fire models receiving synaptic shot noise with excitatory and inhibitory reversal potentials is examined. For the particular case where the underlying synaptic conductances are exponentially distributed, it is shown that the master equation for a population of such model neurons can be reduced from an integro-differential form to a more tractable set of three differential equations. The system is nevertheless more challenging analytically than for current-based synapses: where possible analytical results are provided with an efficient numerical scheme and code provided for other quantities. The increased tractability of the framework developed supports an ongoing critical comparison between models in which synapses are treated with and without reversal potentials, such as recently in the context of networks with balanced excitatory and inhibitory conductances.</description>

Abstract: What could metacognition look like in simple physical terms? We define metacognition as having beliefs about beliefs, which can be articulated very simply using the language of statistical physics and Bayesian mechanics. We introduce a typology between cognitive and metacognitive particles and develop an example of a metacognitive particle. This can be generalized to provide examples of higher forms of metacognition: i.e. particles having beliefs about beliefs about beliefs and so forth. We conclude by saying that the typology of particles laid down in the target article seems promising, for seemingly enabling a physics of cognition that builds upon and refines the free energy principle, toward a physical description of entities that specifically possess higher forms of cognition.</description>

      <title>Visual Decoding and Reconstruction via EEG Embeddings with Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to decode human vision through neural signals has attracted a long-standing interest in neuroscience and machine learning. Modern contrastive learning and generative models improved the performance of fMRI-based visual decoding and reconstruction. However, the high cost and low temporal resolution of fMRI limit their applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), prompting a high need for EEG-based visual reconstruction. In this study, we present an EEG-based visual reconstruction framework. It consists of a plug-and-play EEG encoder called the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM), which is aligned with image embeddings, and a two-stage EEG guidance image generator that first transforms EEG features into image priors and then reconstructs the visual stimuli with a pre-trained image generator. Our approach allows EEG embeddings to achieve superior performance in image classification and retrieval tasks. Our two-stage image generation strategy vividly reconstructs images seen by humans. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of signals from different time windows and brain regions on decoding and reconstruction. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated in the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data modality. We report that EEG-based visual decoding achieves SOTA performance, highlighting the portability, low cost, and high temporal resolution of EEG, enabling a wide range of BCI applications. The code of ATM is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/status/EEG_Image_decode-DEEF.</description>

      <title>Computational limits to the legibility of the imaged human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our knowledge of the organisation of the human brain at the population-level is yet to translate into power to predict functional differences at the individual-level, limiting clinical applications, and casting doubt on the generalisability of inferred mechanisms. It remains unknown whether the difficulty arises from the absence of individuating biological patterns within the brain, or from limited power to access them with the models and compute at our disposal. Here we comprehensively investigate the resolvability of such patterns with data and compute at unprecedented scale. Across 23 810 unique participants from UK Biobank, we systematically evaluate the predictability of 25 individual biological characteristics, from all available combinations of structural and functional neuroimaging data. Over 4526 GPU hours of computation, we train, optimize, and evaluate out-of-sample 700 individual predictive models, including fully-connected feed-forward neural networks of demographic, psychological, serological, chronic disease, and functional connectivity characteristics, and both uni- and multi-modal 3D convolutional neural network models of macro- and micro-structural brain imaging. We find a marked discrepancy between the high predictability of sex (balanced accuracy 99.7%), age (mean absolute error 2.048 years, R2 0.859), and weight (mean absolute error 2.609Kg, R2 0.625), for which we set new state-of-the-art performance, and the surprisingly low predictability of other characteristics. Neither structural nor functional imaging predicted psychology better than the coincidence of chronic disease (p&lt;0.05). Serology predicted chronic disease (p&lt;0.05) and was best predicted by it (p&lt;0.001), followed by structural neuroimaging (p&lt;0.05). Our findings suggest either more informative imaging or more powerful models are needed to decipher individual level characteristics from the human brain.</description>
