      <title>Twisted circle compactification of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and its Holographic Dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a compactification of 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, with $SU(N)$ gauge group, on a circle with anti-periodic boundary conditions for the fermions. We couple the theory to a constant background gauge field along the circle for an abelian subgroup of the $R$-symmetry which allows to preserve four supersymmetries. The 3D effective theory exhibits gapped and ungapped phases, which we argue are holographically dual, respectively, to a supersymmetric soliton in AdS$_{5}\times S^{5}$, and a particular quotient of AdS$_5\times S^5$. The gapped phase corresponds to an IR 3D $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory at level $N$, while the ungapped phase is naturally identified with the root of a Higgs branch in the 3D theory. We discuss the extension of the twisting procedure to maximally SUSY Yang-Mills theories in different dimensions, obtaining the relevant duals for 2D and 6D, and comment on the odd dimensional cases.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dual of Crosscap Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a holographic dual for 2D CFT defined on closed non-orientable manifolds, such as the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and the Klein bottle $\mathbb{K}^2$. Such CFT can be constructed by introducing antipodally identified cuttings, i.e. crosscaps, to a sphere and hence called crosscap CFT (XCFT). The gravity dual is AdS$_3$ spacetime with dS$_2$ end-of-the-world branes. In particular, the Lorentzian spacetime with a global dS$_2$ brane is dual to the unitary time evolution of a crosscap state in CFT, post-selected on the CFT ground state. We compute the holographic $\mathbb{RP}^2$ partition function (or the $p$-function), one-point function, and $\mathbb{K}^2$ partition function, and see that they successfully reproduce the XCFT results. We also show a holographic $p$-theorem as an application.</description>

      <title>Staggered bosons and Kahler-Dirac bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel way to think about bosonic lattice theories in Hamiltonian form where each lattice site has only a half boson degree of freedom. The construction requires a non-trivial Poisson bracket between neighboring sites and leads to gapless theories with non-invertible symmetries. We also describe a bosonic version of Kahler-Dirac fermions, dubbed Kahler-Dirac bosons that can be performed on any triangulation of a manifold. This also leads to a straightforward implementation of supersymmetry on the lattice and one immediately deduces the Dirac equation of the corresponding Kahler-Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Casimir Energy in (2 + 1)-Dimensional Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dependence of vacuum energy on the boundary conditions for massive scalar fields in (2 + 1)-dimensional spacetimes. We consider the simplest geometrical setup given by a two-dimensional space bounded by two homogeneous parallel wires in order to compare it with the non-perturbative behaviour of the Casimir energy for non-Abelian gauge theories in (2 + 1) dimensions. Our results show the existence of two types of boundary conditions which give rise to two different asymptotic exponential decay regimes of the Casimir energy at large distances. The two families are distinguished by the feature that the boundary conditions involve or not interrelations between the behaviour of the fields at the two boundaries. Non-perturbative numerical simulations and analytical arguments show such an exponential decay for Dirichlet boundary conditions of SU(2) gauge theories. The verification that this behaviour is modified for other types of boundary conditions requires further numerical work. Subdominant corrections in the low-temperature regime are very relevant for numerical simulations, and they are also analysed in this paper.</description>

      <title>On the normalization of open-closed string amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the factorization constraints of open-closed string field theory to determine the signs and normalizations of general string amplitudes with both open and closed string external states. The normalization of all amplitudes is controlled by the genus, the number of boundaries, the number of open and closed string insertions, the string coupling and the D-brane tension. The challenge with signs arises because the relevant moduli spaces are not complex manifolds and have no obvious orientation. We deal with this by fixing a specific convention for the sign of the integration measure over the moduli space and adopting a consistent prescription for the ordering of operators and ghost insertions inside correlators.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Dualities of Type II Little String Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the symmetry structure of Type II Little String Theories and their T-dualities. We construct these theories both from the bottom-up perspective starting with seed Superconformal Field Theories, and from the top-down using F-/M-theory. By exploiting anomaly inflow and unitarity of the LST worldsheet theory, we derive strong conditions on the possible 6D bulk theories and their flavor algebras. These constraints continue to apply if gravity is coupled to the theory. We also study the higher form symmetry structure of these theories and show how they get exchanged under T-duality. Finally, we comment on seemingly consistent bottom-up Little String Theories that cannot be constructed from the top-down approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading $\alpha'$-correction to the gravitational low-energy effective action of closed (type II) superstring theory in four-spacetime dimensions defines the Einstein-Grisaru-Zanon gravity action that is applied for a calculation of the leading corrections to the Schwarzschild solution and the Hubble function in the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe, in the first order with respect to the effective string-generated coupling. The solutions found are compared to the corresponding solutions in the Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity that also modifies the Einstein gravity by the terms quartic in the spacetime curvature. We consider the black hole shadows in the Einstein-Grisaru-Zanon gravity theory and derive the upper bound on the string coupling parameter from the Hawking temperature of a black hole.</description>

      <title>The stringy scaling loop expansion and stringy scaling violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a systematic approximation scheme to calculate general $n$-point $HSSA$ of open bosonic string theory. This stringy scaling loop expansion contains finite number of vacuum diagram terms at each loop order of scattering energy due to a vacuum diagram contraint and a topological graph constraint. In addition, we calculate coefficient and give the vacuum diagram representation and its Feynman rules for each term in the expansion of the $HSSA$. As an application to extending our previous calculation of $n$-point leading order stringy scaling behavior of $HSSA$, we explicitly calculate some examples of $4$-point next to leading order stringy scaling violation terms.</description>

      <title>$1/N$ Corrections in $\text{QCD}_2$: Small Mass Limit and Threshold States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate $1/N$ corrections to mesonic spectrum in $1+1$-dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics ($\text{QCD}_2$) with fundamental quarks using effective Hamiltonian method. We express the corrections in terms of 't Hooft equation solutions. First, we consider 2-flavor model with a heavy and a light quark. We show that, in contrast to some claims in earlier literature, the $1/N$ correction to the mass of the heavy-light meson remains finite when the light quark mass is taken to zero. Nevertheless, the corrections become significantly larger in this limit; we attribute this to the presence of massless modes in the spectrum. We also study the corrections to the lightest meson mass in 1-flavor model and show that they are consistent with recent numerical data, but not with the prediction coming from bosonization. Then we study low energy effective theory for 2 flavors. We show that the 3-meson interaction vertex correctly reproduces Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) coupling when both quarks become massless. This coupling does not change even if one of the quarks is massive. We employ Discretized Light Cone Quatization (DLCQ) to check the continuum results and show that the improved version can be used for small quark mass. Finally, we study the states associated with $1\to 2$ meson thresholds. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we show that when the decay is allowed by parity, the infinite $N$ theory has near-threshold bound states that mix one- and two-meson parts. They are $1/3$ two-meson and $2/3$ one-meson and the corrections to their masses have unusual scaling $\sim 1/N^{2/3}$.</description>

      <title>On self-dual Carrollian conformal nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the duality symmetry group of Carrollian (nonlinear) electrodynamics and propose a family of Carrollian ModMax theories, which are invariant under Carrollian $\text{SO}(2)$ electromagnetic (EM) duality transformations and conformal transformation. We define the Carrollian $\text{SO}(2)$ EM transformations, with the help of Hodge duality in Carrollian geometry, then we rederive the Gaillard-Zumino consistency condition for EM duality of Carrollian nonlinear electrodynamics. Together with the traceless condition for the energy-momentum tensor, we are able to determine the Lagrangian of the Carrollian ModMax theories among pure electrodynamics. We furthermore study their behaviors under the $\sqrt{T\bar{T}}$ deformation flow, and show that these theories deform to each other and may reach two endpoints under the flow, with one of the endpoint being the Carrollian Maxwell theory. As a byproduct, we construct a family of two-dimensional Carrollian ModMax-like multiple scalar theories, which are closed under the $\sqrt{T\bar{T}}$ flow and may flow to a BMS free multi-scalar model.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the spacetime dual to a free matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the collective field theory description of the singlet sector of a free matrix field in 2+1 dimensions. This necessarily involves the study of $k$-local collective fields, which are functions of $2k+1$ coordinates. We argue that these coordinates have a natural interpretation: the $k$-local collective field is a field defined on an AdS$_4\times$S$^{k-2}\times$S$^{k-1}$ spacetime. The modes of a harmonic expansion on the S$^{k-2}\times$S$^{k-1}$ portion of the spacetime leads to the spinning bulk fields of the dual gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Dressing fields for supersymmetry: The cases of the Rarita-Schwinger and gravitino fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we argue that the gauge-fixing conditions typically used to extract the (off-shell) degrees of freedom of the Rarita-Schwinger spinor-vector and gravitino, respectively in rigid supersymmetric field theory and supergravity, are actually instances of the dressing field method of symmetry reduction. Since the latter has a natural relation interpretation, solving the ``gauge-fixing condition" -- or, better, ``dressing functional constraints" -- actually realises the Rarita-Schwinger spinor-vector and the gravitino fields as (non-local) relational variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the dressing field method to supersymmetric theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining swampland conjectures with observational data, it was recently suggested that the cosmological hierarchy problem (i.e. the smallness of the dark energy in Planck units) could be understood as an asymptotic limit in field space, corresponding to a decompactification of one extra (dark) dimension of a size in the micron range. In these Proceedings we examine the fundamental setting of this framework and discuss general aspects of the effective low energy theory inherited from properties of the overarching string theory. We then explore some novel phenomenology encompassing the dark dimension by looking at potential dark matter candidates, decoding neutrino masses, and digging into new cosmological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of mixed-state topological orders in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering $G$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild Solution within a new renormalizable SO(1,3) Gauge Field Theory of Gravitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of the Schwarzschild solution is demonstrated within a new SO(1,3) gauge field theory whose fundamental gauge field B is of dimension one allowing for the renormalizability of the full quantum theory. On the other hand the classically dominant term of the gauge field action can be expressed in terms of a naturally emerging Vierbein of dimension zero. In fact this action term is the same functional of the emerging Vierbein e[B] as is the Einstein-Hilbert action of the Vierbein in General Relativity (GR), albeit with e[B] subject to a constraint. To solve the Einstein equations a spherically symmetric Ansatz for e[B] respecting the constraint is determined and transformed into the standard metric used to calculate the Schwarzschild solution. This allows to prove the latter's existence making the present theory a perfectly viable theory of gravitation equivalent to GR at the classical level.</description>

      <title>Percolating Cosmic String loops from evaporating primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pulsar timing data from NANOGrav Collaboration has regenerated interest in the possibility of observing stochastic gravitational wave background arising from cosmic strings. In the standard theory, the cosmic string network forms during spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase transition in the whole universe via the so called Kibble mechanism. This scenario would not be possible, e.g., in models of low energy inflation, where the reheat temperature is much lower than the energy scale of cosmic strings. We point out a very different possibility, where a network of even high energy scale cosmic strings can form when the temperature of the Universe is much lower. We consider local heating of plasma in the early universe by evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs). It is known that for suitable masses of PBHs, their Hawking radiation may re-heat the surrounding plasma to high temperatures, restoring certain symmetries {\it locally} which are broken at the ambient temperature at that stage. Expansion of the hot plasma cools it so that the {\it locally restored symmetry} is spontaneously broken again. If this SSB supports formation of cosmic strings, then string loops will form in this region around the PBH. Further, resulting temperature gradients lead to pressure gradients such that plasma develops radial flow with the string loops getting stretched as they get dragged by the flow. For a finite density of PBHs of suitable masses, one will get local hot spots, each one contributing to expanding cosmic string loops. For suitable PBH density, the loops from different regions may intersect. Intercommutation of strings can then lead to percolation, leading to the possibility of formation of infinite string network, even when the entire universe never goes through the respective SSB phase transition.</description>

      <title>Too Hot to Handle: Searching for Inflationary Particle Production in Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic production of massive particles is a generic feature of many inflationary mechanisms. If sufficiently massive, these particles can leave features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that are not well-captured by traditional correlation function analyses. We consider a scenario in which particle production occurs only in a narrow time-interval during inflation, eventually leading to CMB hot- or coldspots with characteristic shapes and sizes. Searching for such features in CMB data is analogous to searching for late-Universe hot- or coldspots, such as those due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Exploiting this data-analysis parallel, we perform a search for particle-production hotspots in the Planck PR4 temperature dataset, which we implement via a matched-filter analysis. Our pipeline is validated on synthetic observations and found to yield unbiased constraints on sufficiently large hotspots across $\approx 60\%$ of the sky. After removing point sources and tSZ clusters, we find no evidence for new physics and place novel bounds on the coupling between the inflaton and massive particles. These bounds are strongest for larger hotspots, produced early in inflation, whilst sensitivity to smaller hotspots is limited by noise and beam effects. Through such methods we can constrain particles with masses $\mathcal{O}(100)$ times larger than the inflationary Hubble scale, which represents possibly the highest energies ever directly probed with observational data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic strings in LISA: reconstruction pipeline and physics interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the LISA template databank for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds sourced by cosmic strings. We include two templates, an analytical template, which enables more flexible searches, and a numerical template derived directly from large Nambu-Goto simulations of string networks. Using searches based on these templates, we forecast the parameter space within the reach of the experiment and the precision with which their parameters will be reconstructed, provided a signal is observed. The reconstruction permits probing the Hubble expansion and new relativistic DoF in the early universe. We quantify the impact that astrophysical foregrounds can have on these searches. Finally, we discuss the impact that these observations would have on our understanding of the fundamental models behind the string networks. Overall, we prove that LISA has great potential for probing cosmic string models and may reach tensions as low as $G\mu =10^{-16} - 10^{-17} $, which translates into energy scales of the order $10^{11}~\text{GeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under the assumption that the recent pulsar timing array evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies is generated by metastable cosmic strings, we analyze the potential of present and future GW observatories for probing the change of particle degrees of freedom caused, e.g., by a supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the Standard Model (SM). We find that signs of the characteristic doubling of degrees of freedom predicted by SUSY could be detected at Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer even if the masses of the SUSY partner particles are as high as about $10^4$ TeV, far above the reach of any currently envisioned particle collider. We also discuss the detection prospects for the case that some entropy production, e.g. from a late decaying modulus field inducing a temporary matter domination phase in the evolution of the universe, somewhat dilutes the GW spectrum, delaying discovery of the stochastic GW background at LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. In our analysis we focus on SUSY, but any theory beyond the SM predicting a significant increase of particle degrees of freedom could be probed this way.</description>

      <title>Differential spinors and Kundt three-manifolds with skew-torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of spinorial polyforms associated with bundles of irreducible Clifford modules of non-simple real type, obtaining a precise characterization of the square of an irreducible real spinor in signature $(p-q) = 1\,\mathrm{mod(8)}$ as a polyform belonging to a semi-algebraic real set. We use this formalism to study differential spinors on Lorentzian three-manifolds, proving that in this dimension and signature, every differential spinor is equivalent to an isotropic line preserved in a given direction by a metric connection with prescribed torsion. We apply this result to investigate Lorentzian three-manifolds equipped with a skew-torsion parallel spinor, namely a spinor parallel with respect to a metric connection with totally skew-symmetric torsion. We obtain several structural results about this class of Lorentzian three-manifolds, which are necessarily Kundt, and in the compact case, we obtain an explicit differential condition that guarantees geodesic completeness. We further elaborate on these results to study the supersymmetric solutions of three-dimensional NS-NS supergravity, which involve skew-torsion parallel spinors whose torsion is given by the curvature of a curving on an abelian bundle gerbe. In particular, we obtain a correspondence between NS-NS supersymmetric solutions and null coframes satisfying an explicit exterior differential system that we solve locally.</description>

      <title>Assessing observational constraints on dark energy</title>

Abstract: Observational constraints on time-varying dark energy ({\it e.g.}, quintessence) are commonly presented on a $w_0$-$w_a$ plot that assumes the equation of state of dark energy strictly satisfies $w(z)= w_0+ w_a z/(1+z)$ as a function of the redshift $z$. Recent observations favor a sector of the $w_0$-$w_a$ plane in which $w_0 &gt; -1$ and $w_0+w_a&lt; -1$, suggesting that the equation of state underwent a transition from violating the null energy condition (NEC) at large $z$ to obeying it at small $z$. In this paper, we demonstrate that this impression is misleading by showing that simple quintessence models satisfying the NEC for all $z$ predict an observational preference for the same sector. We also find that quintessence models that best fit observational data can predict a value for the dark energy equation of state at present that is significantly different from the best-fit value of $w_0$ obtained assuming the parameterization above. In addition, the analysis reveals an approximate degeneracy of the $w_0$-$w_a$ parameterization that explains the eccentricity and orientation of the likelihood contours presented in recent observational studies.</description>

      <title>MEET-U Project I: The key drivers of the preference for dynamic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We demonstrate that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at $3.2\sigma$ level when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. By comparing the data with over $10^4$ $\Lambda$CDM-based simulations, we find that both the SNe and BAO data contribute significantly to the preference for dynamic dark energy. The preference for dynamic dark energy is unlikely (probability $\lesssim 0.02$) due to unknown systematics in DES5YR SNe and statistical fluctuations in DESI BAO, or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Finite modular majoron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the accidental $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry can arise from a finite modular symmetry $\Gamma_N$ in the type-I seesaw. The finite modular symmetry is spontaneously broken in such a way that the residual $\mathbb{Z}^T_N$ discrete symmetry, associated with the $T$-transformation which shifts the modulus $\tau \to \tau+ 1$, remains unbroken. This discrete $\mathbb{Z}^T_N$ symmetry mimics $U(1)_{B-L}$, and hence the majoron appears as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson of $U(1)_{B-L}$. Without introducing additional interactions, the modulus $\tau$ can be stabilized by the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) potential given by the Majorana mass terms of the right-handed neutrinos. We study cosmological implications of the majoron, with particular interests in the dark matter and dark radiation, where the latter may alleviate the Hubble tension. We also find that the CW potential can have a wide range of nearly exponential shape which prevents $\tau$ from overshooting, and makes the amount of dark radiation not too large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of geodesic completeness of cosmological spacetimes has recently received renewed scrutiny. A particularly interesting result is the observation that the well-known Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem may misdiagnose geodesically complete cosmologies. We propose a simple amendment to the BGV theorem which addresses such loopholes while retaining much of its generality. We give straightforward proofs of some recently offered conjectures concerning (generalized) Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes: geodesic completeness implies (i) the existence of a bounce, loitering phase or an emergent cosmology, and (ii) a phase of accelerated expansion with strictly increasing Hubble rate. Our results are purely kinematic and do not assume general relativity or energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of the Weyl geometric gravity theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider cosmological implications of the Weyl geometric gravity theory. The basic action of the model is obtained from the simplest conformally invariant gravitational action, constructed, in Weyl geometry, from the square of the Weyl scalar, the strength of the Weyl vector, and a matter term, respectively. The total action is linearized in the Weyl scalar by introducing an auxiliary scalar field. To maintain the conformal invariance of the action the trace condition is imposed on the matter energy-momentum tensor, thus making the matter sector of the action conformally invariant. The field equations are derived by varying the action with respect to the metric tensor, the Weyl vector field, and the scalar field, respectively. We investigate the cosmological implications of the theory, and we obtain first the cosmological evolution equations for a flat, homogeneous and isotropic geometry, described by Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, which generalize the Friedmann equations of standard general relativity. In this context we consider two cosmological models, corresponding to the vacuum state, and to the presence of matter described by a linear barotropic equation of state. In both cases we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the theory with the cosmological observational data, and with the standard $\Lambda$ CDM model. By assuming that the presence of the Weyl geometric effects induce small perturbations in the homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background, and that the anisotropy parameter is small, the equations of the cosmological perturbations due to the presence of the Weyl geometric effects are derived. The time evolution of the metric and matter perturbations are explicitly obtained. So, if Weyl geometric effects are present, the Universe would acquire some anisotropic characteristics, and its geometry will deviate from the standard FLRW one.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics driving the conversion of gravitational and electromagnetic waves in cylindrically symmetric spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the ``composite harmonic mapping method," we construct exact solutions for cylindrically symmetric gravitational and electromagnetic waves within the Einstein-Maxwell system, focusing on the conversion dynamics between these types of waves. In this approach, we employs two types of geodesic surfaces in ${\mathbb H}^{2}_{C}$: (a) the complex line and (b) the totally real Lagrangian plane, applied to two different vacuum seed solutions: (i) a vacuum solution previously utilized in our studies and (ii) the solitonic vacuum solution constructed previously by Economou and Tsoubelis. We study three scenarios: case (a) with seeds (i) and (ii), and case (b) with seed (ii). In all cases (a) and (b), solutions demonstrate notable mode conversions near the symmetric axis. In case (a) with seed (i) or seed (ii), we show that any change in the occupancy of the gravitational or electromagnetic mode relative to the C-energy near the axis always reverts to its initial state once the wave moves away from the axis. Particularly in case (b) with seed (ii), nontrivial conversions occur even when the wave moves away from the axis. In this case, the amplification factors of electromagnetic modes range from an upper limit of approximately $2.4$ to a lower limit of about $0.4$, when comparing the contributions of electromagnetic mode to C-energy at past and future null infinities.</description>

      <title>CMB spectrum in unified EFT of dark energy: scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in the unified description of the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy that accommodates both scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories. The boundaries of different classes of theories are universally parameterised by a new EFT parameter $\alpha_V$ characterising the vectorial nature of dark energy and a set of consistency relations associated with the global/local shift symmetry. After implementing the equations of motion in a Boltzmann code, as a demonstration, we compute the CMB power spectrum based on the $w$CDM background with the EFT parameterisation of perturbations and a concrete Horndeski/generalised Proca theory. We show that the vectorial nature generically prevents modifications of gravity in the CMB spectrum. On the other hand, while the shift symmetry is less significant in the perturbation equations unless the background is close to the $\Lambda$CDM, it requires that the effective equation of state of dark energy is in the phantom region $w_{\rm DE}&lt;-1$. The latter is particularly interesting in light of the latest result of the DESI+CMB combination as the observational verification of $w_{\rm DE}&gt;-1$ can rule out shift-symmetric theories including vector-tensor theories in one shot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models with a non-zero background curvature are ill-defined in general relativity because scalar modes cannot be canonically quantized. Therefore, there is no consensus on the primordial power spectrum that should be considered at large scales in a curved Universe. In this letter, we propose a model of curved inflation where canonical quantization is possible for any curvature, and we unambiguously obtain the resulting primordial power spectra. The framework is a recently proposed modification of general relativity in which a non-dynamical topological term is added to the Einstein equation. The main strength of this model is that no additional degree of freedom compared to the standard model of cosmology is needed, giving a natural solution to the problem of constructing curved inflation, and at the same time providing an additional argument for this topological modification of general relativity.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational positivity bounds provide consistency conditions for effective field theories with gravity. They turn out to be phenomenologically useful by providing lower bounds in parameters of new physics beyond the Standard Models (BSM). In this paper, we derive constraints on millicharged fermion dark matter models with massless dark photon using gravitational positivity bounds. Combining them with upper bounds from cosmological and astrophysical observations, we can severely constrain the parameter space of the model. In particular, we show that when the dark matter mass is lighter than the solar core temperature, most of the parameter region is excluded by combining gravitational positivity bounds and the stellar bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The in-in formalism and its influence functional generalization are widely used to describe the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of unitary and open quantum systems, respectively. In this paper, we build on these techniques to develop an effective theory of a quantum damped harmonic oscillator and use it to study initial state-dependence, decoherence, and thermalization. We first consider a Gaussian initial state and quadratic influence functional and obtain general equations for the Green's functions of the oscillator. We solve the equations in the specific case of time-local dissipation and use the resulting Green's functions to obtain the purity and unequal-time two-point correlations of the oscillator. We find that the dynamics must include a non-vanishing noise term to yield physical results for the purity and that the oscillator decoheres in time such that the late-time density operator is thermal. We show that the frequency spectrum or unequal-time correlations can, however, distinguish between the damped oscillator and an isolated oscillator in thermal equilibrium, and obtain a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation for the damped oscillator. We briefly consider time-nonlocal dissipation as well, to show that the fluctuation-dissipation relation is satisfied for a specific choice of dissipation kernels. Lastly, we develop a double in-out path integral approach to go beyond Gaussian initial states and show that our equal-time results for time-local dissipation are in fact non-perturbative in the initial state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calabi-Yau four-folds may be constructed as hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces of complex dimension 5 defined via weight systems of 6 weights. In this work, neural networks were implemented to learn the Calabi-Yau Hodge numbers from the weight systems, where gradient saliency and symbolic regression then inspired a truncation of the Landau-Ginzburg model formula for the Hodge numbers of any dimensional Calabi-Yau constructed in this way. The approximation always provides a tight lower bound, is shown to be dramatically quicker to compute (with compute times reduced by up to four orders of magnitude), and gives remarkably accurate results for systems with large weights. Additionally, complementary datasets of weight systems satisfying the necessary but insufficient conditions for transversality were constructed, including considerations of the interior point, reflexivity, and intradivisibility properties. Overall producing a classification of this weight system landscape, further confirmed with machine learning methods. Using the knowledge of this classification, and the properties of the presented approximation, a novel dataset of transverse weight systems consisting of 7 weights was generated for a sum of weights $\leq 200$; producing a new database of Calabi-Yau five-folds, with their respective topological properties computed. Further to this an equivalent database of candidate Calabi-Yau six-folds was generated with approximated Hodge numbers.</description>

      <title>The Bubble of Nothing under T-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bubble of nothing is a solution to Einstein's equations where a circle shrinks and pinches off smoothly. As such, it is one of the simplest examples of a dynamical cobordism to nothing. We take a first step in studying how this solution transforms under T-duality in bosonic string theory. Applying Buscher's rules reveals that the dual solution features a singular, strongly coupled core, with a circle blowing-up rather than pinching off. This naive approach to T-duality solely accounts for the zero-modes of the fields after dimensional reduction on the circle. For this reason, we argue that this is not the full picture that the T-dual solution should depend non-trivially on the dual circle. We point out evidence to this effect both in the gravity description and on the worldsheet. A more complete description of the T-dual object would require a full-fledged sigma model for the bubble of nothing. Nevertheless, inspired by similar examples in the literature, we detail one possible scenario where the stringy bubble of nothing is mediated by closed string tachyon condensation and we discuss its T-duality.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy from Qubit Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a non-conventional description of the vacuum energy in quantum field theory in terms of quantum entropy. Precisely, we show that the vacuum energy of any non-interacting quantum field at zero temperature is proportional to the quantum entropy of the qubit degrees of freedom associated with virtual fluctuations. We prove this for fermions first, and then extend the derivation to quanta of any spin. Finally, we use these results to obtain the first law of thermodynamics for a non-interacting quantum vacuum at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>On the phase structure of extra-dimensional gauge theories with fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phase structure of five-dimensional Yang-Mills theories coupled to Dirac fermions. In order to tackle their non-perturbative character, we derive the flow equations for the gauge coupling and the effective potential for the Aharonov-Bohm phases employing the Functional Renormalisation Group. We analyse the infrared and ultraviolet fixed-point solutions in the flow of the gauge coupling as a function of the compactification radius of the fifth dimension. We discuss various types of trajectories which smoothly connect both dimensional limits. Last, we investigate the phase diagram and vacuum structure of the gauge potential for different fermion content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A non-relativistic limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence is studied in the context of M2-branes. On the field theory side this corresponds to a near-BPS limit of ABJM that localises onto solutions of Hitchin's equations. It is shown that the symmetries of the theory include an infinite-dimensional enhancement of the spatial symmetry algebra corresponding to time-dependent holomorphic transformations. Taking the limit of the gravitational dual splits the geometry into three 'large' directions and eight 'small' directions and corresponds to the Membrane-Newton-Cartan limit of eleven-dimensional supergravity. This has the effect of reducing the $AdS_4$ factor to an $AdS_2$ factor for the near-horizon limit of the M2-brane metric. Evidence is presented that the duality is maintained after the limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constructed all possible kinematically allowed three-point interactions of two massless Dirac spinors with massive higher-spin bosons. In any $D$ spacetime, the interactions have been constructed using the projections of the massive higher spin representations of $Spin(D-1)$ over the massless complex spinor representations of $Spin(D-2)\times Spin(D-2)$. Based on this analysis, we have further classified the space of theories involving one massless Dirac spinor and a single (or multiple) massive higher spins based on the discrete symmetries: $C,\, R,$ and $ T$. We found that in any $D=2m+1/2m$, the interacting theories of a single massive higher spin have a $``m"$ mod $2$ (or $D$ mod $4$) classification.</description>

      <title>Running Coupling and Beta-Functions for HQCD with Heavy and Light Quarks: Isotropic case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider running coupling constant and beta-function in holographic models supported by Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell action for heavy and light quarks. To obtain the dependence of the running coupling constant $\alpha$ on temperature and chemical potential we impose boundary conditions on the dilaton field that depend on the position of the horizon. We use two types of boundary conditions: a simple boundary condition with the dilaton field vanishing at the horizon, and a boundary condition that ensures agreement with lattice calculations of string tension between quarks at zero chemical potential. The location of the first-order phase transitions in $(T,\mu)$-plane does not depend on the dilaton boundary conditions for light and heavy quarks. At these phase transitions, the functions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ undergo jumps depending on temperature and chemical potential. We also show that for the second boundary conditions the running coupling decreases with increasing temperature and the dependence on temperature and chemical potential for both light and heavy quarks are actually specified by functions of one variable, demonstrating in this sense auto-model behavior.</description>

      <title>Gradient Properties of Perturbative Multiscalar RG Flows to Six Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gradient property of the renormalisation group (RG) flow of multiscalar theories is examined perturbatively in $d=4$ and $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Such theories undergo RG flows in the space of quartic couplings $\lambda^I$. Starting at five loops, the relevant vector field that determines the physical RG flow is not the beta function traditionally computed in a minimal subtraction scheme in dimensional regularisation, but a suitable modification of it, the $B$ function. It is found that up to five loops the $B$ vector field is gradient, i.e. $B^I=G^{IJ}\partial A / \partial\lambda^J$ with $A$ a scalar and $G_{IJ}$ a rank-two symmetric tensor of the couplings. Up to five loops the beta function is also gradient, but it fails to be so at six loops. The conditions under which the $B$ function (and hence the RG flow) is gradient at six loops are specified, but their verification rests on a separate six-loop computation that remains to be performed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In black hole thermodynamics, defining coarse-grained entropy for dynamical black holes has long been a challenge, and various proposals, such as generalized entropy, have been explored. Guided by the AdS/CFT, we introduce a new definition of coarse-grained entropy for a dynamical black hole in Lorentzian Einstein gravity. On each time slice, this entropy is defined as the horizon area of an auxiliary Euclidean black hole that shares the same mass, (angular) momenta, and asymptotic normalizable matter modes with the original Lorentzian solution. The entropy is shown to satisfy a generalized first law and, through holography, the second law as well. Furthermore, by applying this thermodynamics to several Vaidya models in AdS and flat spacetime, we discover a connection between the second law and the null energy condition.</description>

      <title>On a $\mathbb{Z}_3$-valued discrete topological term in 10d heterotic string theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the low-energy effective actions of two ten-dimensional supersymmetric heterotic strings are different by a $\mathbb{Z}_3$-valued discrete topological term even after we turn off the $E_8\times E_8$ and $Spin(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields. This will be demonstrated by considering the inflow of normal bundle anomaly to the respective NS5-branes from the bulk. We also find that the $Spin(16)\times Spin(16)$ non-tachyonic non-supersymmetric heterotic string has the same non-zero $\mathbb{Z}_3$-valued discrete topological term. We will also explain the relation of our findings to the theory of topological modular forms.
  The paper is written as a string theory paper, except for an appendix translating the content in mathematical terms. We will explain there that our finding identifies a representative of the $\mathbb{Z}/3$-torsion element of $\pi_{-32}\mathrm{TMF}$ as a particular self-dual vertex operator superalgebra of $c=16$ and how we utilize string duality to arrive at this statement.</description>

      <title>What if string theory has a de Sitter excited state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose precise effective field theory criteria to obtain a four-dimensional de Sitter space within M-theory. To this effect, starting with the state space described by the action of metric perturbations, fluxes etc over the supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum in eleven-dimensions, we discuss the most general low energy effective action in terms of the eleven-dimensional fields including non-perturbative and non-local terms. Given this, our criteria to obtain a valid four-dimensional de Sitter solution at far IR involve satisfying the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the associated path integral, as well as obeying positivity constraints on the dual IIA string coupling and its time derivative. For excited states, the Schwinger-Dyson equations imply an effective emergent potential different from the original potential. We show that while vacuum solutions and arbitrary coherent states fail to satisfy these criteria, a specific class of excited states called the Glauber-Sudarshan states obey them. Using the resurgent structure of observables computed using the path integral over the Glauber-Sudarshan states, four-dimensional de Sitter in the flat slicing can be constructed using a Glauber-Sudarshan state in M-theory.
  Among other novel results, we discuss the smallness of the positive cosmological constant, including the curious case where the cosmological constant is very slowly varying with time. We also discuss the resolution of identity with the Glauber-Sudarshan states, generation and the convergence properties of the non-perturbative and the non-local effects, the problems with the static patch and other related topics. We analyze briefly the issues related to the compatibility of the Wilsonian effective action with Borel resummations and discuss how they influence the effective field theory description in a four-dimensional de Sitter space.</description>

Abstract: Recently we have constructed a completely supersymmetric nonlinear action possessing the properties expected from multiple D0-brane system. Its quantization should result in an interesting supersymmetric field theory in the (super)space with additional matrix coordinates which can provide an important insights in the study of String Theory. As a first stage toward this aim, in this paper we construct the Hamiltonian mechanics and perform covariant quantization of the simplest three dimensional counterpart of the ten dimensional multiple D0-brane model. We obtain a supersymmetric system of equations in super-spacetime enlarged by bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates which appears as a result of such quantization and discuss some of its properties.</description>

Interpreting the Sch\"{r}odinger equation in terms of a superpotential we determine the supersymmetric partners for $n$.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the late time oscillatory tails of massive gravitons, present in both massive theories of gravity and effectively in extra-dimensional scenarios, could potentially contribute to gravitational waves with very long wavelengths. However, their impact on recent pulsar timing array observations might be relatively small, predominantly consisting of radiation emitted by black holes in our region of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Coupling Constants as Conserved Charges in Black Hole Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a generic theory of gravity coupled to matter fields, the Smarr formula for black holes does not work properly if the contributions of the coupling constants defining the theory are not incorporated. However, these couplings, such as the cosmological constant or the dimensionful parameters that appear in the Lagrangian, are fixed parameters defining the theory, and they cannot be varied. Here, we present a robust method, applicable to any covariant Lagrangian, that upgrades the role of the couplings from being constants in the theory to being free parameters of the solutions. To this end, for each one of the couplings in a theory, a pair of auxiliary scalar and gauge fields is introduced. The couplings are shown to be conserved charges of the global part of the implemented gauge symmetry. Besides, their conjugate chemical potentials are defined as the electric potential of the corresponding gauge fields on the black hole horizon. Using this method, we systematically extend the first law and the Smarr formula by coupling conserved charges and their conjugate potentials. The thermodynamics of a black hole solution in a quadratic gravity theory is given as an example.</description>

      <title>Phase space path integral approach to the kinetics of black hole phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02260v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the approach of path integral in the phase space to study the kinetics of state switching associated with black hole phase transitions. Under the assumption that the state switching process of the black hole is described by the stochastic Langevin equation based on the free energy landscape, we derived the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis (MSRJD) functional and obtained the path integral expression of the transition probability. The MSRJD functional inherently represents the path integral in the phase space, allowing us to extract the effective Hamiltonian for the dynamics of state switching process. By solving the Hamiltonian equations of motion, we obtain the kinetic path in the phase space using an example of the RNAdS black hole. Furthermore, the dominant kinetic path within the configuration space is calculated. We also discuss the kinetic rate by using the functional formalism. Finally, we examine two further examples: Hawking-Page phase transition and Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point. Our analysis demonstrates that, concerning the Hawking-Page phase transition, while a dominant kinetic path in the phase space from the large SAdS black hole to the thermal AdS space is present, there is no kinetic path for the inverse process. For the Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point, the state switching processes between the small, the intermediate and the large Gauss-Bonnet black holes constitute a chemical reaction cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a formulation of Stochastic Inflation in full general relativity that goes beyond the slow-roll and separate universe approximations. We show how gauge invariant Langevin source terms can be obtained for the complete set of Einstein equations in their ADM formulation by providing a recipe for coarse-graining the spacetime in any small gauge. These stochastic source terms are defined in terms of the only dynamical scalar degree of freedom in single-field inflation and all depend simply on the first two time derivatives of the coarse-graining window function, on the gauge-invariant mode functions that satisfy the Mukhanov-Sasaki evolution equation, and on the slow-roll parameters. It is shown that this reasoning can also be applied to include gravitons as stochastic sources, thus enabling the study of all relevant degrees of freedom of general relativity for inflation. We validate the efficacy of these Langevin dynamics directly using an example in uniform field gauge, obtaining the stochastic e-fold number in the long wavelength limit without the need for a first-passage-time analysis. As well as investigating the most commonly used gauges in cosmological perturbation theory, we also derive stochastic source terms for the coarse-grained BSSN formulation of Einstein's equations, which enables a well-posed implementation for 3+1 numerical relativity simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling in the early universe: Stable magnetic monopoles from metastable cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel mechanism for producing topologically stable monopoles (TSMs) from the quantum mechanical decay of metastable cosmic strings in the early universe. In an $SO(10)$ model this mechanism yields TSMs that carry two units ($4\pi/e$) of Dirac magnetic charge as well as some color magnetic charge which is screened. For a dimensionless string tension parameter $G\mu \approx 10^{-9} - 10^{-5}$, the monopoles are superheavy with masses of order $10^{15} - 10^{17}$ GeV. Monopoles with masses of order $10^8 - 10^{14}$ GeV arise from metastable strings for $G\mu$ values from $\sim 10^{-22}$ to $10^{-10}$. We identify the parameter space for producing these monopoles at an observable level with detectors such as IceCube and KM3NeT. For lower $G\mu$ values the ultra-relativistic monopoles should be detectable at Pierre Auger and ANITA. The stochastic gravitational wave emission arises from metastable strings with $G\mu\sim 10^{-9}-10^{-5}$ and should be accessible at HLVK and future detectors including the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. An $E_6$ extension based on this framework would yield TSMs from the quantum mechanical decay of metastable strings that carry three units ($6\pi/e$) of Dirac magnetic charge.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature in a model with manifest confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple lattice evidences support the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover at Tch ~ 155 MeV. This regime is characterised by an approximate chiral spin symmetry of the partition function, which is a symmetry of the colour charge and the confining electric part of the QCD Lagrangian. It is traditionally believed that confinement should automatically induce spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which would preclude the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD at high temperatures. We employ a well-known solvable quark model for QCD in 3+1 dimensions that is chirally symmetric and manifestly confining and argue that while confinement indeed induces dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, a chiral restoration phase transition takes place at some critical temperature Tch. Above this temperature, the spectrum of the model consists of chirally symmetric hadrons with approximate chiral spin symmetry.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the CERN-NA63 radiation reaction data set, assuming the Rindler bath is composed of microscopic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we examine the Unruh-thermalized CERN-NA63 radiation reaction data set from the point of view of a diphoton Rindler bath. Under the assumption that these Hawking-Unruh diphoton pairs are microscopic trans-Planckian black holes, we find the resultant heat capacity describes the measured energy spectrum and is thus a dual description of the data set. Then, employing an n-dimensional Stefan-Boltzmann analysis, we find the power radiated by a black hole in the standard 3+1 spacetime dimensions in complete agreement with the data. Finally, we utilize this power spectrum to directly measure Newtons constant of gravitation.</description>

      <title>Coupled $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the coupled instanton equations for a metric, a spinor, a three-form, and a connection on a bundle, over a spin manifold. Special solutions in dimensions $6$ and $7$ arise, respectively, from the Hull--Strominger and the heterotic $\operatorname{G}_2$ system. The equations are motivated by recent developments in theoretical physics and can be recast using generalized geometry; we investigate how coupled instantons relate to generalized Ricci-flat metrics and also to Killing spinors on a Courant algebroid. We present two open questions regarding how these different geometric conditions are intertwined, for which a positive answer is expected from recent developments in the physics literature by De la Ossa, Larfors and Svanes, and in the mathematics literature on Calabi--Yau manifolds, in recent work by the second-named author with Gonz\'alez Molina. We give a complete solution to the first of these problems, providing a new method for the construction of instantons in arbitrary dimensions. For $\operatorname{G}_2$-structures with torsion coupled to $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons, in dimension $7$, we also establish results around the second problem. The last part of the present work carefully studies the approximate solutions to the heterotic $\operatorname{G}_2$-system constructed by the third and fourth authors on contact Calabi--Yau $7$-manifolds, for which we prove the existence of approximate coupled $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons and generalized Ricci-flat metrics.</description>

      <title>Analysis of anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the model put forth by Ref. [1], in which it is claimed that "post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has three basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, and (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics, and (iii) the spectrum of fluctuations is very different from observations.</description>
