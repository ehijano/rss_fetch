      <title>Responsible Discovery in Astrobiology: Lessons from Four Controversial Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines four case studies of life-detection claims in astrobiology, covering both biosignatures and technosignatures: the 1877 "canals" on Mars, the 1976 Mars Viking landers experiments, the 2020 phosphine detection on Venus, and the 2020 Breakthrough Listen Candidate 1 (BLC1) signal. We analyse the process of discovery for each case, including how they were detected, the media reception, the ensuing scientific debate, the correction processes, and the time it took until an expert consensus was reached. We identify lessons learned while providing scientists, the scientific community, and science communicators with recommendations for approaching future claims of astrobiological discoveries. To avoid potential cognitive biases and mitigate premature conclusions, we stress the need for clear communication of uncertainties, as well as thorough debate and verification processes among the scientific community. These responsible approaches can strengthen the credibility of scientists, cultivate a supportive scientific community, and help astrobiology flourish as a field.</description>

      <title>Physical Analysis of a Reported Missile - "Orb" Interaction in 2024: Momentum Constraints, Atmospheric Drag, Sensor Artifacts, and Theoretical Caution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A widely circulated infrared video from 2024 appears to show an air-to-surface missile engaging a small luminous "orb"-like object, producing debris and an apparent deflection of the missile's trajectory. This paper presents a comprehensive physics-based analysis of the event. Using classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, and imaging-system geometry, we examine momentum transfer, debris behavior, gimbal-induced optical distortions, and the physical plausibility of various interpretations. A balloon-like object remains the most conservative explanation compatible with known physics. However, modern physics is incomplete: the extreme weakness of gravity relative to the gauge forces, the existence of dark matter, dark energy, neutrino masses, and the possibility of extra spatial dimensions indicate that the Standard Model is not the final description of nature. For this reason, anomalous observations should not be dismissed outright as "impossible". Nevertheless, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the present video lacks the multi-sensor, verified, and calibrated data required to support exotic interpretations. The aim is a balanced scientific evaluation based on current knowledge while maintaining appropriate theoretical humility.</description>
