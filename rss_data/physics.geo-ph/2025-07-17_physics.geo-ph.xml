      <title>Assessing the economic benefits of space weather mitigation investment decisions: Evidence from Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space weather events pose a growing threat to modern economies, yet their macroeconomic consequences still remain underexplored. This study presents the first dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa New Zealand, quantifying potential GDP losses across seven disruption and mitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary focus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) on the electrical power transmission network. The goal is to support decision-making around space weather mitigation investments by providing a first-order approximation of their potential economic benefits. We find that in the absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to NZ\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading supply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding NZ\$3 billion. Importantly, research-led operational strategies, such as optimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\$370 million in losses for as little as NZ\$500,000 in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of 740 to 1. Moreover, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices further reduce disruption to as low as NZ\$1.12 billion, with avoided GDP losses up to NZ\$2.3 billion, and benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1. When also acknowledging unmodelled impacts, including multi-billion losses in capital equipment and long-term revenue, the economic rationale for pre-emptive mitigation becomes even more pertinent. Future research needs to integrate the modelling of capital and revenue losses for strategically important industrial facilities.</description>

      <title>Slip-tendency analysis of a potential CO2 storage site in the central German North Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground CO2 storage operations may lead to induced seismicity, which can be partially related to nearby affected faults. Considering the storage potential in the Middle Buntsandstein sandstone formation on the West Schleswig Block within the German North Sea, we investigate the reactivation and seismicity potential of existing faults in the vicinity of a selected study area. For this, we develop a 3D fault data set based on roughly 80 2D seismic lines, combining 60 years of exploration history. Contextual details regarding the geological features and the lithological description of the area are presented. Using the fault data set and the present-day stress tensors derived through spatial interpolation of the 3D numerical stress model of Germany, a slip-tendency analysis is performed to assess the susceptibility of existing faults to reactivation and reveal critical focal mechanisms, which are important for further wave propagation simulation. Furthermore, we extend the procedure to estimate the sustainable pore pressure window and the potential moment magnitude in the event of a reactivation. The results show that the NW/SE and NNW/SSE-oriented faults exhibit a higher slip tendency. Among these faults, those with a combination of above-average slip tendency and potential moment magnitude are identified and discussed.</description>

      <title>Effect of complex orography on numerical simulations of a downburst event in Spain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercells, characterized by their deep, persistent mesocyclones, are among the most severe convective weather systems, often associated with large hail, damaging winds, and significant societal impacts. Accurately simulating these events is essential for improving forecasting capabilities. This study evaluates the performance of two different nested strategies of the HARMONIE-AROME model in simulating a severe supercell outbreak over eastern Iberia on July 31, 2015, where at least six confirmed supercells were reported, producing large hail and significant damage. The configurations include H500_NESTED, a two-step one-way nested approach with a parent domain at 2.5 km resolution and a nested domain at 500 m resolution, and H500, a single-domain simulation at 500 m resolution. The simulated reflectivity is validated against OPERA radar data, while precipitation and temperature outputs are compared to observations from weather stations. Key convective parameters, derived from the Murcia radiosonde, are analyzed to assess the pre-convective environment. Results show that both configurations adequately capture the overall structure of the supercell event, with H500_NESTED offering marginally improved representations of reflectivity and thermodynamic variables. However, these improvements do not justify the 30% higher computational cost of the nested approach. The H500 simulation emerges as a more efficient option, providing comparable results at a lower cost.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Linear Model (PILM): Analytical Representations and Application to Crustal Strain Rate Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many physical systems are described by partial differential equations (PDEs), and solving these equations and estimating their coefficients or boundary conditions (BCs) from observational data play a crucial role in understanding the associated phenomena. Recently, a machine learning approach known as physics-informed neural network, which solves PDEs using neural networks by minimizing the sum of residuals from the PDEs, BCs, and data, has gained significant attention in the scientific community. In this study, we investigate a physics-informed linear model (PILM) that uses linear combinations of basis functions to represent solutions, thereby enabling an analytical representation of optimal solutions. The PILM was formulated and verified for illustrative forward and inverse problems including cases with uncertain BCs. Furthermore, the PILM was applied to estimate crustal strain rates using geodetic data. Specifically, physical regularization that enforces elastic equilibrium on the velocity fields was compared with mathematical regularization that imposes smoothness constraints. From a Bayesian perspective, mathematical regularization exhibited superior performance. The PILM provides an analytically solvable framework applicable to linear forward and inverse problems, underdetermined systems, and physical regularization.</description>
