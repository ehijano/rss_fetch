      <title>New Coevolution Dynamic as an Optimization Strategy in Group Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In society, it is common to face problems that require collaboration with other people, from everyday challenges to complex tasks, such as group projects at work. In this context, the search for more effective problem-solving strategies becomes a topic of great interest. This paper presents a new dynamic that integrates coevolution into the NK model together with an Erd\"os-R\'enyi random network, allowing more than one neighbor update. We explore how this coevolution can be employed as an optimization strategy for solving group problems. In recent coevolution models, only one agent is removed and another is added to the neighborhood of influence. Here, we allow $L$ agents to be changed, which had a large impact on the system performance. In the analysis of the results, we consider rewiring as a way for the target agent to obtain information from individuals or groups that were not part of its neighborhood. Our simulations demonstrate that coevolution can produces gain on the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Stunned by Sleeping Beauty: How Prince Probability updates his forecast upon their fateful encounter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sleeping Beauty problem is a puzzle in probability theory that has gained much attention since Elga's discussion of it [Elga, Adam, Analysis 60 (2), p.143-147 (2000)]. Sleeping Beauty is put asleep, and a coin is tossed. If the outcome of the coin toss is Tails, Sleeping Beauty is woken up on Monday, put asleep again and woken up again on Tuesday (with no recollection of having woken up on Monday). If the outcome is Heads, Sleeping Beauty is woken up on Monday only. Each time Sleeping Beauty is woken up, she is asked what her belief is that the outcome was Heads. What should Sleeping Beauty reply? In literature arguments have been given for both 1/3 and 1/2 as the correct answer. In this short note we argue using simple Bayesian probability theory why 1/3 is the right answer, and not 1/2. Briefly, when Sleeping Beauty awakens, her being awake is nontrivial extra information that leads her to update her beliefs about Heads to 1/3. We strengthen our claim by considering an additional observer, Prince Probability, who may or may not meet Sleeping Beauty. If he meets Sleeping Beauty while she is awake, he lowers his credence in Heads to 1/3. We also briefly consider the credence in Heads of a Sleeping Beauty who knows that she is dreaming (and thus asleep).</description>

      <title>The News Comment Gap and Algorithmic Agenda Setting in Online Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disparity between news stories valued by journalists and those preferred by readers, known as the "News Gap", is well-documented. However, the difference in expectations regarding news related user-generated content is less studied. Comment sections, hosted by news websites, are popular venues for reader engagement, yet still subject to editorial decisions. It is thus important to understand journalist vs reader comment preferences and how these are served by various comment ranking algorithms that represent discussions differently. We analyse 1.2 million comments from Austrian newspaper Der Standard to understand the "News Comment Gap" and the effects of different ranking algorithms. We find that journalists prefer positive, timely, complex, direct responses, while readers favour comments similar to article content from elite authors. We introduce the versatile Feature-Oriented Ranking Utility Metric (FORUM) to assess the impact of different ranking algorithms and find dramatic differences in how they prioritise the display of comments by sentiment, topical relevance, lexical diversity, and readability. Journalists can exert substantial influence over the discourse through both curatorial and algorithmic means. Understanding these choices' implications is vital in fostering engaging and civil discussions while aligning with journalistic objectives, especially given the increasing legal scrutiny and societal importance of online discourse.</description>

      <title>Behavioral and Topological Heterogeneities in Network Versions of Schelling's Segregation Model</title>

Abstract: Agent-based models of residential segregation have been of persistent interest to various research communities since their origin with James Sakoda and popularization by Thomas Schelling. Frequently, these models have sought to elucidate the extent to which the collective dynamics of individual preferences may cause segregation to emerge. This open question has sustained relevance in U.S. jurisprudence. Previous investigation of heterogeneity of behaviors (preferences) by Xie &amp; Zhou has shown reductions in segregation. Meanwhile, previous investigation of heterogeneity of social network topologies by Gandica, Gargiulo, and Carletti has shown no significant impact to observed segregation levels. In the present study, we examined effects of the concurrent presence of both behavioral and topological heterogeneities in network segregation models. Simulations were conducted using both Schelling's and Xie &amp; Zhou's preference models on 2D lattices with varied levels of densification to create topological heterogeneities (i.e., clusters, hubs). Results show a richer variety of outcomes, including novel differences in resultant segregation levels and hub composition. Notably, with concurrent increased representations of heterogeneous preferences and heterogenous topologies, reduced levels of segregation emerge. Simultaneously, we observe a novel dynamic of segregation between tolerance levels as highly tolerant nodes take residence in dense areas and push intolerant nodes to sparse areas mimicking the urban-rural divide.</description>

      <title>Detectability of hierarchical communities in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.07525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of recovering a planted hierarchy of partitions in a network. The detectability of a single planted partition has previously been analysed in detail and a phase transition has been identified below which the partition cannot be detected. Here we show that, in the hierarchical setting, there exist additional phases in which the presence of multiple consistent partitions can either help or hinder detection. Accordingly, the detectability limit for non-hierarchical partitions typically provides insufficient information about the detectability of the complete hierarchical structure, as we highlight with several constructive examples.</description>

      <title>A Model for Economic Freedom on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The momentum of human spaceflight initiatives continues to build toward Mars, and technological advances may eventually enable the potential for permanent space settlement. Aspirations for sustaining human life in space must be predicated on human factors, rather than technological constraints alone, and advances in models of governance and ethics are necessary as human civilization becomes a spacefaring species. This paper presents an idealistic but feasible model for economic freedom on Mars, which is situated within a framework in which Mars has been designated as a sovereign juridical peer to Earth. Under such conditions, Mars could maintain monetary stability through full reserve banking and a restriction on exchange with any fractional reserve Earth currencies, with a volume of circulating currency that changes based on the total population within fixed capacity infrastructure. Mars could maintain long-term political stability by diffusing the ownership of capital on Mars, which would allow all citizens of Mars to draw sufficient wealth from a combination of capital ownership and labor to live a good life. This model could also support limited tourism on Mars, in which real goods are exchanged for services but currency transactions between planets are prohibited. This model demonstrates the potential for a viable and sustainable economy on Mars that could conceivably be implemented, including on a sovereign Mars but also in other scenarios of space settlement. More broadly, this model illustrates that ideas such as diffuse capital ownership and limited government can enable freedom in space, and numerous models beyond a centralized world space agency should be explored to ensure the optimal governance of the emerging space economy.</description>
