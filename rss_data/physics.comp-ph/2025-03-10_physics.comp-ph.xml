      <title>A note on the lattice momentum balance in the lattice Boltzmann interaction-framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show how the exploitation of the lattice momentum balance condition allows to envisage an analytical procedure to define the lattice pressure tensor (LPT) for the multi-phase Shan-Chen (SC) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) with single-range potential. This construction ensures that the LPT normal component to a flat interface is constant to machine precision on each lattice node, i.e., it exactly implements the mechanical equilibrium condition on the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of the approach by providing analytical expressions for the coexistence curves for different choices of the pseudo-potential and forcing schemes in the SC-LBM. This paper offers a novel, rigorous perspective for controlling the LPT in the SC-LBM, paving the way for its application in more general settings.</description>

      <title>An implicit shock tracking method for simulation of shock-dominated flows over complex domains using mesh-based parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mesh-based parametrization is a parametrization of a geometric object that is defined solely from a mesh of the object, e.g., without an analytical expression or computer-aided design (CAD) representation of the object. In this work, we propose a mesh-based parametrization of an arbitrary $d'$-dimensional object embedded in a $d$-dimensional space using tools from high-order finite elements. Using mesh-based parametrizations, we construct a boundary-preserving parametrization of the nodal coordinates of a computational mesh that ensures all nodes remain on all their original boundaries. These boundary-preseving parametrizations allow the nodes of the mesh to move only in ways that will not change the computational domain. They also ensure nodes will not move between boundaries, which would cause issues assigning boundary conditions for partial differential equation simulations and lead to inaccurate geometry representations for non-smooth boundary transitions. Finally, we integrate boundary-preserving, mesh-based parametrizations into high-order implicit shock tracking, an optimization-based discontinuous Galerkin method that moves nodes to align mesh faces with non-smooth flow features to represent them perfectly with inter-element jumps, leaving the intra-element polynomial basis to represent smooth regions of the flow with high-order accuracy. Mesh-based parametrizations enable implicit shock tracking simulations of shock-dominated flows over geometries without simple analytical parametrizations. Several demonstrations of mesh-based parametrizations are provided.</description>

      <title>Global physics-informed neural networks (GPINNs): from local point-wise constraint to global nodal association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their variants have gained significant popularity as a scientific computing method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), whereas accuracy is still its main shortcoming. Despite numerous development efforts, there is no literature demonstrating that these methods surpass classic numerical algorithms in solving the forward issue. In this paper, by analyzing the disparities between PINNs and traditional numerical methods based on mesh discretization, we investigate the underlying causes for the in adequate precision of PINNs and introduce a novel approach named global physics-informed neural networks (GPINNs). Inspired by the crucial concept of global nodal association in conventional numerical algorithms, GPINNs leverages the prior field distribution information from pre-trained PINNs to estimate the association weights between arbitrary nodes in space. GPINNs can not only be regarded as a meshless approach but also be demonstrated, both theoretically and in practical circumstances, to have the ability of second-order convergence when trained with equidistant nodes. Overall, GPINNs may be seen as an ideal approach to inheriting the merits of scientific machine learning (SciML) and conventional numerical computing, which also represent the first SciML algorithm to surpass standard numerical methods in terms of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Wave-Particle Based Multiscale Modeling and Simulation of Non-equilibrium Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for the direct numerical modeling and simulation of turbulent flows. The kinetic model equation is firstly extended to turbulent flow with the account of coupled evolution of kinetic, thermal, and turbulent energy. Based on the kinetic model, a unified framework for the laminar and turbulent flow is constructed through wave-particle decomposition, following the coupled evolution of wave and particles. The modeling is based on the assumption that the turbulence emergence is attributed to the breakdown of continuously connected fluid elements under the cell resolution. Then, the non-equilibrium transport of discrete fluid elements carrying the turbulent kinetic energy is constructed by the particle movement. The model leverages a hybrid wave-particle representation, where wave dynamics governed by the Navier-Stokes equations provide a background flow structure, while particle transport is driven by the unresolved turbulent dynamics. Particle non-equilibrium trajectory crossing, collision, and interaction with the background wave, distinguish the current model from conventional RANS and LES methodologies for the turbulent flow simulation. Instead of the dissipation model constructed in the mixing length theory, the present model presents a upgrading non-equilibrium transport model with particle penetration and collision. The transition between laminar and turbulent states is determined by the particle density in the wave-particle decomposition inside each cell. Emphasizing genuine non-equilibrium particle transport, the proposed multiscale method demonstrates enhanced accuracy for capturing the turbulent flow, where the Reynolds stress can be directly obtained from the flow field in the study of compressible mixing layer. This work offers a versatile tool for turbulence research with potential applications in aerospace, energy systems, etc.</description>

      <title>Learning conformational ensembles of proteins based on backbone geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been proposed for sampling protein conformations from the Boltzmann distribution, as an alternative to often prohibitively expensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on fine-tuning pre-trained folding models and evolutionary sequence information, limiting their applicability and efficiency, and introducing potential biases. In this work, we propose a flow matching model for sampling protein conformations based solely on backbone geometry. We introduce a geometric encoding of the backbone equilibrium structure as input and propose to condition not only the flow but also the prior distribution on the respective equilibrium structure, eliminating the need for evolutionary information. The resulting model is orders of magnitudes faster than current state-of-the-art approaches at comparable accuracy and can be trained from scratch in a few GPU days. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, across not only an established benchmark of naturally occurring proteins but also de novo proteins, for which evolutionary information is scarce.</description>

      <title>A Materials Foundation Model via Hybrid Invariant-Equivariant Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials foundation models can predict energy, force, and stress of materials and enable a wide range of downstream discovery tasks. A key design choice involves the trade-off between invariant and equivariant architectures. Invariant models offer computational efficiency but may not perform well when predicting high-order outputs. In contrast, equivariant models can capture high-order symmetries, but are computationally expensive. In this work, we propose HIENet, a hybrid invariant-equivariant foundation model that integrates both invariant and equivariant message passing layers. HIENet is designed to achieve superior performance with considerable computational speedups over prior models. Experimental results on both common benchmarks and downstream materials discovery tasks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of HIENet.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Regional Cooling Demand Prediction with Optimised Dataset Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of global warming, even relatively cooler countries like the UK are experiencing a rise in cooling demand, particularly in southern regions such as London. This growing demand, especially during the summer months, presents significant challenges for energy management systems. Accurately predicting cooling demand in urban domestic buildings is essential for maintaining energy efficiency. This study introduces a generalised framework for developing high-resolution Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks using physical model-based summer cooling demand data. To maximise the predictive capability and generalisation ability of the models under limited data scenarios, four distinct data partitioning strategies were implemented, including the extrapolation, month-based interpolation, global interpolation, and day-based interpolation. Bayesian Optimisation (BO) was then applied to fine-tune the hyper-parameters, substantially improving the framework predictive accuracy. Results show that the day-based interpolation GRU model demonstrated the best performance due to its ability to retain both the data randomness and the time sequence continuity characteristics. This optimal model achieves a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.22%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.87%, and a coefficient of determination (R square) of 0.9386 on the test set. The generalisation ability of this framework was further evaluated by forecasting.</description>

      <title>Tensor Learning and Compression of N-phonon Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon interactions from lattice anharmonicity govern thermal properties and heat transport in materials. These interactions are described by $n$-th order interatomic force constants ($n$-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of $n$ atoms, or equivalently encoding $n$-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress $n$-IFCs for arbitrary order $n$. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of $n$-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem.Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed $n$-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with &gt;98\% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, and TiNiSn). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.</description>

      <title>SODAs: Sparse Optimization for the Discovery of Differential and Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) integrate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with algebraic constraints, providing a fundamental framework for developing models of dynamical systems characterized by timescale separation, conservation laws, and physical constraints. While sparse optimization has revolutionized model development by allowing data-driven discovery of parsimonious models from a library of possible equations, existing approaches for dynamical systems assume DAEs can be reduced to ODEs by eliminating variables before model discovery. This assumption limits the applicability of such methods to DAE systems with unknown constraints and time scales. We introduce Sparse Optimization for Differential-Algebraic Systems (SODAs), a data-driven method for the identification of DAEs in their explicit form. By discovering the algebraic and dynamic components sequentially without prior identification of the algebraic variables, this approach leads to a sequence of convex optimization problems and has the advantage of discovering interpretable models that preserve the structure of the underlying physical system. To this end, SODAs improves numerical stability when handling high correlations between library terms -- caused by near-perfect algebraic relationships -- by iteratively refining the conditioning of the candidate library. We demonstrate the performance of our method on biological, mechanical, and electrical systems, showcasing its robustness to noise in both simulated time series and real-time experimental data.</description>

      <title>Learning and discovering multiple solutions using physics-informed neural networks with random initialization and deep ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the capability of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to discover multiple solutions. Many real-world phenomena governed by nonlinear differential equations (DEs), such as fluid flow, exhibit multiple solutions under the same conditions, yet capturing this solution multiplicity remains a significant challenge. A key difficulty is giving appropriate initial conditions or initial guesses, to which the widely used time-marching schemes and Newton's iteration method are very sensitive in finding solutions for complex computational problems. While machine learning models, particularly PINNs, have shown promise in solving DEs, their ability to capture multiple solutions remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple and practical approach using PINNs to learn and discover multiple solutions. We first reveal that PINNs, when combined with random initialization and deep ensemble method -- originally developed for uncertainty quantification -- can effectively uncover multiple solutions to nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). Our approach highlights the critical role of initialization in shaping solution diversity, addressing an often-overlooked aspect of machine learning for scientific computing. Furthermore, we propose utilizing PINN-generated solutions as initial conditions or initial guesses for conventional numerical solvers to enhance accuracy and efficiency in capturing multiple solutions. Extensive numerical experiments, including the Allen-Cahn equation and cavity flow, where our approach successfully identifies both stable and unstable solutions, validate the effectiveness of our method. These findings establish a general and efficient framework for addressing solution multiplicity in nonlinear differential equations.</description>

      <title>Understanding the role of autoencoders for stiff dynamical systems using information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the information theory, this study provides insights into how the construction of latent space of autoencoder (AE) using deep neural network (DNN) training finds a smooth low-dimensional manifold in the stiff dynamical system. Our recent study [1] reported that an autoencoder (AE) combined with neural ODE (NODE) as a surrogate reduced order model (ROM) for the integration of stiff chemically reacting systems led to a significant reduction in the temporal stiffness, and the behavior was attributed to the identification of a slow invariant manifold by the nonlinear projection of the AE. The present work offers fundamental understanding of the mechanism by employing concepts from information theory and better mixing. The learning mechanism of both the encoder and decoder are explained by plotting the evolution of mutual information and identifying two different phases. Subsequently, the density distribution is plotted for the physical and latent variables, which shows the transformation of the \emph{rare event} in the physical space to a \emph{highly likely} (more probable) event in the latent space provided by the nonlinear autoencoder. Finally, the nonlinear transformation leading to density redistribution is explained using concepts from information theory and probability.</description>

      <title>Efficient single-precision simulations of nematohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of nematohydrodynamics on graphics processing units (GPUs) are typically performed using double precision, which ensures accuracy but significantly increases computational cost. However, consumer-grade GPUs are optimized for single-precision calculations, making double-precision simulations inefficient on widely available hardware. In this work, we demonstrate that single-precision simulations can achieve the same accuracy as double-precision methods while delivering a 27-fold increase in computational speed. To achieve this, we introduce two key improvements: (i) the shifted distribution function in the lattice Boltzmann method, which mitigates precision loss at low velocities, and (ii) the use of larger time steps in the finite-difference solver, which reduces numerical errors and improves overall accuracy. We find that, unlike in double precision, accuracy in single-precision simulations follows a non-monotonic trend with respect to the finite-difference time step, revealing an optimal regime for precise computations. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we simulate the dynamics of single and multiple skyrmionic tubes in Poiseuille flow. Our results confirm that optimized single-precision simulations enable fast and accurate modeling of complex nematohydrodynamic systems, making large-scale simulations feasible on standard gaming GPUs.</description>

Abstract: Volterra integral and integro-differential equations have been extensively studied in both pure mathematics and applied science. In one direction, developments in analysis have yielded far-ranging existence, uniqueness, and regularity results. In the other, applications in science have inspired a substantial library of practical techniques to deal with such equations.
  The present work connects these research areas by examining five large classes of linear Volterra equations: integral and integro-differential equations with completely monotone (CM) kernels, corresponding to linear viscoelastic models; those with positive definite (PD) kernels, corresponding to partially-observed quantum systems; difference equations with PD kernels; a class of generalized delay differential equations; and a class of generalized fractional differential equations. We develop a system of correspondences between these problems, showing that all five can be understood within the same, spectral theory. We leverage this theory to recover practical, closed-form solutions of all five classes, and we show that interconversion yields a natural, continuous involution within each class. Our work unifies several results from science: the interconversion formula of Gross, recent results in viscoelasticity and operator theory for integral equations of the second type, classical formulas for Prony series and fractional differential equations, and the convergence of Prony series to CM kernels. Finally, our theory yields a novel, geometric construction of the regularized Hilbert transform, extends it to a wide class of infinite measures, and reveals a natural connection to delay and fractional differential equations.
  We leverage our theory to develop a powerful, spectral method to handle scalar Volterra equations numerically, and illustrate it with a number of practical examples.</description>

      <title>PIED: Physics-Informed Experimental Design for Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: In many science and engineering settings, system dynamics are characterized by governing PDEs, and a major challenge is to solve inverse problems (IPs) where unknown PDE parameters are inferred based on observational data gathered under limited budget. Due to the high costs of setting up and running experiments, experimental design (ED) is often done with the help of PDE simulations to optimize for the most informative design parameters to solve such IPs, prior to actual data collection. This process of optimizing design parameters is especially critical when the budget and other practical constraints make it infeasible to adjust the design parameters between trials during the experiments. However, existing experimental design (ED) methods tend to require sequential and frequent design parameter adjustments between trials. Furthermore, they also have significant computational bottlenecks due to the need for complex numerical simulations for PDEs, and do not exploit the advantages provided by physics informed neural networks (PINNs), such as its meshless solutions, differentiability, and amortized training. This work presents PIED, the first ED framework that makes use of PINNs in a fully differentiable architecture to perform continuous optimization of design parameters for IPs for one-shot deployments. PIED overcomes existing methods' computational bottlenecks through parallelized computation and meta-learning of PINN parameter initialization, and proposes novel methods to effectively take into account PINN training dynamics in optimizing the ED parameters. Through experiments based on noisy simulated data and even real world experimental data, we empirically show that given limited observation budget, PIED significantly outperforms existing ED methods in solving IPs, including challenging settings where the inverse parameters are unknown functions rather than just finite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>First-principles investigation of Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$: unveiling their potential for hydrogen storage through mechanical and optoelectronic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uses the density functional theory (DFT) approach with GGA-PBE to assess the effect of substituting alkali metals in Rb$_{2}$CaH and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ on their hydrogen storage potential. To address the challenges associated with predicting accurate electronic properties in materials containing heavier elements such as cesium, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects have been incorporated into our calculations. The mechanical robustness of both Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$, as demonstrated by their mechanical properties, highlights these materials as promising candidates due to their stability in hydrogen storage applications. Anisotropic factors show that all materials exhibit anisotropy, suggesting a directional dependency in their properties. The Pugh ratio indicates that Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ are brittle materials. Based on the calculated band gap, the electronic band structure analysis, conducted using both HSE06 and GGA-PBE, shows that Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ are wide-bandgap materials. Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ exhibit the highest optical conductivity, absorption coefficient, and energy loss function among optoelectronic materials, emphasizing their superior absorption and electron transfer capabilities. The hydrogen storage capacity has been evaluated for practical applications; Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ and Cs-doped Rb$_{2}$CaH$_{4}$ show the highest gravimetric and volumetric capacities.</description>

      <title>Metastable Monolayer Formation through a Connector Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intentional growth of metastable surface structures of organic molecules adsorbed on inorganic substrates is a challenging task. It is usually unclear which kinetic mechanism leads to the metastable surface polymorph after a deposition experiment. In this work we investigate a growth procedure that allows to intentionally grow a defined metastable surface structure starting from thermodynamic equilibrium. This procedure is applicable to organic-inorganic interface systems that exhibit a thermodynamically stable connector structure that can be exploited to grow the metastable target structure. With specific temperature and pressure changes in the system a significant yield of the target polymorph can be achieved. We demonstrate this procedure on a simplified microscopic interface system of rectangular molecules adsorbing on a square lattice substrate with kinetic Monte Carlo growth simulations.</description>

      <title>Hardware acceleration for next-to-leading order event generation within MadGraph5_aMC@NLO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the quality of experimental measurements increases, so does the need for Monte Carlo-generated simulated events - both with respect to the total amount and to their precision. In perturbative methods, this involves the evaluation of higher order corrections to the leading order (LO) scattering amplitudes, including real emissions and loop corrections. Although experimental uncertainties today are larger than those of simulations, at the High Luminosity LHC experimental precision is expected to be above the theoretical one for events generated below next-to-leading order (NLO) precision. As forecasted hardware resources will not meet CPU requirements for these simulation needs, speeding up NLO event generation is a necessity.
  In recent years, collaborators across Europe and the United States have been working on CPU vectorisation of LO event generation within the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework, as well as porting it to GPUs, to major success. Recently, development has also started on vectorising NLO event generation. Due to the more complicated nature of NLO amplitudes this development faces several difficulties not accounted for in the LO development, but it shows promise. Here, we present these issues as well as the current status of our event-parallel NLO implementation.</description>

      <title>Implementation of full-potential screened spherical wave based muffin-tin orbital for all-electron density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Screened spherical wave (SSW) of the Hankel function features the complete, minimal and short-ranged basis set, presenting a compact representation for electronic systems. In this work, we report the implementation of full-potential (FP) SSW based tight-binding linearized Muffin-Tin orbital (TB-LMTO) for all-electron density functional theory (DFT), and provide extensive tests on the robustness of FP-TB-LMTO and its high accuracy for first-principles material simulation. Through the introduction of double augmentation, SSW based MTO is accurately represented on the double grids including the full-space uniform and dense radial grids. Based on the the double augmentation, the accurate computation of full charge density, full potential,complex integral in the interstitial region and the total energy are all effectively addressed to realize the FP-TB-LMTO for DFT self-consistent calculations. By calculating the total energy,band structure, phase ordering, and elastic constants for a wide variety of materials, including normal metals, compounds, and diamond silicon, we domenstrate the highly accurate numerical implemetation of FP-TB-LMTO for all-electron DFT in comparison with other well-established FP method. The implementation of FP-TB-LMTO based DFT offers an important tool for the accurate first-principles tight-binding electronic structure calculations, particular important for the large-scale or strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Hotspice, a Monte Carlo simulation software designed to capture the dynamics and equilibrium states of Artificial Spin Ice (ASI) systems with both in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) geometries. An Ising-like model is used where each nanomagnet is represented as a macrospin, with switching events driven by thermal fluctuations, magnetostatic interactions, and external fields. To improve simulation accuracy, we explore the impact of several corrections to this model, concerning for example the calculation of the dipole interaction in IP and OOP ASI, as well as the impact of allowing asymmetric rather than symmetric energy barriers between stable states. We validate these enhancements by comparing simulation results with experimental data for pinwheel and kagome ASI lattices, demonstrating how these corrections enable a more accurate simulation of the behavior of these systems. We finish with a demonstration of 'clocking' in pinwheel and OOP square ASI as an example of reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Repulsive interatomic potentials calculated at three levels of theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-energy repulsive interaction between nuclei at distances much smaller than the equilibrium bond length is the key quantity determining the nuclear stopping power and atom scattering in keV and MeV radiation events. This interaction is traditionally modeled within orbital-free density functional theory with frozen atomic electron densities, following the Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark (ZBL) model. In this work, we calculate atom pair specific repulsive interatomic potentials with the ZBL model, and compare them to two kinds of quantum chemical calculations - second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory in flexible Gaussian basis sets as well as density functional theory with numerical atomic orbital basis sets - which go well beyond the limitations in the ZBL model, allowing the density to relax in the calculations. We show that the repulsive interatomic potentials predicted by the two quantum chemical models agree within $\sim$ 1% for potential energies above 30 eV, while the ZBL pair-specific potentials and universal ZBL potentials differ much more from either of these calculations. We provide new pair-specific fits of the screening functions in terms of 3 exponentials to the calculations for all pairs $Z_1$-$Z_2$ for $1 \leq Z_i \leq 92$, and show that they agree within $\sim 2$% with the raw data. We use the new potentials to simulate ion implantation depth profiles in single crystalline Si and show very good agreement with experiment. However, we also show that under channeling conditions, the attractive part of the potential can affect the depth profiles. The full data sets of all the calculated interatomic potentials as well as analytic fits to the data are shared as open access.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new approach towards approximating the density-to-pair-density map based on copula theory from statistics. We extend the copula theory to multi-dimensional marginals, and deduce that one can describe any (exact or approximate) pair density by the single-particle density and a copula. We present analytical formulas for the exact copula in scaling limits, numerically compute the copula for dissociating systems with two to four particles in one dimension, and propose accurate approximations of the copula between equilibrium and dissociation for two-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Address Data Scarcity in Machine Learning: Applications in Graphene Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning in materials science faces challenges due to limited experimental data, as generating synthesis data is costly and time-consuming, especially with in-house experiments. Mining data from existing literature introduces issues like mixed data quality, inconsistent formats, and variations in reporting experimental parameters, complicating the creation of consistent features for the learning algorithm. Additionally, combining continuous and discrete features can hinder the learning process with limited data. Here, we propose strategies that utilize large language models (LLMs) to enhance machine learning performance on a limited, heterogeneous dataset of graphene chemical vapor deposition synthesis compiled from existing literature. These strategies include prompting modalities for imputing missing data points and leveraging large language model embeddings to encode the complex nomenclature of substrates reported in chemical vapor deposition experiments. The proposed strategies enhance graphene layer classification using a support vector machine (SVM) model, increasing binary classification accuracy from 39% to 65% and ternary accuracy from 52% to 72%. We compare the performance of the SVM and a GPT-4 model, both trained and fine-tuned on the same data. Our results demonstrate that the numerical classifier, when combined with LLM-driven data enhancements, outperforms the standalone LLM predictor, highlighting that in data-scarce scenarios, improving predictive learning with LLM strategies requires more than simple fine-tuning on datasets. Instead, it necessitates sophisticated approaches for data imputation and feature space homogenization to achieve optimal performance. The proposed strategies emphasize data enhancement techniques, offering a broadly applicable framework for improving machine learning performance on scarce, inhomogeneous datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Li$_2$ZrCl$_6$ (LZC) is a promising solid-state electrolyte due to its affordability, moisture stability, and high ionic conductivity. We computationally investigate the role of cation disorder in LZC and its effect on Li-ion transport by integrating thermodynamic and kinetic modeling. The results demonstrate that fast Li-ion conductivity requires Li/vacancy disorder, which is dependent on the degree of Zr disorder. The high temperature required to form equilibrium Zr-disorder precludes any equilibrium synthesis processes for achieving fast Li-ion conductivity, rationalizing why only non-equilibrium synthesis methods, such as ball milling, lead to good conductivity. Our simulations show that Zr disorder lowers the Li/vacancy order-disorder transition temperature, which is necessary for creating high Li diffusivity at room temperature. These insights raise a challenge for the large-scale production of these materials and the potential for the long-term stability of their properties.</description>

      <title>Modeling Realistic Dynamics of Nanoparticle Dimers for Magneto-Optical Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to optical matter often involve complex illumination fields with costly and unstable setups, requiring strong gradient forces, high-intensity laser spots that could harm samples, and substrate support. For binding, attractive inter-particle forces may not be sufficient to assemble systems due to unbalanced components such as centrifugal forces or collisions. In previous work, magneto-optical nanoparticles illuminated with two counter-propagating circularly polarized waves were optically bound under quasi-static conditions. However, the dynamics of such nano systems were not thoroughly considered. Here, a general framework to study magneto-optical (MO) matter is introduced, controllable by static magnetic fields. Dynamic binding between two n-doped InSb nanoparticles, which exhibit surface plasmons at THz frequencies, is recreated. Additionally, the reported examples may represent a novel approach of low-energy illumination sources without gradient components. This numerical framework, grounded in Langevin dynamics and realistic collision phenomena, serves as a robust and universal tool for exploring various optomechanical designs. The impact of thermal noise, collision types, initial conditions, and resonance excitation on a dimer system is examined. Dimers tuned initially at magneto-optical resonance can bind in stable, average positions even when particle-particle collisions are present. The current methodology provides essential knowledge for studying optical binding and the dynamics of any small-scale cluster of interacting sub-units.</description>

      <title>Learning Object Properties Using Robot Proprioception via Differentiable Robot-Object Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable simulation has become a powerful tool for system identification. While prior work has focused on identifying robot properties using robot-specific data or object properties using object-specific data, our approach calibrates object properties by using information from the robot, without relying on data from the object itself. Specifically, we utilize robot joint encoder information, which is commonly available in standard robotic systems. Our key observation is that by analyzing the robot's reactions to manipulated objects, we can infer properties of those objects, such as inertia and softness. Leveraging this insight, we develop differentiable simulations of robot-object interactions to inversely identify the properties of the manipulated objects. Our approach relies solely on proprioception -- the robot's internal sensing capabilities -- and does not require external measurement tools or vision-based tracking systems. This general method is applicable to any articulated robot and requires only joint position information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a low-cost robotic platform, achieving accurate mass and elastic modulus estimations of manipulated objects with just a few seconds of computation on a laptop.</description>

      <title>Smart navigation through a rotating barrier: Deep reinforcement learning with application to size-based separation of active microagents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ deep reinforcement learning methods to investigate shortest-time navigation strategies for smart active Brownian particles (microagents), which self-propel through a rotating potential barrier in a static, viscous, fluid background. The microagent's motion begins at a specified origin and terminates at a designated destination. The potential barrier is modeled as a localized, repulsive Gaussian potential with finite support, whose peak location rotates at a given angular velocity about a fixed center within the plane of motion. We use the Advantage Actor-Critic approach to train microagents for their origin-to-destination navigation through the barrier. By employing this approach, we demonstrate that the rotating potential (as opposed to a static one) enables size-based sorting and separation of the microagents. In other words, microagents of different radii arrive at the destination at sufficiently well-separated average times, facilitating their sorting. The efficiency of particle sorting is quantified by introducing specific separation measures. We also demonstrate how training the microagents in a noisy background, as opposed to a noise-free one, can improve the precision of their size-based sorting. Our findings suggest promising avenues for future research on smart active particles equipped with deep reinforcement learning to navigate complex environments, particularly in microscale applications.</description>

Abstract: This study evaluates metrics for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, correlation analysis, statistical tests, segmentation, and image-to-image (I2I) translation. Metrics were compared across Python libraries, R packages, and Matlab functions to assess their consistency and highlight discrepancies. The findings underscore the need for a unified roadmap to standardize metrics, ensuring reliable and reproducible ML evaluations across platforms. This study examined a wide range of evaluation metrics across various tasks and found only some to be consistent across platforms, such as (i) Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, Cohens Kappa, F-beta Score, MCC, Geometric Mean, AUC, and Log Loss in binary classification; (ii) Accuracy, Cohens Kappa, and F-beta Score in multi-class classification; (iii) MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, Explained Variance, Median AE, MSLE, and Huber in regression; (iv) Davies-Bouldin Index and Calinski-Harabasz Index in clustering; (v) Pearson, Spearman, Kendall's Tau, Mutual Information, Distance Correlation, Percbend, Shepherd, and Partial Correlation in correlation analysis; (vi) Paired t-test, Chi-Square Test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis Test, Shapiro-Wilk Test, Welchs t-test, and Bartlett's test in statistical tests; (vii) Accuracy, Precision, and Recall in 2D segmentation; (viii) Accuracy in 3D segmentation; (ix) MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-Squared in 2D-I2I translation; and (x) MAE, MSE, and RMSE in 3D-I2I translation. Given observation of discrepancies in a number of metrics (e.g. precision, recall and F1 score in binary classification, WCSS in clustering, multiple statistical tests, and IoU in segmentation, amongst multiple metrics), this study concludes that ML evaluation metrics require standardization and recommends that future research use consistent metrics for different tasks to effectively compare ML techniques and solutions.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>
