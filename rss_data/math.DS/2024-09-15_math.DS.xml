      <title>Multivariate mean equicontinuity for finite-to-one topomorphic extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we generalise the concept of topo-isomorphic extensions and define finite topomorphic extensions as topological dynamical systems whose factor map to the maximal equicontinuous factor is measure-theoretically at most $m$-to-one for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$. We further define multivariate versions of mean equicontinuity, complementing the notion of multivariate mean sensitivity introduced by Li, Ye and Yu, and then show that any $m$-to-one topomorphic extension is mean $(m+1)$-equicontinuous. This falls in line with the well-known result, due to Downarowicz and Glasner, that strictly ergodic systems are isomorphic extensions if and only if they are mean equicontinuous. While in the multivariate case we can only conjecture that the converse direction also holds, the result provides an indication that multivariate equicontinuity properties are strongly related to finite extension structures. For minimal systems, an Auslander-Yorke type dichotomy between multivariate mean equicontinuity and sensitivity is shown as well.</description>

      <title>Fixed point indices of iterates of orientation-reversing homeomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any sequence of integers satisfying necessary Dold's congruences is realized as the sequence of fixed point indices of the iterates of an orientation-reversing homeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ for $m\geq 3$. As an element of the construction of the above homeomorphism, we consider the class of boundary-preserving homeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^{m}_{+}$ and give the answer to [Problem 10.2, Topol. Methods Nonlinear Anal. 50 (2017), 643 - 667] providing a complete description of the forms of fixed point indices for this class of maps.</description>

      <title>Measure-Theoretic Time-Delay Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Takens' embedding theorem provides a theoretical foundation for reconstructing the full state of a dynamical system from partial observations. However, the classical theorem assumes that the underlying system is deterministic and that observations are noise-free, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we rigorously establish a measure-theoretic generalization that adopts an Eulerian description of the dynamics and recasts the embedding as a pushforward map between probability spaces. Our mathematical results leverage recent advances in optimal transportation theory. Building on our novel measure-theoretic time-delay embedding theory, we have developed a new computational framework that forecasts the full state of a dynamical system from time-lagged partial observations, engineered with better robustness to handle sparse and noisy data. We showcase the efficacy and versatility of our approach through several numerical examples, ranging from the classic Lorenz-63 system to large-scale, real-world applications such as NOAA sea surface temperature forecasting and ERA5 wind field reconstruction.</description>

      <title>A curious dynamical system in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any irrational $\alpha &gt; 0$ and any initial value $z_{-1} \in \mathbb{C}$, we define a sequence of complex numbers $(z_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ as follows: $z_n$ is $z_{n-1} + e^{2 \pi i \alpha n}$ or $z_{n-1} - e^{2 \pi i \alpha n}$, whichever has the smaller absolute value. If both numbers have the same absolute value, the sequence terminates at $z_{n-1}$ but this happens rarely. This dynamical system has astonishingly intricate behavior: the choice of signs in $z_{n-1} \pm e^{2 \pi i \alpha n}$ appears to eventually become periodic (though the period can be large). We prove that if one observes periodic signs for a sufficiently long time (depending on $z_{-1}, \alpha$), the signs remain periodic for all time. The surprising complexity of the system is illustrated through examples.</description>

      <title>Shifts of Finite Type Obtained by Forbidding a Single Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite word $w$, Guibas and Odlyzko (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 30, 1981, 183-208) showed that the autocorrelation polynomial $\phi_w(t)$ of $w$, which records the set of self-overlaps of $w$, explicitly determines for each $n$, the number $|B_n(w)|$ of words of length $n$ that avoid $w$. We consider this and related problems from the viewpoint of symbolic dynamics, focusing on the setting of $X_{\{w\}}$, the space of all bi-infinite sequences that avoid $w$. We first summarize and elaborate upon (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 30, 1981, 183-208) and other work to show that the sequence $|B_n(w)|$ is equivalent to several invariants of $X_{\{w\}}$. We then give a finite-state labeled graphical representation $L_w$ of $X_{\{w\}}$ and show that $w$ can be recovered from the graph isomorphism class of the unlabeled version of $L_w$. Using $L_w$, we apply ideas from probability and Perron-Frobenius theory to obtain results comparing features of $X_{\{w\}}$ for different $w$. Next, we give partial results on the problem of classifying the spaces $X_{\{w\}}$ up to conjugacy. Finally, we extend some of our results to spaces of multi-dimensional arrays that avoid a given finite pattern.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Reinforcement Learning with Stability Guarantees for Control of Unknown Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing a stabilizing controller for nonlinear systems is a challenging task, especially for high-dimensional problems with unknown dynamics. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms applied to stabilization tasks tend to drive the system close to the equilibrium point. However, these approaches often fall short of achieving true stabilization and result in persistent oscillations around the equilibrium point. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that stabilizes the system by learning a local linear representation ofthe dynamics. The main component of the algorithm is integrating the learned gain matrix directly into the neural policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several challenging high-dimensional dynamical systems. In these simulations, our algorithm outperforms popular reinforcement learning algorithms, such as soft actor-critic (SAC) and proximal policy optimization (PPO), and successfully stabilizes the system. To support the numerical results, we provide a theoretical analysis of the feasibility of the learned algorithm for both deterministic and stochastic reinforcement learning settings, along with a convergence analysis of the proposed learning algorithm. Furthermore, we verify that the learned control policies indeed provide asymptotic stability for the nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Computing Lyapunov Exponents using Weighted Birkhoff Averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lyapunov exponents of a dynamical system measure the average rate of exponential stretching along an orbit. Positive exponents are often taken as a defining characteristic of chaotic dynamics. However, the standard orthogonalization-based method for computing Lyapunov exponents converges slowly -- if at all. Many alternatively techniques have been developed to distinguish between regular and chaotic orbits, though most do not compute the exponents. We compute the Lyapunov spectrum in three ways: the standard method, the weighted Birkhoff average (WBA), and the ``mean exponential growth rate for nearby orbits'' (MEGNO). The latter two improve convergence for nonchaotic orbits, but the WBA is fastest. However, for chaotic orbits the three methods convergence at similar, slow rates. Though the original MEGNO method does not compute Lyapunov exponents, we show how to reformulate it as a weighted average that does.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Nonlinear Path-following Guidance with Bounded Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the tracking of arbitrary curvilinear geometric paths in three-dimensional output spaces of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) without pre-specified timing requirements, commonly referred to as path-following problems, subjected to bounded inputs. Specifically, we propose a novel nonlinear path-following guidance law for a UAV that enables it to follow any smooth curvilinear path in three dimensions while accounting for the bounded control authority in the design. The proposed solution offers a general treatment of the path-following problem by removing the dependency on the path's geometry, which makes it applicable to paths with varying levels of complexity and smooth curvatures. Additionally, the proposed strategy draws inspiration from the pursuit guidance approach, which is known for its simplicity and ease of implementation. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the UAV converges to its desired path within a fixed time and remains on it irrespective of its initial configuration with respect to the path. Finally, the simulations demonstrate the merits and effectiveness of the proposed guidance strategy through a wide range of engagement scenarios, showcasing the UAV's ability to follow diverse curvilinear paths accurately.</description>

      <title>Borel graphable equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of analytic equivalence relations which are Borel graphable, i.e. which can be realized as the connectedness relation of a Borel graph. Our main focus is the question of which analytic equivalence relations are Borel graphable. First, we study an equivalence relation arising from the theory of countable admissible ordinals and show that it is Borel graphable if and only if there is a non-constructible real. As a corollary of the proof, we construct an analytic equivalence relation which is (provably in ZFC) not Borel graphable and an effectively analytic equivalence relation which is Borel graphable but not effectively Borel graphable. Next, we study analytic equivalence relations given by the isomorphism relation for some class of countable structures. We show that all such equivalence relations are Borel graphable, which implies that for every Borel action of $S_\infty$, the associated orbit equivalence relation is Borel graphable. This leads us to study the class of Polish groups whose Borel actions always give rise to Borel graphable orbit equivalence relations; we refer to such groups as graphic groups. We show that besides $S_\infty$, the class of graphic groups includes all connected Polish groups and is closed under countable products. We finish by studying structural properties of the class of Borel graphable analytic equivalence relations and by considering two variations on Borel graphability: a generalization with hypegraphs instead of graphs and an analogue of Borel graphability in the setting of computably enumerable equivalence relations.</description>

      <title>Generating Temporal Contact Graphs Using Random Walkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study human mobility networks through timeseries of contacts between individuals. Our proposed Random Walkers Induced temporal Graph (RWIG) model generates temporal graph sequences based on independent random walkers that traverse an underlying graph in discrete time steps. Co-location of walkers at a given node and time defines an individual-level contact. RWIG is shown to be a realistic model for temporal human contact graphs, which may place RWIG on a same footing as the Erdos-Renyi (ER) and Barabasi-Albert (BA) models for fixed graphs. Moreover, RWIG is analytically feasible: we derive closed form solutions for the probability distribution of contact graphs.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in the Kuramoto model with external forcing and higher-order interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is an important phenomenon in a wide variety of systems comprising interacting oscillatory units, whether natural (like neurons, biochemical reactions, cardiac cells) or artificial (like metronomes, power grids, Josephson junctions). The Kuramoto model provides a simple description of these systems and has been useful in their mathematical exploration. Here we investigate this model in the presence of two characteristics that may be important in applications: an external periodic influence and higher-order interactions among the units. The combination of these ingredients leads to a very rich bifurcation scenario in the dynamics of the order parameter that describes phase transitions. Our theoretical calculations are validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A laminar chaotic saddle within a turbulent attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermittent switchings between weakly chaotic (laminar) and strongly chaotic (bursty) states are often observed in systems with high-dimensional chaotic attractors, such as fluid turbulence. They differ from the intermittency of a low-dimensional system accompanied by the stability change of a fixed point or a periodic orbit in that the intermittency of a high-dimensional system tends to appear in a wide range of parameters. This paper considers a case where the skeleton of a laminar state $L$ exists as a proper chaotic subset $S$ of a chaotic attractor $X$, that is, $S\ \subsetneq\ X$. We characterize such a laminar state $L$ by a chaotic saddle $S$, which is densely filled with periodic orbits of different numbers of unstable directions. This study demonstrates the presence of chaotic saddles underlying intermittency in fluid turbulence and phase synchronization. Furthermore, we confirm that chaotic saddles persist for a wide range of parameters. Also, a kind of phase synchronization turns out to occur in the turbulent model.</description>

      <title>Soficity of free extensions of effective subshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $H\leqslant G$ a subgroup. The free extension of an $H$-subshift $X$ to $G$ is the $G$-subshift $\widetilde{X}$ whose configurations are those for which the restriction to every coset of $H$ is a configuration from $X$. We study the case of $G = H \times K$ for infinite and finitely generated groups $H$ and $K$: on the one hand we show that if $K$ is nonamenable and $H$ has decidable word problem, then the free extension to $G$ of any $H$-subshift which is effectively closed is a sofic $G$-subshift. On the other hand we prove that if both $H$ and $K$ are amenable, there are always $H$-subshifts which are effectively closed by patterns whose free extension to $G$ is non-sofic. We also present a few applications in the form of a new simulation theorem and a new class of groups which admit strongly aperiodic SFTs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that the homotopy class of non-homothety linear endomorphisms on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with determinant greater than 2 contains a $C^1$ open set of non-uniformly hyperbolic endomorphisms. Furthermore, we prove that the homotopy class of non-hyperbolic elements (having either $1$ or $-1$ as an eigenvalue) whose degree is large enough contains non-uniformly hyperbolic endomorphisms that are also $C^2$ stably ergodic. These results provide partial answers to certain questions posed in arXiv:2206.08295v2</description>

Abstract: The heterochaos baker maps are piecewise affine maps of the unit square or cube introduced in [Nonlinearity 34, 2021, 5744--5761], to provide a hands-on, elementary understanding of complicated phenomena in systems of large degrees of freedom. We review recent progress on a dynamical systems theory of the heterochaos baker maps, and present new results on properties of measures of maximal entropy and the underlying Lebesgue measure. We address several conjectures and questions that may illuminate new aspects of heterochaos and inspire future research.</description>

      <title>Effective dynamical systems beyond dimension zero and factors of SFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using tools from computable analysis we develop a notion of effectiveness for general dynamical systems as those group actions on arbitrary spaces that contain a computable representative in their topological conjugacy class. Most natural systems one can think of are effective in this sense, including some group rotations, affine actions on the torus and finitely presented algebraic actions. We show that for finitely generated and recursively presented groups, every effective dynamical system is the topological factor of a computable action on an effectively closed subset of the Cantor space. We then apply this result to extend the simulation results available in the literature beyond zero-dimensional spaces. In particular, we show that for a large class of groups, many of these natural actions are topological factors of subshifts of finite type.</description>

      <title>A Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition for conditionally ergodic process in the measure-free setting of vector lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the Kac formula for the conditional expectation of the first recurrence time of a conditionally ergodic conditional expectation preserving system was established in the measure free setting of vector lattices (Riesz spaces). We now give a formulation of the Kakutani-Rokhlin decomposition for conditionally ergodic systems in terms of components of weak order units in a vector lattice. In addition, we prove that every aperiodic conditional expectation preserving system can be approximated by a periodic system.</description>

      <title>Multislicing and effective equidistribution for random walks on some homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a random walk on a homogeneous space $G/\Lambda$ where $G$ is $\mathrm{SO}(2,1)$ or $\mathrm{SO}(3,1)$ and $\Lambda$ is a lattice. The walk is driven by a probability measure $\mu$ on $G$ whose support generates a Zariski-dense subgroup. We show that for every starting point $x \in G/\Lambda$ which is not trapped in a finite $\mu$-invariant set, the $n$-step distribution $\mu^{*n}*\delta_{x}$ of the walk equidistributes toward the Haar measure. Moreover, under arithmetic assumptions on the pair $(\Lambda, \mu)$, we show the convergence occurs at an exponential rate, tempered by the obstructions that $x$ may be high in a cusp or close to a finite orbit.
  Our approach is substantially different from that of Benoist-Quint, whose equidistribution statements only hold in Ces\`aro average and are not quantitative, that of Bourgain-Furman-Lindenstrauss-Mozes concerning the torus case, and that of Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang and Yang about the analogous problem for unipotent flows. A key new feature of our proof is the use of a new phenomenon which we call multislicing. The latter is a generalization of the discretized projection theorems \`a la Bourgain and we believe it presents independent interest.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian intersections and a conjecture of Arnol'd</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.15442v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a degenerate homological Arnol'd conjecture on Lagrangian intersections beyond the case studied by A. Floer and H. Hofer via a new version of Lagrangian Ljusternik--Schnirelman theory. We introduce the notion of (Lagrangian) fundamental quantum factorizations and use them to give some uniform lower bounds of the numbers of Lagrangian intersections for some classical examples including Clifford tori in complex projective spaces. Additionally, we use the Lagrangian Ljusternik-Schnirelman theory to study the size of the intersection of a monotone Lagrangian with its image of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Online Actuator Selection and Controller Design for Linear Quadratic Regulation with Unknown System Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the simultaneous actuator selection and controller design problem for linear quadratic regulation with Gaussian noise over a finite horizon of length $T$ and unknown system model. We consider both episodic and non-episodic settings of the problem and propose online algorithms that specify both the sets of actuators to be utilized under a cardinality constraint and the controls corresponding to the sets of selected actuators. In the episodic setting, the interaction with the system breaks into $N$ episodes, each of which restarts from a given initial condition and has length $T$. In the non-episodic setting, the interaction goes on continuously. Our online algorithms leverage a multiarmed bandit algorithm to select the sets of actuators and a certainty equivalence approach to design the corresponding controls. We show that our online algorithms yield $\sqrt{N}$-regret for the episodic setting and $T^{2/3}$-regret for the non-episodic setting. We extend our algorithm design and analysis to show scalability with respect to both the total number of candidate actuators and the cardinality constraint. We numerically validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Convergence and non-convergence in a nonlocal gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic convergence of solutions as $t\rightarrow\infty$ of $\partial_t u=-f(u)+\int f(u)$, a nonlocal differential equation that is formally a gradient flow in a constant-mass subspace of $L^2$ arising from simplified models of phase transitions. In case the solution takes finitely many values, we provide a new proof of stabilization that uses a {\L}ojasiewicz-type gradient inequality near a degenerate curve of equilibria. Solutions with infinitely many values in general need not converge to equilibrium, however, which we demonstrate by providing counterexamples for piecewise linear and cubic functions $f$. Curiously, the exponential rate of convergence in the finite-value case can jump from order $O(1)$ to arbitrarily small values upon perturbation of parameters.</description>

      <title>Front propagation in hybrid reaction-diffusion epidemic models with spatial heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-species reaction-diffusion system in one space dimension that is derived from an epidemiological model in a spatially periodic environment with two types of pathogens: the wild type and the mutant. The system is of a hybrid nature, partly cooperative and partly competitive, but neither of these entirely. As a result, the comparison principle does not hold. We study spreading properties of solution fronts when the infection is localized initially. We show that there is a well-defined spreading speed and that it coincides with the minimal speed of the traveling waves. Next we study the case where the coefficients are spatially homogeneous and show that, when spreading occurs, every solution to the Cauchy problem converges to the unique positive stationary solution as $t\to\infty$. Finally we consider the case of rapidly oscillating coefficients, that is, when the spatial period of the coefficients, denoted by $\varepsilon$, is very small. We show that there exists a unique positive stationary solution, and that every positive solution to the Cauchy problem converges to this stationary solution as $t\to\infty$. We then discuss the homogenization limit as $\varepsilon\to 0$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Low-dimensional Approximation of Transfer Operators via Flow Matching: Computation and Error Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaction coordinates (RCs) are low-dimensional representations of complex dynamical systems that capture their long-term dynamics. In this work, we focus on the criteria of lumpability and decomposability, previously established for assessing RCs, and propose a new flow matching approach for the analysis and optimization of reaction coordinates based on these criteria. This method effectively utilizes data to quantitatively determine whether a given RC satisfies these criteria and enables end-to-end optimization of the reaction coordinate mapping model. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the loss function used in our approach and the operator error induced by dimension reduction.</description>
