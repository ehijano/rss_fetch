      <title>Photoelectron Circular Dichroism of Aqueous-Phase Alanine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amino acids and other small chiral molecules play key roles in biochemistry. However, in order to understand how these molecules behave in vivo, it is necessary to study them under aqueous-phase conditions. Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) has emerged as an extremely sensitive probe of chiral molecules, but its suitability for application to aqueous solutions had not yet been proven. Here, we report on our PECD measurements of aqueous-phase alanine, the simplest chiral amino acid. We demonstrate that the PECD response of alanine in water is different for each of alanine's carbon atoms, and is sensitive to molecular structure changes (protonation states) related to the solution pH. For C~1s photoionization of alanine's carboxylic acid group, we report PECD of comparable magnitude to that observed in valence-band photoelectron spectroscopy of gas-phase alanine. We identify key differences between PECD experiments from liquids and gases, discuss how PECD may provide information regarding solution-specific phenomena -- for example the nature and chirality of the solvation shell surrounding chiral molecules in water -- and highlight liquid-phase PECD as a powerful new tool for the study of aqueous-phase chiral molecules of biological relevance.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Harnessing Heat and Light with Hydrovoltaic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion of ambient heat into electricity through natural evaporation presents a promising avenue for sustainable energy technologies. This study introduces a unified framework for evaporation-driven hydrovoltaic (EDHV) devices that transcends traditional mechanisms focused solely on ion streaming at the solid-liquid interface. Our approach harnesses both thermodiffusion and photovoltaic effects to effectively transform waste heat and solar energy into electrical power. Utilizing a top-evaporating surface paired with a bottom silicon-dielectric (core-shell) nanopillar array separated by a liquid layer, we demonstrate significant enhancements in power output under external heating and solar illumination. Our findings reveal that in addition to the movement of a polar solvent (like water and ethanol) and ions in a narrow, partially wetted region of the top electrode, thermally and light-assisted ion migration from the bottom to the top electrode plays a pivotal role in electricity generation. We developed an equivalent electrical circuit model that quantifies the latter contribution through the capacitive element denoted as transfer capacitance. We demonstrate a high open circuit voltage of up to 1V and output power density of 0.25W/m2 at 0.1M concentration. Furthermore, we highlight the critical influence of material selection on device performance; transitioning from TiO2 to Al2O3 dielectric shell results in voltage (power) enhancements of 1.9 (3.6 times) at 25{\deg}C and 1.6 (2.4 times) at 70{\deg}C. Notably, high silicon doping yields a 28% increase in open-circuit voltage and a 1.6-fold improvement in power output compared to low-doped samples. These results provide insights into advancing EDHV devices and suggest broader operational strategies that consider environmental conditions, water salinity, and material engineering to optimize the utilization of waste heat and sunlight.</description>

      <title>Relevant, hidden, and frustrated information in high-dimensional analyses of complex dynamical systems with internal noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting meaningful insights from trajectory data to understand complex systems is challenging. High-dimensional analyses are often assumed essential to avoid losing information, but the necessity of such high-dimensionality is unclear. Here, we address this fundamental issue using an atomistic molecular dynamics example of liquid water and ice coexisting at the solid/liquid transition temperature. We analyze molecular trajectories with the high-dimensional Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor, generating 2.56e6 576-dimensional SOAP vectors. Surprisingly, our results show that a single SOAP dimension, accounting for &gt;0.001% of the total variance, is more descriptive than the full dataset. Including additional dimensions degrades analysis quality due to "noise-frustrated information" effects, where noise outweighs relevant information. These effects are shown to be general across systems, scales, and dimensionality reduction methods. Our findings challenge the notion that high-dimensional analyses are inherently superior, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing information quality over quantity in complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Fundamental bounds on many-body spin cluster intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-quantum coherence (MQC) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for probing spin clusters, offering insights into diverse materials and quantum many-body systems. However, prior experiments have revealed a rapid decay in MQC intensities as the coherence order increases, restricting observable cluster sizes to the square root of the total system size. In this work, we establish fundamental bounds on observable MQC intensities in the thermodynamic limit outside the weak polarisation limit. We identify a sharp transition point in the observable MQC intensities as the coherence order grows. This transition points fragments the state space into two components consisting of observable and unobservable spin clusters. Notably, we find that this transition point is directly proportional to the size $N$ and polarization $p$ of the system, suggesting that the aforementioned square root limitation can be overcome through hyperpolarization techniques. Our results provide important experimental guidelines for the observation of large spin cluster phenomena.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dingerNet: A Universal Neural Network Solver for The Schr\"{o}dinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have facilitated numerically accurate solution of the electronic Schr\"{o}dinger equation (SE) by integrating various neural network (NN)-based wavefunction ansatzes with variational Monte Carlo methods. Nevertheless, such NN-based methods are all based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) and require computationally expensive training for each nuclear configuration. In this work, we propose a novel NN architecture, Schr\"{o}dingerNet, to solve the full electronic-nuclear SE by defining a loss function designed to equalize local energies across the system. This approach is based on a translationally, rotationally and permutationally symmetry-adapted total wavefunction ansatz that includes both nuclear and electronic coordinates. This strategy not only allows for an efficient and accurate generation of a continuous potential energy surface at any geometry within the well-sampled nuclear configuration space, but also incorporates non-BOA corrections, through a single training process. Comparison with benchmarks of atomic and small molecular systems demonstrates its accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient polarizable QM/MM using the direct reaction field Hamiltonian with electrostatic potential fitted multipole operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic polarization and dispersion are decisive actors in determining interaction energies between molecules. These interactions have a particularly profound effect on excitation energies of molecules in complex environments, especially when the excitation involves a significant degree of charge reorganisation. The direct reaction field (DRF) approach, which has seen a recent revival of interest, provides a powerful framework for describing these interactions in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of systems, where a small subsystem of interest is described using quantum chemical methods and the remainder is treated with a simple MM force field. In this paper we show how the DRF approach can be combined with the electrostatic potential fitted (ESPF) multipole operator description of the QM region charge density, which significantly improves the efficiency of the method, particularly for large MM systems, and for typical calculations effectively eliminates the dependence on MM system size. We also show how the DRF approach can be combined with fluctuating charge descriptions of the polarizable environment, as well as previously used atom-centred dipole-polarizability based models. We further show that the ESPF-DRF method provides an accurate description of molecular interactions in both ground and excited electronic states of the QM system and apply it to predict the gas to aqueous solution solvatochromic shifts in the UV/visible absorption spectrum of acrolein.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Constrained Generation of Diverse Low-Bandgap Molecules with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organic optoelectronic materials are a promising avenue for next-generation electronic devices due to their solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electronic properties. In particular, near-infrared (NIR) sensitive molecules have unique applications in night-vision equipment and biomedical imaging. Molecular engineering has played a crucial role in developing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) such as the Y-series molecules, which have significantly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells and enhanced spectral coverage in the NIR region. However, systematically designing molecules with targeted optoelectronic properties while ensuring synthetic accessibility remains a challenge. To address this, we leverage structural priors from domain-focused, patent-mined datasets of organic electronic molecules using a symmetry-aware fragment decomposition algorithm and a fragment-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) generator. Our approach generates candidates that retain symmetry constraints from the patent dataset, while also exhibiting red-shifted absorption, as validated by TD-DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study on the dynamics and spectroscopy of collective rovibrational polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate rovibrational molecular models are employed to gain insight in high-resolution into the collective effects and intermolecular processes arising when molecules in the gas phase are interacting with a resonant infrared (IR) radiation mode. An efficient theoretical approach is detailed and numerical results are presented for the HCl, H$_2$O and CH$_4$ molecules confined in an IR cavity. It is shown that by employing a rotationally resolved model for the molecules, revealing the various cavity-mediated interactions between the field-free molecular eigenstates, it is possible to obtain a detailed understanding of the physical processes governing the energy level structure, absorbtion spectra, and dynamic behavior of the confined systems. Collective effects, arising due to the cavity-mediated interaction between molecules, are identified in energy level shifts, in intensity borrowing effects in the absorbtion spectra, and in the intermolecular energy transfer occurring during Hermitian or non-Hermitian time propagation.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian transformation for accurate and efficient band structure interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic band structures is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics and materials science. Conventional methods like Wannier interpolation (WI), which are commonly used to interpolate band structures onto dense k-point grids, often encounter difficulties with complex systems, such as those involving entangled bands or topological obstructions. In this work, we introduce the Hamiltonian transformation (HT) method, a novel framework that directly enhances interpolation accuracy by localizing the Hamiltonian. Using a pre-optimized transformation, HT produces a far more localized Hamiltonian than WI, achieving up to two orders of magnitude greater accuracy for entangled bands. Although HT utilizes a slightly larger, nonlocal numerical basis set, its construction is rapid and requires no optimization, resulting in significant computational speedups. These features make HT a more precise, efficient, and robust alternative to WI for band structure interpolation, as further verified by high-throughput calculations.</description>
