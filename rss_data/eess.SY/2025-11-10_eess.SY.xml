      <title>Computationally Efficient Spline-Based Modeling of DER Dynamics for Voltage Stability in Active Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) into power systems necessitates the accurate representation of their dynamic behavior at the transmission level. Traditional electromagnetic transient models (EMT), while effective, face scalability challenges due to their reliance on detailed system information. Data-driven approaches, such as System Identification (SysID), offer a promising alternative by modeling system dynamics without detailed system knowledge. However, SysID and similar methods are computationally intensive, requiring the computation of complex ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or transfer functions estimation. This makes them less effective for real-time operation. We therefore propose a novel data-driven approach that simplifies the modeling of DERs dynamics by leveraging B-splines to transform discrete system data into continuous differentiable functions. This enables the estimation of lower order linear ordinary differential equations with simple linear regression to represent the underlying dynamics at a very low computational cost. Furthermore, the extracted dynamic equations are discretized by the backward Euler method for potential integration into discrete-time power dispatch models. Validation results indicate a goodness-of-fit (GoF) of 98.74%, comparable to the 99.03% GoF of the SysID method, yet, 4.8 times faster. Our proposed model's execution time of less than one minute makes it more suitable for real-time applications in power system operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourth Industrial Revolution has brought in a new era of smart manufacturing, wherein, application of Internet of Things , and data-driven methodologies is revolutionizing the conventional maintenance. With the help of real-time data from the IoT and machine learning algorithms, predictive maintenance allows industrial systems to predict failures and optimize machines life. This paper presents the synergy between the Internet of Things and predictive maintenance in industrial engineering with an emphasis on the technologies, methodologies, as well as data analytics techniques, that constitute the integration. A systematic collection, processing, and predictive modeling of data is discussed. The outcomes emphasize greater operational efficiency, decreased downtime, and cost-saving, which makes a good argument as to why predictive maintenance should be implemented in contemporary industries.</description>

      <title>Strategic Decision-Making Under Uncertainty through Bi-Level Game Theory and Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strategic scenarios where decision-makers operate at different hierarchical levels, traditional optimization methods are often inadequate for handling uncertainties from incomplete information or unpredictable external factors. To fill this gap, we introduce a mathematical framework that integrates bi-level game theory with distributionally robust optimization (DRO), particularly suited for complex network systems. Our approach leverages the hierarchical structure of bi-level games to model leader-follower interactions while incorporating distributional robustness to guard against worst-case probability distributions. To ensure computational tractability, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are used to transform the bi-level challenge into a more manageable single-level model, and the infinite-dimensional DRO problem is reformulated into a finite equivalent. We propose a generalized algorithm to solve this integrated model. Simulation results validate our framework's efficacy, demonstrating that under high uncertainty, the proposed model achieves up to a 22\% cost reduction compared to traditional stochastic methods while maintaining a service level of over 90\%. This highlights its potential to significantly improve decision quality and robustness in networked systems such as transportation and communication networks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of a Load Admittance Approximation in Transient Stability-Constrained Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transient Stability-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (TSC-OPF) incorporates dynamic stability constraints into the OPF formulation to ensure secure and economical operation under disturbances. While discretizing system dynamics enables the use of nonlinear programming techniques, it significantly increases computational burden. To enhance scalability, many studies simplify the network by representing loads as constant admittances, allowing the use of Kron reduction. However, computing the Kron reduction outside the optimization requires a voltage-based assumption to convert loads from constant power to constant admittance. This paper proposes a practical voltage-based load admittance approximation and evaluates the errors it may introduce in rotor angle and speed deviation trajectories. Case studies on the WECC 9-bus system show that the proposed approach reproduces rotor dynamics consistent with time-domain simulations during the first few seconds while considerably reducing implementation effort and mitigating convergence issues. The proposed framework thus offers a simple and effective strategy for scalable TSC-OPF implementations.</description>

      <title>Predicting and forecasting reactivity and flux using long short-term memory models in pebble bed reactors during run-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pebble bed reactor (PBR) operation presents unique advantages and challenges due to the ability to continuously change the fuel mixture and excess reactivity. Each operation parameter affects reactivity on a different timescale. For example, fuel insertion changes may take months to fully propagate, whereas control rod movements have immediate effects. In-core measurements are further limited by the high temperatures, intense neutron flux, and dynamic motion of the fuel bed. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are trained to predict reactivity, flux profiles, and power profiles as functions of operating history and synthetic batch-level pebble measurements, such as discharge burnup distributions. The model's performance is evaluated using unseen temporal data, achieving an $R^2$ of 0.9914 on the testing set. The capability of the network to forecast reactivity responses to future operational changes is also examined, and its application for optimizing reactor running-in procedures is explored.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Power Systems: A Physics-Informed Framework for Modeling Power System Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern power systems require fast and accurate dynamic simulations for stability assessment, digital twins, and real-time control, but classical ODE solvers are often too slow for large-scale or online applications. We propose a neural-operator framework for surrogate modeling of power system components, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) to learn mappings from system states and time-varying inputs to full trajectories without step-by-step integration. To enhance generalization and data efficiency, we introduce Physics-Informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), which embed the residuals of governing equations into the training loss. Our results show that DeepONets, and especially PI-DeepONets, achieve accurate predictions under diverse scenarios, providing over 30 times speedup compared to high-order ODE solvers. Benchmarking against Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) highlights superior stability and scalability. Our results demonstrate neural operators as a promising path toward real-time, physics-aware simulation of power system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Independent Active-Power Droop Coefficient for Enhanced Andronov-Hopf Oscillator Grid-Forming Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, virtual oscillator control, particularly the Andronov-Hopf oscillator (AHO), has received widespread attention for controlling grid-forming (GFM) inverters due to their superior dynamic response. However, traditional AHO systems feature droop coefficients that are dependent on the oscillator voltage amplitude, limiting their ability to maintain consistent grid support during disturbances and resulting in power-sharing inaccuracies. This paper presents an enhanced AHO (EAHO) strategy, where the active power droop coefficient is no longer a function of the voltage amplitude and retains the key dynamic benefits of the original AHO. The EAHO improves both frequency and voltage support and ensures accurate power sharing with other GFM inverters in grid-connected and stand-alone modes. Extensive comparative and small-signal analyses, alongside experimental validation on 2.5 kVA single-phase inverters, confirm the EAHO's improved steady-state performance, enhanced active and reactive power support, and stable operation under varying grid conditions.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the privacy-preserving Cram\'er-Rao (CR) lower bound theory, characterizing the fundamental limit of identification accuracy under privacy constraint. An identifiability criterion under privacy constraint is derived by using Fisher information matrix as the privacy metric. In the identifiable case, the privacy-preserving CR lower bound is established and its attainability is demonstrated, thereby ensuring the existence of the privacy-preserving Fisher information matrix with explicit expression. Then, the privacy-preserving CR lower bound theory is extended to the multi-sensor multi-measurement system. Specifically, the additivity principle of privacy-preserving Fisher information matrices across both spatial and temporal dimensions is established, building a relationship between privacy-preserving CR lower bounds for the multi-sensor multi-measurement system and its subsystems. Using this additivity principle, distributed identification algorithms capable of achieving the privacy-preserving CR lower bound are further proposed. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the privacy-preserving CR lower bound and show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient CNN Inference on Ultra-Low-Power MCUs via Saturation-Aware Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying lightweight CNN inference tasks on ultra-low-power MCUs is often not limited by space constraint, thanks to the compact size of models, yet inference latency is crucial for preserving energy. We reveal that quantized CNN inference on ultra-low-power MCUs executes unnecessary computations in neurons that produce saturated output values: often times, these neurons still produce the correct output value without fully completing the computation, since the neuron value is too extreme and is eventually systematically clamped at the boundaries allowed by the neuron. We show that with carefully designed condition checks, it is possible to identify and skip these unnecessary computations without impacting the neuron output. Based on this, we present saturation-aware convolution: an inference technique whereby computations in convolution kernels are executed in an altered order to induce earlier saturation, and saturation checks are inserted to omit unnecessary computations. We integrate our implementation into MCUNet's TinyEngine, the state-of-the-art neural network code generation and inference framework, and conduct experiments on a Cortex-M0+ MCU. The result based on 7 open-source CNN models displays up to 24% inference time saving, with strictly zero impact on neural network accuracy.</description>

      <title>Coherency Control in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a coherency control strategy for Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) to establish coherence among power system devices. Using the equivalence of the Complex Frequency (CF) of the injected currents as the definition for coherency among devices, the control enforces an output current with a proportional magnitude and a constant phase shift relative to a reference. This formulation makes the control technology-agnostic, enabling coherency with any type of resource. Case studies based on the two-area and IEEE 39-bus systems demonstrate the controller's potential to improve damping and overall dynamic behavior. The paper further evaluates practical implementation aspects including delay/noise sensitivity and the trade-off between oscillation mitigation and disturbance propagation. This work establishes coherency as a viable direct control objective for IBRs in modern power systems.</description>

      <title>A Tilting-Rotor Enhanced Quadcopter Fault-Tolerant Control Based on Non-Linear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fault-tolerant control strategy based on a tilt-rotor quadcopter prototype, utilizing nonlinear model predictive control to maintain both attitude and position stability in the event of rotor failure. The control strategy employs an extended state observer to predict model deviations following a fault and adjusts the original model in the subsequent time step, thereby achieving active fault-tolerant control. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations and compared to both traditional quadcopter and tilt-rotor quadcopter without observer under identical conditions. The results demonstrate that the tilt-rotor quadcopter can maintain position control without sacrificing yaw stability, unlike traditional quadcopters.</description>

      <title>TAPOM: Task-Space Topology-Guided Motion Planning for Manipulating Elongated Object in Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation in complex, constrained spaces is vital for widespread applications but challenging, particularly when navigating narrow passages with elongated objects. Existing planning methods often fail in these low-clearance scenarios due to the sampling difficulties or the local minima. This work proposes Topology-Aware Planning for Object Manipulation (TAPOM), which explicitly incorporates task-space topological analysis to enable efficient planning. TAPOM uses a high-level analysis to identify critical pathways and generate guiding keyframes, which are utilized in a low-level planner to find feasible configuration space trajectories. Experimental validation demonstrates significantly high success rates and improved efficiency over state-of-the-art methods on low-clearance manipulation tasks. This approach offers broad implications for enhancing manipulation capabilities of robots in complex real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Force-Safe Environment Maps and Real-Time Detection for Soft Robot Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robot manipulators have the potential for deployment in delicate environments to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, existing obstacle detection and avoidance methods do not consider limits on the forces that manipulators may exert upon contact with delicate obstacles. This work introduces a framework that maps force safety criteria from task space (i.e. positions along the robot's body) to configuration space (i.e. the robot's joint angles) and enables real-time force safety detection. We incorporate limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space obstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the manipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations classified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby allowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot manipulator in real-time. We validate our approach in simulation and hardware experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator. Results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects force safety during interactions with deformable obstacles, thereby laying the foundation for real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamics from Input-Output Data with Hamiltonian Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws, in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.</description>

      <title>SAD-Flower: Flow Matching for Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically Consistent Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning. However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems. Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency. Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.</description>

      <title>ETHOS: A Robotic Encountered-Type Haptic Display for Social Interaction in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social Interaction), a dynamic encountered-type haptic display (ETHD) that enables natural physical contact in virtual reality (VR) during social interactions such as handovers, fist bumps, and high-fives. The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic manipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a baton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a safety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We introduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary prop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD baselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by exponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand tracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests show static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions achieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21 ms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR. By incorporating essential safety and control mechanisms, ETHOS establishes a practical foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study adversarially robust multitask adaptive linear quadratic control; a setting where multiple systems collaboratively learn control policies under model uncertainty and adversarial corruption. We propose a clustered multitask approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within each cluster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.12689v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The agent-based modelling community has a debate on how ``intelligent'' artificial agents should be, and in what ways their local intelligence relates to the emergence of a collective intelligence. I approach this debate by endowing the preys and predators of the Lotka-Volterra model with behavioral algorithms characterized by different levels of sophistication. The main finding is that by endowing both preys and predators with the capability of making predictions based on linear extrapolation a novel sort of dynamic equilibrium appears, where both species co-exist while both populations grow indefinitely. While this broadly confirms that, in general, relatively simple agents favor the emergence of complex collective behavior, it also suggests that one fundamental mechanism is that the capability of individuals to take first-order derivatives of one other's behavior can allow the collective computation of derivatives of any order.</description>

      <title>Analytical Models of Frequency and Voltage in Large-Scale All-Inverter Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-order frequency response models for power systems have a decades-long history in optimization and control problems such as unit commitment, economic dispatch, and wide-area control. With a few exceptions, these models are built upon the Newtonian mechanics of synchronous generators, assuming that the frequency dynamics across a system are approximately homogeneous, and assume the dynamics of nodal voltages for most operating conditions are negligible, and thus are not directly computed at all buses. As a result, the use of system frequency models results in the systematic underestimation of frequency minimum nadir and maximum RoCoF, and provides no insight into the reactive power-voltage dynamics. This paper proposes a low-order model of both frequency and voltage response in grid-forming inverter-dominated power systems. The proposed model accounts for spatial-temporal variations in frequency and voltage behavior across a system and as a result, demonstrates the heterogeneity of frequency response in future renewable power systems. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations are used to validate the utility, accuracy, and computational efficiency of these models, setting the basis for them to serve as fast, scalable alternatives to EMT simulation, especially when dealing with very large-scale systems, for both planning and operational studies.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Nonlinear Parametric Models under Non-smooth Regularization using EKF and ADMM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01282v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel combination of extended Kalman filtering (EKF) with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for learning parametric nonlinear models online under non-smooth regularization terms, including l1 and l0 penalties and bound constraints on model parameters. For the case of linear time-varying models and non-smoothconvex regularization terms, we provide a sublinear regret bound that ensures the proper behavior of the online learning strategy. The approach is computationally efficient for a wide range of regularization terms, which makes it appealing for its use in embedded control applications for online model adaptation. We show the performance of the proposed method in three simulation examples, highlighting its effectiveness compared to other batch and online algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As power systems evolve with increasing production from Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), their underlying dynamics are undergoing significant changes that can jeopardize system operation, leading to poorly damped oscillations or small-signal rotor angle instability. In this work, we investigate whether Power System Stabilizer (PSS) setting adjustments can effectively restore system stability and provide adequate damping in systems with increased IBR penetration, using the benchmark Kundur Two-Area System as a case study. Specifically, we evaluate the model-based Residues and P-Vref PSS tuning methods to examine their effectiveness under evolving grid conditions. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of these tuning methods is not guaranteed, particularly when coordination is limited. Consequently, our case study motivates local and adaptive online PSS tuning methods.</description>

Abstract: The effective and safe management of traffic is a key issue due to the rapid advancement of the urban transportation system. Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) possess the capability to connect with each other and adjacent infrastructure, presenting novel opportunities for enhancing traffic flow and coordination. This work proposes a dual-mode model predictive control (MPC) architecture that tackles two interrelated issues: mitigating traffic density at signalized junctions and facilitating seamless, cooperative lane changes in high-density traffic conditions. The objective of this work is to facilitate responsive decision-making for CAVs, thereby enhancing the efficiency and safety of urban mobility. Moreover, we ensure recursive feasibility and convergence of the proposed MPC scheme by the integration of an online-calculated maximal control invariant terminal set. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is validated through numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>An overview of Koopman-based control: From error bounds to closed-loop guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling nonlinear dynamical systems remains a central challenge in a wide range of applications, particularly when accurate first-principle models are unavailable. Data-driven approaches offer a promising alternative by designing controllers directly from observed trajectories. A wide range of data-driven methods relies on the Koopman-operator framework that enables linear representations of nonlinear dynamics via lifting into higher-dimensional observable spaces. Finite-dimensional approximations, such as extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) and its controlled variants, make prediction and feedback control tractable but introduce approximation errors that must be accounted for to provide rigorous closed-loop guarantees. This survey provides a systematic overview of Koopman-based control, emphasizing the connection between data-driven surrogate models, approximation errors, controller design, and closed-loop guarantees. We review theoretical foundations, error bounds, and both linear and bilinear EDMD-based control schemes, highlighting robust strategies that ensure stability and performance. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions at the interface of operator theory, approximation theory, and nonlinear control.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a simulation-based reinforcement learning algorithm for controlling systems with uncertain and varying system parameters. While simulators are useful for safely learning control policies for physical systems, mitigating the reality gap remains a major challenge. To address the challenge, we propose a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, multiple control policies are learned for systems with different parameters in a simulator. In the second stage, for a real system, the control policies learned in the first stage are smoothly switched using an online convex optimization algorithm based on observations. Our proposed algorithm is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a predictive compensation framework for finite-horizon, discrete-time linear quadratic dynamic games subject to Gauss-Markov execution deviations from feedback Nash strategies. One player's control is corrupted by temporally correlated stochastic perturbations modeled as a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) process, while the opposing player has causal access to past deviations and employs a predictive feedforward strategy that anticipates their future effect. We derive closed-form recursions for mean and covariance propagation under the resulting perturbed closed loop, establish boundedness and sensitivity properties of the equilibrium trajectory, and characterize the reduction in expected cost achieved by optimal predictive compensation. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate performance gains relative to nominal Nash feedback across a range of disturbance persistence levels.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation with Unbounded Markovian Noise: A General-Purpose Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by engineering applications such as resource allocation in networks and inventory systems, we consider average-reward Reinforcement Learning with unbounded state space and reward function. Recent works studied this problem in the actor-critic framework and established finite sample bounds assuming access to a critic with certain error guarantees. We complement their work by studying Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation and establishing finite-time bounds with the optimal $\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ sample complexity. These results are obtained using the following general-purpose theorem for non-linear Stochastic Approximation (SA).
  Suppose that one constructs a Lyapunov function for a non-linear SA with certain drift condition. Then, our theorem establishes finite-time bounds when this SA is driven by unbounded Markovian noise under suitable conditions. It serves as a black box tool to generalize sample guarantees on SA from i.i.d. or martingale difference case to potentially unbounded Markovian noise. The generality and the mild assumption of the setup enables broad applicability of our theorem. We illustrate its power by studying two more systems: (i) We improve upon the finite-time bounds of $Q$-learning by tightening the error bounds and also allowing for a larger class of behavior policies. (ii) We establish the first ever finite-time bounds for distributed stochastic optimization of high-dimensional smooth strongly convex function using cyclic block coordinate descent.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel targeted exploration strategy designed specifically for uncertain linear time-invariant systems with energy-bounded disturbances, i.e., without making any assumptions on the distribution of the disturbances. We use classical results characterizing the set of non-falsified parameters consistent with energy-bounded disturbances. We derive a semidefinite program which computes an exploration strategy that guarantees a desired accuracy of the parameter estimate. This design is based on sufficient conditions on the spectral content of the exploration data that robustly account for initial parametric uncertainty. Finally, we highlight the applicability of the exploration strategy through a numerical example involving a nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>Joint Bundle Design and Pricing for Extended Warranty Providers Servicing Multi-Tier Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended warranties (EWs) constitute a significant source of revenue for capital-intensive products. Such products comprise multiple subsystems, enabling flexible EW design. For example, providers can bundle tailored sets of subsystems within different EW contracts, facilitating the creation of a service menu with differentiated warranty options. From the perspective of a third-party EW provider servicing multi-tier products, we develop a novel model to jointly optimize bundle design and pricing for EW options in order to maximize the expected total profit. Specifically, the problem involves determining which contracts-each containing a differentiated bundle of subsystems-to recommend for the multi-tier products and identifying the appropriate price for each contract. As the complexity of the joint optimization problem increases exponentially with the number of subsystems, we devise two solution approaches. The first approach leverages a mixed-integer second-order cone programming reformulation, which guarantees optimality but is applicable only for a small number of subsystems. The second approach utilizes an iterative two-step process, offering enhanced computational efficiency for scenarios involving a large number of subsystems. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our model, particularly in scenarios characterized by high failure probabilities and a large number of subsystems.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth observation satellites (EOSs) play a pivotal role in capturing and analyzing planetary phenomena, ranging from natural disasters to societal development. The EOS scheduling problem (EOSSP), which optimizes the schedule of EOSs, is often solved with respect to nadir-directional EOS systems, thus restricting the observation time of targets and, consequently, the effectiveness of each EOS. This paper leverages state-of-the-art constellation reconfigurability to develop the reconfigurable EOS scheduling problem (REOSSP), wherein EOSs are assumed to be maneuverable, forming a more optimal constellation configuration at multiple opportunities during a schedule. This paper develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the REOSSP to optimally solve the scheduling problem for given parameters. Additionally, since the REOSSP can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems, a rolling horizon procedure (RHP) solution method is developed. The performance of the REOSSP is benchmarked against the EOSSP, which serves as a baseline, through a set of random instances where problem characteristics are varied and a case study in which Hurricane Sandy is used to demonstrate realistic performance. These experiments demonstrate the value of constellation reconfigurability in its application to the EOSSP, yielding solutions that improve performance, while the RHP enhances computational runtime for large-scale REOSSP instances.</description>

Abstract: Rate of Penetration (ROP) prediction is critical for drilling optimization yet remains challenging due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous characteristics of drilling data. Conventional empirical, physics-based, and standard machine learning models rely on oversimplified assumptions or intensive feature engineering, constraining their capacity to model long-term dependencies and intricate feature interactions. To address these issues, this study presents a new deep learning Hybrid LSTM-Trans-Mixer-Att framework that first processes input data through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling cycles. Subsequently, an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization refines the features. Concurrently, a parallel Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block introduced facilitates efficient cross-feature interaction modeling of static and categorical parameters, including lithological indices and mud properties. The feature representations extracted from the Enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer modules are integrated through a dedicated fusion layer. Finally, an adaptive attention mechanism then dynamically assigns contextual weights to salient features, enhancing discriminative representation learning and enabling high-fidelity ROP prediction. The proposed framework combines sequential memory, static feature interactions, global context learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution for the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Experimental validation on real-world drilling datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving an Rsquare of 0.9991 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly outperforming existing baseline and hybrid models.</description>
