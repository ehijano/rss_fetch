      <title>Multiplexons: Limits of Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a multiplex network, a set of nodes is connected by different types of interactions, each represented as a separate layer within the network. Multiplexes have emerged as a key instrument for modeling large-scale complex systems, due to the widespread coexistence of diverse interactions in social, industrial, and biological domains. This motivates the development of a rigorous and readily applicable framework for studying properties of large multiplex networks. In this article, we provide a self-contained introduction to the limit theory of dense multiplex networks, analogous to the theory of graphons (limit theory of dense graphs). As applications, we derive limiting analogues of commonly used multiplex features, such as degree distributions and clustering coefficients. We also present a range of illustrative examples, including correlated versions of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and inhomogeneous random graph models and dynamic networks. Finally, we discuss how multiplex networks fit within the broader framework of decorated graphs, and how the convergence results can be recovered from the limit theory of decorated graphs. Several future directions are outlined for further developing the multiplex limit theory.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic approach to strong natural boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local non-extendability of random power series beyond their disk of convergence. We show that random power series formed by independent coefficients which are asymptotically anti-concentrated admit the circle of radius of convergence as strong natural boundary, even in a Nevanlinna sense. Our results complement and extend previous works of Ryll-Nardzewski (1953), and Breuer and Simon (2011).</description>

      <title>Spectral theory for L\'evy and L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups on step 2 Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider non-local perturbations $\Delta^\psi_G$ of sub-Laplacians on a step $2$ Carnot group $G$. The perturbations are by translation-invariant non-local operators acting along the vertical directions in $G$. We use harmonic analysis on $G$ to obtain intertwining relationship between the semigroups generated by $\Delta^\psi_G$ and some strongly continuous contraction semigroups on Euclidean spaces with purely continuous spectrum, and as a result we identify the spectrum of $\Delta^\psi_G$. Further we introduce the L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) semigroup corresponding to $\Delta^\psi_G$. We prove that these Markov semigroups are ergodic, though they are not normal operators on $L^2$ space with respect to the invariant distribution $\mathsf{p}_\psi$. The intertwining relationships allow us to show that all L\'evy-OU generators on $G$ are isospectral, that is, they have the same eigenvalues with the same multiplicities. As a byproduct, we obtain a precise description of the eigenspaces, and also derive explicit formula for the co-eigenfunctions corresponding to some eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Travel Bans vs. Social Distancing: A Mathematical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the world grows increasingly connected, infectious disease transmission and outbreaks become a pressing global concern for public health officials and policymakers. While policy interventions to contain and prevent the spread of disease have been proposed and implemented, there has been little rigorous quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of such interventions. In this paper, we study the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) infection process on a dynamic network model that models two communities with travel between them. In particular, we consider two Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graphs where edges are dynamically changing based on node travel between the graphs. We characterize the time evolution of the outbreaks in both communities and pin down the time for when the infection first reaches the second community. Finally, we analyze two interventions, social distancing and travel bans, and show that while social distancing is effective at reducing the burden of the disease in the second community, travel bans are not.</description>

      <title>Rare event probabilities in Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study rare events in spherical and Gaussian random geometric graphs in high dimensions. In these models, the vertices correspond to points sampled uniformly at random on the $d$ dimensional unit sphere or correspond to $d$ dimensional standard Gaussian vectors, and edges are added between two vertices if the inner-product between their corresponding points are greater than a threshold $t_p$, chosen such that the probability of having an edge is equal to $p$. We focus on two problems: (a) the probability that the RGG is a complete graph, and (b) the probability of observing an atypically large number of edges. We obtain asymptotically exponential decay rates depending on $n$ and $d$ of the probabilities of these rare events through a combination of geometric and probabilistic arguments.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent identically distributed log-concave random variables. We show that $h_\infty(X+Y)-h_\infty(X)$ is maximized when $X$ and $Y$ have exponential distributions. Here, $h_\infty(\cdot)$ is the R\'enyi entropy of order $\infty$. Analogs for integer-valued log-concave random variables are also obtained.</description>

      <title>On the approximation of finite-time Lyapunov exponents for the stochastic Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with quadratic nonlinearities close to a change of stability. To this aim we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs), observing a change of sign based on the interplay between the distance towards the bifurcation and the noise intensity. A technical challenge is to provide a suitable control of the nonlinear terms coupling the dominant and stable modes of the SPDE and of the corresponding linearization. In order to illustrate our results we apply them to the stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universal approximation property uniformly with respect to weakly compact families of measures is established for several classes of neural networks. To that end, we prove that these neural networks are dense in Orlicz spaces, thereby extending classical universal approximation theorems even beyond the traditional $L^p$-setting. The covered classes of neural networks include widely used architectures like feedforward neural networks with non-polynomial activation functions, deep narrow networks with ReLU activation functions and functional input neural networks.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable asymmetric simple inclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the asymmetric simple inclusion process (ASIP) on a periodic one-dimensional lattice, where the integers in the particles rates are deformed to their $t$-analogues. We call this the $(q, t, \theta)$~ASIP, where $q$ is the asymmetric hopping parameter and $\theta$ is the diffusion parameter. We show that this process is a misanthrope process, and consequently the steady state is independent of $q$. We compute the steady state, the one-point correlation and the current in the steady state. In particular, we show that the single-site occupation probabilities follow a \emph{beta-binomial} distribution at $t=1$. We compute the two-dimensional phase diagram in various regimes of the parameters $(t, \theta)$ and perform simulations to justify the results. We also show that a modified form of the steady state weights at $t \neq 1$ satisfy curious palindromic and antipalindromic symmetries. Lastly, we define an enriched process at $t=1$ and $\theta$ an integer which projects onto the $(q, 1, \theta)$~ASIP and whose steady state is uniform, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Fast Wasserstein rates for estimating probability distributions of probabilistic graphical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using i.i.d. data to estimate a high-dimensional distribution in Wasserstein distance is a fundamental instance of the curse of dimensionality. We explore how structural knowledge about the data-generating process which gives rise to the distribution can be used to overcome this curse. More precisely, we work with the set of distributions of probabilistic graphical models for a known directed acyclic graph. It turns out that this knowledge is only helpful if it can be quantified, which we formalize via smoothness conditions on the transition kernels in the disintegration corresponding to the graph. In this case, we prove that the rate of estimation is governed by the local structure of the graph, more precisely by dimensions corresponding to single nodes together with their parent nodes. The precise rate depends on the exact notion of smoothness assumed for the kernels, where either weak (Wasserstein-Lipschitz) or strong (bidirectional Total-Variation-Lipschitz) conditions lead to different results. We prove sharpness under the strong condition and show that this condition is satisfied for example for distributions having a positive Lipschitz density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavefield speckle patterns are generated by interference of randomly scattered coherent light. In the weak-coupling regime of the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model for long-distance wave propagation, we show the following multiscale character: a macroscopic envelope solves a deterministic diffusion equation while the local wavefield (the speckle) is described by a complex Gaussian process both in terms of spatial axial and lateral displacements as well as frequency and angular variations of the incident wavebeam. These results describe speckle patterns and corroborate chromato-spatial memory effects observed in laser light propagation through heterogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Concentration Inequalities and UQ Bounds for Hypocoercive MCMC Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.11973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we provide performance guarantees for hypocoercive non-reversible MCMC samplers $X_t$ with invariant measure $\mu_*$; our results apply in particular to the Langevin equation, Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo, and the bouncy particle and zig-zag samplers. Specifically, we establish a concentration inequality of Bernstein type for ergodic averages $\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T f(X_t)\, dt$. As a consequence we provide two types of performance guarantees: (a) explicit non-asymptotic confidence intervals for $\int f d\mu_*$ when using a finite time ergodic average with given initial condition $\mu$ and (b) uncertainty quantification (UQ) bounds, expressed in terms of relative entropy rate, on the bias of $\int f d\mu_*$ when using an alternative or approximate processes $\widetilde{X}_t$. (Results in (b) generalize results (arXiv:1812.05174) from the authors for coercive dynamics.) The concentration inequality is proved by combining the approach via Feynman-Kac semigroups first noted by Wu with the hypocoercive estimates of Dolbeault, Mouhot and Schmeiser (arXiv:1005.1495) developed for the Langevin equation and generalized to partially deterministic Markov processes by Andrieu et al. (arXiv:1808.08592).</description>

      <title>Strong Characterization for the Airy Line Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a Brownian Gibbsian line ensemble whose top curve approximates a parabola must be given by the parabolic Airy line ensemble. More specifically, we prove that if $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} = (\mathcal{L}_1, \mathcal{L}_2, \ldots )$ is a line ensemble satisfying the Brownian Gibbs property, such that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ there exists a constant $\mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) &gt; 0$ with $$\mathbb{P} \Big[ \big| \mathcal{L}_1 (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2 \big| \le \varepsilon t^2 + \mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) \Big] \ge 1 - \varepsilon, \qquad \text{for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$},$$ then $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}$ is the parabolic Airy line ensemble, up to an independent affine shift. Specializing this result to the case when $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2$ is translation-invariant confirms a prediction of Okounkov and Sheffield from 2006 and Corwin-Hammond from 2014.</description>

      <title>Positive Semidefinite Matrix Supermartingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15567v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic convergence and nonasymptotic maximal inequalities of supermartingales and backward submartingales in the space of positive semidefinite matrices. These are natural matrix analogs of scalar nonnegative supermartingales and backward nonnegative submartingales, whose convergence and maximal inequalities are the theoretical foundations for a wide and ever-growing body of results in statistics, econometrics, and theoretical computer science.
  Our results lead to new concentration inequalities for either martingale dependent or exchangeable random symmetric matrices under a variety of tail conditions, encompassing now-standard Chernoff bounds to self-normalized heavy-tailed settings. Further, these inequalities are usually expressed in the Loewner order, are sometimes valid simultaneously for all sample sizes or at an arbitrary data-dependent stopping time, and can often be tightened via an external randomization factor.</description>

      <title>The stochastic heat inclusion with fractional time driven by time-space Brownian and L\'evy white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a time-fractional stochastic heat inclusion driven by additive time-space Brownian and L\'evy white noise. The fractional time derivative is interpreted as the Caputo derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,2).$ We show the following: \\ a) If a solution exists, then it is a fixed point of a specific set-valued map.\\ b) Conversely, any fixed point of this map is a solution of the heat inclusion.\\ c) Finally, we show that there is at least one fixed point of this map, thereby proving that there is at least one solution of the time-fractional stochastic heat inclusion.
  A solution $Y(t,x)$ is called \emph{mild} if $\E[Y^2(t,x)] &lt; \infty$ for all $t,x$. We show that the solution is mild if\\ $\alpha=1$ \&amp; $d=1,$ \ or \ $\alpha \geq 1$ \&amp; $d\in \{1,2\}$.
  On the other hand, if $\alpha &lt; 1$ we show that the solution is not mild for any space dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>On the exponential integrability of the derivative of intersection and self-intersection local time for fractional Brownian motion and a limit theorem related to the self-intersection local time for fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give the correct condition for existence of the $k$-th derivative of the intersection local time for fractional Brownian motion, which was originally discussed in [Guo, J., Hu, Y., and Xiao, Y., Higher-order derivative of intersection local time for two independent fractional Brownian motions, Journal of Theoretical Probability 32, (2019), pp. 1190-1201]. We also show that the $k$-th derivative of the intersection and self-intersection local times of fractional Brownian motion are exponentially integrable for certain parameter values. In addition, we show convergence in distribution when the existence condition is violated for the $k$-th derivative of self-intersection local time of fractional Brownian motion under scaling.</description>

      <title>Universal finite-size scaling in high-dimensional critical phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new unified theory of critical finite-size scaling for lattice statistical mechanical models with periodic boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension. Our theory is based on recent mathematically rigorous results for linear and branched polymers, multi-component spin systems, and percolation. Both short-range and long-range interactions are included. The universal finite-size scaling is inherited from the scaling of the system unwrapped to the infinite lattice. We also present conjectures for universal scaling profiles for the susceptibility and two-point function plateau in a critical window. For free boundary conditions, the universal scaling has been proven to apply at a pseudocritical point for hierarchical spins, and we conjecture that this holds generally.</description>

      <title>Complexity and accessibility of random landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes introduce probabilistic landscape models defined on high-dimensional discrete sequence spaces. The models are motivated primarily by fitness landscapes in evolutionary biology, but links to statistical physics and computer science are mentioned where appropriate. Elementary and advanced results on the structure of landscapes are described with a focus on features that are relevant to evolutionary searches, such as the number of local maxima and the existence of fitness-monotonic paths. The recent discovery of submodularity as a biologically meaningful property of fitness landscapes and its consequences for their accessibility is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Bridging Control Variates and Regression Adjustment in A/B Testing: From Design-Based to Model-Based Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A B testing serves as the gold standard for large scale, data driven decision making in online businesses. To mitigate metric variability and enhance testing sensitivity, control variates and regression adjustment have emerged as prominent variance reduction techniques, leveraging pre experiment data to improve estimator performance. Over the past decade, these methods have spawned numerous derivatives, yet their theoretical connections and comparative properties remain underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of their statistical properties, establish a formal bridge between the two frameworks in practical implementations, and extend the investigation from design based to model-based frameworks. Through simulation studies and real world experiments at ByteDance, we validate our theoretical insights across both frameworks. Our work aims to provide rigorous guidance for practitioners in online controlled experiments, addressing critical considerations of internal and external validity. The recommended method control variates with group specific coefficient estimates has been fully implemented and deployed on ByteDance's experimental platform.</description>
