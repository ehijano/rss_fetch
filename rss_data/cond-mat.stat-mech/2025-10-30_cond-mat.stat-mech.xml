      <title>Spin Glass Dynamics on Complex Hardware Topologies: A Bond-Correlated Percolation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how frustration and disorder shape relaxation in complex systems is a central problem in statistical physics and quantum annealing. Spin-glass models provide a natural framework to explore this connection, as their energy landscapes are governed by competing interactions and constrained topologies. We investigate the non-exponential relaxation behavior of spin glasses on network architectures relevant to quantum annealing hardware -- such as finite size Chimera, Pegasus, and Zephyr graphs -- where embedding constraints and finite connectivity strongly modulate the distribution of barriers and metastable states. This slow relaxation arises from the combined effects of frustration and disorder, which persist even beyond the conventional spin-glass transition. Within the Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Coniglio-Klein (FKCK) cluster formalism, the appearance of unfrustrated cluster regions gives rise to multiple relaxation scales, as distinct domains follow different dynamical pathways across a rugged energy landscape. This framework enables a more comprehensive characterization of spin-glass energy landscapes and offers valuable insight into how topological constraints and disorder jointly govern relaxation dynamics, providing quantitative benchmarks for evaluating the performance and limitations of quantum annealing architectures.</description>

      <title>Phonon dynamics and chiral modes in the two-dimensional square-octagon lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral phonons, originally identified in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices and later extended to kagome, square, and other lattices, have been extensively studied as manifestations of broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries in vibrational dynamics. In this work, we investigate the vibrational dynamics of the two-dimensional square-octagon lattice using a spring-mass model with central-force interactions. The model incorporates mass contrast and variable coupling strengths among nearest, next-nearest, and third-nearest neighbors. From the dynamical matrix, we obtain the phonon dispersion relations and identify tunable phononic band gaps governed by both mass and spring-constant ratios. The angular dependence of phase and group velocities is analyzed to reveal the pronounced anisotropy inherent to this lattice geometry. We also examine the distinctive features of the square-octagon geometry, including flat-band anomalies in the density of states and anisotropic sound propagation induced by longer-range couplings. In addition, we explore the emergence of chiral phonons by introducing a time reversal symmetry-breaking term in the dynamical matrix, and to elucidate their optical signatures, we construct a minimal model to study infrared circular dichroism arising from chiral phonon modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a formulation of the First Law of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for biological information-processing systems by partitioning entropy in the Second Law into microscopic and mesoscopic components and by assuming that natural selection promotes optimal information processing and transmission. The resulting framework demonstrates how mesoscopic information-based subsystems can attain nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) sustained by external energy and entropy fluxes, such as those generated by ATP/ADP imbalances in vivo. Moreover, mesoscopic systems may reach NESS before microscopic subsystems, leading to ordered structures in entropy flow analogous to eddies in a moving stream.</description>

      <title>Flocking in weakly nonreciprocal mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that weakly nonreciprocal alignment leads to large-scale structure formation in flocking mixtures. By combining numerical simulations of a binary Vicsek model and the analysis of coarse-grained continuum equations, we demonstrate that nonreciprocity destabilizes the ordered phase formed by mutually aligning or anti-aligning species in a large part of the phase diagram. For aligning populations, this instability results in one species condensing in a single band that travels within a homogeneous liquid of the other species. When interactions are anti-aligning, both species self-assemble into polar clusters with large-scale chaotic dynamics. In both cases, the emergence of structures is accompanied by the demixing of the two species, despite the absence of repulsive interactions. Our theoretical analysis allows us to elucidate the origin of the instability, and show that it is generic to nonreciprocal flocks.</description>

Abstract: The scaling functions of single-time and two-time correlators in systems undergoing non-equilibrium critical dynamics with dynamical exponent ${z}=2$ are predicted from a new time-dependent non-equilibrium representation of the Schr\"odinger algebra. These explicit predictions are tested and confirmed in the ageing of several exactly solvable models.</description>

      <title>The impact of fluctuations on particle systems described by Dean-Kawasaki-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the role of fluctuations in particle systems modeled by Dean-Kawasaki-type equations, which describe the evolution of particle densities in systems with Brownian motion. By comparing microscopic simulations, stochastic partial differential equations, and their deterministic counterparts, we analyze four models of increasing complexity. Our results identify macroscopic quantities that can be altered by the conserved multiplicative noise that typically appears in the Dean-Kawasaki-type description. We find that this noise enhances front propagation in systems with density-dependent diffusivity, accelerates the onset of pattern formation in particle systems with nonlocal interactions, and reduces hysteresis in systems interacting via repulsive forces. In some cases, it accelerates transitions or induces structures absent in deterministic models. These findings illustrate that (conservative) fluctuations can have constructive and nontrivial effects, emphasizing the importance of stochastic modeling in understanding collective particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of entanglement fluctuations and quantum Mpemba effect in the $\nu=1$ QSSEP model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of entanglement fluctuations in the $\nu=1$ Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process, a free-fermion chain with hopping amplitudes that are stochastic in time but homogeneous in space. Previous work showed that the average entanglement growth after a quantum quench can be explained in terms of pairs of entangled quasiparticles performing random walks, leading to diffusive entanglement spreading. By incorporating the noise-induced statistical correlations between the quasiparticles, we extend this description to the full-time probability distribution of the entanglement entropy. Our generalized quasiparticle picture allows us to compute the average time evolution of a generic function of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem. We also apply our result to the entanglement asymmetry. This allows us to investigate the restoration of particle-number symmetry in the dynamics from initial states with no well-defined particle number, and the emergence of the quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Maximum Quantum Work at Criticality: Stirling Engines and Fibonacci-Lucas Degeneracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25533v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body effects and quantum criticality play a central role in determining the performance of quantum thermal machines. Although operating near a quantum critical point (QCP) is known to enhance engine performance, the precise thermodynamic conditions required to attain the Carnot efficiency limit remain unsettled. Here, we derive the exact conditions for a quantum Stirling engine to achieve Carnot efficiency when a QCP drives its working medium. In the low-temperature regime, where only the ground-state manifold is populated, the net work output is given by $ W = k_B \delta \ln (g_{\text{crit}}/g_0) $ with $ \delta = T_H - T_L $, which directly yields the Carnot efficiency $ \eta_C = 1 - T_L/T_H $, independent of microscopic details. Notably, whereas ideal Stirling cycles attain Carnot efficiency only with a perfect regenerator, here no regenerator is required because, at low temperatures, the thermal population remains confined to the degenerate ground state; this represents a clear quantum advantage over engines with classical working substances. We validate this universal result by recovering known behaviors in various quantum systems, including spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and magnetic anisotropies. Applying the framework to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model, we predict non-extensive scaling of the work output governed by Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for open chains and closed rings, respectively, which converges to classical extensivity in the thermodynamic limit. This analysis establishes a general and robust foundation for designing quantum thermal machines that reach the Carnot bound while delivering finite work.</description>

      <title>Free-energy REconstruction from Stable Clusters (FRESC): A new method to evaluate nucleation barriers from simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simulation technique to evaluate the most important quantity for nucleation processes: the nucleation barrier, i.e. the free energy of formation of the critical cluster. The method is based on stabilizing a small cluster by simulating it in the NVT ensemble and using the thermodynamics of small systems to convert the properties of this stable cluster into the Gibbs free energy of formation of the critical cluster. We demonstrate this approach using condensation in a Lennard-Jones truncated and shifted fluid as an example, showing an excellent agreement with previous Umbrella Sampling simulations. The method is straightforward to implement, computationally inexpensive, requires only a small number of particles comparable to the critical cluster size, does not rely on the use of Classical Nucleation Theory, and does not require any cluster definition or reaction coordinate. All of these advantages hold the promise of opening the door to simulate nucleation processes in complex molecules of atmospheric, chemical or pharmaceutical interest that cannot be easily simulated with current techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a recently discovered property of many-body quantum chaotic systems called ETH-monotonicity in two-dimensional systems. Our new results further support ETH-monotonicity in these higher dimensional systems. We show that the flattening rate of the $f$-function is directly proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the system, so as $L^2$ where $L$ is the linear size of the system, and in general, expected to be $L^d$ where $d$ is the spatial dimension of the system. We also show that the flattening rate is directly proportional to the particle (or hole) number for systems of same spatial size.</description>

      <title>Critical exponents of fluid-fluid interfacial tensions near a critical endpoint in a nonwetting gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid three-phase equilibria, with phases $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, are studied close to a tricritical point, analytically and numerically, in a mean-field density-functional theory with two densities. Employing Griffiths' scaling for the densities, the interfacial tensions of the wet and nonwet interfaces are analysed. The mean-field critical exponent is obtained for the vanishing of the critical interfacial tension $\sigma_{\beta\gamma}$ as a function of the deviation of the noncritical interfacial tension $\sigma_{\alpha\gamma}$ from its limiting value at a critical endpoint $\sigma_{\alpha,\beta\gamma}$. In the wet regime, this exponent is $3/2$ as expected. In the nonwetting gap of the model, the exponent is again $3/2$, except for the approach to the critical endpoint on the neutral line where $\sigma_{\alpha\beta} = \sigma_{\alpha\gamma}$. When this point is approached along any path with $\sigma_{\alpha\beta} \neq \sigma_{\alpha\gamma}$, or along the neutral line, $\sigma_{\beta\gamma} \propto | \sigma_{\alpha\gamma} - \sigma_{\alpha,\beta\gamma}|^{3/4}$, featuring an anomalous critical exponent $3/4$, which is an exact result derived by analytic calculation and explained by geometrical arguments.</description>

      <title>When Heating Isn't Cooling in Reverse: Nos\'e-Hoover Thermostat Fluctuations from Equilibrium Symmetry to Nonequilibrium Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent laboratory experiments suggest an intrinsic asymmetry between heating and cooling, with heating occurring more efficiently. Two decades earlier, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations had examined a related setup - heating one side of a computational cell while cooling the other via distinct thermostats. We revisit those calculations, recapitulating the underlying theory and showing that earlier MD results already hinted at the observed laboratory asymmetry. Recent realizations of a simple two-dimensional single-particle model, thermostatted in $x$ and $y$ at different temperatures, reproduces key features: at equilibrium, thermostat variables were identical, but under nonequilibrium conditions, the heating variable is weaker than the cooling one. At the same time, MD simulations from four decades ago by Evans and Holian reported a surprising skew in the Nose--Hoover thermostat variable $\xi$ under equilibrium - indicating a statistical bias in energy injection versus extraction. We revisit those results with exact reproduction of their setup. We show that when (1) the center-of-mass velocity is set to zero, (2) integration is done carefully with finite differencing, and (3) sampling is sufficiently long, the distribution of $\xi$ is symmetric and Gaussian with zero mean, as predicted by theory and validated by two independent error estimates. However, in the two-temperature cell, the distribution of thermostat variables become asymmetric, the cold bath requires significantly stronger damping than the hot bath requires anti-damping, with $\langle \xi_x \rangle / \langle \xi_y \rangle = -T_y/T_x$. This exact analytic relation links thermostat effort to thermal bias and the negative rate of change in the entropy of the system. These results identify the microscopic origin of heating-cooling asymmetry as a genuine nonequilibrium effect, consistent with experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Liquid-vapor transition in a model of a continuum particle system with finite-range modified Kac pair potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a phase transition in dimension $d&gt;1$ in a continuum particle system interacting with a pair potential containing a modified attractive Kac potential of range $\gamma^{-1}$, with $\gamma&gt;0$. This transition is "close", for small positive $\gamma$, to the one proved previously by Lebowitz and Penrose in the van der Waals limit $\gamma\downarrow0$. It is of the type of the liquid-vapor transition observed when a fluid, like water, heated at constant pressure, boils at a given temperature. Previous results on phase transitions in continuum systems with stable potentials required the use of unphysical four-body interactions or special symmetries between the liquid and vapor.
  The pair interaction we consider is obtained by partitioning space into cubes of volume $\gamma^{-d}$, and letting the Kac part of the pair potential be uniform in each cube and act only between adjacent cubes. The "short-range" part of the pair potential is quite general (in particular, it may or may not include a hard core), but restricted to act only between particles in the same cube.
  Our setup, the "boxed particle model", is a special case of a general "spin" system, for which we establish a first-order phase transition using reflection positivity and the Dobrushin--Shlosman criterion.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Chimeras States in One-dimensional Ising model with Long-Range Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the conditions for the emergence of chimera-like states in Ising systems. We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes in spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we introduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the whole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange interactions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This setup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical (diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics on the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of activity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time chimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable moving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the system at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's phase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence of chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform stable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and incoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as it is, e.g., the brain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic phase transitions, a central concept in physics and chemistry, are typically controlled by an interplay of enthalpic and entropic contributions. In most cases, the estimation of the enthalpy in simulations is straightforward but evaluating the entropy is notoriously hard. As a result, it is common to induce transitions between the metastable states and estimate their relative occupancies, from which the free energy difference can be inferred. However, for systems with large free energy barriers, sampling these transitions is a significant computational challenge. Dedicated enhanced sampling algorithms require significant prior knowledge of the slow modes governing the transition, which is typically unavailable. We present an alternative approach, which only uses short simulations of each phase separately. We achieve this by employing a recently developed deep learning model for estimating the entropy and hence the free energy of each metastable state. We benchmark our approach calculating the free energies of crystalline and liquid metals. Our method features state-of-the-art precision in estimating the melting transition temperature in Na and Al without requiring any prior information or simulation of the transition pathway itself.</description>

      <title>Maximum-Entropy Analog Computing Approaching ExaOPS-per-Watt Energy-efficiency at the RF-Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how the physics of entropy production, when combined with symmetry constraints, can be used for implementing high-performance and energy-efficient analog computing systems. At the core of the proposed framework is a generalized maximum-entropy principle that can describe the evolution of a mesoscopic physical system formed by an interconnected ensemble of analog elements, including devices that can be readily fabricated on standard integrated circuit technology. We show that the maximum-entropy state of this ensemble corresponds to a margin-propagation (MP) distribution and can be used for computing correlations and inner products as the ensemble's macroscopic properties. Furthermore, the limits of computational throughput and energy efficiency can be pushed by extending the framework to non-equilibrium or transient operating conditions, which we demonstrate using a proof-of-concept radio-frequency (RF) correlator integrated circuit fabricated in a 22 nm SOI CMOS process. The measured results show a compute efficiency greater than 2 Peta ($10^{15}$) Bit Operations per second per Watt (PetaOPS/W) at 8-bit precision and greater than 0.8 Exa ($10^{18}$) Bit Operations per second per Watt (ExaOPS/W) at 3-bit precision for RF data sampled at rates greater than 4 GS/s. Using the fabricated prototypes, we also showcase several real-world RF applications at the edge, including spectrum sensing, and code-domain communications.</description>

      <title>Exotic Acoustic-Edge and Thermal Scaling in Disordered Hyperuniform Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a first-principles theory for the vibrational density of states (VDOS) and thermal properties of network materials built on stationary correlated disordered point configurations. For scalar (mass--spring) models whose dynamical matrix is a distance-weighted graph Laplacian, we prove that the limiting spectral measure is the pushforward of Lebesgue measure by a Fourier symbol that depends only on the edge kernel \(f\) and the two-point statistics \(g_2\) (equivalently the structure factor \(S\)). For hyperuniform systems with small-$k$ scaling \(S(k)\sim k^\alpha\) and compensated kernels, {the VDOS exhibits an algebraic \emph{pseudogap} at low frequency, \(g(\omega)\sim \omega^{\,2d/\beta-1}\) with \(\beta=\min\{4,\alpha+2\}\), which implies a low-temperature specific heat \(C(T)\sim T^{\,2d/\beta}\) and a heat-kernel decay \(Z(t)\sim t^{-d/\beta}\), defining a spectral dimension \(d_s=2d/\beta\).} This hyperuniformity-induced algebraic edge depletion could enable novel wave manipulation and low-temperature applications. Generalization to vector mechanical models and implications on material design are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study on critical exponents of the classical Heisenberg model in ferromagnetic icosahedral quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals (QCs) lack three-dimensional periodicity of atomic arrangement but possess long-range structural order, which are distinct from periodic crystals and random systems. Here, we show how the ferromagnetic (FM) order arises in the icosahedral QC (i-QC) on the basis of the Monte Carlo simulation of the Heisenberg model on the Yb lattice of Cd$_{5.7}$Yb composed of regular icosahedrons. By finite-size scaling of the Monte Carlo data, we identified the critical exponents of the magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and spin correlation length, $\beta=0.508(30)$, $\gamma=1.361(59)$, and $\nu=0.792(17)$, respectively. We confirmed that our data satisfy the hyperscaling relation and estimated the other critical exponents $\alpha=-0.376(51)$, $\delta=3.68(23)$, and $\eta=0.282(65)$. These results show a new universality class inherent in the i-QC, which is different from those in periodic magnets and spin glasses. In the i-QC, each Yb site at vertices of the regular icosahedrons is classified into 8 classes with respect to the coordination numbers of the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor bonds. We revealed the FM-transition mechanism by showing that the difference in the local environment of each site is governed by cooperative evolution of spin correlations upon cooling, giving rise to the critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>NLIE formulations for the generalized Gibbs ensemble in the sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose two sets of nonlinear integral equations (NLIE) for describing the thermodynamics in the sine-Gordon model, when higher Lorentz spin conserved charges are also coupled to the Gibbs ensemble. We call them NLIE I and II. The derivation of the equations, is based on T-Q relations given by the equivalent thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) formulation of the problem in the repulsive regime. Though the equations are derived in the repulsive regime at discrete values of the coupling constant, a straightforward analytical continuation ensures their validity within the whole repulsive regime of the theory. For the NLIE I formulation, appropriate analytical continuation makes the penetration into the attractive regime also possible. However, the magnitude of this penetration is restricted by the spin of the largest spin conserved charge contained in the Gibbs ensemble. Within their range of validity, these NLIE formulations provide efficient theoretical frameworks for computing expectation values of conserved charge densities, their associated currents, and vertex operators and their descendants, with respect to the generalized Gibbs ensemble.</description>

      <title>Self-organization, Memory and Learning: From Driven Disordered Systems to Living Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered systems subject to a fluctuating environment can self-organize into a complex history-dependent response, retaining a memory of the driving. In sheared amorphous solids, self-organization is established by the emergence of a persistent system of mechanical instabilities that can repeatedly be triggered by the driving, leading to a state of high mechanical reversibility. As a result of self-organization, the response of the system becomes correlated with the dynamics of its environment, which can be viewed as a sensing mechanism of the system's environment. Such phenomena emerge across a wide variety of soft matter systems, suggesting that they are generic and hence may depend very little on the underlying specifics. We review self-organization in driven amorphous solids, concluding with a discussion of what self-organization in driven disordered systems can teach us about how simple organisms sense and adapt to their changing environments.</description>

      <title>Scaling flow-based approaches for topology sampling in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a methodology based on out-of-equilibrium simulations to mitigate topological freezing when approaching the continuum limit of lattice gauge theories. We reduce the autocorrelation of the topological charge employing open boundary conditions, while removing exactly their unphysical effects using a non-equilibrium Monte Carlo approach in which periodic boundary conditions are gradually switched on. We perform a detailed analysis of the computational costs of this strategy in the case of the four-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ Yang-Mills theory. After achieving full control of the scaling, we outline a clear strategy to sample topology efficiently in the continuum limit, which we check at lattice spacings as small as $0.045$ fm. We also generalize this approach by designing a customized Stochastic Normalizing Flow for evolutions in the boundary conditions, obtaining superior performances with respect to the purely stochastic non-equilibrium approach, and paving the way for more efficient future flow-based solutions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Asymmetry in Bosonic Gaussian Systems: A Resource-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of symmetries and Gaussianity in bosonic systems, under closed and open dynamics, and develop a resource theory of Gaussian asymmetry. Specifically, we focus on Gaussian symmetry-respecting (covariant) operations, which serve as the free operations in this framework. We prove that any such operation can be realized via Gaussian Hamiltonians that respect the symmetry under consideration, coupled to an environment prepared in a symmetry-respecting pure Gaussian state. We further identify a family of tractable monotone functions of states that remain non-increasing under Gaussian symmetry-respecting dynamics, and are exactly conserved in closed systems. We demonstrate that these monotones are not generally respected under non-Gaussian symmetry-respecting dynamics. Along the way, we provide several technical results of independent interest to the quantum information and optics communities, including a new approach to the Stinespring dilation theorem, and an extension of Williamson's theorem for the simultaneous normal mode decomposition of Gaussian systems and conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Universal Random Matrix Behavior of a Fermionic Quantum Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of universal governing principles is a foundational endeavor in physics, driving breakthroughs from thermodynamics to general relativity and quantum mechanics. In 1951, Wigner introduced the concept of a statistical description of energy levels of heavy atoms, which led to the rise of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) in physics. The theory successfully captured spectral properties across a wide range of atomic systems, circumventing the complexities of quantum many-body interactions. Rooted in the fundamental principles of stochasticity and symmetry, RMT has since found applications and revealed universal laws in diverse physical contexts, from quantum field theory to disordered systems and wireless communications. A particularly compelling application arises in describing the mathematical structure of the many-body wavefunction of non-interacting Fermi gases, which underpins a complex spatial organization driven by Pauli's exclusion principle. However, experimental validation of the counting statistics predicted in such systems has remained elusive. Here, we probe at the single-atom level ultracold atomic Fermi gases made of two interacting spin states, obtaining direct access to their counting statistics in situ. Our measurements show that, while the system is strongly attractive, each spin-component is extremely well described by RMT predictions based on Fredholm determinants. Our results constitutes the first experimental validation of the Fermi-sphere point process through the lens of RMT, and establishes its relevance for strongly-interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Proof of the absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain and its anisotropic extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that, within this class, the only integrable systems are those that have been solved by the Bethe ansatz method, and that all other systems are nonintegrable, in the sense that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. Here, "nontrivial" excludes quantities like the Hamiltonian or the total magnetization, and "local" refers to sums of operators that act only on sites within a finite distance. This result establishes the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model and, consequently, demonstrates that the quantum many-body scars observed in this model emerge independently of any conservation laws of local quantities. Furthermore, we extend the proof of nonintegrability to more general spin-1 models that encompass anisotropic extensions of the bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian, and completely classify the integrability of generic Hamiltonians that possess translational symmetry, $U(1)$ symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and spin-flip symmetry. Our result accomplishes a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</description>

      <title>Learning the Renyi entropy of multiple disjoint intervals in transverse-field quantum Ising models with restricted Boltzmann machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals are computed from the improved swapping operations by two methods: one is from the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and the other one is from the state-of-the-art machine learning method with neural networks. We use the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model in one-dimension to demonstrate the strategy of the improved swapping operation. In particular, we study the second Renyi entropy with two, three and four disjoint intervals. We find that the results from the above two methods match each other very well within errors, which indicates that the machine learning method is applicable for calculating the Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals. Moreover, as the magnetic field increases, the Renyi entropy grows as well until the system arrives at the critical point of the phase transition. However, as the magnetic field exceeds the critical value, the Renyi entropy will decrease since the system enters the paramagnetic phase. Overall, these results match the theoretical predictions very well and demonstrate the high accuracy of the machine learning methods with neural networks.</description>

      <title>Pilot-waves and copilot-particles: A nonstochastic approach to objective wavefunction collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We seek an extension to Schrodinger's equation that incorporates the macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. We find that a suitable hybrid between two leading approaches, the Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse theories, accomplishes this goal in a way that is consistent with Born's rule. Our theory posits that the Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schrodinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, which causes the wavefunction to eventually localizes. This proposed loss of ergodicity mechanism recasts one of the foundational postulate of quantum mechanics as a emergent feature and has important implications regarding the feasibility of large-scale quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)-a dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians coupled to entropy-induced dissipation-to paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium systems. Concretely, we construct NNET realizations for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction (oscillatory), the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model (spiking), and the Lorenz and Chen systems (chaotic), and analyze their dynamical and thermodynamic signatures. Across all cases the velocity field cleanly decomposes into a reversible Nambu part and an irreversible entropygradient part, anchored by a model-independent quasi-conserved quantity. This construction reproduces cycles, spikes, and strange-attractor behavior and clarifies transitions among steady, periodic, and chaotic regimes via cross-model diagnostics. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a unified, quantitatively consistent framework for oscillatory, spiking, and chaotic non-equilibrium systems, offering a systematic description beyond the scope of linear-response theories such as Onsager's relations or GENERIC.</description>

Abstract: Phase-field methods offer a versatile computational framework for simulating large-scale morphological evolution. However, the applicability and predictability of phase-field models are inherently limited by their ad hoc nature, and there is currently no version of this approach that enables truly first-principles predictive modeling of large-scale non-equilibrium processes. Here, we present a bottom-up framework that provides a route to the construction of mesoscopic phase-field models entirely based on atomistic information. Leveraging molecular coarse-graining, we describe the formulation of an order parameter-based free energy functional appropriate for a phase-field description via the enhanced sampling of rare events. We demonstrate our approach on ice nucleation dynamics, achieving a spatiotemporal scale-up of nearly $10^8$ times compared to the microscopic model. Our framework offers a unique approach for incorporating atomistic details into mesoscopic models and systematically bridges the gap between microscopic particle-based simulations and field-theoretic models.</description>

Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here, we show how a topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm would fail. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized multimodal stationary phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the single-mode and bimodal phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of the steady-state peaks.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of AC sensors based on Floquet time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of general Floquet Time Crystals (FTCs), including prethermal ones, in closed systems acting as AC sensors. We provide an analytical treatment of their quantum Fisher information (QFI) dynamics, which characterizes the ultimate sensor accuracy. By tuning the direction and frequency of the AC field, we show how to induce transitions resonantly between macroscopic paired cat states in the FTC sensor. This allows for robust Heisenberg scaling precision (QFI $\sim N^2 t^2$) for exponentially long times in the system size. The QFI dynamics exhibit, moreover, a characteristic step-like structure in time due to the eventual dephasing along the cat subspaces. The behavior is discussed for various initial sensor preparations, including ground states and low- and high-correlated states. Furthermore, we examine the performance of the sensor along the FTC phase transition; with the QFI capturing its critical exponents. Our findings are presented for both linear and nonlinear response regimes and illustrated for a specific FTC based on the long-range interacting LMG model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the puzzles left open by energetic analyses of irreversible stochastic processes is that boundary conditions that prevent the performance of work or the dissipation of heat make no contribution to an entropy-production budget; yet we see ubiquitously in both engineered and living systems that both transient and persistent energy costs are paid to create and maintain such boundaries. We wish to know whether there are inherent limits for the costs of such phenomena, and common units in which those can be traded off against more familiar costs measured in terms of heat dissipation. We give this problem a concrete framing in the context of CRNs, for the problem of extracting a topologically restricted pathway from a larger distributed network, through activation of some reactions and selective elimination of others. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a NESS, and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we make use of their formal equivalence to electrical circuits. We prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. For small CRNs, we show how catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms can drastically alter pathway costs, enabling unfavorable pathways to become favorable and approach the cost of the hosting pathway. Our results provide insights into the thermodynamic principles governing open CRNs and offer a foundation for understanding the evolution of metabolic networks.</description>

      <title>Fundamental measure theory for predicting many-body correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-body correlation functions within various Fundamental Measure Theory (FMT) formulations and compare their predictions to Monte Carlo simulations of hard-sphere fluids. FMT accurately captures the qualitative behavior of three- and four-body structure, particularly at low and intermediate wavevectors. At higher wavevectors, the predictions of FMT vary in quantitative accuracy. We show that the dominant contributions to the four-point structure factor arise from direct triplet correlations, allowing the evaluation of four-point correlations to be greatly simplified. In glass-forming liquids at high volume fractions, FMT correctly reproduces deviations from the convolution approximation, highlighting FMT's ability to capture growing structural multipoint correlations upon supercooling.</description>

      <title>Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of quantum processes: An operational framework for free energy and reversible athermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation, and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Noise Models and Optimal Thresholds of the 3D Toric Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes offer the advantage of supporting fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford gates, yet their performance against realistic noise remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on the paradigmatic 3D toric code and investigate its fault-tolerance thresholds in the presence of both Pauli and measurement errors. Two randomly coupled lattice gauge models that describe the code's correctability are derived, including a random 2-form $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. By exploiting a generalized duality technique, we show that the 3D toric code exhibits optimal thresholds of $p^{X,M}_{th} \approx 11\%$ and $p^{Z,M}_{th} \approx 2\%$ against bit-flip and phase-flip errors, respectively. These threshold values show modest reductions compared to the case of perfect measurements, establishing the robustness of the 3D toric code against measurement errors. Our results constitute a substantial advance towards assessing the practical performance of 3D topological codes. This contribution is timely and in high demand, as rapid hardware advancements are bringing complex codes into experimental reach. Moreover, our work highlights the interdisciplinary nature of fault-tolerant quantum computation and holds significant interest for quantum information science, high-energy physics, and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics of deep learning: Optimal learning of a multi-layer perceptron near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it.</description>

      <title>Distinct Types of Parent Hamiltonians for Quantum States: Insights from the $W$ State as a Quantum Many-Body Scar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of parent Hamiltonians that possess a given state as their ground state is a well-studied problem. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates. These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians. Motivated by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS.</description>
