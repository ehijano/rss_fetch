      <title>Invariant transports of stationary random measures: asymptotic variance, hyperuniformity, and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider invariant transports of stationary random measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and establish natural mixing criteria that guarantee persistence of asymptotic variances. To check our mixing assumptions, which are based on two-point Palm probabilities, we combine factorial moment expansion with stopping set techniques, among others. We complement our results by providing formulas for the Bartlett spectral measure of the destinations. We pay special attention to the case of a vanishing asymptotic variance, known as hyperuniformity. By constructing suitable transports from a hyperuniform source we are able to rigorously establish hyperuniformity for many point processes and random measures. On the other hand, our method can also refute hyperuniformity. For instance, we show that finitely many steps of Lloyd's algorithm or of a random organization model preserve the asymptotic variance if we start from a Poisson process or a point process with exponentially fast decaying correlation. Finally, we define a hyperuniformerer that turns any ergodic point process with finite intensity into a hyperuniform process by randomizing each point within its cell of a fair partition.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rotationally invariant polynomial root sets under iterated differentiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We associate to an $N$-sample of a given rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_0$ with compact support in the complex plane, a polynomial $P_N$ with roots given by the sample. Then, for $t \in (0,1)$, we consider the empirical measure $\mu_t^{N}$ associated to the root set of the $\lfloor t N\rfloor$-th derivative of $P_N$.
  A question posed by O'Rourke and Steinerberger \cite{o2021nonlocal}, reformulated as a conjecture by Hoskins and Kabluchko \cite{hoskins2021dynamics}, and recently reaffirmed by Campbell, O'Rourke and Renfrew \cite{campbell2024fractional}, states that under suitable conditions of regularity on $\mu_0$, for an i.i.d. sample,
  $\mu_t^{N}$ converges to a rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_t$ when $N$ tends to infinity, and that $(1-t)\mu_t$ has a radial density
  $x \mapsto \psi(x,t)$ satisfying the following partial differential equation:
  \begin{equation} \label{PDErotational}
  \frac{ \partial \psi(x,t) }{\partial t} = \frac{ \partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{ \psi(x,t) }{ \frac{1}{x} \int_0^x \psi(y,t) dy } \right),
  \end{equation} In \cite{hoskins2021dynamics}, this equation is reformulated as an equation on the distribution function $\Psi_t$ of the radial part of $(1-t) \mu_t$: \begin{equation} \label{equationPsixtabstract} \frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial t} = x \frac{\frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial x} } {\Psi_t(x)} - 1. \end{equation} Restricting our study to a specific family of $N$-samplings, we are able to prove a variant of the conjecture above. We also emphasize the important differences between the two-dimensional setting and the one-dimensional setting, illustrated in our Theorem \ref{monotonicity}.</description>

      <title>Remarks on multi-period martingale optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structural properties of multi-period martingale optimal transport (MOT). We develop new tools to address these problems, and use them to prove several uniqueness and structural results on three-period martingale optimal transport. More precisely, we establish lemmas on how and when two-period martingale couplings may be glued together to obtain multi-period martingales and which among these glueings are optimal for particular MOT problems. We use these optimality results to study limits of solutions under convergence of the cost function and obtain a corresponding linearization of the optimal cost. We go on to establish a complete characterization of limiting solutions in a three-period problem as the interaction between two of the variables vanishes. Under additional assumptions, we show uniqueness of the solution and a structural result which yields the solution essentially explicitly. For the full three-period problem, we also obtain several structural and uniqueness results under a variety of different assumptions on the marginals and cost function.
  We illustrate our results with a real world application, providing approximate model independent upper and lower bounds for options depending on Amazon stock prices at three different times. We compare these bounds to prices computed using certain models.</description>

      <title>Stochastic maximum principle for optimal control problem of non exchangeable mean field systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Pontryagin maximum principle by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for a class of optimal control problems arising in non exchangeable mean field systems, where agents interact through heterogeneous and asymmetric couplings. Our analysis leads to a collection of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDE) of non exchangeable mean field type. Under suitable assumptions, we establish the solvability of this system. As an illustration, we consider the linear-quadratic case, where the optimal control is characterized by an infinite dimensional system of Riccati equations.</description>

      <title>Deformations of OP ensembles in a bulk critical scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study orthogonal polynomial ensembles whose weights are deformations of exponential weights, in the limit of a large number of particles. The deformation symbols we consider affect local fluctuations of the ensemble around a bulk point of the limiting spectrum. We identify the limiting kernel in terms of a solution to an integrable non-local differential equation. This novel kernel is the correlation kernel of a conditional thinned process starting from the Sine point process, and it is also related to a finite temperature deformation of the Sine kernel as recently studied by Claeys and Tarricone. We also unravel the effect of the deformation on the recurrence coefficients of the associated orthogonal polynomials, which display oscillatory behavior even in a one-cut regular situation for the limiting spectrum.</description>

Abstract: A Mizohata-Takeuchi type estimate is a type of weighted Fourier restriction estimate. Using tools from high dimensional probability, we construct a large class of weights that satisfy sharp estimates of Mizohata-Takeuchi type. One can interpret our result as saying that with high probability, a generic weight satisfies a sharp inequality of Mizohata-Takeuchi type (up to an epsilon-loss).</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization for Continuous-time Linear-Quadratic Graphon Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning, despite its popularity and empirical success, faces significant scalability challenges in large-population dynamic games. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) offer a principled framework for approximating such games while capturing heterogeneity among players. In this paper, we propose and analyze a policy optimization framework for continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs. Exploiting the structural properties of GMFGs, we design an efficient policy parameterization in which each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their private state, with a shared slope function and player-specific intercepts. We develop a bilevel optimization algorithm that alternates between policy gradient updates for best-response computation under a fixed population distribution, and distribution updates using the resulting policies. We prove linear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and establish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium. The analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over infinite-dimensional policy spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under varying graphon structures, noise levels, and action frequencies.</description>

      <title>Convergence of linear programming hierarchies for Gibbs states of spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly. Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$, where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Geometric inequalities, stability results and Kendall's problem in spherical space</title>

      <description>arXiv:1709.06522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Euclidean space, the asymptotic shape of large cells in various types of Poisson driven random tessellations has been the subject of a famous conjecture due to David Kendall. Since shape is a geometric concept and large cells are identified by means of geometric size functionals, the resolution of the conjecture is inevitably connected with geometric inequalities of isoperimetric type and their improvements in the form of geometric stability results, relating geometric size functionals and hitting functionals. The latter are deterministic characteristics of the underlying random tessellation. The current work explores specific and typical cells of random tessellations in spherical space. A key ingredient of our approach are new geometric inequalities and quantitative strengthenings in terms of stability results for quite general and some specific size and hitting functionals of spherically convex bodies. As a consequence we obtain probabilistic deviation inequalities and asymptotic distributions of quite general size functionals. In contrast to the Euclidean setting, where the asymptotic regime concerns large size, in the spherical framework the asymptotic analysis is concerned with high intensities.</description>

      <title>On the long-time behaviour of reversible interacting particle systems in one and two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By refining Holley's free energy technique, we show that, under quite general assumptions on the dynamics, the attractor of a (possibly non-translation-invariant) interacting particle system in one or two spatial dimensions is contained in the set of Gibbs measures if the dynamics admits a reversible Gibbs measure. In particular, this implies that there can be no reversible interacting particle system that exhibits time-periodic behaviour and that every reversible interacting particle system is ergodic if and only if the reversible Gibbs measure is unique. In the special case of non-attractive stochastic Ising models this answers a question due to Liggett.</description>

We assume the branching rate measure $\mu$ is in the Kato class and $\mu$ has a compact support on ${\mathbb R}^d$. We show that the maximal displacement exponentially grows and its order is determined by the index $\alpha$ and the spectral bottom of the corresponding Schr\"odinger-type operator.</description>

      <title>Computable Bounds on Convergence of Markov Chains in Wasserstein Distance via Contractive Drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework to estimate the convergence of Markov chains to equilibrium in Wasserstein distance. The framework can provide convergence bounds with rates ranging from polynomial to exponential, all derived from a contractive drift condition that integrates not only contraction and drift but also coupling and metric design. The resulting bounds are computable, as they contain simple constants, one-step transition expectations, but no equilibrium-related quantities. We introduce the large M technique and the boundary removal technique to enhance the applicability of the framework, which is further enhanced by deep learning in Qu, Blanchet and Glynn (2024). We apply the framework to non-contractive or even expansive Markov chains arising from queueing theory, stochastic optimization, and Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of large structured random matrices characterized by four fundamental properties which we discuss. We prove that this class is stable under matrix-valued and pointwise non-linear operations. We then formulate an efficient method, based on an extremization problem, for computing the spectrum of subblocks of such large structured random matrices. We present different proofs -- combinatorial or algebraic -- of the validity of this method, which all have some connection with free probability. We illustrate this method with well known examples of unstructured matrices, including Haar randomly rotated matrices, as well as with the example of structured random matrices arising in the quantum symmetric simple exclusion process. tured random matrices arising in the quantum symmetric simple exclusion process.</description>

Abstract: We consider again the fast-slow motions setups in the continuous time $\frac {dX_N(t)}{dt}=N^{1/2} \sig(X_N(t))(\xi(tN))+b(X_N(t)),\, t\in [0,T]$ and the discrete time $X_N((n+1)/N)=X_N(n/N)+N^{-1/2}\sig(X_N(n/N))\xi(n)+N^{-1}b(X_N(n/N)),\, n=0,1,...,[TN]$ where $\sig$ and $b$ are smooth matrix and vector functions, respectively, $\xi$ is a centered vector stationary stochastic process with weak dependence in time and $N$ is a big parameter. We obtain estimates for the almost
  sure approximations of the process $X_N$ by certain diffusion process $\Sig$. In \cite{FK} and in other recent
  papers concerning similar setups the results were obtained relying fully on the rough paths theory. Here we derive
  our probabilistic results as corollaries of quite general deterministic estimates which are obtained with all details
  provided following somewhat ideology of the rough paths theory but not relying on this theory per se
  which should allow a more general readership to follow complete arguments.</description>

Abstract: Consider the stationary measure of open asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on the lattice $\{1,\dots,n\}$. Taking $n$ to infinity while fixing the jump rates, this measure converges to a measure on the semi-infinite lattice. In the high and low density phases, we characterize the limiting measure and provide bounds on the convergence rates in total variation distance. Our approach involves bounding the total variation distance using generating functions, which are further estimated through a subtle analysis of the atom masses of Askey-Wilson signed measures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17472v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time system of n coupled random vectors, a.k.a. interacting particles. The dynamics involve a vanishing step size, some random centered perturbations, and a mean vector field which induces the coupling between the particles. We study the doubly asymptotic regime where both the number of iterations and the number n of particles tend to infinity, without any constraint on the relative rates of convergence of these two parameters. We establish that the empirical measure of the interpolated trajectories of the particles converges in probability, in an ergodic sense, to the set of recurrent Mc-Kean-Vlasov distributions. A first application example is the granular media equation, where the particles are shown to converge to a critical point of the Helmholtz energy. A second example is the convergence of stochastic gradient descent to the global minimizer of the risk, in a wide two-layer neural networks using random features.</description>

      <title>Normal approximation of Functionals of Point Processes: Application to Hawkes Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an explicit upper bound for the Wasserstein distance between a functional of point processes and a Gaussian distribution. Using Stein's method in conjunction with Malliavin's calculus and the Poisson embedding representation, our result applies to a variety of point processes including discrete and continuous Hawkes processes. In particular, we establish an explicit convergence rate for stable continuous non-linear Hawkes processes and for discrete Hawkes processes. Finally, we obtain an upper bound in the context of nearly unstable Hawkes processes.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of discounted tree sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(V(u),\, u\in \mathcal{T})$ be a (supercritical) branching random walk and $(\eta_u,\,u\in \mathcal{T})$ be marks on the vertices of the tree, distributed in an i.i.d.\ fashion. Following Aldous and Bandyopadhyay \cite{AB05}, for each infinite ray $\xi$ of the tree, we associate the {\it discounted tree sum} $D(\xi)$ which is the sum of the $e^{-V(u)}\eta_u$ taken along the ray. The paper deals with the finiteness of $\sup_\xi D(\xi)$. To this end, we study the extreme behaviour of the local time processes of the paths $(V(u),\,u\in \xi)$. It answers a question of Nicolas Curien, and partially solves Open Problem 31 of Aldous and Bandyopadhyay \cite{AB05}. We also present several open questions.</description>

      <title>A Proof of The Changepoint Detection Threshold Conjecture in Preferential Attachment Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of detecting and estimating a changepoint in the attachment function of a network evolving according to a preferential attachment model on $n$ vertices, using only a single final snapshot of the network. Bet et al.~\cite{bet2023detecting} show that a simple test based on thresholding the number of vertices with minimum degrees can detect the changepoint when the change occurs at time $n-\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. They further make the striking conjecture that detection becomes impossible for any test if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$ Kaddouri et al.~\cite{kaddouri2024impossibility} make a step forward by proving the detection is impossible if the change occurs at time $n-o(n^{1/3}).$ In this paper, we resolve the conjecture affirmatively, proving that detection is indeed impossible if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$ Furthermore, we establish that estimating the changepoint with an error smaller than $o(\sqrt{n})$ is also impossible, thereby confirming that the estimator proposed in Bhamidi et al.~\cite{bhamidi2018change} is order-optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider some matrix waiting for its coefficients to be written. For each column, sample independently one Bernoulli random variable of some parameter $p$. Seeing all this and possibly using extra randomness, Alice then chooses one spot in each column, in any way she wants. When the Bernoulli random variable of some column is equal to 1, the number 1 is written in the chosen spot. When the Bernoulli random variable of a column is 0, nothing is done on this column. We prove that, using extra randomness, it is possible for Bob to fill the empty spots with well chosen 0's and 1's so that the entries of the matrix are independent Bernoulli random variables of parameter $p$. We investigate various generalisations and variations of this problem, and use this result to revisit and generalise (nonstrict) monotonicity of the percolation threshold $p_c$ with respect to some sort of graph-quotienting, namely fibrations.
  In a second part, which is independent of the first one, we revisit strict monotonicity of $p_c$ with respect to fibrations, a result that naturally requires more assumptions than its nonstrict counterpart. We reprove the bond-percolation case of the result of Martineau and Severo without resorting to essential enhancements, using couplings instead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the critical long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}$, where an edge connects $i$ and $j$ independently with probability $1-\exp\{-\beta\int_i^{i+1}\int_j^{j+1}|u-v|^{-2}{\rm d} u{\rm d} v\}$ for $|i-j|&gt;1$ for some fixed $\beta&gt;0$ and with probability 1 for $|i-j|=1$. Viewing this as a random electric network where each edge has a unit conductance, we show that the effective resistances from 0 to $[-n,n]^c$ and from the interval $[-n,n]$ to $[-2n,2n]^c$ (conditioned on no edge joining $[-n,n]$ and $[-2n,2n]^c$) both grow like $n^{\delta(\beta)}$ for some $\delta(\beta)\in (0,1)$.</description>

Abstract: Consider the critical long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}$, where an edge connects $i$ and $j$ independently with probability $1-\exp\{-\beta\int_i^{i+1}\int_j^{j+1}|u-v|^{-2}d ud v\}$ for $|i-j|&gt;1$ for some fixed $\beta&gt;0$ and with probability 1 for $|i-j|=1$. We prove that both the quenched and annealed spectral dimensions of the associated simple random walk are $2/(1+\delta)$, where $\delta\in (0,1)$ is the exponent of the effective resistance in the LRP model, as derived in [10, Theorem 1.1]. Our work addresses an open question from [7, Section 5].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a transfer principle to study the adapted 2-Wasserstein distance between stochastic processes. First, we obtain an explicit formula for the distance between real-valued mean-square continuous Gaussian processes by introducing the causal factorization as an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Cholesky decomposition for operators on Hilbert spaces. We discuss the existence and uniqueness of this causal factorization and link it to the canonical representation of Gaussian processes. As a byproduct, we characterize mean-square continuous Gaussian Volterra processes in terms of their natural filtrations. Moreover, for real-valued fractional stochastic differential equations, we show that the synchronous coupling between the driving fractional noises attains the adapted Wasserstein distance under some monotonicity conditions. Our results cover a wide class of stochastic processes which are neither Markov processes nor semi-martingales, including fractional Brownian motions and fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quasi-linear stochastic wave and heat equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d\in \{1,2,3\}$ and $d\geq 1$, respectively, and perturbed by an additive Gaussian noise which is white in time and has a homogeneous spatial correlation with spectral measure $\mu_n$. We allow the Fourier transform of $\mu_n$ to be a genuine distribution. Let $u^n$ be the mild solution to these equations. We provide sufficient conditions on the measures $\mu_n$ and the initial data to ensure that $u^n$ converges in law, in the space of continuous functions, to the solution of our equations driven by a noise with spectral measure $\mu$, where $\mu_n\to\mu$ in some sense. We apply our main result to various types of noises, such as the anisotropic fractional noise. We also show that we cover existing results in the literature, such as the case of Riesz kernels and the fractional noise with $d=1$.</description>

Abstract: The probability that a zero of a random real polynomial of increasing degree is real tends to zero. However, passing from polynomials to Laurent polynomials yields a surprising result: the probability that a root is real tends not to zero, but to $1/\sqrt{3}$. A similar phenomenon has also been observed for systems of Laurent polynomials in several variables. By considering Laurent polynomials as functions associated with torus representations, we describe an analogous phenomenon for representations of any reductive linear group. In the case of a simple group, we provide a formula for the aforementioned limiting probability.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Dimensional Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have had a profound impact on many application areas, including those where data are intrinsically infinite-dimensional, such as images or time series. The standard approach is first to discretize and then to apply diffusion models to the discretized data. While such approaches are practically appealing, the performance of the resulting algorithms typically deteriorates as discretization parameters are refined. In this paper, we instead directly formulate diffusion-based generative models in infinite dimensions and apply them to the generative modelling of functions. We prove that our formulations are well posed in the infinite-dimensional setting and provide dimension-independent distance bounds from the sample to the target measure. Using our theory, we also develop guidelines for the design of infinite-dimensional diffusion models. For image distributions, these guidelines are in line with current canonical choices. For other distributions, however, we can improve upon these canonical choices. We demonstrate these results both theoretically and empirically, by applying the algorithms to data distributions on manifolds and to distributions arising in Bayesian inverse problems or simulation-based inference.</description>

Abstract: The envelope of an elliptical Gaussian complex vector, or equivalently, the amplitude or norm of a bivariate normal random vector has application in many weather and signal processing contexts. We explicitly characterize its distribution in the general case through its probability density, cumulative distribution and moment generating function. Moments and limiting distributions are also derived. These derivations are exploited to also characterize the special cases where the bivariate Gaussian mean vector and covariance matrix have a simpler structure, providing new additional insights in many cases. Simulations illustrate the benefits of using our formulae over Monte Carlo methods. We also use our derivations to get a better initial characterization of the distribution of the observed values in structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets, and of wind speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of multijet for functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which extends the classical notion of jets in the sense that the multijet of a function is defined by contact conditions at several points. For all $p \geq 1$ we build a vector bundle of $p$-multijets, defined over a well-chosen compactification of the configuration space of $p$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^n$. As an application, we prove that the linear statistics associated with the zero set of a centered Gaussian field on a Riemannian manifold have a finite $p$-th moment as soon as the field is of class~$\mathcal{C}^p$ and its $(p-1)$-jet is nowhere degenerate. We prove a similar result for the linear statistics associated with the critical points of a Gaussian field and those associated with the vanishing locus of a holomorphic Gaussian field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global convergence of a Fisher-Rao policy gradient flow for infinite-horizon entropy-regularised Markov decision processes with Polish state and action space. The flow is a continuous-time analogue of a policy mirror descent method. We establish the global well-posedness of the gradient flow and demonstrate its exponential convergence to the optimal policy. Moreover, we prove the flow is stable with respect to gradient evaluation, offering insights into the performance of a natural policy gradient flow with log-linear policy parameterisation. To overcome challenges stemming from the lack of the convexity of the objective function and the discontinuity arising from the entropy regulariser, we leverage the performance difference lemma and the duality relationship between the gradient and mirror descent flows. Our analysis provides a theoretical foundation for developing various discrete policy gradient algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Positive Semidefinite Safe Approximation of Multivariate Distributionally Robust Constraints Determined by Simple Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-level reformulations of (non-convex) distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems are often intractable, as they contain semiinfinite dual constraints. Based on such a semiinfinite reformulation, we present a safe approximation, that allows for the computation of feasible solutions for DROs that depend on nonconvex multivariate simple functions. Moreover, the approximation allows to address ambiguity sets that can incorporate information on moments as well as confidence sets. The typical strong assumptions on the structure of the underlying constraints, such as convexity in the decisions or concavity in the uncertainty found in the literature were, at least in part, recently overcome in [9]. We start from the duality-based reformulation approach in [9] that can be applied for DRO constraints based on simple functions that are univariate in the uncertainty parameters. We significantly extend their approach to multivariate simple functions which leads to a considerably wider applicability of the proposed reformulation approach. In order to achieve algorithmic tractability, the presented safe approximation is then realized by a discretized counterpart for the semiinfinite dual constraints. The approximation leads to a computationally tractable mixed-integer positive semidefinite problem for which state-of-the-art software implementations are readily available. The tractable safe approximation provides sufficient conditions for distributional robustness of the original problem, i.e., obtained solutions are provably robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We call a continuous path of polygons decreasing if the convex hulls of the polygons form a decreasing family of sets. For an arbitrary polygon of more than three vertices, we characterize the polygons contained in it that can be reached by a decreasing path (attainability problem), and we show that this can be done by a finite application of "pull-in" moves (bang-bang problem). In the case of triangles, this problems was investigated by Goodman, Johansen, Ramsey, and Frydman among others, in connection with the embeddability problem for non-homogeneous Markov processes.</description>

Abstract: For the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, two classes of algorithms have been widely studied in the literature: convex approaches based on nuclear norm minimization, and non-convex approaches that use factorized gradient descent. Under certain statistical model assumptions, it is known that nuclear norm minimization recovers the ground truth as soon as the number of samples scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom of the ground truth. In contrast, while non-convex approaches are computationally less expensive, existing recovery guarantees assume that the number of samples scales at least quadratically with the rank $r$ of the ground-truth matrix. In this paper, we close this gap by showing that the non-convex approaches can be as efficient as nuclear norm minimization in terms of sample complexity. Namely, we consider the problem of reconstructing a positive semidefinite matrix from a few Gaussian measurements. We show that factorized gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the ground truth with a linear rate as soon as the number of samples scales with $ \Omega (rd\kappa^2)$, where $d$ is the dimension, and $\kappa$ is the condition number of the ground truth matrix. This improves the previous rank-dependence in the sample complexity of non-convex matrix factorization from quadratic to linear. Our proof relies on a probabilistic decoupling argument, where we show that the gradient descent iterates are only weakly dependent on the individual entries of the measurement matrices. We expect that our proof technique is of independent interest for other non-convex problems.</description>

      <title>Renormalising Feynman diagrams with multi-indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a method to obtain the renormalised measure in quantum field theory directly from the renormalisation of the expansion of the original measure. Our approach is based on BPHZ renormalisation via multi-indices, a combinatorial structure extremely successful for describing scalar-valued singular SPDEs. We propose the multi-indices counterpart to the Hopf algebraic program initiated by Connes and Kreimer for the renormalisation of Feynman diagrams. This new Hopf algebra also bridges the gap between the analysis of "pre-Feynman diagrams" and traditional diagrammatic methods. The construction relies on a well-chosen extraction-contraction coproduct of multi-indices equipped with a correct symmetry factor. We illustrate our method by the $ \Phi^4 $ measure example.</description>

Abstract: We consider the number of common edges in two independent random spanning trees of a graph $G$. For complete graphs $K_n$, we give a new proof of the fact, originally obtained by Moon, that the distribution converges to a Poisson distribution with expected value $2$. This is applied to show a Poisson limit law for the number of common edges in two independent random spanning trees of an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ for constant~$p$. We also use the same method to prove an analogous result for complete multipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Estimating stationary mass, frequency by frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose we observe a trajectory of length $n$ from an exponentially $\alpha$-mixing stochastic process over a finite but potentially large state space. We consider the problem of estimating the probability mass placed by the stationary distribution of any such process on elements that occur with a certain frequency in the observed sequence. We estimate this vector of probabilities in total variation distance, showing universal consistency in $n$ and recovering known results for i.i.d. sequences as special cases. Our proposed methodology -- implementable in linear time -- carefully combines the plug-in (or empirical) estimator with a recently-proposed modification of the Good--Turing estimator called WingIt, which was originally developed for Markovian sequences. En route to controlling the error of our estimator, we develop new performance bounds on WingIt and the plug-in estimator for exponentially $\alpha$-mixing stochastic processes. Importantly, the extensively used method of Poissonization can no longer be applied in our non i.i.d. setting, and so we develop complementary tools -- including concentration inequalities for a natural self-normalized statistic of mixing sequences -- that may prove independently useful in the design and analysis of estimators for related problems. Simulation studies corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Conditioning Diffusions Using Malliavin Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In generative modelling and stochastic optimal control, a central computational task is to modify a reference diffusion process to maximise a given terminal-time reward. Most existing methods require this reward to be differentiable, using gradients to steer the diffusion towards favourable outcomes. However, in many practical settings, like diffusion bridges, the reward is singular, taking an infinite value if the target is hit and zero otherwise. We introduce a novel framework, based on Malliavin calculus and centred around a generalisation of the Tweedie score formula to nonlinear stochastic differential equations, that enables the development of methods robust to such singularities. This allows our approach to handle a broad range of applications, like diffusion bridges, or adding conditional controls to an already trained diffusion model. We demonstrate that our approach offers stable and reliable training, outperforming existing techniques. As a byproduct, we also introduce a novel score matching objective. Our loss functions are formulated such that they could readily be extended to manifold-valued and infinite dimensional diffusions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for a class of planar orthogonal polynomials and truncated unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out the asymptotic analysis as $n \to \infty$ of a class of orthogonal polynomials $p_{n}(z)$ of degree $n$, defined with respect to the planar measure \begin{equation*} d\mu(z) = (1-|z|^{2})^{\alpha-1}|z-x|^{\gamma}\mathbf{1}_{|z| &lt; 1}d^{2}z, \end{equation*} where $d^{2}z$ is the two dimensional area measure, $\alpha$ is a parameter that can grow with $n$, while $\gamma&gt;-2$ and $x&gt;0$ are fixed. This measure arises naturally in the study of characteristic polynomials of non-Hermitian ensembles and generalises the example of a Gaussian weight that was recently studied by several authors. We obtain asymptotics in all regions of the complex plane and via an appropriate differential identity, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of the partition function. The main approach is to convert the planar orthogonality to one defined on suitable contours in the complex plane. Then the asymptotic analysis is performed using the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>
