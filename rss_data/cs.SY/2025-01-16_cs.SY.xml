      <title>Nonlinear Modeling of a PEM Fuel Cell System; a Practical Study with Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a nonlinear six order model is proposed for a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) as a control-oriented electrochemical model. Its validation is performed on a specific single cell PEMFC with effective dimension of 5 cm5 cm. This model is described in the nonlinear state space form with 6 state variables. Load current and DC voltage are considered as measurable disturbance and control input respectively. Besides, the model includes fuel cell stack and its auxiliary components as well. In this survey, a nonlinear state space representation is derived by arranging nonlinear equations and combining them with auxiliary components model. The proposed model can be successfully used to design nonlinear controller and nonlinear observer systems. The analyzed PEMFC system consists of air compressor motor dynamic equations, air and fuel supply subsystems, a perfect air humidifier and a fuel cell stack. An experimentally validated nonlinear model that reproduces the most typical features of a laboratory PEMFC system is presented. This model is derived based on physics law in stack, including system gases dynamics. The objective of this paper is to introduce a fully analytical model which has been fully validated on a fuel cell system and its auxiliary components. The proposed method can be used as a general modeling guideline for control-oriented purposes. Moreover, it can be successfully implemented in composing a dynamic subsystem, like hydrogen subsystem, as part of the whole nonlinear model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rise in inverter-based renewable resources has heightened concerns over subsynchronous resonance and oscillations, thereby challenging grid stability. This paper reviews approaches to identify and mitigate these issues, focusing on frequency scanning methods for stability assessment. It categorizes white-, black-, and gray-box modeling techniques, compares positive-sequence, dq-frame, and alpha-beta domain scanning, and examines perturbation shapes like step, ramp, and chirp. A comparative study highlights their strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific scenarios. By summarizing past events and surveying available tools, this work guides operators and researchers toward more effective, reliable stability analysis methods in grids with high renewable penetration.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents interval prediction methodology to address limitations in existing evaluation indicators and improve prediction accuracy and reliability. First, new evaluation indicators are proposed to comprehensively assess interval prediction methods, considering both all-sample and single-sample scenarios. Second, a novel Pattern-Diversity Conditional Time-Series Generative Adversarial Network (PDCTSGAN) is introduced to generate realistic scenarios, enabling a new interval prediction approach based on scenario generation. The PDCTSGAN model innovatively incorporates modifications to random noise inputs, allowing the generation of pattern-diverse realistic scenarios. These scenarios are further utilized to construct multiple interval patterns with high coverage probability and low average width. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through comprehensive case studies. The paper concludes by highlighting future research directions to further enhance interval prediction methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative interval prediction methodology aimed at addressing the limitations of current evaluation indicators while enhancing prediction accuracy and reliability. To achieve this, new evaluation metrics are proposed, offering a comprehensive assessment of interval prediction methods across both all-sample and single-sample scenarios. Additionally, a novel Pattern-Diversity Conditional Time-Series Generative Adversarial Network (PDCTSGAN) is developed, designed to generate realistic scenarios and support a new interval prediction framework based on scenario generation. The PDCTSGAN model incorporates unique modifications to random noise inputs, enabling the creation of pattern-diverse and realistic scenarios. These scenarios are then utilized to produce multiple interval patterns characterized by high coverage probability and reduced average width. The proposed approach is validated through detailed case studies, and the paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions to further refine interval prediction techniques.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Online Channel Modeling: Challenges,Principles, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from traditional offline channel modeling, digital twin online channel modeling can sense and accurately characterize dynamic wireless channels in real time, and can therefore greatly assist 6G network optimization. This article proposes a novel promising framework and a step-by-step design procedure of digital twin online channel models (DTOCM). By enabling continuous visualization and accurate prediction of dynamic channel variations, DTOCM can synchronize the performance between simulated and real networks. We first explore the evolution and conceptual advancements of DTOCM, highlighting its visions and associated challenges. Then, we explain its operational principles, construction mechanisms, and applications to typical 6G scenarios. Subsequently, the real-time channel information provisioning and visualization capabilities of DTOCM are illustrated through our DTOCM platform based on practical scenarios. Finally, future research directions and open issues are discussed.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on practical stabilization via CLF-based control under measurement noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical stabilization of input-affine systems in the presence of measurement errors and input constraints is considered in this brief note. Assuming that a Lyapunov function and a stabilizing control exist for an input-affine system, the required measurement accuracy at each point of the state space is computed. This is done via the Lyapunov function-based decay condition, which describes along with the input constraints a set of admissible controls. Afterwards, the measurement time points are computed based on the system dynamics. It is shown that between these self-triggered measurement time points, the system evolves and converges into the so-called target ball, i.e. a vicinity of the origin, where it remains. Furthermore, it is shown that the approach ensures the existence of a control law, which is admissible for all possible states and it introduces a connection between measurement time points, measurement accuracy, target ball, and decay. The results of the approach are shown in three examples.</description>

      <title>Cultivating Precision: Comparative Analysis of Sensor-Based Yogurt Fermentation Monitoring Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermented dairy products, including yogurt, are widely consumed for their nutritional and health benefits. While numerous methods exist to monitor and understand yogurt fermentation, the literature lacks an integrated evaluation of diverse sensing approaches within a single experimental framework. To address this gap, this study systematically examines and compares multiple measurement techniques--electrical impedance, DC resistance, pH, optical transparency, carbon dioxide concentration, ambient temperature, and relative humidity--in tracking the yogurt fermentation process. By presenting a unified set of experimental results and assessing each method's observational characteristics, this work offers an encompassing reference point for researchers seeking to understand the relative merits and limitations of different sensing modalities. Rather than establishing definitive guidelines or practical recommendations, the findings provide a foundation for subsequent investigations into sensor-based fermentation monitoring, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of yogurt fermentation dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Generating Synthetic Unbalanced Power Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-world data of power networks is often inaccessible due to privacy and security concerns, highlighting the need for tools to generate realistic synthetic network data. Existing methods leverage geographic tools like OpenStreetMap with heuristic rules to model system topology and typically focus on single-phase, balanced systems, limiting their applicability to real-world distribution systems, which are usually unbalanced. This work proposes a Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) to generate unbalanced three-phase distribution systems learning from existing networks. The scheme takes as input the base topology and aggregated demand per node and outputs a three-phase unbalanced system. The proposed scheme achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than $8\%$ across all phases, with computation times of 20.4 seconds for model training and 3.1 seconds per sample generation. The tool is applied to learn from publicly available SMART-DS dataset and applied to generate European 906 and IEEE-123 systems. We demonstrate the transfer learning capability of the proposed tool by leveraging a model trained on an observed system to generate a synthetic network for an unobserved system. Specifically, the tool is trained using the publicly available SMART-DS dataset and subsequently applied to generate synthetic networks for the European 906-bus system and the IEEE 123-bus system. This tool allows researchers to simulate realistic unbalanced three-phase power data with high accuracy and speed, enhancing planning and operational analysis for modern power grids.</description>

      <title>Achieving Stability and Optimality: Control Strategy for a Wind Turbine Supplying an Electrolyzer in the Islanded Storage-less Microgrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind power generation supplying electrolyzers in islanded microgrids is an essential technical pathway for green hydrogen production, attracting growing attention in the transition towards net zero carbon emissions. Both academia and industry widely recognize that islanded AC microgrids normally rely on battery energy storage systems (BESSs) for grid-forming functions. However, the high cost of BESS significantly increases the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), compromising economic feasibility. To address this challenge and reduce the LCOH, this paper focuses on a wind turbine (WT) supplying an electrolyzer in a storage-less microgrid and identifies a unique characteristic that challenges the conventional understanding of this microgrid: active power is coupled with microgrid voltage rather than frequency, the latter being entirely decoupled from active power balance. Based on this unique characteristic, this paper develops a new control strategy that maintains power balance, stabilizes the voltage and frequency, and maximizes hydrogen production. The effectiveness of the control strategy is validated through case studies conducted in Matlab/Simulink, especially its capability to maintain stability while maximizing hydrogen production under various conditions.</description>

      <title>Processing and Analyzing Real-World Driving Data: Insights on Trips, Scenarios, and Human Driving Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing large volumes of real-world driving data is essential for providing meaningful and reliable insights into real-world trips, scenarios, and human driving behaviors. To this end, we developed a multi-level data processing approach that adds new information, segments data, and extracts desired parameters. Leveraging a confidential but extensive dataset (over 1 million km), this approach leads to three levels of in-depth analysis: trip, scenario, and driving. The trip-level analysis explains representative properties observed in real-world trips, while the scenario-level analysis focuses on scenario conditions resulting from road events that reduce vehicle speed. The driving-level analysis identifies the cause of driving regimes for specific situations and characterizes typical human driving behaviors. Such analyses can support the design of both trip- and scenario-based tests, the modeling of human drivers, and the establishment of guidelines for connected and automated vehicles.</description>

      <title>Integrating Cybersecurity in Predictive Cost-Benefit Power Scheduling: A DeepStack Model with Dynamic Defense Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, deep learning-based predictive model tailored to address wind curtailment in contemporary power systems, while enhancing cybersecurity measures through the implementation of a Dynamic Defense Mechanism (DDM). The augmented BiLSTM architecture facilitates accurate short-term predictions for wind power. In addition, a ConvGAN-driven step for stochastic scenario generation and a hierarchical, multi-stage optimization framework, which includes cases with and without Battery Energy Storage (BES), significantly minimizes operational costs. The inclusion of DDM strategically alters network reactances, thereby obfuscating the system's operational parameters to deter cyber threats. This robust solution not only integrates wind power more efficiently into power grids, leveraging BES potential to improve the economic efficiency of the system, but also boosting the cyber security of the system. Validation using the Illinois 200-bus system demonstrates the model's potential, achieving a 98% accuracy in forecasting and substantial cost reductions of over 3.8%. The results underscore the dual benefits of enhancing system reliability and security through advanced deep learning architectures and the strategic application of cybersecurity measures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Planning in Large-scale Systems Using Hierarchical Finite State Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider optimal planning in a large-scale system formalised as a hierarchical finite state machine (HFSM). A planning algorithm is proposed computing an optimal plan between any two states in the HFSM, consisting of two steps: A pre-processing step that computes optimal exit costs of the machines in the HFSM, with time complexity scaling with the number of machines; and a query step that efficiently computes an optimal plan by removing irrelevant subtrees of the HFSM using the optimal exit costs. The algorithm is reconfigurable in the sense that changes in the HFSM are handled with ease, where the pre-processing step recomputes only the optimal exit costs affected by the change. The algorithm can also exploit compact representations that groups together identical machines in the HFSM, where the algorithm only needs to compute the optimal exit costs for one of the identical machines within each group, thereby avoid unnecessary recomputations. We validate the algorithm on large systems with millions of states and a robotic application. It is shown that our approach outperforms Dijkstra's algorithm, Bidirectional Dijkstra and Contraction Hierarchies.</description>

      <title>CVaR-Based Variational Quantum Optimization for User Association in Handoff-Aware Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient resource allocation is essential for optimizing various tasks in wireless networks, which are usually formulated as generalized assignment problems (GAP). GAP, as a generalized version of the linear sum assignment problem, involves both equality and inequality constraints that add computational challenges. In this work, we present a novel Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)-based Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) framework to address GAP in vehicular networks (VNets). Our approach leverages a hybrid quantum-classical structure, integrating a tailored cost function that balances both objective and constraint-specific penalties to improve solution quality and stability. Using the CVaR-VQE model, we handle the GAP efficiently by focusing optimization on the lower tail of the solution space, enhancing both convergence and resilience on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We apply this framework to a user-association problem in VNets, where our method achieves 23.5% improvement compared to the deep neural network (DNN) approach.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Clutches Enable High-Force Mechanical Multiplexing: Demonstrating Single-Motor Full-Actuation of a 4-DoF Hand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel mechanical multiplexing system powered by electrostatic capstan clutches, enabling high-force, single-motor control of multiple degrees of freedom (DoF). The system is capable of both bidirectional single-input single-output time-division and single-input multiple-output multiplexing to actuate a commercial 4-DoF robotic hand with a single motor. Our mechanical multiplexer is also capable of powerless position holding owing to its use of a leadscrew nut acting as the output. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, achieving individual and simultaneous actuation. This innovation offers a scalable solution for high-DoF robotic systems, providing a path to efficient actuation in robotic platforms.</description>

      <title>Energy Storage Arbitrage Under Price Uncertainty: Market Risks and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the profitability and risk of energy storage arbitrage in electricity markets under price uncertainty, exploring both robust and chance-constrained optimization approaches. We analyze various uncertainty representations, including polyhedral, ellipsoidal uncertainty sets and probabilistic approximations, to model price fluctuations and construct efficient frontiers that highlight the tradeoff between risk and profit. Using historical electricity price data, we quantify the impact of uncertainty on arbitrage strategies and compare their performance under distinct market conditions. The results reveal that arbitrage strategies under uncertainties can effectively secure expected profits, and robust strategies perform better in risk management across varying levels of conservativeness, especially under highly volatile market conditions. This work provides insights into storage arbitrage strategy selection for market participants with differing risk preferences, emphasizing the adaptability of efficient frontiers to the electricity market.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Sampling-Based MPC for Collision Avoidance in Uncertain Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating safely in dynamic and uncertain environments is challenging due to uncertainties in perception and motion. This letter presents C2U-MPPI, a robust sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging the Unscented Model Predictive Path Integral (U-MPPI) control strategy with integrated probabilistic chance constraints, ensuring more reliable and efficient navigation under uncertainty. Unlike gradient-based MPC methods, our approach (i) avoids linearization of system dynamics and directly applies non-convex and nonlinear chance constraints, enabling more accurate and flexible optimization, and (ii) enhances computational efficiency by reformulating probabilistic constraints into a deterministic form and employing a layered dynamic obstacle representation, enabling real-time handling of multiple obstacles. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world human-shared environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm against baseline methods, showcasing its capability to generate feasible trajectories and control inputs that adhere to system dynamics and constraints in dynamic settings, enabled by unscented-based sampling strategy and risk-sensitive trajectory evaluation.

      <description>arXiv:2401.07819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present data-based conditions for enforcing contractivity via feedback control and obtain desired asymptotic properties of the closed-loop system. We focus on unknown nonlinear control systems whose vector fields are expressible via a dictionary of functions and derive data-dependent semidefinite programs whose solution returns the controller that guarantees contractivity. When data are perturbed by disturbances that are linear combinations of sinusoids of known frequencies (but unknown amplitude and phase) and constants, we remarkably obtain conditions for contractivity that do not depend on the magnitude of the disturbances, with imaginable positive consequences for the synthesis of the controller. Finally, we show how to design from data an integral controller for nonlinear systems that achieves constant reference tracking and constant disturbance rejection.</description>

      <title>Implications of Zoning Ordinances for Rural Utility-Scale Solar Deployment and Power System Decarbonization in the Great Lakes Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local zoning ordinances across the United States have the impact of restricting development of energy infrastructure, including utility-scale solar photovoltaics. While these ordinances may be developed for legitimate purposes to protect public health and safety, they could impede or increase costs of power sector decarbonization. We quantify the role of utility-scale solar zoning ordinances on power sector decarbonization across the Great Lakes region (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin) by integrating 6,300 rural community zoning ordinances into a power system planning model. Relative to no ordinances, solar zoning ordinances reduce total potential deployment of solar PV by 52% (or 1.6 TW) across our region. Currently, however, the biggest zoning barrier to deployment is zoning ordinances which are silent on utility-scale solar. Deployment restrictions translate to up to 4 GW greater investment needs and 5.6% greater PV investment costs to achieve a 10% PV generation target. Starker shifts occur at the state level, e.g. Wisconsin sees a 40% reduction in PV investments due to zoning restrictions. Our results underscore the need for planning that aligns local zoning laws with state and regional goals.</description>

      <title>EdgeSight: Enabling Modeless and Cost-Efficient Inference at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional ML inference is evolving toward modeless inference, which abstracts the complexity of model selection from users, allowing the system to automatically choose the most appropriate model for each request based on accuracy and resource requirements. While prior studies have focused on modeless inference within data centers, this paper tackles the pressing need for cost-efficient modeless inference at the edge -- particularly within its unique constraints of limited device memory, volatile network conditions, and restricted power consumption.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose EdgeSight, a system that provides cost-efficient EdgeSight serving for diverse DNNs at the edge. EdgeSight employs an edge-data center (edge-DC) architecture, utilizing confidence scaling to reduce the number of model options while meeting diverse accuracy requirements. Additionally, it supports lossy inference in volatile network environments. Our experimental results show that EdgeSight outperforms existing systems by up to 1.6x in P99 latency for modeless services. Furthermore, our FPGA prototype demonstrates similar performance at certain accuracy levels, with a power consumption reduction of up to 3.34x.</description>

      <title>Performance-Barrier Event-Triggered Control of a Class of Reaction-Diffusion PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the recent performance-barrier event-triggered control (P-ETC) for achieving global exponential convergence of a class of reaction-diffusion PDEs via PDE backstepping control. Rather than insisting on a strictly monotonic decrease of the Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system, P-ETC allows the Lyapunov function to increase as long as it remains below an acceptable performance-barrier. This approach integrates a performance residual, the difference between the value of the performance-barrier and the Lyapunov function, into the triggering mechanism. The integration adds flexibility and results in fewer control updates than with regular ETC (R-ETC) that demands a monotonic decrease of the Lyapunov function. Our P-ETC PDE backstepping design ensures global exponential convergence of the closed-loop system in the spatial L^2 norm, without encountering Zeno phenomenon. To avoid continuous monitoring of the triggering function that generates events, we develop periodic event-triggered and self-triggered variants (P-PETC and P-STC, respectively) of the P-ETC. The P-PETC only requires periodic evaluation of the triggering function whereas the P-STC preemptively computes the time of the next event at the current event time using the system model and continuously available system states. The P-PETC and P-STC also ensure a Zeno-free behavior and deliver performance equivalent to that of the continuous-time P-ETC which requires continuous evaluation of the triggering function, in addition to the continuous sensing of the state. We provide numerical simulations to illustrate the proposed technique and to compare it with R-ETC associated with strictly decreasing Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <title>Performance-Barrier Event-Triggered PDE Control of Traffic Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For stabilizing stop-and-go oscillations in traffic flow by actuating a variable speed limit (VSL) at a downstream boundary of a freeway segment, we introduce event-triggered PDE backstepping designs employing the recent concept of performance-barrier event-triggered control (P-ETC). Our design is for linearized hyperbolic Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) PDEs governing traffic velocity and density. Compared to continuous feedback, ETC provides a piecewise-constant VSL commands-more likely to be obeyed by human drivers. Unlike the existing regular ETC (R-ETC), which enforces conservatively a strict decrease of a Lyapunov function, our performance-barrier (P-ETC) approach permits an increase, as long as the Lyapunov function remains below a performance barrier, resulting in fewer control updates than R-ETC. To relieve VSL from continuously monitoring the triggering function, we also develop periodic event-triggered (PETC) and self-triggered (STC) versions of both R-ETC and P-ETC. These are referred to as R/P-PETC and R/P-STC, respectively, and we show that they both guarantee Zeno-free behavior and exponential convergence in the spatial $L^2$ norm. With comparative simulations, we illustrate the benefits of the performance-barrier designs through traffic metrics (driver comfort, safety, travel time, fuel consumption). The proposed algorithms reduce discomfort nearly in half relative to driver behavior without VSL, while tripling the driver safety, measured by the average dwell time, relative to the R-ETC frequent-switching VSL schedule.</description>

      <title>Resilient Distributed Optimization for Multi-Agent Cyberphysical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the problem of distributed optimization in multi-agent cyberphysical systems, where a legitimate agent's iterates are influenced both by the values it receives from potentially malicious neighboring agents, and by its own self-serving target function. We develop a new algorithmic and analytical framework to achieve resilience for the class of problems where stochastic values of trust between agents exist and can be exploited. In this case, we show that convergence to the true global optimal point can be recovered, both in mean and almost surely, even in the presence of malicious agents. Furthermore, we provide expected convergence rate guarantees in the form of upper bounds on the expected squared distance to the optimal value. Finally, numerical results are presented that validate our analytical convergence guarantees even when the malicious agents compose the majority of agents in the network and where existing methods fail to converge to the optimal nominal points.</description>

      <title>Observer-based Periodic Event-triggered and Self-triggered Boundary Control of a Class of Parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the first observer-based periodic event-triggered control (PETC) and self-triggered control (STC) for boundary control of a class of parabolic PDEs using PDE backstepping control. We introduce techniques to convert a certain class of continuous-time event-triggered control into PETC and STC, eliminating the need for continuous monitoring of the event-triggering function. For the PETC, the event-triggering function requires only periodic evaluations to detect events, while the STC proactively computes the time of the next event right at the current event time using the system model and the continuously available measurements. For both strategies, the control input is updated exclusively at events and is maintained using a zero-order hold between events. We demonstrate that the closed-loop system is Zeno-free. We offer criteria for selecting an appropriate sampling period for the PETC and for determining the time until the next event under the STC. We prove the system's global exponential convergence to zero in the spatial $L^2$ norm for both anti-collocated and collocated sensing and actuation under the PETC. For the STC, local exponential convergence to zero in the spatial $L^2$ norm for collocated sensing and actuation is proven. Simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical claims.</description>

      <title>SupplyGraph: A Benchmark Dataset for Supply Chain Planning using Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained traction across different domains such as transportation, bio-informatics, language processing, and computer vision. However, there is a noticeable absence of research on applying GNNs to supply chain networks. Supply chain networks are inherently graph-like in structure, making them prime candidates for applying GNN methodologies. This opens up a world of possibilities for optimizing, predicting, and solving even the most complex supply chain problems. A major setback in this approach lies in the absence of real-world benchmark datasets to facilitate the research and resolution of supply chain problems using GNNs. To address the issue, we present a real-world benchmark dataset for temporal tasks, obtained from one of the leading FMCG companies in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning for production purposes. The dataset includes temporal data as node features to enable sales predictions, production planning, and the identification of factory issues. By utilizing this dataset, researchers can employ GNNs to address numerous supply chain problems, thereby advancing the field of supply chain analytics and planning.

      <title>Exploring the 6G Potentials: Immersive, Hyper Reliable, and Low-Latency Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition towards the sixth-generation (6G) wireless telecommunications networks introduces significant challenges for researchers and industry stakeholders. The 6G technology aims to enhance existing usage scenarios through supporting innovative applications that require stringent key performance indicators (KPIs). In some critical use cases of 6G, multiple KPIs, including immersive throughput, with an envisioned peak data rate of $1$ Tbps, hyper-reliability, in the range of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-7}$, and hyper low-latency, between $0.1$ and $1$ ms, must be achieved simultaneously to deliver the expected service experience. However, this is challenging due to the conflicting nature of these KPIs. This article proposes a new service class of 6G as immersive, hyper reliable, and low-latency communication (IHRLLC), and introduces a potential network architecture to achieve the associated KPIs. Specifically, enhanced technologies, such as ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (umMIMO)-aided terahertz (THz) communications, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and non-terrestrial networks (NTN), are viewed as the key enablers for achieving immersive data rates and hyper reliability. Given the computational complexity involved in employing these technologies, we propose mathematical and computational enabling technologies, such as learn-to-optimize (L2O), generative-AI (GenAI), quantum computing, and network digital twin (NDT), to complement the proposed architecture and optimize the latency.</description>

      <title>A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</description>

      <title>On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectrum Clipping in Learning Stable Linear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) provable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of reconstruction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to remedy this focus on enforcing stability while also ensuring accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a straightforward approach can simultaneously offer all three desiderata of learning stable linear systems. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc approach that manipulates the spectrum of the learned system matrix after it is learned in an unconstrained fashion. We call this approach spectrum clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after clipping all of its eigenvalues that are larger than one to one (without altering the eigenvectors). Through detailed experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that this simple technique can simultaneously learn highly accurate linear systems that are provably stable. Notably, we demonstrate that SC can achieve similar or better performance than strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn stable nonlinear dynamics, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Further, we find that SC can learn stable robot policies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated demonstrations. Our codes and dataset can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/spec_clip.</description>
