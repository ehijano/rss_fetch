      <title>TOI-283 b: A transiting mini-Neptune in a 17.6-day orbit discovered with TESS and ESPRESSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are missing from our Solar System, yet they appear to be the most abundant planetary types in our Galaxy. A detailed characterization of key planets within this population is important for understanding the formation mechanisms of rocky and gas giant planets and the diversity of planetary interior structures. In 2019, NASA's TESS satellite found a transiting planet candidate in a 17.6-day orbit around the star TOI-283. We started radial velocity (RV) follow-up observations with ESPRESSO to obtain a mass measurement. Mass and radius are measurements critical for planetary classification and internal composition modeling. We used ESPRESSO spectra to derive the stellar parameters of the planet candidate host star TOI-283. We then performed a joint analysis of the photometric and RV data of this star, using Gaussian processes to model the systematic noise present in both datasets. We find that the host is a bright K-type star ($d = 82.4$ pc, $\mathrm{T}_\mathrm{eff} = 5213 \pm 70$ K, $V = 10.4$ mag) with a mass and radius of $\mathrm{M}_\star = 0.80 \pm 0.01\; \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $\mathrm{R}_\star = 0.85 \pm 0.03\; \mathrm{R}_\odot$. The planet has an orbital period of $P = 17.617$ days, a size of $\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{p} = 2.34 \pm 0.09\; \mathrm{R}_\oplus$, and a mass of $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{p} = 6.54 \pm 2.04\; \mathrm{M}_\oplus$. With an equilibrium temperature of $\sim$600 K and a bulk density of $\rho_\mathrm{p} = 2.81 \pm 0.93$ g cm$^{-3}$, this planet is positioned in the mass-radius diagram where planetary models predict H$_2$O- and H/He-rich envelopes. The ESPRESSO RV data also reveal a long-term trend that is probably related to the star's activity cycle. Further RV observations are required to confirm whether this signal originates from stellar activity or another planetary body in the system.</description>

      <title>Precise frequencies of H$_2^{~16}$O lines protected for radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise frequency values have been determined for H$_2^{~16}$O radio lines appearing in protected line lists of the International Astronomical Union and the Panel on Frequency Allocations of the US National Academy of Sciences. The improved precision is attributable to a spectroscopic network built from a large set of near-infrared Lamb-dip lines augmented with a handful of ultrahigh-accuracy rotational transitions. The ultraprecise H$_2^{~16}$O network contains 376 Lamb-dip lines recorded previously via our frequency-comb locked cavity-enhanced spectrometer. During the present study, altogether 55 target lines have been (re)measured at high accuracy. Due to our network-assisted measurements, the accuracy has been significantly improved with respect to previous direct radio-frequency measurements for all the protected lines of H$_2^{~16}$O above 750 GHz. Furthermore, 43 of these protected transitions now benefit from the accuracy of the new near-infrared Lamb dips reported in this paper.</description>

      <title>The effect of near-surface winds on surface temperature and dust transport on Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knowledge of the Venus near-surface atmosphere is sparse. Few spacecrafts landed on the surface and measured winds with amplitudes below 1 m/s. The diurnal cycle of the wind amplitude and orientation is not known. Recent numerical simulations showed that slope winds along topographic structures could strongly impact the direction of winds. This study presents the first mesoscale modelling of such winds on Venus. A change of direction is occurring during the day in the main slopes, with upslope winds at noon due to solar heating and downslope winds at night. This is due to efficient IR cooling of the surface during the night, being colder than its surroundings slope atmospheric environment and leading to displacement of air. The temperature is impacted by the adiabatic cooling/warming induced by those winds. A strong heating effect is occurring for the downslope winds, leading to an anti-correlation between the surface temperature diurnal amplitude and the topography. This diurnal amplitude reaches 4 K in the plains and below 1 K in the mountains. The saltation of sediment by those winds was also quantified, with a higher probability at night along the slopes on the western flanks.</description>

      <title>Definition and Realization of the International Lunar Reference Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All future lunar missions require a definition of the lunar reference system and a realization in the form of the lunar reference frame to ensure consistent products for positioning, navigation, cartography, and timing. This paper defines the origin, orientation, and scale of the Lunar Reference System (LRS), as well as provides numerical solutions for the first realization of the International Lunar Reference Frame (ILRF). ILRF is defined as the Principal Axis (PA) system, attached to the surface and co-rotating with the Moon, with its origin in the lunar center of mass (lunocenter). The ILRF realization is based on variance component estimation of the three lunar ephemeris solutions: INPOP21a, DE430, and EPM2021 for the series of the position of the lunar center of mass and rotation Euler angles -- precession, nutation, and proper rotation. The solution is valid starting with the period covered by Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) data in 1970 and ending with extrapolated ILRF realizations in 2052 for future lunar missions. Results. The combined ILRF is characterized by the mean error of 17.6 cm for 2010-2030, where 15.3 cm comes from the origin and 8.6 cm from the orientation realization. The error in the realization of the origin is mainly caused by a poor geometry of the retroreflector network, resulting in a high correlation between the scale and the X component of the lunocenter in PA. The LLR post-fit residuals in ILRF are at the level of 2-3 cm in terms of the standard deviations of one-way ranges for best-performing LLR stations. The mean errors of the transformation between ILRF and other reference frame realizations in PA are at the level of 3 cm, whereas the mean transformation error to the DE421 Mean Earth frame equals 5 cm.</description>

      <title>Eruption column modelling of explosive volcanism on Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volcanism on Venus has never been directly observed, but several measurements indicate present-day activity. Volcanism could potentially play a role in climatic processes on Venus, especially in the sulfur cycle like on Earth. Observation of volcanic activity is the primary objective of future Venus spacecraft. However, there are many unknowns regarding its Venusian characteristics, like the condition at the vent, the volatile content and composition. Past modelling efforts have only studied explosive volcanic plume propagation over a limited range of flow parameters at the vent and in an idealised Venus atmospheric configuration. We propose to use the 1D FPLUME volcanic plume model in a realistic Venusian environment. In similar Venusian conditions, the height of the plume is consistent with past modelling. The present study shows that explosive volcanism would preferably reach 15 km of altitude. Under certain conditions, plumes are able to reach the VenSpec-H tropospheric altitude range of observations and even the 45 km cloud floor. For the first time, the impact of wind was quantified, and the super-rotating winds have a substantial impact by plume-bending of reducing the height of plumes. Contrary to the Earth, the atmospheric heat capacity depends greatly on temperature, and will disadvantage lower plumes and allow larger plumes to propagate at higher altitudes. The high latitude atmospheric environment, due to the thermal profile and weaker winds, is favorable to plumes reaching higher altitudes.</description>

      <title>Molecular line emission from 1000 au scales outflows to &lt;30 au compact structures in NGC1333 IRAS4A2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Studying protostellar objects in their earliest stages, particularly during the Class 0 phase, provides key insight into the beginnings of planet formation and dust evolution. Disentangling the various components, however, is particularly challenging. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of molecular line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are therefore crucial for probing their complex environments. Methods. In this work, we present high-resolution ($\sim$30 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 millimeters of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS4A2. Results. We detected large, well-traced outflows in HCN (3-2), H$_{2}$CO$(2_{1~2}-1_{1~1})$, and HCO$^{+}$ (3-2), along with numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) tracing central, more compact regions. Using moment maps, we analyzed the kinematics and spatial distributions of the molecular emission, revealing a wide range of spatial scales, from compact structures within the IRAS4A2 core at $\sim$8 au in radius, to extended $\sim$5000 au outflow emission. Specifically, we find that CH$_{3}$CDO and CH$_{3}$OCHO could be both good tracers of the disk, possibly tracing its rotation. Lines of OCS (22-21), SO$_{2}~(13_{3~11}-13_{2~12})$, HCN, H$_{2}$CO, and HCO$^{+}$, show more extended structures around IRAS4A2, likely tracing the envelope, disk, accretion shocks, the base of an outflow, and the outflow itself. Conclusions. Most COMs appear to trace distinct inner regions near the central protostar, while other molecules trace more extended structures, such as the envelope or outflows. The kinematics, emission patterns, and position-velocity diagrams suggest that individual molecules trace multiple components simultaneously, making it challenging to disentangle their true origins. Altogether, these findings highlight the complex spatial distribution within the IRAS4A2 system. Abridged.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength analysis of polarized light in HD 100453</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 100453 disk is a prototypical companion-disk interaction system hosting a pair of spirals and a substellar companion. We present new noncoronagraphic high-contrast imaging observations of HD 100453 with $V$ filter on SPHERE/ZIMPOL. We combined high-contrast imaging data of the reflected light from 0.55 to 2.2 $\mu m$ using the $V$, $I'$, $J$, and $Ks$ band data of ZIMPOL and IRDIS at VLT/SPHERE. For each observational epoch, we corrected for the smearing effect to derive the intrinsic disk-integrated polarized flux. We derived a steady increase with wavelengths from $\hat{Q}_{\varphi}/I_{\star}(V)=0.3\%$ to $\hat{Q}_{\varphi}/I_{\star}(K)=1.2\%$. We applied reference differential imaging to extract the disk intensity for the $V$ and $Ks$ bands using star hopping observations. We obtained the first $V$-band total intensity for HD 100453 with ZIMPOL star hopping. The integrated total flux $I_{\rm disk}/I_{\star}(V)=1.5\%$ increases to $I_{\rm disk}/I_{\star}(K)=4.8\%$. Both the total intensity and the polarization fraction show red colors, and the intrinsic maximum degree of polarization increases moderately from $40\%$ to $55\%$. We then used RADMC-3D radiative transfer modeling with a parametrized Henyey-Greenstein phase function to constrain the dust properties. From the $V$ to $Ks$ band, the dominating dust in the outer disk has an increasing scattering albedo and degree of polarization, while the asymmetry parameter slightly decreases. The outer disk of HD 100453 contains sub-micron-sized low porosity grains/aggregates. The cavity in scattered light is not empty and is replenished with optically thin dust with a maximum size of $\leq 0.1\mu m$. The linear polarization is higher in the spiral region than in the other regions, suggesting different dust properties in those regions.</description>

      <title>Extending TESS Flare Frequency Distributions with CHEOPS: power-law or lognormal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar flares are intense bursts of radiation caused by magnetic reconnection events on active stars. They are especially frequent on M dwarfs, where they can strongly influence planetary habitability. Flare frequency distributions (FFDs) are usually modeled as power laws, but recent studies have proposed alternatives such as lognormal distributions, implying different flare mechanisms and planetary impacts. This work investigates which statistical distribution best describes flare occurrences on M dwarfs, considering both equivalent duration (ED), the quantity directly measured from photometry, and bolometric energy, which is more relevant for habitability assesments. We analyzed 110 M dwarfs observed with TESS and CHEOPS, detecting 5,620 flares. Complex events were decomposed, detection biases corrected, and FFDs from both missions scaled to build a combined distribution spanning nearly 10 orders of magnitude in bolometric energy. ED-based FFDs follow a power law, reflecting intrinsic photometric flare occurrence. However, bolometric energy-based FFDs deviate from a pure power law, being better described by a lognormal distribution or, more accurately, by a truncated power law with a break near $10^{33}$ erg, the typical superflare threshold. This truncation suggests a change in flare-generation physics between regular flares and superflares, with implications for the cumulative impact on exoplanetary atmospheres. The apparent low-energy flattening previously attributed to lognormal behavior arises from observational biases, while the drop in flare frequency above $10^{35}$ erg remains unexplained, possibly reflecting an intrinsic cutoff or current observational limits. The upcoming PLATO mission will be well suited to probe both regimes.</description>

      <title>On the discovery of meteoritic mineral Zolenskyite; The artificial origin should not be overlooked</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently a new meteoritic mineral, Zolenskyite (Fe0.99Mn0.04Ca0.01Cr1.99S3.98), was discovered from the Indarch meteorite. Zolenskyite was structurally indexed as the monoclinic C2/m CrNb2Se4 - Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 12.84(1) {\AA}, b = 3.44(1) {\AA}, c = 5.94(1) {\AA} and \b{eta} = 117(1){\deg}. Zolenskyite was reported as high-pressure phase formed from Daubr\'eelite at high pressures and temperatures in highly shocked regions of the EH parent asteroid. Although this discovery provides valuable information about the origin of meteoritic mineral assemblages, the results and conclusions raise controversies with those reported in previous articles where the synthetic FeCr2S4 was described. In this review, an alternative analysis of the supplementary X-ray data from Zolenskyite was made and yields to the monoclinic I2/m Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 5.940 {\AA}, b = 3.440 {\AA}, c = 11.441 {\AA} and \b{eta} = 90.55{\deg}, in agreement with previous results in the literature and differ from those reported above. Regarding the genesis of Zolenskyite and according to solid-state laboratory synthesis, the transformation of cubic FeCr2S4 phase (ideal composition of Daubr\'eelite) to monoclinic FeCr2S4 (ideal composition of Zolenskyite) requires a process whose replication in Shock metamorphism stages is not well established and remains an open issue to address, together with another open issue related to the real composition of meteoritic minerals, with minor and trace metals, which is often overlooked when compared with synthetic ideal compositions. Whatever the results to be obtained by addressing the above open issues, they will shed more light on the genesis of Zolenskyite. In this context, it is worth to promote an open debate about the hypothesis of artificial origin.</description>
