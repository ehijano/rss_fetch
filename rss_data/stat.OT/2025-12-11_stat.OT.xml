      <title>A Conversation with Mike West</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mike West is currently the Arts &amp; Sciences Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Statistics and Decision Sciences at Duke University. Mike's research in Bayesian analysis spans multiple interlinked areas: theory and methods of dynamic models in time series analysis, foundations of inference and decision analysis, multivariate and latent structure analysis, stochastic computation and optimisation, among others. Inter-disciplinary R&amp;D has ranged across applications in commercial forecasting, dynamic networks, finance, econometrics, signal processing, climatology, systems biology, genomics and neuroscience, among other areas. Among Mike's currently active research areas are forecasting, causal prediction and decision analysis in business, economic policy and finance, as well as in personal decision making. Mike led the development of academic statistics at Duke University from 1990-2002, and has been broadly engaged in professional leadership elsewhere. He is past president of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA), and has served in founding roles and as board member for several professional societies, national and international centres and institutes. Recipient of numerous awards, Mike has been active in research with various companies, banks, government agencies and academic centres, co-founder of a successful biotechnology company, and board member for several financial and IT companies. He has published 4 books, several edited volumes and over 200 papers. Mike has worked with many undergraduate and Master's research students, and as of 2025 has mentored around 65 primary PhD students and postdoctoral associates who moved to academic, industrial or governmental positions involving advanced statistical and data science research.</description>

      <title>Group Cooperation Diverges onto Durable Low versus High Paths: Public Goods Experiments in 134 Honduran Villages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed large, lab-in-the-field experiment (2,591 participants across 134 Honduran villages; ten rounds) and tracked how contribution behavior unfolds in fixed, anonymous groups of size five. Contribution separates early into two durable paths, one low and one high, with rare convergence thereafter. High-path players can be identified with strong accuracy early on. Groups that begin with an early majority of above-norm contributors (about 60%) are very likely finish high. The empirical finding of a bifurcation, consistent with the theory, shows that early, high contributions by socially central people steer groups onto, and help keep them on, a high-cooperation path.</description>
