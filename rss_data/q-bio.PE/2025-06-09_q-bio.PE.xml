      <title>Counting rankings of tree-child networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks allow biologists to represent evolutionary relationships between present-day species by revealing ancestral speciation and hybridization events. A convenient and well-studied class of such networks are `tree-child networks' and a `ranking' of such a network is a temporal ordering of the ancestral speciation and hybridization events. In this short note, we show how to efficiently count such rankings on any given binary (or semi-binary) tree-child network. We also consider a class of binary tree-child networks that have exactly one ranking, and investigate further the relationship between ranked-tree child networks and the class of `normal' networks. Finally, we provide an explicit asymptotic expression for the expected number of rankings of a tree-child network chosen uniformly at random.</description>

      <title>Single-cell metabolic flux analysis reveals coexisting optimal sub-groups, cross-feeding, and mixotrophy in a cyanobacterial population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a single-cell level understanding of metabolism in an isogenic cyanobacterial population by integrating secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) derived multi-isotope uptake measurements of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 with a statistical inference protocol based on Liebig's law of the minimum, the maximum entropy principle, and constraint-based modeling. We find the population is structured in two metabolically distinct clusters: cells optimizing carbon yield while excessively turning over nitrogen, and cells which act reciprocally, optimizing nitrogen yield and excessively turning over carbon. This partition enables partial heterotrophy within the population via metabolic exchange, likely in the form of organic acids. Exchange increases the feasible metabolic space, and mixotrophic cells achieve the fastest growth rates. Metabolic flux analysis at the single-cell level reveals heterogeneity in carbon fixation rates, Rubisco specificity, and nitrogen assimilation. Our results provide a necessary foundation for understanding how population level phenotypes arise from the collective contributions of distinct individuals.</description>

      <title>A general relationship between extinction risk and carrying capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between a populations probability of extinction and its carrying capacity frames conservation status assessments and guides efforts to understand and mitigate the ongoing biodiversity crisis. Despite this, our understanding of the mathematical form of this relationship remains limited. We conducted ~5 billion population viability assessments that jointly converge on a modified Gompertz curve. This pattern is consistent across &gt;1700 distinct model populations, representing different breeding systems and widely varying rates of population growth, levels of environmental stochasticity, adult survival rate, age at first breeding, and initial population size. Analytical treatment of the underlying dynamics shows that few assumptions suffice to show that the relationship holds for any extant population subject to density-dependent growth. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results and consider the practical use of our findings by conservationists.</description>
