      <title>Can solvents tie knots? Helical folds of biopolymers in liquid environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helices are the quintessential geometric motif of microscale self-assembly, from $\alpha$-helices in proteins to double helices in DNA. Assembly of the helical geometry of biopolymers is a foundational step in a hierarchy of structure that eventually leads to biological activity. Simulating self-assembly in a simplified and controlled setting allows us to probe the relevance of the solvent as a component of the system of collaborative processes governing biomaterials. Using a simulation technique based on the morphometric approach to solvation, we performed computer experiments which fold a short open flexible tube, modelling a biopolymer in an aqueous environment, according to the interaction of the tube with the solvent alone. Different fluid environments may favour quite different solute geometry: We find an array of helical geometries that self-assemble depending on the solvent conditions, including overhand knot shapes and symmetric double helices where the strand folds back on itself. Interestingly these shapes-in all their variety-are energetically favoured over the $\alpha$-helix. In differentiating the role of solvation in self-assembly our study helps illuminate the energetic background scenery in which all soluble biomolecules live, indeed our results demonstrate that the solvent is capable of quite fundamental rearrangements even up to tying a simple overhand knot.</description>

      <title>Kinetically arrested clusters in active filament arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Brownian dynamics simulations and theory to study the over-damped spatiotemporal dynamics and pattern formation in a fluid-permeated array of equally spaced, active, elastic filaments that are pinned at one end and free at the other. The filaments are modeled as connected colloidal chains with activity incorporated via compressive follower forces acting along the filament backbone. The length of the chains is smaller than the thermal persistence length. For a range of filament separation and activity values, we find that the filament array eventually self-assembles into a series of regularly spaced, kinetically arrested, compact clusters. Filament activity, geometry, elasticity, and grafting density are each seen to crucially influence the size, shape, and spacing of emergent clusters. Furthermore, cluster shapes for different grafting densities can be rescaled into self-similar forms with activity-dependent scaling exponents. We derive theoretical expressions that relate the number of filaments in a cluster and the spacing between clusters, to filament activity, filament elasticity, and grafting density. Our results provide insight into the physical mechanisms involved in the initiation of clustering and suggest that steric contact forces and friction balance active forces and filament elasticity to stabilize the clusters. Our simulations suggest design principles to realize filament-based clusters and similar self-assembling biomimetic materials using active colloids or synthetic microtubule-motor systems.</description>

      <title>Voltage laws in nanodomains revealed by asymptotics and simulations of electro-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the local voltage distribution within nanophysiological domains, driven by ionic currents through membrane channels, is crucial for studying cellular activity in modern biophysics, yet it presents significant experimental and theoretical challenges. Theoretically, the complexity arises from the difficulty of solving electro-diffusion equations in three-dimensional domains. Currently, there are no methods available for obtaining asymptotic computations or approximated solutions of nonlinear equations, and numerically, it is challenging to explore solutions across both small and large spatial scales. In this work, we develop a method to solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations with ionic currents entering and exiting through two narrow, circular window channels located on the boundary. The inflow through the first window is composed of a single cation, while the outflow maintains a constant ionic density satisfying local electro-neutrality conditions. Employing regular expansions and Green's function representations, we derive the ionic profiles and voltage drops in both small and large charge regimes. We explore how local surface curvature and window channels size influence voltage dynamics and validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations, assessing the accuracy of our asymptotic computations. These novel relationships between current, voltage, concentrations and geometry can enhance the characterization of physiological behaviors of nanodomains.</description>

      <title>Re-programmable self-assembly of magnetic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple local interactions can cause primitive building blocks to self-assemble into complex and functional patterns. However, even for a small number of blocks, there exist a vast number of possible configurations that are plausible, stable, and with varying degree of order. The ability to dynamically shift between multi-stable patterns (i.e., reprogram the self-assembly) entails navigating an intractable search space, which remains a challenge. In this paper, we engineer the self-assembly of macroscopic magnetic particles to create metamaterials with dynamically reversible emergent phases. We utilize a boundary composed of magnetic hinges to confine free-floating magnetic disks into different stable assemblies. We exploit the non-destructive nature of the magnetic boundaries to create re-programmable two-dimensional metamaterials that morphs from crystalline to quasi-crystalline to disordered assembly using the same number of disks and boundary. Furthermore, we explore their utility to control the propagation of sound waves in an effectively undamped media with rich nonlinearities. Our findings can expand the metamaterials horizon into functional and tunable devices.</description>

      <title>Boundary layers and universal distribution in boundary driven active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-interacting run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension driven by particle reservoirs at the boundaries. Analytical results for the steady state and dynamics are obtained and new active features are observed. In steady state, a Seebeck-like effect is identified. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom, combined together, possess a symmetry, using which we found the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two distinct bands. There is a crossover from system size-independent relaxation rate to the diffusive relaxation as the system size is increased. The time-dependent distribution is calculated and extended to the semi-infinite line. In the dynamics, a 'Milne length' emerges that depends non-trivially on diffusivity and other parameters. Notably, the large time distribution retains a strong and often dominant 'active' contribution in the bulk, implying that an effective passive-like description is inadequate. We report the existence of a 'kinetic boundary layer' both in the steady-state and time-dependent regime, which is a consequence of thermal diffusion. In the absorbing boundary problem, a novel universality is proposed when the particle is driven by short-ranged colored noise.</description>

      <title>The balance between paraelectricity and ferroelectricity in non-chiral smectic homologs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Odd dynamics of passive objects in a chiral active bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When submerged in a chiral active bath, a passive object becomes a spinning ratchet imbued with odd transport properties. In the adiabatic limit of a massive object, we derive the most general Langevin dynamics for a rigid body in a chiral active bath, with odd diffusion and odd mobility connected by an Einstein relation, and numerically explore the breakdown of these predictions beyond the adiabatic limit. We show that the irreversibility of a massive object increases as its symmetry decreases: a disk exhibits an effective equilibrium dynamics, while a rod admits distinct translational and rotational temperatures, and a wedge is fully out of equilibrium. Conversely, this departure from equilibrium can be read in the universal far-field currents and density modulations of the bath, which we measure numerically and derive analytically.</description>

      <title>Polymer networks which locally rotate to accommodate stresses, torques, and deformation</title>

Abstract: Polymer network models construct the constitutive relationships of a broader polymer network from the behavior of a single polymer chain (e.g. viscoelastic response to applied forces, applied electromagnetic fields, etc.). Network models have been used for multiscale phenomena in a variety of contexts such as rubber elasticity, soft multifunctional materials, biological materials, and even the curing of polymers. For decades, a myriad of polymer network models have been developed with differing numbers of chains, arranged in different ways, and with differing symmetries. To complicate matters further, there are also competing assumptions for how macroscopic variables (e.g. deformation) are related to individual chains within the network model. In this work, we propose a simple, intuitive assumption for how the network locally rotates relative to applied loading (e.g. stresses, external fields) and show that this assumption unifies many of the disparate polymer network models--while also recovering one of the most successful models for rubber elasticity, the Arruda-Boyce $8$-chain model. The new assumption is then shown to make more intuitive predictions (than prior models) for stimuli-responsive networks with orientational energies (e.g. electroactive polymers), which is significant for shape morphing and designing high degree of freedom actuators (e.g. for soft robotics). Lastly, we unveil some surprising consequences of the new model for the phases of multistable biopolymer and semi-crystalline networks.</description>

      <title>Collective epithelial migration mediated by the unbinding of hexatic defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective cell migration in epithelia relies on cell intercalation: a local remodelling of the cellular network that allows neighbouring cells to swap their positions. Unlike foams and passive cellular fluid, in epithelial intercalation these rearrangements crucially depend on activity. During these processes, the local geometry of the network and the contractile forces generated therein conspire to produce a burst of remodelling events, which collectively give rise to a vortical flow at the mesoscopic length scale. In this article we formulate a continuum theory of the mechanism driving this process, built upon recent advances towards understanding the hexatic (i.e. $6-$fold ordered) structure of epithelial layers. Using a combination of active hydrodynamics and cell-resolved numerical simulations, we demonstrate that cell intercalation takes place via the unbinding of topological defects, naturally initiated by fluctuations and whose late-times dynamics is governed by the interplay between passive attractive forces and active self-propulsion. Our approach sheds light on the structure of the cellular forces driving collective migration in epithelia and provides an explanation of the observed extensile activity of in vitro epithelial layers.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of neutral and charged microgel suspensions: from single-particle to collective behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations of an ensemble of realistic microgel particles in swollen conditions in a wide range of packing fractions $\zeta$. We compare neutral and charged microgels, where we consider charges distribution adherent to experimental conditions. Through a detailed analysis of single-particle behavior, we are able to identify the different regimes occurring upon increasing concentration: from shrinking to deformation and interpenetration, always connecting our findings to available experimental observations. We then link these single-particle features to the collective behavior of the suspension, finding evidence of a structural reentrance, that has no counterpart in the dynamics. Hence, while the maximum of the radial distribution function displays a non-monotonic behavior with increasing $\zeta$, the dynamics, quantified by the microgels' mean-squared displacement, always slows down. This behavior, at odds with simple Hertzian model, can be described by a phenomenological multi-Hertzian, which takes into account the enhanced internal stiffness of the core. However, also this model fails when deformation enters into play, whereby more realistic many-body models are required. We are able to unveil the key physical mechanisms, shrinking and deformation, giving rise to the structural reentrance that holds up to very large packing fractions. We further identify key similarities and differences between neutral and charged microgels, for which we detect at high enough $\zeta$ the fusion of charged shells, previously invoked to explain key experimental findings, and responsible for the structural reentrance. Overall, our study establishes a powerful framework to uncover the physics of microgel suspensions, paving the way to tackle different regimes and internal structural architectures, where experimental evidence is still limited.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of hydrophobic-amphiphilic block copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the aggregation of locally amphiphilic copolymers with blocky architecture and uniformly distributed amphiphilic moieties in terms of a mean-field theory. Locally amphiphilic structure is characteristic of many thermoresponsive polymers, both linear and grafted, which endows them with local surface activity. Self-assembly of such copolymers exhibits a rich diversity of morphologies, which are analyzed in the present work in the limit of high surface activity of amphiphilic dimers with solvophilic/polar pendants. Depending on the composition and architecture of the copolymer and sizes and interaction parameters of the solvophilic/polar pendants, we build morphological diagrams of copolymer solutions. Copolymers with small volume pendants form precipitates or large aggregates with internal voids containing these pendants. For moderate volume pendants, a lamellar structure (or large vesicles) is observed at smaller fractions of amphiphilic monomer units in the chain and micelles are formed at larger fractions of these units. The sizes and shapes of micelles depend on the monomer distribution along the chain, and the blocky architecture favors the existence of single spherical micelles or spherical particles that constitute compound micelles. For sufficiently large polar pendants, copolymers of both types mainly form granular branched compound micelles. The distance at which adjacent hydrophobic and polar groups are located in a chain determines the size of domains and particles formed by locally amphiphilic blocks or chains. Our predictions explain the existence of dense multicore complex micelles consisting of beads of several tens of nanometers size and other structures such as disc-shaped micelles.</description>

      <title>Rapidly yawing spheroids in viscous shear flow: Emergent loss of symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. We also demonstrate that this effective asymmetry generated by the rapid yawing can cause chaotic behaviour in the emergent dynamics, in stark contrast to the emergent dynamics generated by rapidly rotating spheroids, which are equivalent to those of effective passive spheroids. In general, we find that the shape of the equivalent effective particle under rapid yawing is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. In these scenarios, we calculate analytically the equivalent aspect ratio of the effective spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</description>
