      <title>Finite Stature in Graphs of Cube Complexes with Cyclonormal Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact cube complex $X$ that splits as a graph of virtually special cube complexes. Suppose that the fundamental groups of edge spaces are cyclonormal in the fundamental groups of adjacent vertex spaces. We show that $\pi_1X$ has finite stature with respect to vertex groups in the sense of Huang-Wise. In particular, when vertex groups are hyperbolic, this allows us to deduce virtual specialness of $X$.</description>

Abstract: Problem 20.21 of Mazurov and Khukhro (Unsolved Problems in Group Theory: The Kourovka Notebook, 20th Issue, 2022), contributed by M.~Conder and attributed to G.~Verret, asks whether there exists a finite group $G$ with two normal subgroups $K$ and $L$ of index $12$ such that $K \cong L$, but with non-isomorphic quotients $G/K \cong C_{12}$ and $G/L \cong A_4.$ We prove that no such finite group exists.</description>

      <title>The diameter and dominating sets of the difference graph of a nilpotent group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$, the difference graph of $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{D}(G)$, is the difference of the enhanced power graph of $G$ and the power graph of $G$, with all isolated vertices removed. This paper mainly studies the dominating sets of the difference graph of a finite group. In particular, we prove that the diameter of the difference graph of a nilpotent group has an upper bound of $4$. Furthermore, we generalize and refine the result by Biswas et al. by classifying all nilpotent groups whose difference graph has diameter $k$, for each $k\le 4$.</description>

      <title>On finite presentability of some partial Torelli subgroups of Aut(F_n)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F_n$ be the free group of rank $n$, and let $\rho_{ab}:\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)\to \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ be the map induced by the natural projection $F_n\to\mathbb Z^n$. It is a long-standing open problem whether the subgroup of $\mathrm{IA}$-automorphisms $\mathrm{IA}_n=\mathrm{Ker}\rho_{ab}$ is finitely presented for $n\geq 4$. In this paper we establish finite presentability of certain infinite index subgroups of $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ containing $\mathrm{IA}_n$. In the terminology of Putman, these subgroups are natural analogues of partial Torelli subgroups of mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Elementary abelian subgroups of classical groups of type $A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many open conjectures in the representation theory of finite groups can be studied by reducing them to related questions about quasi-simple groups. In such studies, $p$-radical subgroups typically play a critical role. To classify the $p$-radical subgroups of a finite group, we first classify the elementary abelian $p$- subgroups and find their local structure. To do this, we conduct the classification in a linear algebraic group $G$ and then transfer the results to the finite group of Lie type $G^F$ . This approach was used by An, Dietrich and Litterick in their work on finite exceptional groups of Lie type. We now apply this approach to classical groups of type $A$ for the classification and local structure of the elementary abelian $p$-subgroups.</description>

Abstract: We show that if a subsemigroup $S$ of the bicyclic monoid ${\mathscr{C}}(p,q)$ contains infinitely many idempotents then $S$ admits only the discrete Hausdorff shift-continuous topology. Also we proof that every right-continuous (left-continuous\emph) Hausdorff Baire topology on the semigroup $\mathscr{C}_+(a,b)$ $(\mathscr{C}_-(a,b))$ is discrete and the same statement holds for the bicyclic monoid.</description>

      <title>Invariant random subgroups in hyperbolic reflection groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Fuchsian (4,4,4) triangle group and also right-angled reflection groups of hyperbolic spaces in higher dimensions admit ergodic invariant random subgroups having uncountably many isomorphism types of subgroups in their support (in most cases we actually prove a stronger statement), providing an answer to a question of S. Thomas. We also give similar constructions in higher-dimensional spaces. Our constructions are based on Coxeter polytopes in hyperbolic spaces. We also provide examples of invariant random subgroups related to questions of Y. Glasner and A. Hase through a similar construction.</description>

      <title>Representations of code loops by binary codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code loops are Moufang loops constructed from doubly even binary codes. Then, given a code loop $L$, we ask which doubly even binary code $V$ produces $L$. In this sense, $V$ is called a representation of $L$. In this article we define and show how to determine all minimal and reduced representations of nonassociative code loops of rank $3$ and $4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any code loop $L$, we prove that the half-automorphism group of $L$ is the product of the automorphism group of $L$ by an elementary abelian $2-$group consisting of all half-automorphisms that acts as the identity on a fixed basis. Also, we prove that elementary mappings only can be a half-automorphism on code loops of rank at most $3$.</description>

      <title>On the Diophantine problem related to power circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won introduced power circuits in 2012 to construct a polynomial algorithm for the word problem in the Baumslag group, which has a non-elementary Dehn function. Power circuits are circuits supporting addition and operation $(x,y) = x \cdot 2^y$ for integer numbers. Also they posed a question about decidability of the Diophantine problem over the structure $\langle \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}; +, x \cdot 2^y, \leq, 1 \rangle$, which is closely related to power circuits. In this paper we prove undecidability of the Diophantine problem over this structure.</description>

      <title>Polynomial towers and inverse Gowers theory for bounded-exponent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop Host--Kra and inverse Gowers theory for abelian groups of bounded exponent. We show that the Host--Kra factors $Z^{\leq k}(\mathrm{X})$ associated with actions of such groups admit extensions with the structure of \emph{polynomial towers}. This new notion is a system obtained as a finite iteration of abelian extensions of the trivial system by polynomial cocycles; crucially, the intermediate extensions in this system are not required to agree with the Host--Kra factors. We prove that all such extensions are Abramov (generalizing a recent result of Candela, Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez, and Szegedy), but not necessarily Weyl, and have the structure of k-step translational systems.
  Combining this structure theorem with a correspondence principle due to the first and third authors, we derive an inverse theorem for the Gowers norms on finite abelian groups of bounded exponent: large $U^{k+1}$-norm implies large correlation with a polynomial of degree $\le k$ (on the same group), even when the exponent is not square-free or is divisible by small primes. This resolves a conjecture of the first and third authors for such groups, and also answers a question of Candela, Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez, and Szegedy.</description>

      <title>The combinatorics of permuting and preserving curve-bound spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps to $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ from the space of normal (real or complex) $n\times n$, $n\ge 3$ matrices with spectra contained in a given continuous-injection interval image $\Lambda\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ are (a) conjugations; (b) transpose conjugations, or (c) orderings of spectra according to an orientation of $\Lambda$, with fixed eigenspaces. This generalizes results of Petek's (self-maps of real or complex Hermitian matrices) and the author's (complex Hermitian matrices as the domain, $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ as the codomain). An application rules out possibility (c) for normal matrices with spectra constrained to a simple closed curve, extending a result by the author, Gogi\'c and Toma\v{s}evi\'c to the effect that continuous commutativity and spectrum preservers on unitary groups are (transpose) conjugations.
  The involution preserving eigenspaces and complex-conjugating eigenvalues is a novel possibility beyond (a), (b) and (c) if the domain consists of all semisimple operators with $\Lambda$-bound spectra instead; its continuity (or lack thereof) and whether or not that map furthermore extends continuously to arbitrary $\Lambda$-constrained-spectrum matrices hinge on the geometry and regularity of $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic size of finite irreducible semigroups of rational matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite semigroups of $n \times n$ matrices with rational entries. Such semigroups provide a rich generalization of transition monoids of unambiguous (and, in particular, deterministic) finite automata. In this paper we determine the maximum size of finite semigroups of rational $n \times n$ matrices, with the goal of shedding more light on the structure of such matrix semigroups.
  While in general such semigroups can be arbitrarily large in terms of $n$, a classical result of Sch\"utzenberger from 1962 implies an upper bound of $2^{O(n^2 \log n)}$ for irreducible semigroups, i.e., the only subspaces of $Q^n$ that are invariant for all matrices in the semigroup are $Q^n$ and the subspace consisting only of the zero vector. Irreducible matrix semigroups can be viewed as the building blocks of general matrix semigroups, and as such play an important role in mathematics and computer science. From the point of view of automata theory, they generalize strongly connected automata.
  Using a very different technique from that of Sch\"utzenberger, we improve the upper bound on the cardinality to $3^{n^2}$. This is the main result of the paper. The bound is in some sense tight, as we show that there exists, for every $n$, a finite irreducible semigroup with $3^{\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor}$ rational matrices. Our main result also leads to an improvement of a bound, due to Almeida and Steinberg, on the mortality threshold. The mortality threshold is a number $\ell$ such that if the zero matrix is in the semigroup, then the zero matrix can be written as a product of at most $\ell$ matrices from any subset that generates the semigroup.</description>

      <title>Completeness of closed Kleinian flat Pseudo-Riemannian Manifolds of Signature (2,2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$ denote the model space of flat pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature $(2,2)$. We prove that the only domain divisible by a discrete subgroup of the isometry group of $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$ is $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$ itself. In the Kleinian setting, this provides the first completeness theorem of closed flat pseudo-Riemannian manifolds beyond the Euclidean and Lorentzian cases.
  Along the proof, we show two results of independent interest. The first is a geometric reduction for certain divisible domains of affine space. The second concerns the existence of syndetic hulls in semidirect products $R \ltimes G$, where $G$ is a homothety Lie group. This construction generalizes earlier constructions in affine geometry due to Carri\`ere and Dal'bo.</description>

The above upper bound is optimal, and there exists a unique $j$ such that $e_j= 2^{n-1} $. For each $e_i$, there exists a unique $a_i$ such that $\{ a_i/e_i\}\cup \{\infty\}$ is the set of ideal vertices of a fundamental domain of $\Gamma_0(2^n)$ whose side-pairings give a set of independent generators of $\Gamma_0(2^n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove certain polynomial relations between the values of complex irreducible characters of general finite symmetric groups. We use it to find some sets of conjugacy classes such that no finite symmetric group has a complex irreducible character that vanishes at every class in the set. In particular, we show that if $n$ satisfies certain conditions, then $S_n\setminus \{1\}$ cannot be covered by the set of zeros of three irreducible characters. We also prove that the values of character of $2$-defect zero can be expressed as rational functions in $n$, and build a recursive algorithm to find these rational functions. As another application, we improve a result by A. Miller on identification of irreducible characters by checking small number of values.</description>

      <title>On the source algebra equivalence class of blocks with cyclic defect groups, III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This series of papers is a contribution to the program of classifying $p$-blocks of finite groups up to source algebra equivalence, starting with the case of cyclic blocks. To any $p$-block $\mathbf{B}$ of a finite group with cyclic defect group $D$, Linckelmann associated an invariant $W( \mathbf{B} )$, which is an indecomposable endo-permutation module over $D$, and which, together with the Brauer tree of~$\mathbf{B} $, essentially determines its source algebra equivalence class.
  In Part II of our series, assuming that $p$ is an odd prime, we reduced the classification of the invariants $W( \mathbf{B} )$ arising from cyclic $p$-blocks $\mathbf{B}$ of quasisimple classical groups to the classification for cyclic $p$-blocks of quasisimple quotients of special linear or unitary groups. This objective is achieved in the present Part III.</description>

      <title>Coxeter and Dynkin Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coxeter and Dynkin diagrams classify a wide variety of structures, most notably finite reflection groups, lattices having such groups as symmetries, compact simple Lie groups and complex simple Lie algebras. The simply laced or "ADE" Dynkin diagrams also classify finite subgroups of SU(2) and quivers with finitely many indecomposable representations. This introductory tour of Coxeter and Dynkin diagrams, based on the column This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics, is made to accompany a series of lecture videos.</description>

      <title>Hyperlinearity via amenable near representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We note a characterization of the amenability of unitary representations (in the sense of Bekka) via the existence of an orthonormal basis supporting an invariant probability charge. Based on this, we explore several natural notions of amenable near representations on Hilbert spaces. Establishing an analogue of a theorem about sofic groups by Elek and Szab\'o, we prove that a group is hyperlinear if and only if it admits an essentially free amenable near representation. This answers a question raised by Pestov and Kwiatkowska. For comparison, we also provide characterizations of Kirchberg's factorization property, as well as Haagerup's property, along similar lines.</description>

      <title>Products of Infinite Countable Groups Have Fixed Price One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08325v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the product of any two infinite countable groups has fixed price one. This resolves a longstanding problem posed by Gaboriau. The proof uses the propagation method to construct a Poisson horoball process as a weak limit of a sequence of factors of iid. We then construct a low-cost graphing by showing that the resulting horoballs have a variant of the infinite touching property almost surely, if the metric and the other parameters of the construction are chosen carefully. A novelty is providing direct simple proofs that do not rely on sophisticated results like amenability and double-recurrence, which are used in related works. An essential tool for avoiding any growth conditions is the convergence in the sense of point processes of pointed closed subsets, which is a notion from stochastic geometry. Also, to manage the overlapping of the horoballs, a generalization of the induction lemma is presented for random multisets of a group.</description>

      <title>Prime degree irreducible representations of simple algebraic groups and finite simple groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that finite quasisimple groups of Lie type in characteristic $p$ with an irreducible representation of prime degree $r$ over a finite field of characteristic $p$ have orders bounded above by a function of $r$, independent of $p$. We also bound the number of such groups in terms of $r$. Apart from being notable in their own right, these results have a significant application in a computational version of the strong approximation theorem for finitely generated Zariski-dense subgroups of $SL_r(\mathbb{P})$, where $\mathbb{P}$ is a number field.</description>

      <title>A lexicographic section of the braid arrangement and the modified Artin presentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a specific line arrangement obtained from a generic $2$-section of the braid arrangement, and compute the fundamental group of its complement via braid monodromy. We show that the resulting presentation of the fundamental group coincides, under the identification of generators, with the modified Artin presentation introduced by Margalit and McCammond. Moreover, we extend the construction to the Manin--Schechtman arrangements $MS(n, k)$, which are higher analogues of the braid arrangement. Focusing on the case $k = 2$, we obtain an explicit presentation of $\pi_1(\mathbb{C}^n \setminus MS(n, 2))$.</description>

      <title>On endosplit $p$-permutation resolutions and Brou\'{e}'s conjecture for $p$-solvable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Endosplit $p$-permutation resolutions play an instrumental role in verifying Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture in numerous cases. We give a new characterization of all endosplit $p$-permutation resolutions and reduce the question of Galois descent of an endosplit $p$-permutation resolution to the Galois descent of the module it resolves. This is shown using techniques from the study of endotrivial complexes, the invertible objects of the bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation modules. As an application, we show that a refinement of Brou\'{e}'s conjecture proposed by Kessar--Linckelmann holds for certain blocks of groups $G$ satisfying $G = O_{p',p,p'}(G)$ with abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup, the key reduction step in Harris--Linckelmann's verification of Brou\'e's conjecture for all $p$-solvable groups.</description>

      <title>Automorphism Groups and Structure of 4-Valent Cayley Graphs on Dihedral Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $S$ be an inverse-closed subset of $G$ not containing the identity. The Cayley graph $\mathrm{Cay}(G,S)$ has vertex set $G$, where two vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $x^{-1}y \in S$.
  Kaseasbeh and Erfanian (2021) determined the structure of all Cayley graphs on the dihedral group of order $2n$ for subsets $S$ of size at most three. We extend their work by analyzing the structure of such Cayley graphs for subsets $S$ of size at least four.
  Our main results are as follows:
  1. using a classical result of Burnside and Schur, we determine the automorphism groups of Cayley graphs on dihedral groups of order $2p$, where $p$ ranges over infinitely many primes and $S$ consists only of rotations;
  2. if $S$ consists of $4 \le 2k &lt; n$ distinct rotations, then the Cayley graph $\mathrm{Cay}(D_{2n},S)$ is the disjoint union of two isomorphic circulant graphs on $n$ vertices, and
  3. if $S$ is a generating set of $4\leq k\leq n$ reflections, then the Cayley graph $\mathrm{Cay}(D_{2n},S)$ is bipartite, forming the disjoint union of $k$ perfect matchings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed element $g\in SL(2,C)$ and a word $w=[x^n,y^m]$ we consider the automorphism group $Aut(S_{g})$ of the affine threefold $S_{g}=\{(x,y)\in SL(2,C)^2 \ | w(x,y)=g\}.$ We prove that Makar-Limanov invariant $ML(S_{g})=\mathcal{O}(S_{g})$ and $Aut(S_{g})$ is Jordan.</description>
