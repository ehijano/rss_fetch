      <title>On physical considerations regarding development and validation of Heat Flux Partitioning models: application to vertical boiling flows simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of a critical assessment of wall boiling modeling through Heat Flux Partitioning approach, a new model dedicated to vertical boiling flows is proposed, with a revisited partitioning including a boiling heat flux related to bubble coalescence. Closure laws include a recent model for bubble dynamics, a new correlation for the bubble maximum lift-off diameter, and comprehensive selection of existing models for nucleation site density and bubble wait time. Each formulation are compared to relevant existing data from the literature in order to emphasize the importance of separate validation in such a modeling framework. The whole model is then confronted to detailed wall boiling experiments to simultaneously compare boiling curve predictions along other physical parameters such as boiling time scales (bubble growth, transient conduction, bubble wait), nucleation frequency, or nucleation site density. Finally, validation against wall heat flux measurements in various conditions are used to assess the model accuracy and further discuss the limits of the Heat Flux Partitioning approach.</description>

      <title>Real-time control of a magnetohydrodynamic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feedback control of a weakly conducting magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow via Lorentz forces generated by externally applied electric and magnetic fields. Specifically, we steer the flow of an electrolyte toward prescribed velocity or vorticity patterns using arrays of electrodes and electromagnets positioned around and beneath a fluid reservoir, with feedback provided by planar particle image velocimetry (PIV). Control is implemented using a model predictive control (MPC) framework, in which control signals are computed by minimizing a cost function over the predicted evolution of the flow. The predictor is constructed entirely from data using Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of the underlying nonlinear fluid dynamics. This linearity allows the MPC problem to be solved by alternating between two small and efficiently solvable convex quadratic programs (QPs): one for the electrodes and one for the electromagnets. The resulting controller runs in a closed loop on a standard laptop, enabling real-time control of the flow. We demonstrate the functionality of the approach through experiments in which the flow is shaped to match a range of reference velocity fields and a time-varying vorticity field.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling of a settling sphere in a quiescent medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop data-driven models to predict the dynamics of a freely settling sphere in a quiescent Newtonian fluid using experimentally obtained trajectories. Particle tracking velocimetry was used to obtain a comprehensive dataset of settling motions, which we use to train neural networks that model the spatial evolution of a spherical particle without explicitly resolving the surrounding fluid dynamics. We employ deterministic neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and stochastic neural stochastic differential equations (NSDEs) to reconstruct the sphere's trajectory and capture key statistical features of the settling process. The models are evaluated based on short- and long-time dynamics, including ensemble-averaged velocity evolution, settling time distributions, and probability density functions of the final settling positions. We also examine the correlation between lateral displacement and streamwise velocity and assess the impact of dataset size on predictive accuracy. While NODEs excel in trajectory reconstruction and generalization across different initial conditions, NSDEs effectively capture statistical trends in the long-time behavior but are more sensitive to data availability. Acceleration profiles computed via second-order finite difference schemes confirm that both approaches accurately capture long-time dynamics, though short-time transients pose challenges.</description>

      <title>Enhancing wall-to-wall heat transport with unsteady flow perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine unsteady flow perturbations that are optimal for enhancing the rate of heat transfer between hot and cold walls (i.e. the Nusselt number Nu), under the constraint of fixed flow power (Pe$^2$, where Pe is the P\'{e}clet number). The unsteady flows are perturbations of previously computed optimal steady flows and are given by eigenmodes of the Hessian matrix of Nu, the matrix of second derivatives with respect to amplitudes of flow mode coefficients. Positive eigenvalues of the Hessian correspond to increases in Nu by unsteady flows, and occur at Pe $\geq 10^{3.5}$ and within a band of flow periods $\tau \sim$ Pe$^{-1}$. For $\tau$Pe $\leq 10^{0.5}$, the optimal flows are chains of vortices that move along the walls or along eddies enclosed by flow branches near the walls. At larger $\tau$Pe the vorticity distributions are often more complex and extend farther from the walls. The heat flux is enhanced at locations on the walls near the unsteady vorticity. We construct an iterative time-spectral solver for the unsteady temperature field and find increases in Nu of up to 7% at moderate-to-large perturbation amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Self-Similar Energy Transfer Dynamics: a Case Study for 1D Burgers System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of constructing flow evolutions leading to a self-similar energy cascade consistent with Kolmogorov's statistical theory of turbulence. As a first step in this direction, we focus on the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation as a toy model. Its solutions exhibiting self-similar behavior, in a precisely-defined sense, are found by framing this problems in terms of PDE-constrained optimization. The main physical parameters are the time window over which self-similar behavior is sought (equal to approximately one eddy turnover time), viscosity (inversely proportional to the ``Reynolds number") and an integer parameter characterizing the distance in the Fourier space over which self-similar interactions occur. Local solutions to this nonconvex PDE optimization problems are obtained with a state-of-the-art adjoint-based gradient method. Two distinct families of solutions, termed viscous and inertial, are identified and are distinguished primarily by the behavior of enstrophy which, respectively, uniformly decays and grows in the two cases. The physically meaningful and appropriately self-similar inertial solutions are found only when a sufficiently small viscosity is considered. These flows achieve the self-similar behaviour by a uniform steepening of the wave fronts present in the solutions. The methodology proposed and the results obtained represent an encouraging proof of concept for this approach to be employed to systematically search for self-similar flow evolutions in the context of three-dimensional turbulence.</description>

      <title>Impact of Spinning Droplets onto Superhydrophobic Surfaces: Asymmetric Tumbling Rapid Rebound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact dynamics of spinning droplets onto superhydrophobic surfaces was studied by using Volume-of-Fluid simulations, covering broad ranges of Weber number ($We$) and dimensionless angular velocity ($\mathit{\Omega}$). The omputational results were validated by high-speed imaging experiments, with particular focus on the types of rebound, asymmetric deformation, and droplet-wall contact time. Results show that, the spinning motion of droplets leads to two novel rebound scenarios. Specificially, the front-raise tumbling rebound occurs at a lower $\mathit{\Omega}$ and is caused by the unsymmetrical Laplace pressure, while the rear-raise tumbling rebound emerges at a higher $\mathit{\Omega}$ and is attributed to the rotational inertia. The angular momentum of the spinning droplet is dissipated or even reversed, while its direction upon detachment is inconsistent with the visually observed spinning motion. With the increase of the angular velocity, the droplet-wall contact time is largely reduced, which is attributed to the asymmetric spreading by the spinning motion rather than the increased kinetic energy. A theoretical model was also established to predict asymmetric spreading and the contact time and validated against numerical results in wide ranges of $We$ and $\mathit{\Omega}$.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of blood vessel models, Part I: 3D-1D to 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a family of models describing blood perfusion through a tissue surrounding a thin blood vessel. Our goal is to rigorously establish convergence results among 3D-3D Darcy--Stokes, 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille, and 1D Green's function methods commonly used to model this process. In Part I, we propose a 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille system where the coupling across the permeable vessel surface involves an angle-averaged Neumann boundary condition coupled with a geometrically constrained Robin boundary condition. We show that this model is well-posed and moreover limits to a 1D Green's function model as the maximum vessel radius $\epsilon\to 0$. In the 1D model, the exterior blood pressure is given by an explicit Green's function expression involving the interior blood pressure. The interior pressure satisfies a novel 1D integrodifferential equation in which the integral term incorporates the effects of the exterior pressure and the vessel geometry. Much of this paper is devoted to analyzing this integrodifferential equation. Using the \emph{a priori} bounds obtained here, we show that the solution to the 1D model converges to the 3D-1D solution with a rate proportional to $\epsilon^{1/2}|\log\epsilon|$. In Part II [Ohm \&amp; Strikwerda, arXiv preprint July 2025], we rely on the 1D estimates to show that both the 1D and 3D-1D models converge to a coupled 3D-3D Darcy-Stokes system as $\epsilon\to 0$, thereby establishing a convergence chain among all hierarchy levels.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of blood vessel models, Part II: 3D-3D to 3D-1D and 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a hierarchy of three models of blood perfusion through a tissue surrounding a thin arteriole or venule. Our goal is to rigorously link 3D-3D Darcy--Stokes, 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille, and 1D Green's function methods commonly used to model this process. Here in Part II, we consider the most detailed level, a 3D-3D Darcy-Stokes system coupled across the permeable vessel surface by mass conservation and pressure/stress balance conditions. We derive a convergence result between the 3D-3D model and both the 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille model and 1D Green's function model proposed in Part I [Ohm \&amp; Strikwerda, arXiv preprint July 2025] at a rate proportional to $\epsilon^{1/6}|\log\epsilon|$, where $\epsilon$ is the maximum vessel radius. The rate is limited by the inclusion of a degenerate endpoint where the vessel radius vanishes, i.e. becomes indistinguishable from a capillary. Key to our proof are \emph{a priori} estimates for the 1D integrodifferential model obtained in Part I.</description>

      <title>The effect of normal electric fields on the Stokes drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In periodic wave motion, particles beneath the wave undergo a drift in the direction of wave propagation, a phenomenon known as Stokes drift. While extensive research has been conducted on Stokes drift in water wave flows, its counterpart in electrohydrodynamic flows remains relatively unexplored. Addressing this gap, we investigate Stokes drift beneath periodic traveling irrotational waves on a dielectric fluid under the effect of normal electric fields. Through numerical simulations utilizing conformal mapping, we compute particle trajectories and analyze the resultant Stokes drift behaviors beneath periodic traveling waves. Our findings indicate that variations in the electric field impact particle velocities while maintaining trajectory shapes. Moreover, the kinetic energy associated with a particle depends on its depth location and is a non-decreasing convex function in a laboratory frame and a constant in a moving frame, as observed in water wave flows.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-parallelism on standard and magnetorheological measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aiming towards the magnetorheological characterisation of whole human blood, we evaluated the suitability of our experimental setup for steady shear measurements with low-viscosity fluids. Previous measurements with a rotational rheometer equipped with a magnetorheological cell returned low and inconsistent apparent-viscosity values. In this work, a parametric study was conducted, experimentally and numerically, to evaluate the possible error sources and define an experimentally reliable window. Steady shear measurements were carried out with Newtonian fluids using two geometries: parallel-plates at different gap heights, and cone-plate. A clear decrease in measured viscosity with parallel-plate gap reduction was found, along with a slight overestimation of the cone-plate. Numerical results corroborated the experimental observations, pointing towards a small inclination of the bottom plate (between 0.1{\deg} and 0.3{\deg}). The numerical study has also shown that geometry non-parallelism can lead to significant flow alterations, particularly for cone-plate geometries where contraction/expansion flow can be generated, critically deviating from the canonical Couette flow and provoking non-negligible errors. Additional experimental and numerical work was conducted to evaluate the effects of the non-parallelism on magnetorheological measurements. The geometrical asymmetry results in severe alterations of the microstructural dynamics, possibly leading to an underestimation of the magnetorheological response. This work has shown that geometry non-parallelism can have critical repercussions on simple shear flows, with fundamentally different implications from a general gap-error, and can be identified through comparative measurements with Newtonian fluids in different geometries (parallel-plates and cone-plate)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an enhanced multi-fidelity Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) framework for efficient spatio-temporal flow field prediction when high-fidelity data is scarce. Key innovations include: a merge network replacing traditional dot-product operations, achieving 50.4% reduction in prediction error and 7.57% accuracy improvement while reducing training time by 96%; a transfer learning multi-fidelity approach that freezes pre-trained low-fidelity networks while making only the merge network trainable, outperforming alternatives by up to 76% and achieving 43.7% better accuracy than single-fidelity training; and a physics-guided subsampling method that strategically selects high-fidelity training points based on temporal dynamics, reducing high-fidelity sample requirements by 40% while maintaining comparable accuracy. Comprehensive experiments across multiple resolutions and datasets demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly reduce required high-fidelity dataset size while maintaining predictive accuracy, with consistent superior performance against conventional benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Segregation in Periodically Textured Microfluidic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transport dynamics of elongated microparticles in microchannel flows. While smooth-walled channels preserve the dependence of particle trajectories on initial orientation and lateral position, we show that introducing periodically textured walls can trigger robust alignment of the particle along the channel centerline. This geometry-driven alignment arises from repeated reorientation torques generated by spatially modulated shear gradients near the textured walls. A resistive force theory-based analysis reveals that the effect stems from the anisotropic hydrodynamic response of the elongated particle to local shear, with maximal alignment torque occurring at intermediate particle orientations. The alignment efficiency depends on particle elongation and the relative texture wavelength, with an optimal range for maximal effect. While the observed alignment behavior is not limited to low Reynolds numbers, the characteristic alignment length scale diverges as the Reynolds number increases toward the turbulent flow regime. These findings offer a predictive framework for designing microfluidic devices that passively sort or focus anisotropic particles, with implications for soft matter transport, biophysical flows, and microfluidic engineering.</description>

      <title>Non-coalescence and in-plane momentum generation in sessile droplet clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intuitively, droplets in proximity merge when brought into contact. However, under certain conditions, they may not coalesce due to the entrapment of an interstitial gas film. Non-coalescence between water droplets has so far been observed during collisions of droplets moving with relative centroidal velocity, or in the presence of specific enabling effects such as high intervening gas pressures, surfactants, or large droplet sizes (diameter $\gtrsim 1~\mathrm{mm}$). Here, we report non-coalescence between water droplets over a much wider range of droplet diameters, from millimeters to as small as 100 microns, without the need for any of the above factors. Such non-coalescence occurs in sessile droplet clusters on water-repellent surfaces. When any two droplets in a cluster coalesce, the evolving interface of the coalescing droplets comes in apparent contact with other neighbouring droplets in the cluster, but does not necessarily trigger further coalescence. In fact, such apparent contact can manifest as a bouncing interaction, and depending on the initial geometric arrangement of droplets, it can result in significant lateral momentum generation, consequently leading to spontaneous in-plane self-propulsion of the participating droplets. The energy conversion efficiency of this process reaches as high as 9\% for closely packed clusters of three sessile droplets and increases further with an increase in the number of participating droplets. The resulting self-propulsion of such small droplets reveals a new pathway for passive droplet removal and surface renewal during dropwise condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces, critical in multiple applications.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in viscoelastic fluids described by the Oldroyd-B model under small Deborah numbers</title>

Abstract: Viscoelastic fluids play a critical role in various engineering and biological applications, where their lubrication properties are strongly influenced by relaxation times ranging from microseconds to minutes. Although the lubrication mechanism for Newtonian fluids is well-established, its extension to viscoelastic materials - particularly under squeezing flow conditions - remains less explored. This study presents a semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in a Boger fluid under small Deborah numbers. Unlike previous works that assumed a Newtonian velocity field, we derive the velocity profile directly from the mass-momentum conservation and Oldroyd-B constitutive equations using lubrication theory and order-of-magnitude analysis techniques. Under steady-state conditions, viscoelasticity induces a marginal increase in the surface-to-surface normal force as a result of the increased pressure required to overcome the original resistance from the first normal-stress difference. Transient analyses reveal that the normal lubrication force is bounded by two Newtonian plateaus and is nonsymmetric as the spheres approach or separate. Our findings highlight the role of viscoelasticity in improving load capacity and provide new insight for modelling dense particle suspensions in Boger fluids, where short-range interactions dominate.</description>

Abstract: This study investigated the pulsating instability of burner-stabilized premixed CH4-O2 flames at various levels of CO2 dilution. Experiments were conducted using a water-cooled porous-plug burner of 18 mm diameter over a wide range of mixture compositions and flow rates, during which time-resolved measurements of flame chemiluminescence and gas temperature were obtained. The primary oscillation frequencies of the pulsating flames were determined using fast Fourier transform and harmonic power analysis. Phase-locked analysis of the chemiluminescence images revealed an interesting mode-transition phenomenon of the flame oscillations. Under fuel-rich conditions with relatively low heat release rates and low flow rates, the flames exhibited quasi-periodic single-mode oscillations. These oscillations were modulated by low-frequency flame flickering instabilities at elevated flow rates, which created sidebands around the primary oscillation frequency. At higher heat release rates, the flickering instability further triggered mode splitting, eventually leading to multi-mode oscillations. Regime diagrams of the flame oscillation modes, as well as the stability boundaries, were obtained under various fuel flow rates. These findings can be useful for both fundamental research on flame dynamics and practical applications of CO$_2$-moderated oxy-combustion.</description>

      <title>Interplay between tidal flows and magnetic fields in nonlinear simulations of stellar and planetary convective envelopes</title>

Abstract: Stars and planets in close systems are magnetised but the influence of magnetic fields on their tidal responses (and vice versa) and dissipation rates has not been well explored. We present exploratory nonlinear magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of tidally-excited inertial waves in convective envelopes. These waves probably provide the dominant contribution to tidal dissipation in several astrophysical settings, including tidal circularisation of solar-type binary stars and hot Jupiters, and orbital migration of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. We model convective envelopes as incompressible magnetised fluids in spherical shells harbouring an initially (rotationally-aligned) dipolar magnetic field. We find that depending on its strength (quantified by its Lehnert number Le) and the magnetic Prandtl number Pm, the magnetic field can either deeply modify the tidal response or be substantially altered by tidal flows. Simulations with small Le exhibit strong tidally-generated differential rotation (zonal flows) for sufficiently large tidal amplitudes, such that both the amplitude and topology of the initial magnetic field are tidally impacted. In contrast, strong magnetic fields can inhibit these zonal flows through large-scale magnetic torques, and by Maxwell stresses arising from magneto-rotational instability, which we identify and characterise in our simulations, along with the role of torsional Alfv\'en waves. Without tidally-driven zonal flows, the resulting tidal dissipation is close to the linear predictions. We quantify the transition Le as a function of Pm, finding it to be comparable to realistic values found in solar-like stars, such that we predict complex interactions between tidal flows and magnetic fields.</description>
