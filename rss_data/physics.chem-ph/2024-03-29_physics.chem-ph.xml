      <title>MiMiC: A High-Performance Framework for Multiscale Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MiMiC is a framework for performing multiscale simulations, where individual subsystems are handled at different resolutions and/or levels of theory by loosely coupled external programs. To make it highly efficient and flexible, we adopt an interoperable approach based on a multiple-program multiple-data paradigm, serving as an intermediary responsible for fast data exchange and interactions between the subsystems. The main goal of MiMiC is to avoid interfering with the underlying parallelization of the external programs, including the operability on hybrid architectures (e.g., CPU/GPU), and keep their setup and execution as close as possible to the original. At the moment, MiMiC offers an efficient implementation of electrostatic embedding QM/MM that has demonstrated unprecedented parallel scaling in simulations of large biomolecules using CPMD and GROMACS as QM and MM engines, respectively. However, as it is designed for high flexibility with general multiscale models in mind, it can be straightforwardly extended beyond QM/MM. In this article, we illustrate the software design and the features of the framework, which make it a compelling choice for multiscale simulations in the upcoming era of exascale high-performance computing.</description>

      <title>The role of chemo-mechanical modelling in the development of battery technology -- a perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the race to reduce global CO2 emissions and achieve net-zero, chemomechanics must play a critical role in the technological development of current and next-generation batteries to improve their energy storage capabilities and their lifetime. Many degradation processes arise through mechanics via the development of diffusion-induced stress and volumetric strains within the various constituent materials in a battery. From particle cracking in lithium-ion batteries to lithium dendrite-based fracture of solid electrolytes in solid-state batteries, it is clear that significant barriers exist in the development of these energy storage systems, where chemomechanics plays a central part. To accelerate technological and scientific advances in this area, multi-scale and highly coupled multiphysics modelling must be carried out that includes mechanics-based phenomena. In this perspective article, we provide an introduction to chemomechanical modelling, the various physical problems that it addresses, and the issues that need to be resolved in order to expand its use within the field of battery technology.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of chemical reactions using a variational quantum eigensolver method without specifying molecular charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemical calculations have attracted much attention as a practical application of quantum computing. Quantum computers can prepare superpositions of electronic states with various numbers of electrons on qubits. This special feature could be used to construct an efficient method for analyzing the structural variations of molecules and chemical reactions involving changes in molecular charge. The present work demonstrates a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm based on a cost function ($L_{cost}$) having the same form as the grand potential of the grand canonical ensemble of electrons. The chemical potential of the electrons ($w$) is used as an input to these VQE calculations, whereas the molecular charge is not specified in advance but rather is a physical quantity that results from the calculations. Calculations involving model systems are carried out to show the viability of this new approach. Calculations for typical electron-donating and electron-accepting molecules using this technique yielded cationic, neutral or anionic species depending on the value of $w$. Models representing the adsorption of water or ammonia on copper-based catalysts predicted that oxidation would be associated with such adsorption. The molecular structures in which such reactions occurred were found to be dependent on the catalyst model, the adsorbed molecular species, and the value of $w$. These results arise because the electronic state that gives the lowest $L_{cost}$ value depends on the value of $w$ and the molecular structure. This behaviour was successfully simulated by the present VQE calculations.</description>

      <title>Coherent control from quantum committment probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general definition of a quantum committor in order to clarify reaction mechanisms and facilitate control in processes where coherent effects are important. With a quantum committor, we generalize the notion of a transition state to quantum superpositions and quantify the effect of interference on the progress of the reaction. The formalism is applicable to any linear quantum master equation supporting metastability for which absorbing boundary conditions designating the reactant and product states can be applied. We use this formalism to determine the dependence of the quantum transition state on coherences in a polaritonic system and optimize the initialization state of a conical intersection model to control reactive outcomes, achieving yields of the desired state approaching 100%. In addition to providing a practical tool, the quantum committor provides a conceptual framework for understanding reactions in cases when classical intuitions fail.</description>

      <title>Reference Energies for Double Excitations: Improvement and Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of photochemistry, the significance of double excitations (also known as doubly-excited states), where two electrons are concurrently elevated to higher energy levels, lies in their involvement in key electronic transitions essential in light-induced chemical reactions as well as their challenging nature from the computational theoretical chemistry point of view. Based on state-of-the-art electronic structure methods (such as high-order coupled-cluster, selected configuration interaction, and multiconfigurational methods), we improve and expand our prior set of accurate reference excitation energies for electronic states exhibiting a substantial amount of double excitations [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01205; Loos et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 1939]. This extended collection encompasses 47 electronic transitions across 26 molecular systems that we separate into two distinct subsets: (i) 28 "genuine" doubly-excited states where the transitions almost exclusively involve doubly-excited configurations and (ii) 19 "partial" doubly-excited states which exhibit a more balanced character between singly- and doubly-excited configurations. For each subset, we assess the performance of high-order coupled-cluster (CC3, CCSDT, CC4, and CCSDTQ) and multiconfigurational methods (CASPT2, CASPT3, PC-NEVPT2, and SC-NEVPT2). Using as a probe the percentage of single excitations involved in a given transition ($\%T_1$) computed at the CC3 level, we also propose a simple correction that reduces the errors of CC3 by a factor of 3, for both sets of excitations. We hope that this more complete and diverse compilation of double excitations will help future developments of electronic excited-state methodologies.</description>

      <title>Capillary-lubrication force between rotating cylinders separated by a fluid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two cylinders rotating next to each other generate a large hydrodynamic force if the intermediate space is filled with a viscous fluid. Herein, we explore the case where the cylinders are separated by two layers of viscous immiscible fluids, in the limit of small capillary deformation of the fluid interface. As the interface deformation breaks the system's symmetry, a novel force characteristic of soft lubrication is generated. We calculate this capillary-lubrication force, which is split into velocity-dependant and acceleration-dependant contributions. Furthermore, we analyze the variations induced by modifying the viscosity ratio between the two fluid layers, their thickness ratio, and the Bond number. Unlike standard elastic cases, where a repelling soft-lubrication lift force has been abundantly reported, the current fluid bilayer setting can also exhibit an attractive force due to the non-monotonic deflection of the fluid interface when varying the sublayer thickness. Besides, at high Bond numbers, the system's response becomes analogous to the one of a Winkler-like substrate with a viscous flow inside.</description>

      <title>Water is a radiation protection agent for ionised pyrrole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.00453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation-induced damage of biological matter is an ubiquitous problem in nature. The influence of the hydration environment is widely discussed, but its exact role remains elusive. Utilising well defined solvated-molecule aggregates, we experimentally observed a hydrogen-bonded water molecule acting as a radiation protection agent for ionised pyrrole, a prototypical aromatic biomolecule. Pure samples of pyrrole and pyrrole(H$_2$O) were outer-valence ionised and the subsequent damage and relaxation processes were studied. Bare pyrrole ions fragmented through the breaking of C-C or N-C covalent bonds. However, for pyrrole(H$_2$O)$^+$, we observed a strong protection of the pyrrole ring through the dissociative release of neutral water or by transferring an electron or proton across the hydrogen bond. Overall, a single water molecule strongly reduces the fragmentation probability and thus the persistent radiation damage of singly-ionised pyrrole.</description>

      <title>Coupled cluster theory: Towards an algebraic geometry formulation</title>

Abstract: Coupled cluster theory produced arguably the most widely used high-accuracy computational quantum chemistry methods. Despite the approach's overall great computational success, its mathematical understanding is so far limited to results within the realm of functional analysis. The coupled cluster amplitudes, which are the targeted objects in coupled cluster theory, correspond to solutions to the coupled cluster equations, which is a system of polynomial equations of at most degree four. The high dimensionality of the electronic Schr\"odinger equation and the non-linearity of the coupled cluster ansatz have so far stalled a formal analysis of this polynomial system. In this article, we present algebraic investigations that shed light on the coupled cluster equations and the root structure of this ansatz. This is of importance for the a posteriori evaluation of coupled cluster calculations. To that end, we investigate the root structure by means of Newton polytopes. We derive a general v-description, which is subsequently turned into an h-description for explicit examples. This perspective reveals an apparent connection between Pauli's exclusion principle and the geometrical structure of the Newton polytopes. We also propose an alternative characterization of the coupled cluster equations projected onto singles and doubles as cubic polynomials on an algebraic variety with certain sparsity patterns. Moreover, we provide numerical simulations of two computationally tractable systems, namely, the two electrons in four spin-orbitals system and the three electrons in six spin-orbitals system. These simulations provide novel insight into the root structure of the coupled cluster solutions when the coupled cluster ansatz is truncated.</description>

      <title>Tensorial properties via the neuroevolution potential framework: Fast simulation of infrared and Raman spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared and Raman spectroscopy are widely used for the characterization of gases, liquids, and solids, as the spectra contain a wealth of information concerning in particular the dynamics of these systems. Atomic scale simulations can be used to predict such spectra but are often severely limited due to high computational cost or the need for strong approximations that limit application range and reliability. Here, we introduce a machine learning (ML) accelerated approach that addresses these shortcomings and provides a significant performance boost in terms of data and computational efficiency compared to earlier ML schemes. To this end, we generalize the neuroevolution potential approach to enable the prediction of rank one and two tensors to obtain the tensorial neuroevolution potential (TNEP) scheme. We apply the resulting framework to construct models for the dipole moment, polarizability, and susceptibility of molecules, liquids, and solids, and show that our approach compares favorably with several ML models from the literature with respect to accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the TNEP approach to the prediction of infrared and Raman spectra of liquid water, a molecule (PTAF-), and a prototypical perovskite with strong anharmonicity (BaZrO3). The TNEP approach is implemented in the free and open source software package GPUMD, which makes this methodology readily available to the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity in Point Defect Distribution and Mobility in Solid Ion Conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alkali metal anodes paired with solid ion conductors offer promising avenues for enhancing battery energy density and safety. To facilitate rapid ion transport crucial for fast charging and discharging, it is essential to understand point defects within these conductors. In this study, we investigate the heterogeneity of defect distribution in Li$_3$OCl solid ion conductor, quantifying the defect formation energy (DFE) of lithium vacancies and interstitials as a function of distance from the surface through first-principles simulations. Our results reveal that the surface DFE is consistently lower than bulk except for one surface termination, indicating significant defect aggregation at surfaces. This difference can cause the defect density to be up to 14 orders of magnitude higher at surfaces compared to the bulk. Moreover, we unveil the transition in DFE when moving from the surface to the bulk through the DFE function, which exhibits an exponentially decaying relationship. Incorporating this exponential trend, we develop a revised model for the average behavior of defects that offers a more accurate description of the influence of grain size. Surface effects dominate for grain sizes $\lesssim$ 1 $\mu$m, highlighting the importance of surface defect engineering and the DFE function for accurately capturing ion transport in devices. We further explore the kinetics of defect redistribution by calculating the migration barriers for defect movement between bulk and surfaces. We find a highly asymmetric energy landscape for the lithium vacancies, exhibiting lower migration barriers for movement towards the surface compared to the bulk, while interstitial defects exhibit comparable kinetics between surface and bulk regions. These insights underscore the importance of considering both thermodynamic and kinetic factors in the design of solid ion conductors.</description>

      <title>Chemically Motivated Simulation Problems are Efficiently Solvable by a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating chemical systems is highly sought after and computationally challenging, as the simulation cost exponentially increases with the system size. Quantum computers have been proposed as a computational means to overcome this bottleneck. Most efforts recently have been spent on determining the ground states of chemical systems. Hardness results and the lack of efficient heuristics for initial-state generation sheds doubt on the feasibility. Here we propose an inherently efficient approach for solving chemical simulation problems, meaning it requires quantum circuits of size scaling polynomially in relevant system parameters. If a set of assumptions can be satisfied, our approach finds good initial states by assembling initial states for dynamical simulation in a scattering tree. We discuss a variety of quantities of chemical interest that can be measured based on quantum simulation, e.g. of a reaction, succeeding the initial state preparation.</description>
