      <title>Explicit Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff Radii in Special Banach--Malcev Algebras of Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06357v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish explicit convergence radii for the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) series in special Banach--Malcev algebras of shifts-those embeddable into a Banach alternative algebra. Under the continuity estimate $\|[x,y]\|\leq B\|x\|\|y\|$, the series converges absolutely whenever $B(\|x\|+\|y\|)&lt;1/(4K)$, where $K\geq1$ bounds the absolute BCH coefficients. The constant $1/(4K)$ stems from a Catalan-number majorization and is sharp in the exponential-weight model. We compute $B$ explicitly for operator, exponential, polynomial, damped, and tree-like shift algebras, including the non-Lie split-octonionic (Zorn) algebra ($B=2$, $\rho=1/(8K)$). All results require the speciality assumption; the framework does not apply to general Malcev algebras. Geometrically, $\rho=1/(4KB)$ is the analyticity radius of the induced Moufang loop; numerically, it governs stability of BCH-type integrators.</description>

      <title>Associative $H$-pseudoalgebras with a semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Family algebraic structures indexed by a semigroup arise naturally in renormalizations of quantum field theory. In this paper, we first define the notion of $\Omega$-associative $H$-pseudoalgebra, where the operations are indexed by pairs of elements from a semigroup $\Omega$. Then we construct $\Omega$-associative $H$-pseudoalgebras from associative $H$-pseudoalgebras, $\Omega$-associative algebras, Rota-Baxter family algebras, $\Omega$-type $H$-pseudoalgebras and family-type $H$-pseudoalgebras. Moreover, we investigate the cohomology of $\Omega$-associative $H$-pseudoalgebras and establish that it both induces the cohomology of pseudo-$\mathcal{O}$-operator families and governs the associated formal deformations. As an application, we show that the first-order deformation of a commutative $\Omega$-associative $H$-pseudoalgebra yields an $\Omega$-Poisson $H$-pseudoalgebra.</description>

Abstract: We give several examples of tilting-discrete symmetric algebras; in particular, one explores which algebra has tilting-discrete trivial extension. We provide a counter example of the conjecture stating any {\tau} -tilting finite symmetric algebra is tiltingdiscrete. Also, we discuss the tilting-disconnectedness of symmetric algebras and give new examples of tilting-disconnected symmetric algebras.</description>

      <title>Structured Symmetric Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study structured symmetric tensors. We introduce several new classes of structured symmetric tensors: completely decomposable (CD) tensors, strictly sum of squares (SSOS) tensors and SOS$^*$ tensors. CD tensors have applications in data analysis and signal processing. Complete Hankel tensors are CD tensors. SSOS tensors are defined as SOS tensors with a positive definite Gram matrix, ensuring structural stability under perturbations. The SOS$^*$ cone is defined as the dual cone of the SOS tensor cone, with characterizations via moment matrices and polynomial nonnegativity. We study the relations among completely positive (CP) cones, CD cones, sum of squares (SOS) cones, positive semidefinite (PSD) cones and copositive (COP) cones. We identify the interiors of PSD, SOS, CP, COP and CD cones for even-order tensors. These characterizations are crucial for interior-point methods and stability analysis in polynomial and tensor optimization. We generalize the classical Schur product theorem to CD and CP tensors, including the case of strongly completely decomposable (SCD) and strongly completely positive (SCP) tensors. We identify equivalence between strictly CD (SCD) and positive definite (PD) for CD tensors. This result establishes a key link between the spanning property of decomposition vectors and positive definiteness.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the properties Koszul, Artin-Schelter regular and (skew) Calabi-Yau of some special types of quantum and generalized Heisenberg algebras and also analyze relations between these algebras, (graded) iterated Ore extensions and (graded) skew PBW extensions. The first-named author and Razavinia introduced the quantum generalized Heisenberg algebras, which depend on a parameter $q$ and two polynomials $f, g\in K[t]$. We prove that under certain conditions for $f$, $g$ these algebras are Koszul, Artin-Shelter regular, Calabi-Yau and graded Calabi-Yau.</description>

      <title>Formal matrix representations of pseudo-Frobenius and Frobenius rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rings with Nakayama permutations, pseudo-Frobenius and Frobenius rings in particular, are studied by applying the general theory of formal matrix rings to their Peirce decompositions. A combinatorial criterion is given to decide whether a formal matrix ring with local rings on the diagonal has a prescribed Nakayama permutation.
  It is shown that a pseudo-Frobenius ring R can be represented as a block matrix ring, where the blocks on the diagonal are pseudo-Frobenius rings corresponding to cycles in the Nakayama permutation of R. All possible supports of such blocks are characterised. In the finite case, their local corner rings are shown to be isomorphic. We characterise local corners of quasi-Frobenius rings as a subclass of rings with a Morita self-duality. The duality contexts between these corners then appear on the shifted diagonal of their formal matrix representations.
  Using the combinatorial criterion, we give, under mild assumptions, a method of how to glue two rings with a Nakayama permutation. It is then used to construct an indecomposable Frobenius ring with two simple modules whose rings of endomorphisms are not isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Notes on Simplifying the Construction of Barabanov Norms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To answer the question about the growth rate of matrix products, the concepts of joint and generalized spectral radius were introduced in the 1960s. A common tool for finding the joint/generalized spectral radius is the so-called extremal norms and, in particular, the Barabanov norm. The goal of this paper is to try to combine the advantages of different approaches based on the concept of extremality in order to obtain results that are simpler for everyday use. It is shown how the Dranishnikov-Konyagin theorem on the existence of a special invariant body for a set of matrices can be used to construct a Barabanov norm. A modified max-relaxation algorithm for constructing Barabanov norms, which follows from this theorem, is described. Additional techniques are also described that simplify the construction of Barabanov norms under the assumption that</description>

      <title>On flat deformations and their applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a formal deformation from an algebra $N$ to algebra $A$ is strongly flat if for every real number $e $ there is a real number $0&lt;s&lt;e$ such that this deformation specialised at $t=s$ gives an algebra isomorphic to $A$.
  We show that every strongly flat deformation from a finite-dimensional $C$-algebra $N$ to a semisimple $C$-algebra $A$
  specialised at $t=s$ for all sufficiently small real numbers $s&gt;0$ gives an algebra isomorphic to $A$.
  It is shown that all semisimple algebras which can be obtained as a specialisation of such a deformation are isomorphic.
  We also show that every strongly flat deformation $\mathcal N=N\{t\}$ from a finite-dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra $N$ to a semisimple $\mathbb C$-algebra $A$
  specialised at $t=s$ for all sufficiently small real numbers $s&gt;0$ gives an algebra isomorphic to $A$. A remark by Joachim Jelisiejew is also included which allows us to obtain this result as an application of Gabriel's theorem [6].
  We also give a characterisation of semisimple algebras $A$ to which a given algebra $N$ cannot be deformed to. This gives a partial answer to a question of Michael Wemyss on Acons [26]. We also give a partial answer to question 6.5 from [1].</description>

      <title>Leibniz-dendriform bialgebras and relative Rota-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of Leibniz-dendriform bialgebras and establish their equivalence with phase spaces and matched pairs of Leibniz algebras. The study of the coboundary case leads naturally to the Leibniz-dendriform Yang-Baxter equation (LD-YBE). We prove that skew-symmetric solutions of the LD-YBE give rise to coboundary Leibniz-dendriform bialgebras.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that solutions not necessarily skew-symmetric can also induce such bialgebras. This observation motivates the introduction of quasi-triangular and factorizable Leibniz-dendriform bialgebras. In particular, we show that solutions of the LD-YBE with invariant symmetric parts yield quasi-triangular Leibniz-dendriform bialgebras. Such solutions are also interpreted as relative Rota-Baxter operators with weights. Finally, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between quadratic Rota-Baxter Leibniz-dendriform algebras
  and factorizable Leibniz-dendriform bialgebras.</description>

      <title>A Gentle Introduction to Algebraic Operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This text, based on the author's Bachelor's thesis, introduces the theory of Algebraic Operads, a mathematical formalism that provides a unifying framework for modern algebra. We demonstrate how the fundamental theories of associative, commutative, and Lie algebras can be fully recovered as categories of representations of three archetypal operads: $\mathsf{As}$, $\mathsf{Com}$ and $\mathsf{Lie}$ -- the so-called 'three graces' of algebra.
  Following a deductive and self-contained approach, the notion of an operad is initially presented in its classical form, as a single-object multicategory. Subsequently, alternative definitions -- namely, the partial and functorial definitions -- are provided. This framework allows for the extension of classical algebraic notions, such as free objects and quotients, to the operadic context, thereby enabling operads to be formally presented through generators and relations.
  The central result of this work is the rigorous proof of the correspondence between operads and algebras. We establish isomorphisms of categories between the algebras over the operads $\mathsf{As}$, $\mathsf{Com}$ and $\mathsf{Lie}$, and their respective classical counterparts.
  This thesis thus highlights how the theory of operads offers a higher-level language for algebra, encoding entire algebraic theories within single mathematical objects. This formalism not only unifies known structures but also lays the foundation for advanced concepts, such as 'algebras up to homotopy,' with applications in fields like theoretical physics and geometry.</description>
