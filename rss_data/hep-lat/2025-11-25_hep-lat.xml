      <title>Tensor network simulations of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Parton Distribution functions (GPDs) are off-diagonal light-cone matrix elements that encode the internal structure of hadrons in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom. In this work, we present the first nonperturbative study of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions (QED2), within the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory. Quasi-distributions are spatial correlation functions of boosted states, which approach the relevant light-cone distributions in the luminal limit. Using tensor networks, we prepare the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime and boost it to close to the light-cone on lattices of up to 400 lattice sites. We compute both quasi-parton distribution functions and, for the first time, quasi-GPDs, and study their convergence for increasingly boosted states. In addition, we perform analytic calculations of GPDs in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit, providing qualitative benchmarks for the tensor network results. Our analysis establishes computational benchmarks for accessing partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories, offering a starting point for future extensions to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of chiral 2-flavor QCD based on an effective approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite intense experimental and theoretical research, the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon density remains to a large extent unexplored. From the theoretical side, the obvious non-perturbative approach is lattice QCD simulations, which are, however, obstructed by a severe sign problem. Here we employ the O(4) non-linear $\sigma$-model as an effective theory for 2-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. The identical pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking indicates that they belong to the same universality class. We assume high temperature dimensional reduction to the 3d O(4) model, with topological charge taking the role of the baryon number, along the lines of Skyrme's model. In this effective formulation, the baryonic chemical potential $\mu_{B}$ can be included in the lattice formulation without causing any sign problem in Monte Carlo simulations. This allows us to pin down the critical line, i.e. the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}(\mu_{B})$, which decreases monotonically for increasing $\mu_{B}$. In the range $0 &lt; \mu_{B} \lesssim 309~{\rm MeV}$ and $132~{\rm MeV} \gtrsim T_{\rm c} \gtrsim 106~{\rm MeV}$, we do not find a Critical Endpoint (CEP), although there are hints for it to be in the vicinity of the maximal $\mu_{B}$-value that we could explore.</description>

      <title>Precision estimates of large charge RG exponents $Y_q$ in the 3D XY universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We accurately compute the RG exponents $Y_q$ of large $q$ fields at the $O(2)$ invariant fixed point in three dimensions. We build on an iterative approach that has been previously proposed and is implemented by using the worm algorithm. We simulate an improved XY model, that has next-to-next-to-nearest couplings in addition to nearest ones. In the worm update we incorporate weights, which allows us to obtain accurate results up to $q=64$. For example we get $Y_q=1.76370(12)$, $0.89167(23)$, and $-0.11203(34)$ for $q=2$, $3$, and $4$, respectively. The comparison with the large $q$ effective field theory gives an excellent agreement down to $q=4$ and provides accurate estimates of the parameters of the effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Proton mass decompositions in the NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor are expressed by the gravitational form factors. The forward values of the gravitational form factors allow for a decomposition of the proton mass into the contributions from quarks and gluons, and the further subdivisions into the contributions from quark masses and from the QCD trace anomaly may be considered. We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.</description>

      <title>Projected Density Matrix Sampling for Lattice Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Magnetic susceptibility of hot hadronic medium and quark degrees of freedom near the QCD cross-over point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the lattice QCD results for the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility of the medium below the cross-over temperature are difficult to reconcile with the available hadronic models. In particular, in the widely used Hadron Resonance Gas model, reproducing well numerous other features of the medium, one observes a substantially too strong diamagnetism compared to the lattice simulations. One thus needs a significant source of paramagnetism below the QCD cross-over temperature, possible to achieve with sufficiently light fermions. We thus consider a quark-meson model, where the temperature-dependent quark masses are fixed from the baryon-baryon and baryon-strangeness susceptibility data from the lattice at zero magnetic field. We show that in such a framework one can describe the magnetic susceptibility, with the vacuum contributions duly incorporated. In the hadronic picture, we also evaluate the contribution of the pion--vector-meson loops to the magnetic susceptibility evaluated via the photon polarization, showing it is small and paramagnetic.</description>

      <title>Hints for a Geon from Causal Dynamic Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.</description>

      <title>SO(3) real algebra method for SU(3) QCD at finite baryon-number densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For SU(3) lattice QCD calculations at finite baryon-number densities, we propose the ``SO(3) real algebra method'', in which the SU(3) gauge variable is divided into the SO(3) and SU(3)/SO(3) parts. In this method, we introduce the ``maximal SO(3) gauge'' by minimizing the SU(3)/SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable. In the Monte Carlo calculation, the SO(3) real algebra method employs the SO(3) fermionic determinant, i.e., the fermionic determinant of the SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable, in the maximal SO(3) gauge, as well as the positive SU(3) gauge action factor $e^{-S_G}$. Here, the SO(3) fermionic determinant is real, and it is non-negative for the even-number flavor case ($N_f=2n$) of the same quark mass, e.g., $m_u=m_d$. The SO(3) real algebra method alternates between the maximal SO(3) gauge fixing and Monte Carlo updates on the SO(3) determinant and $e^{-S_G}$. After the most importance sampling, the ratio of the SU(3) and SO(3) fermionic determinants is treated as a weight factor. If the phase factor of the ratio does not fluctuate significantly among the sampled gauge configurations for a set of parameters (e.g., volume, chemical potential, and quark mass), then SU(3) lattice QCD calculations at finite densities would be feasible.</description>

      <title>The mass of the lightest gluelump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the most up-to-date determinations of the normalization of the leading renormalons of the pole mass, the singlet static potential, the octet static potential, and the gluelump energy. They read $Z^{\rm MS}_m=-Z^{\rm MS}_{V_s}/2=\{0.604(17),0.551(20)\}$, $Z^{\rm MS}_{V_o}=\{0.136(8),0.121(13)\}$, and $Z^{\rm MS}_A=\{-1.343(36),-1.224(43)\}$, for $n_f=0$ and $n_f=3$ respectively. We obtain two independent renormalization group invariant and renormalization scale independent determinations of the energy of the ground state gluelump in the principal value summation scheme: $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.47(9)r_0^{-1}$ and $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.38(11)r_0^{-1}$. They combine in $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.44(7)r_0^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gradient flow exact renormalization (GFERG) is a variant of the exact renormalization group of gauge theory that aims to preserve gauge symmetry as manifestly as possible. From an integral representation of the Wilson action in GFERG for the Yang--Mills theory, we explicitly compute the one-loop renormalization group functions that reproduce correct coefficients. From the correspondence with the gradient flow formalism by L\"uscher and Weisz, we also argue that GFERG reproduces the conventional renormalization group functions in all orders of perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Discovering the $D_0^\ast(2100)$ in $B$ semileptonic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass and width of the lightest scalar open-charm state listed in the Review of Particle Physics, the $D_0^\ast(2300)$, are in puzzling tension with predictions from unitarized chiral perturbation theory (UChPT) and lattice QCD, which favor a lighter state at around $2100$ MeV. However, to date, no direct experimental evidence for this lighter state exists. In an effort to facilitate a direct observation, we introduce angular asymmetries of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays that allow for a direct extraction of the $D\pi$ S-wave phase shift and discuss a novel measurement strategy for the Belle II experiment. We conduct a sensitivity study, finding that the Belle II experiment can determine the pole location with sufficient precision to firmly establish the $D_0^\ast(2100)$ using the currently available data set. We also investigate the possibility and necessary statistics of measuring the $D\pi$ isospin 1/2 scattering length with an accuracy sufficient to distinguish between the predictions from both UChPT and lattice QCD and the measurement by ALICE using femtoscopy.</description>

      <title>Masses of Purely Top-Quark Bound States: Toponium and the Triply-Top Baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the pseudoscalar ($\eta_t$) and vector ($\psi_t$) toponium states, as well as the triply-top baryon ($\Omega_{ttt}$), using the QCD sum-rule method. This study was motivated by the recent observation of a pseudoscalar enhancement near the $t\bar{t}$ threshold, reported by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations with a statistical significance exceeding $5\sigma$. In the calculations, we consider both the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions, with the nonperturbative operators taken into account up to dimension eight. The results obtained for the pseudoscalar toponium provide a theoretical estimate that is consistent with the near-threshold events observed in recent experimental studies. The calculated negative binding energy for both the pseudoscalar and vector toponium states reflects the strong correlation within the $t\bar{t}$ system and can be interpreted as $t\bar{t}$ bound states, while the calculated central mass for the $\Omega_{ttt}$ slightly exceeds the central value of the sum of the constituent top-quark masses. The results of this study can provide a precise theoretical guide for future experimental investigations of these states, which are composed entirely of top quarks, at high-energy colliders such as the LHC and future facilities like the FCC.</description>
