      <title>Exploring Fourier methods with beer bottles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As anyone who has blown across the mouth of a beer bottle knows, beer bottles have a well-defined fundamental frequency. This paper shows how a beer bottle's acoustical resonance can be modeled as a one-dimensional driven-damped oscillator and includes enough detail to be useful in undergraduate laboratory experiments. While the frequency-domain Green's function of the bottle can be extracted through sequential pure-tone measurements, sufficient data to fit the model's parameters can be collected in just a few seconds when Fourier methods are used.</description>

      <title>Formative experience for intensive instruction physics courses: Evaluation and results in an Electromagnetism course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the increase in demand for higher education has motivated universities to offer courses in various formats, including Intensive Instruction Courses (CII), in order to adapt to the needs of an increasingly diverse student body. In this context, although active methodologies have been shown to improve conceptual understanding of physics in regular courses, little research has been done on their effectiveness in CII. This research explored the most efficient methodologies for promoting meaningful learning in intensive physics courses. To this end, an integrated pedagogical proposal was designed based on the opinions gathered from a focus group of teachers with previous experience teaching these courses, as well as on existing literature, highlighting methodologies, types of assessment, and characteristics of intensive courses. To evaluate its efficiency, a quasi-experiment was conducted in which students were divided into two groups: an experimental group (EG), which followed the teaching proposal, and a control group (CG), which received non-innovated lessons. Results were measured using the BEMA electromagnetism concepts inventory before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis revealed that Hake's gain was greater in the EG, both in general terms and in each thematic unit of the course. The intervention in the EG shows that the use of active methodologies proved to be more efficient than that of the CG in the context of CII. The results obtained suggest the need to continue investigating other factors involved in the teaching-learning process of CII.</description>

      <title>On emerging paradigm of teaching measurement science and technology in times of ubiquitous use of AI tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquitous use of the tools of artificial intelligence (AI) in techno-science, in higher education and in other existing and potential fields of measurement application generates new challenges for teaching measurement science and technology (MST). The aim of this article is to encourage its readers to modernize their approach to teaching MST in a way as to meet these challenges, in particular - to profit from new technological opportunities, and to respond to the needs of our civilization, identified within a humanistic reflection over its development. First, the state of the art in applications of AI in higher education is briefly characterized. Next, a methodology for using AI tools in MST, referring to the author's meta-model of measurement, is outlined. Finally, conclusions concerning an emerging paradigm of teaching MST are summarized. The most important of them are as follows. The challenges implied by the ubiquitous use of AI tools cannot be effectively faced without enhancing, in the corresponding curricula, of the contents related to mathematical modelling of material entities, on the one hand, and of the contents related to ethics of research and engineering, on the other. Knowledge and skills related to the art of mathematical modelling are indispensable for extensively profiting from the convergence of various technologies around IT tools, including AI tools. The knowledge and skills related to ethics of research and engineering are indispensable for developing safe applications of measurement in such domains as autonomous vehicles, social robots, biomedical engineering or automated manufacturing.</description>

      <title>The SIREN Program: A Scalable Model for Short-Term Undergraduate Research Experiences at Community Colleges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing meaningful research experiences for undergraduate students is a well-recognized challenge, particularly at community colleges and teaching-focused institutions where resources are limited and faculty time is dedicated to instruction. To address this, the Summer Introduction to Research and Experimentation in Nuclear physics (SIREN) was developed as a three-week, intensive summer program that engaged 24 students working in six teams on original research projects centered around cosmic detection. Each team was supported by an advisor and a peer mentor, combining structured guidance with near-peer learning. After developing a range of technical skills, students built cosmic detectors and used them to explore a variety of projects. The program also included multiple workshops on research skills and seminars led by guest speakers, giving students access to broader STEM pathways. The evaluation of the program was based on advisor and student surveys, as well as peer mentor observations. The findings suggest that the short-term team-based model promoted engagement, collaboration, and skill development while leading to the completion of advanced projects. The advisors highlighted the effectiveness of the program structure and the excitement generated by the direct application of newly acquired skills to research. Data showed that students were able to significantly develop transferable skills through hands-on activities. Post-program surveys indicated that participants experienced an increased sense of belonging in their majors and greater confidence in pursuing careers in STEM.</description>

      <title>Visualization enhances Problem Solving in multi-Qubit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Information Science (QIS) is a vast, diverse, and abstract field. In consequence, learners face many challenges. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education research has found that visualizations are valuable to aid learners in complex matters. The conditions under which visualizations pose benefits are largely unexplored in QIS education. In this eye-tracking study, we examine the conditions under which the visualization of multi-qubit systems with the Dimensional Circle Notation (DCN) in addition to the mathematical symbolic Dirac Notation (DN) is associated with a benefit for solving problems on the ubiquitously used Hadamard gate operation in terms of performance, Extraneous Cognitive Load (ECL) and Intrinsic Cognitive Load (ICL). We find that DCN increases performance and reduces cognitive load for participants with little experience in quantum physics. In addition, representational competence is able to predict reductions in ECL with DCN, but not performance or ICL. Analysis of the eye-tracking results indicates that task solvers with more transitions between DN and DCN benefit less from the visualization. We discuss the generalizability of the results and practical implications.</description>
