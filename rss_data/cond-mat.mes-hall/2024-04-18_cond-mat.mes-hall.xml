      <title>Quantized Acoustoelectric Floquet Effect in Quantum Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External coherent fields can drive quantum materials into non-equilibrium states, revealing exotic properties that are unattainable under equilibrium conditions -- an approach known as ``Floquet engineering.'' While optical lasers have commonly been used as the driving fields, recent advancements have introduced nontraditional sources, such as coherent phonon drives. Building on this progress, we demonstrate that driving a metallic quantum nanowire with a coherent wave of terahertz phonons can induce an electronic steady state characterized by a persistent quantized current along the wire. The quantization of the current is achieved due to the coupling of electrons to the nanowire's vibrational modes, providing the low-temperature heat bath and energy relaxation mechanisms. Our findings underscore the potential of using non-optical drives, such as coherent phonon sources, to induce non-equilibrium phenomena in materials. Furthermore, our approach suggests a new method for the high-precision detection of coherent phonon oscillations via transport measurements.</description>

      <title>A many-body perturbation approach to moir\'e bands in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a many-body perturbation theory to account for the emergence of moir\'e bands in the continuum model of twisted bilayer graphene. Our framework is build upon treating the moir\'e potential as a perturbation that transfers electrons from one layer to another through the exchange of the three wave vectors that define the moir\'e Brillouin zone. By working in the two-band basis of each monolayer, we analyze the one-particle Green's function and introduce a diagrammatic representation for the scattering processes. We then identify the moir\'e-induced self-energy, relate it to the quasiparticle weight and velocity of the moir\'e bands, and show how it can be obtained by summing irreducible diagrams. We also connect the emergence of flat bands to the behavior of the static self-energy at the magic angle. In particular, we show that a vanishing Dirac velocity is a direct consequence of the relative orientation of the momentum transfer vectors, suggesting that the origin of magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene is intrinsically connected to its geometrical properties. Our approach provides a many-body diagrammatic framework that highlights the physical properties of the moir\'e bands.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium finite frequency resonances in differential quantum noise driven by Majorana interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium quantum noise $S^&gt;(\omega,V)$ measured at finite frequencies $\omega$ and bias voltages $V$ probes Majorana bound states in a host nanostructure via fluctuation fingerprints unavailable in average currents or static shot noise. When Majorana interference is brought into play, it enriches nonequilibrium states and makes their nature even more unique. Here we demonstrate that an interference of two Majorana modes via a nonequilibrium quantum dot gives rise to a remarkable finite frequency response of the differential quantum noise $\partial S^&gt;(\omega,V,\Delta\phi)/\partial V$ driven by the Majorana phase difference $\Delta\phi$. Specifically, at low bias voltages there develops a narrow resonance of width $\hbar\Delta\omega\sim\sin^2\Delta\phi$ at a finite frequency determined by $V$, whereas for high bias voltages there arise two antiresonances at two finite frequencies controlled by both $V$ and $\Delta\phi$. We show that the maximum and minimum of these resonance and antiresonances have universal fractional values, $3e^3/4h$ and $-e^3/4h$. Moreover, detecting the frequencies of the antiresonances provides a potential tool to measure $\Delta\phi$ in nonequilibrium experiments on Majorana finite frequency quantum noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in semiconductors, traditionally seen as detrimental to electronic device performance, have emerged as potential assets in quantum technologies due to their unique quantum properties. This study investigates the interaction between defects and quantum electron transport in GaN/AlGaN field-effect transistors, highlighting the observation of Fano resonances at low temperatures. We observe the resonance spectra and their dependence on gate voltage and magnetic fields. To explain the observed behavior, we construct the possible scenario as a Fano interferometer with finite width. Our findings reveal the potential of semiconductor defects to contribute to the development of quantum information processing, providing their role to key components in next-generation quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Coherent optical control of quantum Hall edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current carrying chiral edge states in quantum Hall systems have fascinating properties that are usually studied by electron spectroscopy and interferometry. Here we demonstrate that electron occupation, current, and electron coherence in chiral edge states can be selectively probed and controlled by low-energy electromagnetic radiation in the microwave to infrared range without affecting electron states in the bulk or destroying quantum Hall effect conditions in the bulk of the sample. Both linear and nonlinear optical control is possible due to inevitable violation of adiabaticity and inversion symmetry breaking for electron states near the edge. This opens up new pathways for frequency- and polarization-selective spectroscopy and control of individual edge states.</description>

      <title>Dyakonov-Perel-like Orbital and Spin Relaxations in Centrosymmetric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dyakonov-Perel (DP) mechanism of spin relaxation has long been considered irrelevant in centrosymmetric systems since it was developed originally for non-centrosymmetric ones. We investigate whether this conventional understanding extends to the realm of orbital relaxation, which has recently attracted significant attention. Surprisingly, we find that orbital relaxation in centrosymmetric systems exhibits the DP-like behavior in the weak scattering regime. Moreover, the DP-like orbital relaxation can make the spin relaxation in centrosymmetric systems DP-like through the spin-orbit coupling. We also find that the DP-like orbital and spin relaxations are anisotropic even in materials with high crystal symmetry (such as face-centered cubic structure) and may depend on the orbital and spin nature of electron wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of a Kondo spin screening cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In metals and semiconductors, an impurity spin is quantum entangled with and thereby screened by surrounding conduction electrons at low temperatures, called the Kondo screening cloud. Quantum confinement of the Kondo screening cloud in a region, called a Kondo box, with a length smaller than the original cloud extension length strongly deforms the screening cloud and provides a way of controlling the entanglement. Here we realize such a Kondo box and develop an approach to controlling and monitoring the entanglement. It is based on a spin localized in a semiconductor quantum dot, which is screened by conduction electrons along a quasi-one-dimensional channel. The box is formed between the dot and a quantum point contact placed on a channel. As the quantum point contact is tuned to make the confinement stronger, electron conductance through the dot as a function of temperature starts to deviate from the known universal function of the single energy scale, the Kondo temperature. Nevertheless, the entanglement is monitored by the measured conductance according to our theoretical development. The dependence of the monitored entanglement on the confinement strength and temperature implies that the Kondo screening is controlled by tuning the quantum point contact. Namely, the Kondo cloud is deformed by the Kondo box in the region across the original cloud length. Our findings offer a way of manipulating and detecting spatially extended quantum many-body entanglement in solids by electrical means.</description>

      <title>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy for Molecules: Manipulating Electrons and Photons by Varying Buffer Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scanning tunneling microscopy of molecules, an insulating buffer layer is often introduced to reduce interaction between the molecules and the substrate. Focusing on tunneling through the molecule's electronic transport gap, we demonstrate that the buffer itself strongly influences the wave function of the tunneling electron at the molecule. This is exemplified for an adsorbed platinum phthalocyanine molecule by varying the composition and thickness of the buffer. We find that, in particular, the buffer's lattice parameter is crucial. By expanding the wave function of the tunneling electron in molecular orbitals (MOs), we illustrate how one can strongly vary the relative weights of different MOs, such as the highest occupied MO versus some low-lying MOs with few nodal surfaces. The set of MOs with significant weight are important for processes used to manipulate the state of the molecule by a tunneling electron, such as molecular luminescence. The choice of buffer therefore provides an important tool for manipulating these processes.</description>

      <title>Transport of orbital currents in systems with strong intervalley coupling: the case of Kekul\'e distorted graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that orbital currents can describe the transport of orbital magnetic moments of Bloch states in models where the formalism based on valley current is not applicable. As a case study, we consider Kekul\'e distorted graphene. We begin by analyzing the band structure in detail and obtain the orbital magnetic moment operator for this model within the framework of the modern theory of magnetism. Despite the simultaneous presence of time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries, such operator may be defined, although its expectation value at a given energy is zero. Nevertheless, its presence can be exposed by the application of an external magnetic field. We then proceed to study the transport of these quantities. In the Kekul\'e-$O$ distorted graphene model, the strong coupling between different valleys prevents the definition of a bulk valley current. However, the formalism of the orbital Hall effect together with the non-Abelian description of the magnetic moment operator can be directly applied to describe its transport in these types of models. We show that the Kekul\'e-$O$ distorted graphene model exhibits an orbital Hall insulating plateau whose height is inversely proportional to the energy band gap produced by intervalley coupling. Our results strengthen the perspective of using the orbital Hall effect formalism as a preferable alternative to the valley Hall effect</description>

      <title>Vortex motion in reconfigurable three-dimensional superconducting nanoarchitectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When materials are patterned in three dimensions, there exist opportunities to tailor and create functionalities associated with an increase in complexity, the breaking of symmetries, and the introduction of curvature and non-trivial topologies. For superconducting nanostructures, the extension to the third dimension may trigger the emergence of new physical phenomena, as well as advances in technologies. Here, we harness three-dimensional (3D) nanopatterning to fabricate and control the emergent properties of a 3D superconducting nanostructure. Not only are we able to demonstrate the existence and motion of superconducting vortices in 3D but, with simulations, we show that the confinement leads to a well-defined bending of the vortices within the volume of the structure. Moreover, we experimentally observe a strong geometrical anisotropy of the critical field, through which we achieve the reconfigurable coexistence of superconducting and normal states in our 3D superconducting architecture, and the local definition of weak links. In this way, we uncover an intermediate regime of nanosuperconductivity, where the vortex state is truly three-dimensional and can be designed and manipulated by geometrical confinement. This insight into the influence of 3D geometries on superconducting properties offers a route to local reconfigurable control for future computing devices, sensors, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Spin-1 Haldane chains of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the possibility of realizing the symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase of spin-1 chains in a tunable hybrid platform of superconducting islands (SIs) and quantum dots (QDs). Inspired by recent findings suggesting that an appropriately tuned QD-SI-QD block may behave as a robust spin-1 unit, we study the behavior of many such units tunnel-coupled into linear chains. Our efficient and fully microscopic modeling of long chains with several tens of units is enabled by the use of the surrogate model solver [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023); arXiv:2402.18357]. Our numerical findings indicate that the QD-SI-QD chains exhibit emblematic features of the Haldane phase, such as fractional spin-1/2 edge states and non-vanishing string order parameters, and that these persist over a sizeable region of parameter space. Increasing the coupling between neighboring units gradually degrades their individual spin-1 character and leads to a trivial dimerized phase.</description>

      <title>Effects of Reduced Interlayer Interactions on the K-point Excitons of MoS$_2$ Nanoscrolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanoscrolls (NS) exhibit significant photoluminescence (PL) signals despite their multilayer structure, which cannot be explained by the strained multilayer description of NS. Here, we investigate the interlayer interactions in NS to address this discrepancy. The reduction of interlayer interactions in NS is attributed to two factors: (1) the symmetry-broken mixed stacking order between neighbouring layers due to misalignment, and (2) the high inhomogeneity in the strain landscape resulting from the unique Archimedean spiral-like geometry with positive eccentricity. These were confirmed through transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. To probe the effect of reduction of interlayer interactions in multilayered MoS$_2$ nanoscrolls, low-temperature PL spectroscopy was employed investigating the behaviour of K-point excitons. The effects of reduced interlayer interactions on exciton-phonon coupling (EXPC), exciton energy, and exciton oscillator strength are discussed, providing insights into the unique properties of TMD nanoscrolls.</description>

      <title>High spin axion insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion insulators possess a quantized axion field $\theta=\pi$ protected by combined lattice and time-reversal symmetry, holding great potential for device applications in layertronics and quantum computing. Here, we propose a high-spin axion insulator (HSAI) defined in large spin-$s$ representation, which maintains the same inherent symmetry but possesses a notable axion field $\theta=(s+1/2)^2\pi$. Such distinct axion field is confirmed independently by the direct calculation of the axion term using hybrid Wannier functions, layer-resolved Chern numbers, as well as the topological magneto-electric effect. We show that the guaranteed gapless quasi-particle excitation is absent at the boundary of the HSAI despite its integer surface Chern number, hinting an unusual quantum anomaly violating the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we ascertain that the axion field $\theta$ can be precisely tuned through an external magnetic field, enabling the manipulation of bonded transport properties. The HSAI proposed here can be experimentally verified in ultra-cold atoms by the quantized non-reciprocal conductance or topological magnetoelectric response. Our work enriches the understanding of axion insulators in condensed matter physics, paving the way for future device applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Robustness via Loss Engineering in Detuned Non-Hermitian Scattering Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian optics has revealed a series of counterintuitive phenomena with profound implications for sensing, lasing, and light manipulation. While the non-Hermiticity of Hamitonians is well-recognized, recent advancements in non-Hermitian physics have broadened to include scattering matrices, uncovering phenomena such as simultaneous lasing and coherent perfect absorption (CPA), reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs), and coherent chaos control. Despite these developments, the investigation has predominantly focused on static and symmetric configurations, leaving the dynamic properties of non-Hermitian scattering in detuned systems largely unexplored. Bridging this gap, we extend certain stationary non-Hermitian scattering phenomena to detuned systems. We delve into the interplay between bi-directional RSMs and RSM exceptional points (EPs), and elucidate the global existence conditions for RSMs under detuning. Moreover, we introduces a novel category of EPs, characterized by the coalescence of transmission peaks, emerging independent with the presence of Hamiltonian EPs. The transmission EPs (TEPs) exhibit flat-top lineshape and can be extended to a square-shaped spectrum when detuning is involved, accompanied by a distinctive phase transition. Significantly, we demonstrate the applications of the TEPs in a one-dimensional coupled cavity system, engineered to enhance sensing robustness against environmental instabilities such as laser frequency drifts, which can exceed 10 MHz. This capability represents a substantial improvement over traditional sensing methods and an important improvement of fragile EP sensors. Our findings not only contribute to the broader understanding of non-Hermitian scattering phenomena but also paves the way for future advancements in non-Hermitian sensing technologies.</description>

Abstract: Topology is routinely used to understand the physics of electronic insulators. However, for strongly interacting electronic matter, such as Mott insulators, a comprehensive topological characterization is still lacking. When their ground state only contains short range entanglement and does not break symmetries spontaneously, they generically realize crystalline symmetry protected topological phases (cFSPTs), supporting gapless modes at the boundaries or at the lattice defects. Here, we provide an exhaustive classification of cFSPTs in two-dimensions (2D) with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge-conservation and spinful time-reversal symmetries, namely those generically are present in spin-orbit coupled insulators, for any of the 17 wallpaper groups. It has been shown that the classification of cFSPTs can be understood from appropriate real-space decorations of lower-dimensional subspaces, and we expose how these relate to the Wyckoff positions of the lattice. We find that all nontrivial one-dimensional decorations require electronic interactions. Furthermore, we provide model Hamiltonians for various decorations, and discuss the signatures of cFSPTs. This classification paves the way to further explore topological interacting insulators, providing the backbone information in generic model systems and ultimately in experiments.</description>

Abstract: Twist between neighboring layers and variation of interlayer distance are two extra ways to control the physical properties of stacked two-dimensional van der Waals materials without alteration of chemical compositions or application of external fields, compared to their monolayer counterparts. In this work, we explored the dependence of the magnetic states of the untwisted and twisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ (X = S, Se) on the interlayer distance by density functional theory calculations. We find that, while a magnetic phase transition occurs from interlayer ferromagnetism to interlayer antiferromagnetism either as a function of decreasing interlayer distance for the untwisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ or after twist, richer magnetic phase transitions consecutively take place for the twisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ as interlayer distance is gradually reduced. Besides, the critical pressures for the phase transition are greatly reduced in twisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ compared with the untwisted case. We derived the Heisenberg model with intralayer and interlayer exchange couplings to comprehend the emergence of various magnetic states. Our results point out an easy access towards tunable two-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of honeycomb lattice model by high-order moir\'e pattern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices have become an emergent solid-state platform for simulating quantum lattice models. However, in single moir\'e device, Hamiltonians parameters like lattice constant, hopping and interaction terms can hardly be manipulated, limiting the controllability and accessibility of moire quantum simulator. Here, by combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that high-order moir\'e patterns in graphene-monolayered xenon/krypton heterostructures can simulate honeycomb model in mesoscale, with in-situ tunable Hamiltonians parameters. The length scale of simulated lattice constant can be tuned by annealing processes, which in-situ adjusts intervalley interaction and hopping parameters in the simulated honeycomb lattice. The sign of the lattice constant can be switched by choosing xenon or krypton monolayer deposited on graphene, which controls sublattice degree of freedom and valley arrangment of Dirac fermions. Our work establishes a novel path for experimentally simulating the honeycomb model with tunable parameters by high-order moir\'e patterns.</description>

      <title>Green and Solid State Reduction of GO Monolayers Sandwiched between Arachidic Acid LB Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel, single step and environment friendly solid state approach for reduction of graphene oxide (GO) monolayers has been demonstrated, in which, arachidic acid-GO-arachidic acid (AA-GO-AA) sandwich structure obtained by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique was heat treated at moderate temperatures to obtain RGO sheets. Heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure at 200 C results in substantial reduction of GO, with concurrent removal of AA molecules. Such developed RGO sheets possess sp2-C content of 69%, O/C ratio of 0.17 and significantly reduced I(D) and I(G) ratio of ~1.1. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies on RGO sheets evidenced significant increase in density of states in immediate vicinity of Fermi level and decrease in work function after reduction. Bottom gated field effect transistors fabricated with isolated RGO sheets displayed charge neutrality point at a positive gate voltage, indicating p-type nature, consistent with UPS and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) measurement results.The RGO sheets obtained by heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure exhibited conductivity in the range of 2-7Scm-1 and field effect mobility of 0.03-2cm2V-1s-1, which are consistent with values reported for RGO sheets obtained by various chemical or thermal reduction procedures.The extent of GO reduction is determined primarily by proximity of AA molecules and found to be unaltered with either escalation of heat treatment temperature or increase of AA content in sandwich structure. The single-step GO reduction approach demonstrated in this work is an effective way for development of RGO monolayers with high structural quality towards graphene-based electronic device applications.</description>

Abstract: A recently developed approach to the thermodynamics of open quantum systems, on the basis of the principle of minimal dissipation, is applied to the spin-boson model. Employing a numerically exact quantum dynamical treatment based on the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we investigate the influence of the environment on quantities such as work, heat and entropy production in a range of parameters which go beyond the weak-coupling limit and include both the non-adiabatic and the adiabatic regimes. The results reveal significant differences to the weak-coupling forms of work, heat and entropy production, which are analyzed in some detail.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle cooling algorithms for quantum many-body state preparation</title>

Abstract: Probing correlated states of many-body systems is one of the central tasks for quantum simulators and processors. A promising approach to state preparation is to realize desired correlated states as steady states of engineered dissipative evolution. A recent experiment with a Google superconducting quantum processor [X. Mi et al., Science 383, 1332 (2024)] demonstrated a cooling algorithm utilizing auxiliary degrees of freedom that are periodically reset to remove quasiparticles from the system, thereby driving it towards the ground state. We develop a kinetic theory framework to describe quasiparticle cooling dynamics, and employ it to compare the efficiency of different cooling algorithms. In particular, we introduce a protocol where coupling to auxiliaries is modulated in time to minimize heating processes, and demonstrate that it allows a high-fidelity preparation of ground states in different quantum phases. We verify the validity of the kinetic theory description by an extensive comparison with numerical simulations of a 1d transverse-field Ising model using a solvable model and tensor-network techniques. Further, the effect of noise, which limits efficiency of variational quantum algorithms in near-term quantum processors, can be naturally described within the kinetic theory. We investigate the steady state quasiparticle population as a function of noise strength, and establish maximum noise values for achieving high-fidelity ground states. This work establishes quasiparticle cooling algorithms as a practical, robust method for many-body state preparation on near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and conservation of spin angular momentum, helicity, and chirality in photonic time-varying media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization-dependent dynamical properties of light as the spin angular momentum (SAM), helicity, and chirality are conserved quantities in free-space. Despite their similarities on account of their relationship with a circular state of polarization, SAM, helicity, and chirality emerge from distinct symmetries, which endows them with different physical meanings, properties, and practical applications. In this work, we investigate the behavior of such quantities in time-varying media (TVM), i.e., how a temporal modulation impacts their symmetries and conservation laws. Our results demonstrate that the SAM is conserved for any time modulation, helicity is only preserved in impedance-matched time modulations, while chirality is not conserved. In addition, the continuity equations highlight the dependence of the chirality with the energy content of the fields. These results provide additional insights into the similarities and differences between SAM, helicity, and chirality, as well as their physical meaning. Furthermore, our theoretical framework provides with a new perspective to analyze polarization-dependent light-matter interactions in TVM.</description>

Abstract: We show that how to generate propagation of spin degree in spin-symmetric exciton-polariton condensates in a semiconductor microcavity. Due to the stimulated spin-dependent scattering between hot excitons and condensates, exciton polaritons form a circular polarized condensate with spontaneous breaking of the spin rotation symmetry. The spin antiferromagnetic state is developed evidently from the density and spin flow pumped by localized laser source. The low energy spin current is identified where the steady state is characterized by the oscillating spin pattern. Finally, we predict via simulation how to dynamical generation of phase slip where ring-shape phase jump shows the behavior of splitting and joining together.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.05493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving small error for qubit gate operations under random telegraph noise (RTN) is of great interest for potential applications in quantum computing and quantum error correction. I calculate the error generated in the qubit driven by $\pi$, CORPSE, SCORPSE, symmetric and asymmetric pulses in presence of RTN. For a special case when pulse acts in x-direction and RTN in z-direction, I find that for small value of noise correlation time, $\pi$-pulse has small error among all the other pulses. For large value of noise correlation time, possibly white noise, symmetric pulse generates small error for small energy amplitudes of noise strength, whereas CORPSE pulse has small error for large energy amplitudes of noise strength. For the pulses acting in all the three directions, several pulse sequences were identified that generate small error in presence of small and large strength of energy amplitudes of RTN. More precisely, when $\pi$ pulse acts in x direction, CORPSE pulse acts in y direction and SCORPSE pulse acts in z-direction then such pulse sequences induces small error and may consider for better candidate in implementing of bit-flip quantum error correction. Error analysis of small energy amplitudes of RTN may be useful for low temperature measurements, whereas error analysis of large energy amplitudes of RTN may be useful for room temperature measurements of quantum error correction codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), originating from the relativistic corrections in the Dirac equation, offer nonlinearity in the classical limit and are capable of driving chaotic dynamics. In a nanoscale quantum dot confined by a two-dimensional parabolic potential with SOCs, various quantum scar states emerge quasi-periodically in the eigenstates of the system, when the ratio of confinement energies in the two directions is nearly commensurable. The scars, displaying both quantum interference and classical trajectory features on the electron density, due to relativistic effects, serve as a bridge between the classical and quantum behaviors of the system. When the strengths of Rashba and Dresselhaus SOCs are identical, the chaos in the classical limit is eliminated as the classical Hamilton's equations become linear, leading to the disappearance of all quantum scar states. Importantly, the quantum scars induced by SOCs are robust against small perturbations of system parameters. With precise control achievable through external gating, the quantum scar induced by Rashba SOC is fully controllable and detectable.</description>

Abstract: Spin waves are collective perturbations in the orientation of the magnetic moments in magnetically ordered materials. Their rich phenomenology is intrinsically three-dimensional; however, the three-dimensional imaging of spin waves has so far not been possible. Here, we image the three-dimensional dynamics of spin waves excited in a synthetic antiferromagnet, with nanoscale spatial resolution and sub-ns temporal resolution, using time-resolved magnetic laminography. In this way, we map the distribution of the spin-wave modes throughout the volume of the structure, revealing unexpected depth-dependent profiles originating from the interlayer dipolar interaction. We experimentally demonstrate the existence of complex three-dimensional interference patterns and analyze them via micromagnetic modelling. We find that these patterns are generated by the superposition of spin waves with non-uniform amplitude profiles, and that their features can be controlled by tuning the composition and structure of the magnetic system. Our results open unforeseen possibilities for the study and manipulation of complex spin-wave modes within nanostructures and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>A Non-Hermitian Moir\'{e} Valley Filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A valley filter capable of generating a valley-polarized current is a crucial element in valleytronics, yet its implementation remains challenging. Here, we propose a valley filter made of a graphene bilayer which exhibits a 1D moir\'{e} pattern in the overlapping region of the two layers controlled by heterostrain. In the presence of a lattice modulation between layers, electrons propagating in one layer can have valley-dependent dissipation due to valley asymmetric interlayer coupling, thus giving rise to a valley-polarized current. Such a process can be described by an effective non-Hermitian theory, in which the valley filter is driven by a valley-resolved non-Hermitian skin effect. Nearly 100\% valley-polarization can be achieved within a wide parameter range and the functionality of the valley filter is electrically tunable. The non-Hermitian topological scenario of the valley filter ensures high tolerance against imperfections such as disorder and edge defects. Our work opens a new route for efficient and robust valley filters while significantly relaxing the stringent implementation requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the energy spectrum of a single and two electron quantum dot (QD) embedded in two dimensional electron gas at the interface between SrTiO$_3$ and LaAlO$_3$, in the presence of the external magnetic field. For this purpose the three band model of $3d$-electrons defined on the square lattice of Ti ions was utilized. We demonstrate that, for the weak parabolic confinement potential, the low energy spectrum is sufficiently well described by the effective Hamiltonian reduced to the one $d_{xy}$ orbital with the spin-orbit interaction originating from the coupling to the $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$ bands. This is not the case for stronger confinement where contribution of the states related to the $d_{xz/yz}$ orbital is relevant. Based on the time depended calculations we discuss in details the manipulation of the electron spin in QD by external AC voltages, in the context of the electric dipole spin resonance. The allowed and forbidden transitions are discussed in details with respect to the parity selection rule. Our calculations show that for a single electron QD the spin-flip in the ground-state has a character of a Rabi resonance while for two electrons the singlet-triplet transition is forbidden by the parity symmetry. For the two electrons QD, we demonstrate that the spin-flip transition can still be accomplished via a second-order, two-photon process that has a two-state Rabi character for low AC field amplitude. The violation of the parity symmetry on the spin-flip transitions is also analyzed.</description>

Abstract: The time evolution of a wave packet is a tool to detect topological phase transitions in two-dimensional Dirac materials, such as graphene and silicene. Here we extend the analysis to HgTe/CdTe quantum wells and study the evolution of their electron current wave packet, using 2D effective Dirac Hamiltonians and different layer thicknesses. We show that the two different periodicities that appear in this temporal evolution reach a minimum near the critical thickness, where the system goes from normal to inverted regime. Moreover, the maximum of the electron current amplitude changes with the layer thickness, identifying that current maxima reach their higher value at the critical thickness. Thus, we can characterize the topological phase transitions in terms of the periodicity and amplitude of the electron currents.</description>

Abstract: The sublattice symmetry on a bipartite lattice is commonly regarded as the chiral symmetry in the AIII class of the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer classification. Here, we reveal the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry, and show that this assertion holds only if the periodicity of primitive unit cells agrees with that of the sublattice labeling. In cases where the periodicity does not agree, sublattice symmetry is represented as a glide reflection in energy-momentum space, which inverts energy and simultaneously translates some $k$ by $\pi$, leading to substantially different physics. Particularly, it introduces novel constraints on zero modes in semimetals and completely alters the classification table of topological insulators compared to class AIII. Notably, the dimensions corresponding to trivial and nontrivial classifications are switched, and the nontrivial classification becomes $\mathbb{Z}_2$ instead of $\mathbb{Z}$. We have applied these results to several models, including the Hofstadter model both with and without dimerization.</description>

Abstract: The supercurrent field effect is experimentally realized in various nano-scale devices, based on the superconductivity suppression by external electric fields being effective for confined systems. In spite of intense research, a microscopic theory and explanation of this effect is missing. Here, a microscopic theory of phonon-mediated superconductivity in thin films is presented, which accounts for the effect of quantum confinement on the electronic density of states, on the Fermi energy, and on the topology of allowed states in momentum space. By further accounting for the interplay between quantum confinement, the external static electric field, the Thomas-Fermi screening in the electron-phonon matrix element, and the effect of confinement on the Coulomb repulsion parameter, the theory predicts the critical value of the external electric field as a function of the film thickness, above which superconductivity is suppressed. In particular, this critical value of the electric field is the lower the thinner the film, in agreement with recent experimental observations. Crucially, this effect is predicted by the theory when both Thomas-Fermi screening and the Coulomb pseudopotential are taken into account, along with the respective dependence on thin film thickness. This microscopic theory of the supercurrent field-effect opens up new possibilities for electric-field gated quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: The surprising discovery of ultrafast demagnetization -- where electric field of femtosecond laser pulse couples to electrons of a ferromagnetic (FM) layer causing its magnetization vector {\em to shrink while not rotating}, is also assumed to be accompanied by generation of spin current in the direction orthogonal to electric field. However, understanding of the microscopic origin of such spin current and how efficiently it can be converted into charge current, as the putative source of THz radiation, is lacking despite nearly three decades of intense studies. Here we connect the standard pumping phenomena driven by microwave precession of magnetization vector replacing periodic time-dependence of magnetization precession with nonperiodic time-dependence of demagnetization, as obtained from experiments on ultrafast-light-driven Ni layer. Applying time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions, able to evolve such setup with arbitrary time dependence, reveals how demagnetization dynamics pumps both charge and spin currents in directions both parallel and orthogonal to electric field of laser pulse, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and thereby induced spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms. Although pumped currents follow $dM_z/dt$ in some setups, this becomes obscured when NM layers are disconnected and pumped currents start to reflect from FM boundaries (as is the case of experimental setups). Finally, we use the Jefimenko equations to compute electromagnetic radiation by charge current pumped in disconnected setup during demagnetization, or later during its slow recovery, unraveling that radiated electric field only in the former time interval exhibits features in 0.1--30 THz frequency range probed experimentally or explored for applications of spintronic THz emitters.</description>
