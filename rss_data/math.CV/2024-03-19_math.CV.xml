      <title>Commutant of sum of two quasihomogeneous Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major open question in the theory of Toeplitz operator on the Bergman space of the unit disk of the complex plane is to fully characterize the set of all Toeplitz operators that commute with a given one. In [2], the second author described the sum $S = T_{e^{im\theta}f} +T_{e^{il\theta}g}$, where $f$ and $g$ are radial functions, that commutes with the sum $T = T_{e^{ip\theta}r(2M+1)p} +T_{e^{is\theta}r(2N+1)s}$ . It is proved that $S = cT$, where $c$ is a constant. In this article, we shall replace $r^{(2M+1)p}$ and $r^{(2N+1)s}$ by $r^n$ and $r^d$ respectively, with $n$ and $d$ in $\mathbb{N}$, and we shall show that the same result holds.</description>

      <title>On the boundary behavior of unclosed mappings with the inverse Poletsky inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manuscript is devoted to the boundary behavior of mappings with bounded and finite distortion, which has been actively studied recently. We consider mappings of domains of the Euclidean space that satisfy the inverse Poletsky inequality with an integrable majorant, are open, and discrete. Assume that the image of the boundary of the original domain is finitely connected relative to the mapped domain, and the preimage of the boundary of the latter is nowhere a dense set. Then, under certain conditions on the geometry of these domains, it is proved that the specified mappings have a continuous boundary extension. The result is valid even in a more general form, when the majorant in the inverse Poletsky inequality is integrable over almost all concentric spheres centered at each point. In particular, the obtained results are valid for homeomorphisms as well as for open discrete closed mappings with the appropriate modulus condition.</description>

      <title>Isometries in the diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the (anti)holomorphicity of smooth Kobayashi isometries of the diamond, the domain defined as $\triangle:=\{z\in\mathbb C^2:|z_1|+|z_2|&lt;1\}$. Additionally, we discuss the problem of uniqueness of real geodesics, left inverses and strict convexity of indicatrices.</description>

      <title>Rate distortion dimension of random Brody curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to propose an ergodic theoretic approach to the study of entire holomorphic curves. Brody curves are one-Lipschitz holomorphic maps from the complex plane to the complex projective space. They naturally form a dynamical system, and "random Brody curves" in the title refers to invariant probability measures on it. We study their geometric and dynamical properties. Given an invariant probability measure $\mu$ on the space of Brody curves, our first main theorem claims that its rate distortion dimension is bounded by the integral of a "potential function" over $\mu$. This result is analogous to the Ruelle inequality of smooth ergodic theory. Our second main theorem claims that there exists a rich variety of invariant probability measures attaining equality in this "Ruelle inequality for Brody curves". The main tools of the proofs are the deformation theory of Brody curves and the variational principle for mean dimension with potential. This approach is motivated by the theory of thermodynamic formalism for Axiom A diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>On universality of general Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we establish sufficient conditions for a Dirichlet series induced by general frequencies to be universal with respect to vertical translations. Our results can be applied to known universal objects such as Hurwitz zeta functions and also can provide new examples of universal Dirichlet series including the alternating prime zeta function $\sum_{n\geq1}(-1)^np_n^{-s}$.</description>

      <title>Principles of Locally Conformally Kahler Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07188v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An LCK (locally conformally Kahler) manifold is a complex manifold admitting a Kahler covering with monodromy acting by homotheties. Hopf manifolds and their submanifolds are the prime examples. This book presents an introduction to the principles of LCK geometry (the first two parts) and its current situation (the last part). It is supposed to be accessible to master and graduate students of complex geometry. The book contains many exercises of different levels of difficulty. We finish it by a list of open questions.</description>
