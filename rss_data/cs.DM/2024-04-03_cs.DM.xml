      <title>Automated Inference of Graph Transformation Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosion of data available in life sciences is fueling an increasing demand for expressive models and computational methods. Graph transformation is a model for dynamic systems with a large variety of applications. We introduce a novel method of the graph transformation model construction, combining generative and dynamical viewpoints to give a fully automated data-driven model inference method.
  The method takes the input dynamical properties, given as a "snapshot" of the dynamics encoded by explicit transitions, and constructs a compatible model. The obtained model is guaranteed to be minimal, thus framing the approach as model compression (from a set of transitions into a set of rules). The compression is permissive to a lossy case, where the constructed model is allowed to exhibit behavior outside of the input transitions, thus suggesting a completion of the input dynamics.
  The task of graph transformation model inference is naturally highly challenging due to the combinatorics involved. We tackle the exponential explosion by proposing a heuristically minimal translation of the task into a well-established problem, set cover, for which highly optimized solutions exist. We further showcase how our results relate to Kolmogorov complexity expressed in terms of graph transformation.</description>

      <title>The Identity Problem in virtually solvable matrix groups over algebraic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tits alternative states that a finitely generated matrix group either contains a nonabelian free subgroup $F_2$, or it is virtually solvable. This paper considers two decision problems in virtually solvable matrix groups: the Identity Problem (does a given finitely generated subsemigroup contain the identity matrix?), and the Group Problem (is a given finitely generated subsemigroup a group?). We show that both problems are decidable in virtually solvable matrix groups over the field of algebraic numbers $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. Our proof also extends the decidability result for nilpotent groups by Bodart, Ciobanu, Metcalfe and Shaffrir, and the decidability result for metabelian groups by Dong (STOC'24). Since the Identity Problem and the Group Problem are known to be undecidable in matrix groups containing $F_2 \times F_2$, our result significantly reduces the decidability gap for both decision problems.</description>

      <title>Generalized saturation game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the following game version of the generalized graph Tur\'an problem. For two fixed graphs F and H, two players, Max and Mini, alternately claim unclaimed edges of the complete graph Kn such that the graph G of the claimed edges must remain F-free throughout the game. The game ends when no further edges can be claimed, i.e. when G becomes F-saturated. The H-score of the game is the number of copies of H in G. Max aims to maximize the H-score, while Mini wants to minimize it. The H-score of the game when both players play optimally is denoted by s1(n, #H, F) when Max starts, and by s2(n, #H, F) when Mini starts. We study these values for several natural choices of F and H.</description>

      <title>Grid-drawings of graphs in three-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using probabilistic methods, we obtain grid-drawings of graphs without crossings with low volume and small aspect ratio. We show that every $D$-degenerate graph on $n$ vertices can be drawn in $[m]^3$ where $m = O(D^{5/3} n^{1/3}\log^{4/3}n)$. In particular, every graph of bounded maximum degree can be drawn in a grid with volume $O(n \log^{4}n)$.</description>

      <title>Degree Sequence Optimization and Extremal Degree Enumerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree sequence optimization problem is to find a subgraph of a given graph which maximizes the sum of given functions evaluated at the subgraph degrees. Here we study this problem by replacing degree sequences, via suitable nonlinear transformations, by suitable degree enumerators, and we introduce suitable degree enumerator polytopes.
  We characterize their vertices, that is, the extremal degree enumerators, for complete graphs and some complete bipartite graphs, and use these characterizations to obtain simpler and faster algorithms for optimization over degree sequences for such graphs.</description>

      <title>Elimination distance to bounded degree on planar graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.02413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the graph parameter elimination distance to bounded degree, which was introduced by Bulian and Dawar in their study of the parameterized complexity of the graph isomorphism problem. We prove that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable on planar graphs, that is, there exists an algorithm that given a planar graph $G$ and integers $d$ and $k$ decides in time $f(k,d)\cdot n^c$ for a computable function~$f$ and constant $c$ whether the elimination distance of $G$ to the class of degree $d$ graphs is at most $k$.</description>

      <title>On Linear Representation, Complexity and Inversion of maps over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.14601v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper defines a linear representation for nonlinear maps $F:\mathbb{F}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{F}^n$ where $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite field, in terms of matrices over $\mathbb{F}$. This linear representation of the map $F$ associates a unique number $N$ and a unique matrix $M$ in $\mathbb{F}^{N\times N}$, called the Linear Complexity and the Linear Representation of $F$ respectively, and shows that the compositional powers $F^{(k)}$ are represented by matrix powers $M^k$. It is shown that for a permutation map $F$ with representation $M$, the inverse map has the linear representation $M^{-1}$. This framework of representation is extended to a parameterized family of maps $F_{\lambda}(x): \mathbb{F} \to \mathbb{F}$, defined in terms of a parameter $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$, leading to the definition of an analogous linear complexity of the map $F_{\lambda}(x)$, and a parameter-dependent matrix representation $M_\lambda$ defined over the univariate polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}[\lambda]$. Such a representation leads to the construction of a parametric inverse of such maps where the condition for invertibility is expressed through the unimodularity of this matrix representation $M_\lambda$. Apart from computing the compositional inverses of permutation polynomials, this linear representation is also used to compute the cycle structures of the permutation map. Lastly, this representation is extended to a representation of the cyclic group generated by a permutation map $F$, and to the group generated by a finite number of permutation maps over $\mathbb{F}$.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithms for Vizing's theorem on bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05408v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vizing's theorem states that every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be properly edge-colored using $\Delta + 1$ colors. The fastest currently known $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring algorithm for general graphs is due to Sinnamon and runs in time $O(m\sqrt{n})$, where $n :=|V(G)|$ and $m :=|E(G)|$. We investigate the case when $\Delta$ is constant, i.e., $\Delta = O(1)$. In this regime, the runtime of Sinnamon's algorithm is $O(n^{3/2})$, which can be improved to $O(n \log n)$, as shown by Gabow, Nishizeki, Kariv, Leven, and Terada. Here we give an algorithm whose running time is only $O(n)$, which is obviously best possible. Prior to this work, no linear-time $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring algorithm was known for any $\Delta \geq 4$. Using some of the same ideas, we also develop new algorithms for $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring in the $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ model of distributed computation. Namely, when $\Delta$ is constant, we design a deterministic $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ algorithm with running time $\tilde{O}(\log^5 n)$ and a randomized $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ algorithm with running time $O(\log ^2 n)$. Although our focus is on the constant $\Delta$ regime, our results remain interesting for $\Delta$ up to $\log^{o(1)} n$, since the dependence of their running time on $\Delta$ is polynomial. The key new ingredient in our algorithms is a novel application of the entropy compression method.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Cluster Vertex Splitting and Company</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering a graph when the clusters can overlap can be seen from three different angles: We may look for cliques that cover the edges of the graph with bounded overlap, we may look to add or delete few edges to uncover the cluster structure, or we may split vertices to separate the clusters from each other. Splitting a vertex $v$ means to remove it and to add two new copies of $v$ and to make each previous neighbor of $v$ adjacent with at least one of the copies. In this work, we study underlying computational problems regarding the three angles to overlapping clusterings, in particular when the overlap is small. We show that the above-mentioned covering problem is NP-complete. We then make structural observations that show that the covering viewpoint and the vertex-splitting viewpoint are equivalent, yielding NP-hardness for the vertex-splitting problem. On the positive side, we show that splitting at most $k$ vertices to obtain a cluster graph has a problem kernel with $O(k)$ vertices. Finally, we observe that combining our hardness results with the so-called critical-clique lemma yields NP-hardness for Cluster Editing with Vertex Splitting, which was previously open (Abu-Khzam et al. [ISCO 2018]) and independently shown to be NP-hard by Arrighi et al. [IPEC 2023]. We observe that a previous version of the critical-clique lemma was flawed; a corrected version has appeared in the meantime on which our hardness result is based.</description>
