      <title>Obstructions to almost complex structures following Massey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide proofs of two theorems stated by Massey in 1961, concerning the obstructions to finding complex structures on real vector bundles. In addition, we determine the second obstruction to a complex structure on a rank six orientable real vector bundle. The obstructions are fractional parts of integral Stiefel-Whitney classes, and a fourth of an appropriate combination of Pontryagin, Chern, and Euler classes.</description>

      <title>Weak Universality in Random Persistent Homology and Scale-Invariant Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a universality result for the limiting distribution of persistence diagrams arising from geometric filtrations over random point processes. Specifically, we consider the distribution of the ratio of persistence values (death/birth), and show that for fixed dimension, homological degree and filtration type (Cech or Vietoris-Rips), the limiting distribution is independent of the underlying point process distribution, i.e., universal. In proving this result, we present a novel general framework for proving universality for scale-invariant functionals on point processes. Finally, we also provide a number of new results related to Morse theory in random geometric complexes, which may be of an independent interest.</description>

      <title>Splitting of abelian varieties in motivic stable homotopy category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the motivic stable homotopy type of abelian varieties. For an abelian variety over a field $k$ with a rational point, it always splits off a top-dimensional cell in motivic stable homotopy category $\text{SH}(k)$. Let $k = \mathbb{R}$, there is a concrete splitting which is determined by the motive of X and the real points $X(\mathbb{R})$ in $\text{SH}(\mathbb{R})_\mathbb{Q}$. We will also discuss this splitting from a viewpoint of the Chow-Witt correspondences.</description>

      <title>Hilbert series for contractads and modular compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contractads are operadic-type algebraic structures well-suited for describing configuration spaces indexed by a simple connected graph $\Gamma$. Specifically, these configuration spaces are defined as $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X):=X^{|V(\Gamma)|}\setminus \cup_{(ij)\in E(\Gamma)} {x_i=x_j}$. In this paper, we explore functional equations for the Hilbert series of Koszul dual contractads and provide explicit Hilbert series for fundamental contractads such as the commutative, Lie, associative and the little discs contractads.
  Additionally, we focus on a particular contractad derived from the wonderful compactifications of $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{k})$, for $\mathbb{k}=\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}$. First, we demonstrate that for complete multipartite graphs, the associated wonderful compactifications coincide with the modular compactifications introduced by Smyth. Second, we establish that the homology of the complex points and the homology of the real locus of the wonderful contractad are both quadratic and Koszul contractads. We offer a detailed description of generators and relations, extending the concepts of the Hypercommutative operad and cacti operads, respectively.
  Furthermore, using the functional equations for the Hilbert series, we describe the corresponding Hilbert series for the homology of modular compactifications.
  We hope this work will highlight the concept of contractads and their applications in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.12490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify in terms of Hopf-type properties mapping tori of residually finite Poincar\'e Duality groups with non-zero Euler characteristic. This generalises and gives a new proof of the analogous classification for fibered 3-manifolds. Various applications are given. In particular, we deduce that rigidity results for Gromov hyperbolic groups hold for the above mapping tori with trivial center.</description>

      <title>Discrete Microlocal Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish several results combining discrete Morse theory and microlocal sheaf theory in the setting of finite posets and simplicial complexes. Our primary tool is a computationally tractable description of the bounded derived category of sheaves on a poset with the Alexandrov topology. We prove that each bounded complex of sheaves on a finite poset admits a unique (up to isomorphism of complexes) minimal injective resolution, and we provide algorithms for computing minimal injective resolution of an injective complex, as well as several useful functors between derived categories of sheaves. For the constant sheaf on a simplicial complex, we give asymptotically tight bounds on the complexity of computing the minimal injective resolution using those algorithms. Our main result is a novel definition of the discrete microsupport of a bounded complex of sheaves on a finite poset. We detail several foundational properties of the discrete microsupport, as well as a microlocal generalization of the discrete homological Morse theorem and Morse inequalities.</description>

      <title>Homology of matching complexes and representations of symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the homology of the matching complex $M(\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is the complete hypergraph on $n\geq 2$ vertices, and analyse the $S_n$-representations carried by this homology. These results are achieved using standard techniques in combinatorial topology, such as the theory of shellings. We then broaden the scope to the larger class of fibre-closed families of simplicial complexes and consider these through the lens of representation stability. This allows us to prove a number of results of an asymptotic nature, such as an analysis of the growth of Betti numbers and the kinds of irreducible $S_n$-representations that appear.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Singular Patterns from a Vector Field via Persistent Path Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extraction of singular patterns is a fundamental problem in theoretical and practical domains due to the ability of such patterns to detect the intrinsic characteristics of vector fields. In this study, we propose an approach for extracting singular patterns from discrete planar vector fields. Our method involves converting the planar discrete vector field into a specialized digraph and computing its one-dimensional persistent path homology. By analyzing the persistence diagram, we can determine the location of singularity and segment a region of the singular pattern, which is referred to as a singular polygon. Moreover, the variations of singular patterns can also be analyzed. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in analyzing the centers and impact areas of tropical cyclones, positioning the dip poles from geomagnetic fields, and measuring variations of singular patterns between vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study relations between Chern classes and Galois cohomology classes in the Gal(C/R)-equivariant cohomology of real algebraic varieties with no real points. We give applications to the topology of their sets of complex points, and to sums of squares problems. In particular, we show that -1 is a sum of 2 squares in the function field of any smooth projective real algebraic surface with no real points and with vanishing geometric genus, as well as higher-dimensional generalizations of this result.</description>

      <title>A T-Duality of Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic Strings and an implication for Topological Modular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments connecting non-supersymmetric heterotic string theory to the theory of Topological Modular Forms (TMF), we show that the worldsheet theory with central charge $(17,\frac{3}{2})$ obtained by fibering the $(E_8)_1 \times (E_8)_1$ current algebra over the $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ sigma model on $S^{1}$ with antiperiodic spin structure (such that the two $E_8$ factors are exchanged as we go around the circle), is continuously connected to the $(E_8)_2$ theory in the Gaiotto$-$Johnson-Freyd$-$Witten sense of going "up and down the RG trajectories". Combined with the work of Tachikawa and Yamashita, this furnishes a physical derivation of the fact that the $(E_8)_2$ theory corresponds to the unique nontrivial torsion element $[(E_8)_2]$ of $\mathsf{TMF}^{31}$ with zero mod-2 elliptic genus.</description>

      <title>The Macias topology on integral domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript a recent topology on the positive integers generated by the collection of $\{\sigma_n:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ where $\sigma_n:=\{m: \gcd(n,m)=1\}$ is generalized over integral domains. Some of its topological properties are studied. Properties of this topology on infinite principal ideal domains that are not fields are also explored, and a new topological proof of the infinitude of prime elements is obtained (assuming the set of units is finite or not open), different from those presented in the style of H. Furstenberg. Finally, some problems are proposed.</description>
