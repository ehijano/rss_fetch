      <title>Look into your Heart - Prototypes for a Speculative Design Exploration of Personal Heart Rate Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personal heart rate data from wearable devices contains rich information, yet current visualizations primarily focus on simple metrics, leaving complex temporal patterns largely unexplored. We present a speculative exploration of personal heart rate visualization possibilities through five prototype approaches derived from established visualization literature: pattern/variability heatmaps, recurrence plots, spectrograms, T-SNE, and Poincar\'e plots. Using physiologically-informed synthetic datasets generated through large language models, we systematically explore how different visualization strategies might reveal distinct aspects of heart rate patterns across temporal scales and analytical complexity. We evaluate these prototypes using established visualization assessment scales from multiple literacy perspectives, then conduct reflective analysis on both the evaluation and the design of the prototypes. Our iterative process reveals recurring design tensions in visualizing complex physiological data. This work offers a speculative map of the personal heart rate visualization design space, providing insights into making heart rate data more visually accessible and meaningful.</description>

      <title>Accessibility, Safety, and Accommodation Burden in U.S. Higher Education Syllabi for Blind and Low-Vision Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Course syllabi are often the first and sometimes only structured artifact that explains how a class will run: deadlines, grading rules, safety procedures, and how to request disability accommodations. For blind and low-vision (BLV) students who use screen readers, independent access depends on whether the syllabus is machine readable and navigable. We audited publicly posted syllabi and master syllabi from five U.S. institutions spanning an elite private R1 university, large public R1s (including a UC campus), a large community college, and a workforce focused technical college. We coded each document on five dimensions: (1) machine-readability of core logistics, (2) readability of safety critical procedures, (3) accommodation framing (rights based vs. burden based), (4) governance model (instructor-authored vs. centralized "master syllabus"), and (5) presence of proactive universal design language. Across the sample, logistics and many safety expectations are published as selectable text. Accommodation language, however, shifts by institution type: research universities more often use rights based wording (while still requiring advance letters), whereas community/technical colleges emphasize disclosure, documentation, and institutional discretion in master syllabi that replicate across sections. We argue that accessibility is not only a PDF tagging problem but also a question of governance and equity, and we outline implications for HCI, including an "accessible master syllabus" template as a high leverage intervention.</description>

      <title>Designing and Evaluating Malinowski's Lens: An AI-Native Educational Game for Ethnographic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces 'Malinowski's Lens', the first AI-native educational game for anthropology that transforms Bronislaw Malinowski's 'Argonauts of the Western Pacific' (1922) into an interactive learning experience. The system combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation with DALL-E 3 text-to-image generation, creating consistent VGA-style visuals as players embody Malinowski during his Trobriand Islands fieldwork (1915-1918). To address ethical concerns, indigenous peoples appear as silhouettes while Malinowski is detailed, prompting reflection on anthropological representation. Two validation studies confirmed effectiveness: Study 1 with 10 non-specialists showed strong learning outcomes (average quiz score 7.5/10) and excellent usability (SUS: 83/100). Study 2 with 4 expert anthropologists confirmed pedagogical value, with one senior researcher discovering "new aspects" of Malinowski's work through gameplay. The findings demonstrate that AI-driven educational games can effectively convey complex anthropological concepts while sparking disciplinary curiosity. This study advances AI-native educational game design and provides a replicable model for transforming academic texts into engaging interactive experiences.</description>

      <title>Designing Mental-Health Chatbots for Indian Adolescents: Mixed-Methods Evidence, a Boundary-Object Lens, and a Design-Tensions Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental health challenges among Indian adolescents are shaped by unique cultural and systemic barriers, including high social stigma and limited professional support. We report a mixed-methods study of Indian adolescents (survey n=362; interviews n=14) examining how they navigate mental-health challenges and engage with digital tools. Quantitative results highlight low self-stigma but significant social stigma, a preference for text over voice interactions, and low utilization of mental health apps but high smartphone access. Our qualitative findings reveal that while adolescents value privacy, emotional support, and localized content in mental health tools, existing chatbots lack personalization and cultural relevance. We contribute (1) a Design-Tensions framework; (2) an artifact-level probe; and (3) a boundary-objects account that specifies how chatbots mediate adolescents, peers, families, and services. This work advances culturally sensitive chatbot design by centering on underrepresented populations, addressing critical gaps in accessibility and support for adolescents in India.</description>

      <title>TouchWalker: Real-Time Avatar Locomotion from Touchscreen Finger Walking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TouchWalker, a real-time system for controlling full-body avatar locomotion using finger-walking gestures on a touchscreen. The system comprises two main components: TouchWalker-MotionNet, a neural motion generator that synthesizes full-body avatar motion on a per-frame basis from temporally sparse two-finger input, and TouchWalker-UI, a compact touch interface that interprets user touch input to avatar-relative foot positions. Unlike prior systems that rely on symbolic gesture triggers or predefined motion sequences, TouchWalker uses its neural component to generate continuous, context-aware full-body motion on a per-frame basis-including airborne phases such as running, even without input during mid-air steps-enabling more expressive and immediate interaction. To ensure accurate alignment between finger contacts and avatar motion, it employs a MoE-GRU architecture with a dedicated foot-alignment loss. We evaluate TouchWalker in a user study comparing it to a virtual joystick baseline with predefined motion across diverse locomotion tasks. Results show that TouchWalker improves users' sense of embodiment, enjoyment, and immersion.</description>

      <title>Digital Nature Revisited: A Ten-Year Synthesis of Art, Technology, and the Evolution of "Nature": Reimagining Post-Truth Ecologies Through Art, Algorithm, and Animism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper critically re-examines "Digital Nature," a concept that has proliferated across various domains over the last ten years. By "Digital Nature," we refer to an evolving view of nature as a dynamic process of circulating computation and matter, one that extends into the realms of AI, XR, indigenous perspectives, and post-human theory. Despite its popularity, "Digital Nature" remains ambiguously defined. This paper provides a genealogical and philosophical survey of how the idea has emerged, diverged, and overlapped in media art, bio-art, and generative art, alongside relevant Eastern, Islamic, and indigenous worldviews. We then introduce a multi-axis framework (from real/virtual to anthropocentric/object-oriented, with sub-axes of enchantment and materialization), illustrating how digital technologies have reconceptualized the question "What is nature?" in unexpected ways. Finally, we discuss how the field might evolve, particularly through the lens of large language models, AGI, and "supernatural reality," while highlighting the ethical and political pitfalls of techno-occultism. Our ultimate goal is to re-situate "Digital Nature" as both an intellectual frontier and a collaborative platform that invites continuous dialogue between art, science, technology, and cultural philosophies.</description>

      <title>Private Chat in a Public Space of Metaverse Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies and the emergence of the Metaverse, social VR applications have become increasingly prevalent and accessible to the general user base. Serving as a novel form of social media, these platforms give users a unique opportunity to engage in social activities. However, there remains a significant limitation: the inability to engage in private conversations within public social VR environments. Current interactions are predominantly public, making it challenging for users to have confidential side discussions or whispers without disrupting ongoing conversations. To address this gap, we developed Hushhub, a private chat system integrated into the popular social VR platform VRChat. Our system enables users within a shared VR space to initiate private audio conversations selectively, allowing them to maintain awareness and engagement with the broader group discussions. To evaluate the system, we conducted user studies to gather insight and feedback on the efficacy and user experience of the implemented system. The results demonstrate the value and necessity of enabling private conversations within immersive social VR environments, paving the way for richer, more nuanced social interactions.</description>

      <title>GazeCopilot: Evaluating Novel Gaze-Informed Prompting for AI-Supported Code Comprehension and Readability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-powered coding assistants, like GitHub Copilot, are increasingly used to boost developers' productivity. However, their output quality hinges on the contextual richness of the prompts. Meanwhile, gaze behaviour carries rich cognitive information, providing insights into how developers process code. We leverage this in Real-time GazeCopilot, a novel approach that refines prompts using real-time gaze data to improve code comprehension and readability by integrating gaze metrics, like fixation patterns and pupil dilation, into prompts to adapt suggestions to developers' cognitive states. In a controlled lab study with 25 developers, we evaluated Real-time GazeCopilot against two baselines: Standard Copilot, which relies on text prompts provided by developers, and Pre-set GazeCopilot, which uses a hard-coded prompt that assumes developers' gaze metrics indicate they are struggling with all aspects of the code, allowing us to assess the impact of leveraging the developer's personal real-time gaze data. Our results show that prompts dynamically generated using developers' real-time gaze data significantly improve code comprehension accuracy, reduce comprehension time, and improve perceived readability compared to Standard Copilot. Our Real-time GazeCopilot approach selectively refactors only code aspects where gaze data indicate difficulty, outperforming the overgeneralized refactoring done by Pre-set GazeCopilot by avoiding revising code the developer already understands.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Electric Charge Variation Sensors for Camera-free Eye Tracking on Smart Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contactless Electrooculography (EOC) using electric charge variation (QVar) sensing has recently emerged as a promising eye-tracking technique for wearable devices. QVar enables low-power and unobtrusive interaction without requiring skin-contact electrodes. Previous work demonstrated that such systems can accurately classify eye movements using onboard TinyML under controlled laboratory conditions. However, the performance and robustness of contactless EOC in real-world scenarios, where environmental noise and user variability are significant, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a field evaluation of a previously proposed QVar-based eye-tracking system, assessing its limitations in everyday usage contexts across 29 users and 100 recordings in everyday scenarios such as working in front of a laptop. Our results show that classification accuracy varies between 57% and 89% depending on the user, with an average of 74.5%, and degrades significantly in the presence of nearby electronic noise sources. These results show that contactless EOC remains viable under realistic conditions, though subject variability and environmental factors can significantly affect classification accuracy. The findings inform the future development of wearable gaze interfaces for human-computer interaction and augmented reality, supporting the transition of this technology from prototype to practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main drawback of using generative AI for advanced mathematics via Large Language Models (LLMs) is that they are probabilistic pattern-matchers, not logical reasoning engines. However, LLMs can pick up on patterns in higher mathematics that are difficult for humans to see. By putting the design of LLMs to their advantage, mathematicians may use them as powerful interactive assistants that can carry out laborious tasks, generate and debug code, check examples, formulate conjectures and more. We discuss how LLMs can be used to advance mathematics research by careful use of prompt engineering. We also discuss the integration of LLMs with Computer Algebra Systems and formal proof assistants such as Lean.</description>

      <title>"I need to learn better searching tactics for privacy policy laws.'' Investigating Software Developers' Behavior When Using Sources on Privacy Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the introduction of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), software developers increasingly have to make privacy-related decisions during system design and implementation. However, past research showed that they often lack legal expertise and struggle with privacy-compliant development. To shed light on how effective current information sources are in supporting them with privacy-sensitive implementation, we conducted a qualitative study with 30 developers. Participants were presented with a privacy-sensitive scenario and asked to identify privacy issues and suggest measures using their knowledge, online resources, and an AI assistant. We observed developers' decision-making in think-aloud sessions and discussed it in follow-up interviews. We found that participants struggled with all three sources: personal knowledge was insufficient, web content was often too complex, and while AI assistants provided clear and user-tailored responses, they lacked contextual relevance and failed to identify scenario-specific issues. Our study highlights major shortcomings in existing support for privacy-related development tasks. Based on our findings, we discuss the need for more accessible, understandable, and actionable privacy resources for developers.</description>

      <title>Radar-APLANC: Unsupervised Radar-based Heartbeat Sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars can measure subtle chest wall oscillations to enable non-contact heartbeat sensing. However, traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods face performance degradation due to noise. Learning-based radar methods achieve better noise robustness but require costly labeled signals for supervised training. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals. We further design a pseudo-label augmentation approach featuring adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve pseudo-label signal quality. Extensive experiments on the Equipleth dataset and our collected radar dataset demonstrate that our unsupervised method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods. Our code, dataset, and supplementary materials can be accessed from https://github.com/RadarHRSensing/Radar-APLANC.</description>

      <title>PerspAct: Enhancing LLM Situated Collaboration Skills through Perspective Taking and Active Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models have significantly broadened their application in robotics and collaborative systems. However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of integrating active perception with perspective-taking mechanisms in advancing LLMs' application in robotics and multi-agent systems, setting a foundation for future research into adaptive and context-aware AI systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Educational LLMs with Analytics: A Case Study on Gender Bias in Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As teachers increasingly turn to GenAI in their educational practice, we need robust methods to benchmark large language models (LLMs) for pedagogical purposes. This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-Set Myoelectric Gesture Recognition via Dual-Perspective Inconsistency Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG)-based gesture recognition plays a critical role in human-machine interaction (HMI), particularly for rehabilitation and prosthetic control. However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples.</description>

      <title>Human Motion Intent Inferencing in Teleoperation Through a SINDy Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intent inferencing in teleoperation has been instrumental in aligning operator goals and coordinating actions with robotic partners. However, current intent inference methods often ignore subtle motion that can be strong indicators for a sudden change in intent. Specifically, we aim to tackle 1) if we can detect sudden jumps in operator trajectories, 2) how we appropriately use these sudden jump motions to infer an operator's goal state, and 3) how to incorporate these discontinuous and continuous dynamics to infer operator motion. Our framework, called Psychic, models these small indicative motions through a jump-drift-diffusion stochastic differential equation to cover discontinuous and continuous dynamics. Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients allow us to detect jumps with a trajectory which we pair with a statistical outlier detection algorithm to nominate goal transitions. Through identifying jumps, we can perform early detection of existing goals and discover undefined goals in unstructured scenarios. Our framework then applies a Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) model using KM coefficients with the goal transitions as a control input to infer an operator's motion behavior in unstructured scenarios. We demonstrate Psychic can produce probabilistic reachability sets and compare our strategy to a negative log-likelihood model fit. We perform a retrospective study on 600 operator trajectories in a hands-free teleoperation task to evaluate the efficacy of our opensource package, Psychic, in both offline and online learning.</description>

      <title>Interaction Dynamics as a Reward Signal for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversations typically relies on reward signals derived from the content of the text. This approach, however, overlooks a rich, complementary source of signal: the dynamics of the interaction itself. This paper introduces TRACE (Trajectory-based Reward for Agent Collaboration Estimation), a novel reward signal derived from the geometric properties of a dialogue's embedding trajectory--a concept we term 'conversational geometry'. Our central finding is that a reward model trained only on these structural signals achieves a pairwise accuracy (68.20%) comparable to a powerful LLM baseline that analyzes the full transcript (70.04%). Furthermore, a hybrid model combining interaction dynamics with textual analysis achieves the highest performance (80.17%), demonstrating their complementary nature. This work provides strong evidence that for interactive settings, how an agent communicates is as powerful a predictor of success as what it says, offering a new, privacy-preserving framework that not only aligns agents but also serves as a diagnostic tool for understanding the distinct interaction patterns that drive successful collaboration.</description>

      <title>Blockly2Hooks: Smart Contracts for Everyone with the XRP Ledger and Google Blockly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent technologies such as inter-ledger payments, non-fungible tokens, and smart contracts are all fruited from the ongoing development of Distributed Ledger Technologies. The foreseen trend is that they will play an increasingly visible role in daily life, which will have to be backed by appropriate operational resources. For example, due to increasing demand, smart contracts could soon face a shortage of knowledgeable users and tools to handle them in practice. Widespread smart contract adoption is currently limited by security, usability and costs aspects. Because of a steep learning curve, the handling of smart contracts is currently performed by specialised developers mainly, and most of the research effort is focusing on smart contract security, while other aspects like usability being somewhat neglected. Specific tools would lower the entry barrier, enabling interested non-experts to create smart contracts.
  In this paper we designed, developed and tested Blockly2Hooks, a solution towards filling this gap even in challenging scenarios such as when the smart contracts are written in an advanced language like C. With the XRP Ledger as a concrete working case, Blockly2Hooks helps interested non-experts from the community to learn smart contracts easily and adopt the technology, through leveraging well-proven teaching methodologies like Visual Programming Languages, and more specifically, the Blockly Visual Programming library from Google. The platform was developed and tested and the results are promising to make learning smart contract development smoother.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Conversational Bandit Approach to Online Evaluation and Selection of User-Aligned LLM Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt-based offline methods are commonly used to optimize large language model (LLM) responses, but evaluating these responses is computationally intensive and often fails to accommodate diverse response styles. This study introduces a novel online evaluation framework that employs a multi-agent conversational bandit model to select optimal responses while aligning with user preferences dynamically. To tackle challenges such as high-dimensional features, large response sets, adaptive conversational needs, and multi-device access, we propose MACO, Multi-Agent Conversational Online Learning, which comprises two key components: (1) \texttt{MACO-A}: Executed by local agents, it employs an online elimination mechanism to filter out low-quality responses. (2) \texttt{MACO-S}: Executed by the cloud server, it adaptively adjusts selection strategies based on aggregated preference data. An adaptive preference mechanism triggers asynchronous conversations to enhance alignment efficiency. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MACO achieves near-optimal regret bounds, matching state-of-the-art performance in various degenerate cases. Extensive experiments utilizing Google and OpenAI text embedding models on the real-world datasets with different response styles, combined with Llama and GPT-4o, show that MACO consistently outperforms baseline methods by at least 8.29\% across varying response set sizes and numbers of agents.</description>

      <title>UMind: A Unified Multitask Network for Zero-Shot M/EEG Visual Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding visual information from time-resolved brain recordings, such as EEG and MEG, plays a pivotal role in real-time brain-computer interfaces. However, existing approaches primarily focus on direct brain-image feature alignment and are limited to single-task frameworks or task-specific models. In this paper, we propose a Unified MultItask Network for zero-shot M/EEG visual Decoding (referred to UMind), including visual stimulus retrieval, classification, and reconstruction, where multiple tasks mutually enhance each other. Our method learns robust neural-visual and semantic representations through multimodal alignment with both image and text modalities. The integration of both coarse and fine-grained texts enhances the extraction of these neural representations, enabling more detailed semantic and visual decoding. These representations then serve as dual conditional inputs to a pre-trained diffusion model, guiding visual reconstruction from both visual and semantic perspectives. Extensive evaluations on MEG and EEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and biological plausibility of our approach in capturing spatiotemporal neural dynamics. Our approach sets a multitask pipeline for brain visual decoding, highlighting the synergy of semantic information in visual feature extraction.

      <title>A Survey on Human-Centered Evaluation of Explainable AI Methods in Clinical Decision Support Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is essential for the transparency and clinical adoption of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). However, the real-world effectiveness of existing XAI methods remains limited and is inconsistently evaluated. This study conducts a systematic PRISMA-guided survey of 31 human-centered evaluations (HCE) of XAI applied to CDSS, classifying them by XAI methodology, evaluation design, and adoption barrier. Our findings reveal that most existing studies employ post-hoc, model-agnostic approaches such as SHAP and Grad-CAM, typically assessed through small-scale clinician studies. The results show that over 80% of the studies adopt post-hoc, model-agnostic approaches such as SHAP and Grad-CAM, and that clinician sample sizes remain below 25 participants. The findings indicate that explanations generally improve clinician trust and diagnostic confidence, but frequently increase cognitive load and exhibit misalignment with domain reasoning processes. To bridge these gaps, we propose a stakeholder-centric evaluation framework that integrates socio-technical principles and human-computer interaction to guide the future development of clinically viable and trustworthy XAI-based CDSS.</description>

      <title>AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents -- virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZikangLeng/AgentSense.</description>

      <title>Question-to-Knowledge (Q2K): Multi-Agent Generation of Inspectable Facts for Product Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge (Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models for the Machine-Assisted Resolution of User Intentions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional, GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However, extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative. This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded intelligence.</description>

      <title>GUI-AIMA: Aligning Intrinsic Multimodal Attention with a Context Anchor for GUI Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a key function of computer-use agents, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable screen regions. Existing approaches based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically formulate it as a text-based coordinate generation task, yet directly generating precise coordinates from visual inputs remains challenging and computationally intensive. An intuitive way to implement GUI grounding is to first select visual patches relevant to the instructions and then determine the precise click location within those patches. Based on the observations that general MLLMs have some native grounding capability, nested within their attentions, we propose GUI-AIMA, an attention-based and coordinate-free supervised fine-tuning framework for efficient GUI grounding. GUI-AIMA aligns the intrinsic multimodal attention of MLLMs with patch-wise grounding signals. These signals are calculated adaptively for diverse user instructions by multi-head aggregation on simplified query-visual attention matrices. Besides, its coordinate-free manner can easily integrate a plug-and-play zoom-in stage. GUI-AIMA-3B was trained with only 85k screenshots, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and verifying that light training can trigger the native grounding capability of MLLMs. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among 3B models, attaining an average accuracy of 59.6% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 63.8% on OSWorld-G and 91.5% on ScreenSpot-v2.

      <title>An Artificial Intelligence-based Assistant for the Visually Impaired</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes an artificial intelligence-based assistant application, AIDEN, developed during 2023 and 2024, aimed at improving the quality of life for visually impaired individuals. Visually impaired individuals face challenges in identifying objects, reading text, and navigating unfamiliar environments, which can limit their independence and reduce their quality of life. Although solutions such as Braille, audio books, and screen readers exist, they may not be effective in all situations. This application leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to identify and describe objects, read text, and answer questions about the environment. Specifically, it uses You Only Look Once architectures and a Large Language and Vision Assistant. The system incorporates several methods to facilitate the user's interaction with the system and access to textual and visual information in an appropriate manner. AIDEN aims to enhance user autonomy and access to information, contributing to an improved perception of daily usability, as supported by user feedback.</description>
