      <title>A discrete view of Gromov's filling area conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compact metric surface $M$ isometrically fills a closed metric curve $C$ if $\partial M=C$ and $d_M(x,y)=d_C(x,y)$ for every $x,y\in C=\partial M$; that is, $M$ does not introduce any ``shortcuts'' between points on its boundary. Gromov's filling area conjecture in differential geometry from 1983 asserts that among all compact, orientable Riemannian surfaces which isometrically fill the Riemannian circle, the one with the smallest surface area is the hemisphere. Gromov demonstrated that this is indeed the case if $M$ is homeomorphic to the disk. While Gromov's conjecture has since been verified in some other cases, the full conjecture remains unresolved.
  In this paper, we consider a discrete analogue of Gromov's problem, which is likely natural to those who study graph embeddings on arbitrary surfaces. Using standard graph-theoretic tools, such as Menger's theorem, we obtain reasonable asymptotic bounds on this discrete variant. We then demonstrate how these discrete bounds can be translated to the continuous setting, showing that any isometric filling of the Riemannian circle of length $2\pi$ has surface area at least $1.36\pi$ (the hemisphere has surface area $2\pi$). This appears to be the first quantitative lower-bound on Gromov's problem that applies to arbitrary isometric fillings.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Lower Bound for the Spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian on K\"ahler Hyperbolic Manifolds and its Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a sharp lower bound for the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian on K\"ahler hyperbolic manifolds. This bound is expressed explicitly in terms of the supremum norm of the 1-form associated with the K\"ahler hyperbolic structure. As an application, we obtain explicit spectral lower bounds for bounded symmetric domains.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Killing tensors and first integrals of the magnetic flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a new family of symmetric tensors generalizing Killing tensors, that we call magnetic Killing symmetric tensors. We make use of them to construct first integrals for the magnetic flow associated to a given magnetic field. We apply the results to prove integrability of some invariant magnetic flows (either exact or non-exact) on some 2-step nilmanifolds: the Kodaira-Thurston manifold and Heisenberg nilmanifolds of higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Maxwell Strata in the sub-Riemannian problem on solvable, nonnilpotent regular three-dimensional Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the sub-Riemannian problem associated with contact structures on connected, simply connected, solvable, non-nilpotent, regular three-dimensional Lie groups. For these groups, the vertical component of the Hamiltonian system takes the form of a perturbed pendulum. A qualitative phase-space analysis allows us to prove that this vertical component exhibits nontrivial symmetries. In particular, we are able to fully characterize the Maxwell set corresponding to these symmetries, and show that its first Maxwell time coincides with the period of the pendulum for almost all geodesics. This result yields an explicit upper bound for the cut time in terms of the period of the pendulum.</description>

Abstract: Bernard [3] showed that a Ma\~n\'e generic convex Hamiltonian has only non-degenerate periodic orbits on a given energy level. We show that one can use this result to prove that for a generic potential the prime periodic orbits of fixed energy of a Lagrangian system of classical type on a compact manifold of dimension $n\ge 3$ do not have self-intersections and do not intersect each other.</description>

Abstract: We prove the local logarithmic Brunn-Minkowski inequality for bodies of revolution. Furthermore, we give a generalization for one origin symmetric body of revolution and one body of revolution that does not need to be symmetric. Equality cases are discussed. The proof uses an operator theoretic approach together with the decomposition of spherical functions into isotypical components with respect to rotations around a fixed axis.</description>

      <title>Overdetermined problems for the rotationally invariant Poisson equation in model manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present rigidity results for overdetermined problems associated to the rotationally invariant Poisson equation $-\Delta_{g_\mathcal{M}} u = f(r)$ in a model manifold $\mathcal{M} = [0,S) \times_h \mathbb S^{N-1}$ with warping function $h$. The variable $r$ ranges in the interval $[0,S)$, whose endpoint $S$ is positive and possibly infinite. The first part of the paper deals with the problem \[
  \begin{array}{ll}
  -\Delta_{g_\mathcal{M}} {u}=f(r) &amp;\mbox{in $\Omega$},
  u=\varphi(r) &amp;\mbox{on $\partial \Omega$},
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} = \kappa(r) &amp;\mbox{on $\partial \Omega$},
  \end{array} \] where $\Omega \subset \mathcal{M}$ is a bounded domain containing the point $O \in \mathcal{M}$ corresponding to $r = 0$, $\nu$ is the exterior unit normal vector on $\partial \Omega$, and $f$, $\varphi$, $\kappa$ are three prescribed functions.
  In the second part of the paper, we consider a similar overdetermined problem for the exterior Bernoulli problem in a domain $\Omega \setminus \overline B_{R_0}(O)$, where $B_{R_0}(O)$ denotes the geodesic ball centered at $O$ with radius $R_0$, within the class of functions that vanish on $\partial B_{R_0}(O)$. In both cases, we give conditions on $f$, $\varphi$ and $\kappa$ implying that the solution $u$ is radial and $\Omega$ is a geodesic ball centered at $O$. Our results apply in particular to the three space forms $\mathbb{R}^N$, $\mathbb{H}^N$ and $\mathbb{S}^N$.</description>

      <title>Quenched path limits and periodization stability for tilted Brownian motion in Poissonian potentials on $\mathbb{H}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the existence of Brownian motion tilted by a potential of full support on hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{H}^d$. On compact spaces, it is classical that these path limits, called Q-processes, exist and can be directly defined using the ground state of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. On non-compact spaces like $\mathbb{H}^d$, the existence fails in general.
  We show that for \emph{stationary random} potentials on $\mathbb{H}^d$ with suitable spectral and sup norm bounds, the Q-processes exist a.s. For potentials that are factors of a Poisson point process, the method works up to sup norm $(d-1)^2/8$. In this case, we also show that the path limit can be approximated by periodic potentials.
  As a tool, we use the foliated space defined by the point process. It turns out that the global ground state of this foliated space serves as a substitute for the non-existing $L^2$ ground states on the leaves of the foliation. Restricting the global ground state to a leaf gives a generalized eigenwave that can be plugged into the usual machinery to get the Q-process.</description>

      <title>Weyl metrizability of 3-dimensional projective structures and CR submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A projective structure is Weyl metrizable if it has a representative that preserves a conformal structure. We interpret Weyl metrizability of 3-dimensional projective structures as certain 5-dimensional nondegenerate CR submanifolds in a class of 7-dimensional 2-nondegenerate CR structures. As a corollary, it follows that in dimension three Beltrami's theorem extends to conformal structures, i.e. a locally flat projective structure is Weyl metrizable exclusively with respect to a locally flat conformal structure. In higher dimensions it is shown that conformal Beltrami theorem remains true as well.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Approach to Infinitesimal Conformal Rigidity on Complex Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09710v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every conformal vector field on the complex hyperbolic space $\mathbb{C}H^n$ is Killing for all $n\ge 2$. Although this rigidity is classically known, our proof is entirely different in nature: it is local, analytic, and fully constructive. Our approach is local, analytic, and constructive: we view $\mathbb{C}H^2$ through its solvable Lie group model and express the conformal Killing equation as an explicit system of partial differential equations. By solving this system completely, we show that any conformal vector field must be determined by a Killing field. The analysis in complex dimension $2$ naturally extends to arbitrary $n$, yielding a unified and fully explicit proof of this rigidity phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for the First Non-zero Basic Eigenvalue on a Singular Riemannian Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the lower bounds of the first non-zero basic eigenvalue on a closed singular Riemannian manifold $(M,\mathcal{F})$ with basic mean curvature that depends on the given non-negative lower bound of the Ricci curvature of $M$ and the diameter of the leaf space $M/\mathcal{F}$. These can be regarded as generalized versions of the Zhong-Yang estimate and a generalized Shi-Yang's estimate for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. We also provide a rigidity result corresponding to the generalized Zhong-Yang estimate, which is a generalized Hang-Wang rigidity for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. More precisely, when the first basic eigenvalue $\lambda_1^B$ is equal to $\frac{\pi^2}{d_{M/\mathcal{F}^2}} $, where $d_{M/\mathcal{F}}$ is the diameter of the leaf space, $M$ is isometric to a mapping torus of an isometry $\varphi:N\to N$ where $N$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature and $\mathcal{F}$ has the form $\{[\{\text{point}\}\times N]\}$.</description>

      <title>Extremal domains in $\mathbb{S}^2$: Geometric and Analytic methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{S}^2$ that support positive solutions of the overdetermined problem $$ \Delta u + f(u,|\nabla u|)=0 \quad \text{in } \Omega, $$ subject to the boundary conditions $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$ and $|\nabla u|$ being locally constant along $\partial\Omega$. We refer to such domains as $f$--extremal domains.
  In the first part of the paper, we extend the moving plane method in $\mathbb{S}^2$ and show that if an $f$--extremal domain $\Omega$ contains a simple curve of maximum points of $u$, then both $\Omega$ and $u$ are either rotationally symmetric or antipodally symmetric. Using the Alexandrov reflection method, we establish an analogous symmetry result for properly embedded constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces with capillary boundaries that contain a simple curve of minimum distance to the origin (a neck).
  In the second part, we strengthen these conclusions for specific nonlinearities, including the eigenvalue problem ($f(x)=\lambda x$), the Serrin problem ($f(x)=\lambda x + c$), harmonic domains ($f(x)=c$), and nonlinearities of the form $f(x)=\lambda x + x^\beta$, for constants $\lambda \geq 2$, $c \geq 0$, and $\beta \in (0,1)$. In these cases, we prove that the domain $\Omega$ must be rotationally symmetric.
  Throughout the paper, we restrict our attention to the analytic setting in order to simplify the exposition and highlight the main ideas.</description>

      <title>On the Bergman metric of symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bounded domains $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ whose Bergman metric is locally symmetric, i.e. its Riemannian curvature tensor is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection. Following the strategy developed in \cite{UnifThm2}, we obtain two rigidity results. If the Bergman metric of $\Omega$ is complete, then $\Omega$ is (globally) symmetric. If instead $\Omega$ is pseudoconvex, then $\Omega$ is biholomorphic to $\widetilde\Omega\setminus E$, where $\widetilde\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ is a bounded symmetric domain and $E\subset\widetilde\Omega$ is relatively closed and pluripolar. The proofs combine the structure theory of Hermitian symmetric spaces with Calabi's theory of K\"ahler immersions into the infinite dimensional complex projective space (in particular, rigidity and the hereditary property of the diastasis), together with analytic and pluripotential tools based on extension properties of square-integrable holomorphic functions and the Bergman kernel.</description>
