      <title>First-principles Investigation of Exceptional Coarsening-resistant V-Sc(Al2Cu)4 Nanoprecipitates in Al-Cu-Mg-Ag-Sc Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum-copper-magnesium-sliver (Al-Cu-Mg-Ag) alloys are extensively utilized in aerospace industries due to the formation of Omega nano-plates.However, the rapid coarsening of these nano-plates above 475 K restricts their application at elevated temperatures.When introducing scandium (Sc) to these alloys, the service temperature of the resultant alloys can reach an unprecedented 675 K, attributed to the in situ formation of a coarsening-resistant V-Sc(Al2Cu)4 phase within the Omega nano-plates. However, the fundamental thermodynamic properties and mechanisms behind the remarkable coarsening resistance of V nano-plates remain unexplored.Here, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the phase stability of V-Sc(Al2Cu)4 phase, the basic kinetic features of V phase formation within Omega nano-plates, and the origins of the extremely high thermal stability of V nano-plates. Our results indicate that V-Sc(Al2Cu)4 is meta-stable and thermodynamically tends to evolve into a stable ScAl7Cu5 phase. We also demonstrate that kinetic factors are mainly responsible for the temperature dependence of V phase formation. Notably, the formation of V-Sc(Al2Cu)4 within Omega nano-plates modifies the Kagome lattice in the shell layer of the Omega nano-plates, inhibiting further thickening of V nano-plates through the thickening pathway of Omega nano-plates. This interface transition leads to the exceptional coarsening resistance of the V nano-plates. Moreover, we also screened 14 promising element substitutions for Sc. These findings are anticipated to accelerate the development of high-performance Al alloys with superior heat resistance.</description>

      <title>Atomic layer etching of niobium nitride using sequential exposures of O$_2$ and H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium nitride (NbN) is a metallic superconductor that is widely used for superconducting electronics due to its high transition temperature ($T_c$) and kinetic inductance. Processing-induced damage negatively affects the performance of these devices by mechanisms such as microwave surface loss. Atomic layer etching (ALE), with its ability to etch with Angstrom-scale control and low damage, has the potential to address these issues, but no ALE process is known for NbN. Here, we report such a process consisting of sequential exposures of O$_2$ plasma and H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasma. Exposure to O$_2$ plasma rather than O$_2$ gas yields a greater fraction of Nb in the +5 oxidation state, which is then volatilized by NbF$_5$ formation with exposure to an H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasma. The SF$_6$:H$_2$ flow rate ratio is chosen to produce selective etching of Nb$_2$O$_5$ over NbN, enabling self-limiting etching within a cycle. An etch rate of 1.77 \r{A}/cycle was measured at 125 $^\circ$C using ex-situ ellipsometry. The $T_c$ of the ALE-etched film is higher than that of an RIE-etched film of a similar thickness, highlighting the low-damage nature of the process. These findings have relevance for applications of NbN in single-photon detectors and superconducting microresonators.</description>

      <title>Ductility mechanisms in complex concentrated refractory alloys from atomistic fracture simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The striking variation in damage tolerance among refractory complex concentrated alloys is examined through the analysis of atomistic fracture simulations, contrasting behavior in elemental Nb with that in brittle NbMoTaW and ductile Nb45Ta25Ti15Hf15. We employ machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), including a new MLIP developed for NbTaTiHf, in atomistic simulations of crack tip extension mechanisms based on analyses of atomistic fracture resistance curves. While the initial behavior of sharp cracks shows good correspondence with the Rice theory, fracture resistance curves reveal marked changes in fracture modes for the complex alloys as crack extension proceeds. In NbMoTaW, compositional complexity appears to promote dislocation nucleation relative to pure Nb, despite theoretical predictions that the alloy should be relatively more brittle. In Nb45Ta25Ti15Hf15, alloying not only changes the fracture mode relative to elemental Nb, but promotes dislocation accumulation at the crack tip, leading to higher resistance to crack propagation.</description>

      <title>Swirling topological textures of polarization in bulk relaxor ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete understanding of the mechanisms for dielectric relaxation in relaxor ferroelectrics remains elusive. We used a structural refinement framework that integrates several types of experimental data to identify the nanoscale correlations of polarization and their relationship to the underlying chemistry in the classic relaxor system PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3-PbTiO3. The polar structure in these materials in their bulk cubic state can be represented as overlapping anisotropic volumes, each encompassing unit cells with projections of their polarization vectors onto the volume's longest axis pointing in the same direction. The overlap results in swirling topological textures of polarization containing vortices, such as merons, and displaying smooth changes in the polarization directions. The locations of these vortices are linked to the electric charge gradient caused by compositional heterogeneities, deemed to create depolarizing fields.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-temperature ultrafast synthesis of wafer-scale single-crystalline graphene via metal-assisted graphitization of silicon-carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-conventional epitaxial techniques, such as vdWE and remote epitaxy, have attracted substantial attention in the semiconductor research community for their exceptional capability to continuously produce high-quality free-standing films. The successful implementation of these emerging epitaxial techniques crucially hinges on creating a robust uniform 2D material surface at the wafer-scale and with atomically precise uniformity. The conventional method for fabricating graphene on a SiC wafer is through high-temperature graphitization, which produces epitaxial graphene on the surface of the SiC wafer. However, the extremely high temperature needed for silicon sublimation (&gt; 1500 C) causes step-bunching of the SiC surface in addition to the growth of uneven graphene at the edges of the step, leading to multilayer graphene stripes and unfavorable surface morphology for epitaxial growth. Here, we fully develop a graphitization technique that allows fast synthesis of single-crystalline graphene at ultra-low temperatures (growth time of less than 1 min and growth temperature of less than 500 C) at wafer-scale by metal-assisted graphitization. We found annealing conditions that enable SiC dissociation while avoiding silicide formation, which produces single-crystalline graphene while maintaining atomically smooth surface morphology. The thickness of the graphene layer can be precisely controlled by varying the metal thickness or annealing temperature. We successfully produce freestanding single-crystalline ultra-wide bandgap (AlN, GaN) films on graphene/SiC via the 2D material-based layer transfer technique. Our results show that low-temperature graphene synthesis via MAG represents a promising route for the commercialization of the 2D-based epitaxy technique, enabling the production of large-scale ultra-wide bandgap free-standing crystalline membranes.</description>

      <title>Incongruent Melting and Phase Diagram of SiC from Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is an important technological material, but its high-temperature phase diagram has remained unclear due to conflicting experimental results about congruent versus incongruent melting. Here, we employ large-scale machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations to gain insights into SiC decomposition and phase transitions. Our approach relies on a Bayesian active learning workflow to efficiently train an accurate machine learning force field on density functional theory data. Our large-scale simulations provide direct evidence of the incongruent melting of SiC, confirming its decomposition into silicon-rich and carbon phases at high temperature and pressure. During cooling at high pressures, carbon nanoclusters nucleate and grow within the homogeneous molten liquid. During heating, the decomposed mixture reversibly transitions back into a homogeneous SiC liquid. The full pressure-temperature phase diagram of SiC is systematically constructed using MLMD simulations, providing new understanding of the nature of phases, resolving long-standing inconsistencies from previous experiments and yielding technologically relevant implications for processing and deposition of this material.</description>

      <title>Breathing ferroelectricity induced topological valley states in kagome niobium halide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, kagome lattices have garnered significant attention for their diverse properties in topology, magnetism, and electron correlations. However, the exploration of breathing kagome lattices, which exhibit dynamic breathing behavior, remains relatively scarce. Structural breathing introduces an additional degree of freedom that is anticipated to fine-tune the electronic structure, potentially leading to exotic properties within the system. In this study, we employ a combination of the kp model and first-principles calculations to explore how breathing ferroelectricity can modulate valley states within a monolayer of niobium halide with breathing kagome lattice. Through the interplay of magnetoelectric coupling and the lock-in between breathing and ferroelectric states, we demonstrate that a dynamically breathing process, when controlled by an appropriately applied electric field, can achieve valley polarization reversal and generate multiple valley states, including those that are topologically nontrivial. These state transformations may couple to distinctive properties in circularly-polarized optical responses and various valley Hall effects. Consequently, our results suggest that materials featuring breathing kagome lattices represent promising platforms for studying the interplay among structure, charge, spin, and valley degrees of freedom, a crucial step toward developing multifunctional devices.</description>

      <title>High-throughput computational screening of Heusler compounds with phonon considerations for enhanced material discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput (HTP) $ab$ $initio$ calculations are performed on 27,865 Heusler compositions, covering a broad range of regular, inverse, and half-Heusler compounds in both cubic and tetragonal phases. In addition to conventional stability metrics, such as formation energy, Hull distance, and magnetic critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, phonon stability is assessed by systematically conducting $ab$ $initio$ phonon calculations for over 8,000 compounds. The performance of $ab$ $initio$ stability criteria is systematically assessed against 189 experimentally synthesized compounds, and magnetic critical temperature calculations are validated using 59 experimental data points. As a result, we identify 631 stable compounds as promising candidates for further functional material exploration. Notably, 47 low-moment ferrimagnets are identified, with their spin polarization and anomalous Hall/Nernst conductivity calculated to provide insights into potential applications in spintronics and energy harvesting. Furthermore, our analyses reveal linear relationship between $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and magnetization in 14 systems and correlations between stability and atomic properties such as atomic radius and ionization energy. The regular/inverse structures preference in $X_2YZ$ compound and tetragonal distortion are also investigated for a broad Heusler family.</description>

      <title>Stacking, Strain-Engineering Induced Altermagnetism, Multipiezo Effect, and Topological State in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, as a newly identified form of unconventional antiferromagnetism, enables the removal of spin degeneracy in the absence of net magnetization that provides a platform for the low power consumption and ultra-fast device applications. However, the rare attention has been paid to the relationship between stacking, strain and altermagnet, multipiezo effect and topological state. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize the altermagnet, multipiezo effect, and topological state in two-dimensional materials by the stacking and strain engineering. Based on the analysis of symmetry, we find that the spin splitting feature related to the Ut, PTt, MzUt, or MzPTt symmetries in altermagnet multilayers. In addition, we find that the stacking engineering can effectively realize the transform from antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism and semiconductor to metal for the Jauns bilayer V2SeTeO. More interestingly, the strain not only induces an intriguing multipiezo effect, encompassing the piezovalley, piezomagnetism and piezoelectric, but also achieves the abundant topological phase. Our findings offer a generalized direction for manipulating the spin splitting, valley polarization, and topological states, promoting practical application of valleytronic and spintronic devices based on two-dimensional altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Photoexcitation-induced Stacking Transition Assisted by Intralayer Reconstruction in Charge-Density-Wave Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser excitation has emerged as an effective tool for probing microscopic interactions and manipulating phases of matter. Among charge density wave (CDW) materials, 1T-TaS2 has garnered significant attention due to its diverse stacking orders and photoexcited responses. However, the mechanisms driving transitions among different stacking orders and the microscopic out-of-equilibrium dynamics remain unclear. We elucidate that photoexcitation can introduce interlayer stacking order transitions facilitated by laser-induced intralayer reconstruction in 1T-TaS2. Importantly, our finding reveals a novel pathway to introduce different phases through laser excitations, apparently distinct from thermally-induced phase transitions via interlayer sliding. In particular, photoexcitation is able to considerably change potential energy surfaces and evoke collective lattice dynamics. Consequently, the laser-induced intralayer reconstruction plays a crucial role in interlayer stacking-order transition, offering a new method to create exotic stackings and quantum phases. The exploration opens up great opportunities for manipulating CDW phases and electronic properties on the femtosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Analysis methodology of coherent oscillations in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillatory signals from coherently excited phonons are regularly observed in ultrafast pump-probe experiments on condensed matter samples. Electron-phonon coupling implies that coherent phonons also modulate the electronic band structure. These oscillations can be probed with energy and momentum resolution using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) which reveals the orbital dependence of the electron-phonon coupling for a specific phonon mode. However, a comprehensive analysis remains challenging when multiple coherent phonon modes couple to multiple electronic bands. Complex spectral line shapes due to strong correlations in quantum materials add to this challenge. In this work, we examine how the frequency domain representation of trARPES data facilitates a quantitative analysis of coherent oscillations of the electronic bands. We investigate the frequency domain representation of the photoemission intensity and \tred{the first moment of the energy distribution curves}. Both quantities provide complimentary information and are able to distinguish oscillations of binding energy, linewidth and intensity.We analyze a representative trARPES dataset of the transition metal dichalcogenide WTe$_2$ and construct composite spectra which intuitively illustrate how much each electronic band is affected by a specific phonon mode. We also show how a linearly chirped probe pulse can generate extrinsic artifacts that are distinct from the intrinsic coherent phonon signal.</description>

      <title>Multifield Induced Antiferromagnet Transformation into Altermagnet and Realized Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in Two-dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, as a new category of collinear magnetism distinct from traditional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, exhibits the spin splitting without net magnetization. Currently, researchers are focus on searching three-dimensional altermagnetism and exploring its novel physical properties. However, there is a lack of understanding of the physical origin of two-dimensional altermagnetic emergent behavior. Here, we propose an approach to realize the transition from Neel antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism in two-dimensional system using an electric field, Janus structure, and ferroelectric substrate. In monolayer VPSe3, we demonstrate that multiple-physical-fields cause the upper and lower Se atoms unequal to break PT symmetry, resulting in altermagnetic spin splitting. Noted that monolayer VPSe3 produces a spontaneous valley splitting of 2.91 meV at the conduction band minimum. The electric field can effectively tune the valley splitting magnitude, while the Janus structure not only changes the valley splitting magnitude, but also alters the direction. More interestingly, when the ferroelectric polarization of Al2S3 is upward, the direction of valley polarization is switched and the magnitude is almost unchanged. However, the valley splitting sigfinicantly increases under the downward. It is worth noting that the ferroelectric polarization can switch altermagnetic effect and realize anomalous valley Hall effect. Besides, we reveal the microscopic mechanism of valley splitting by an effective Hamiltonian. Our findings not only provide a method to designing altermagnet, but also enriches the valley physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable properties and numerous technological applications of shape-memory alloys are due to a solid-to-solid phase transition involving a temperature-driven rearrangement of their crystal structure. Here, we propose a simple, yet effective experiment probing the \textit{sound} emitted by a Ni$_{40}$Ti$_{50}$Cu$_{10}$ bar at different temperatures crossing the transition between martensite and austenite phases and we discuss the relationship with the elastic properties of the material. We show that the phase transition{\RED, which occurs slightly above room temperature,} can be qualitatively monitored by the ear and that a quantitative description of the phenomenon can be obtained using a very simple setup and sound analysis tools. We argue that such a sound-based investigation provides an unusual, stimulating way to experimentally introduce solid-to-solid phase transitions suitable for undergraduate courses.</description>

Here, we systematically search for all thermodynamically stable Sr-C compounds under pressure (up to 100 GPa) using the ab initio evolutionary crystal structure prediction method. Our search lead to the discovery of hitherto unknown phases of SrC3, Sr2C5, Sr2C3, Sr2C, Sr3C2, and SrC. The newly discovered crystal structures feature a variety of different carbon environments ranging from isolated C anions and C-dimers to exotic polyatomic carbon anions including chains, stripes, and infinite ribbons consisting of pentagonal C5 and hexagonal C6 rings. Dynamical stability of all predicted compounds is confirmed by phonons calculations. Bader analysis unravels very diverse chemistry in these compounds and bonding patterns in some of them can be described using Zintl-Klemm rule.</description>

      <title>Growth orientation and magnetic properties of GdVO$_3$ tailored by epitaxial strain engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal oxides with an ABO$_3$ perovskite structure exhibit significant coupling between spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom, highlighting the crucial role of lattice distortion in tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of these systems. In this study, we grow a series of antiferromagnetic GdVO$_3$ thin films on different substrates introducing various strain values. The results demonstrate that the strain not only affects the material's structure and magnetic transition temperature but also influences the growth direction of the orthorhombic unit cell. A correlation is observed between the orientation of the orthorhombic long axis direction and the material's N\'eel temperature. DFT calculations highlighting the link between strain, lattice distortions and magnetic characteristics confirm these conclusions. Our findings demonstrate that the development of novel features in RVO$_3$ through material design requires control of growth orientation through strain engineering.</description>

      <title>Multicaloric effect in Fe48Rh52 alloy: case of combination magnetic field and uniaxial tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mono and multicaloric effects in Fe48Rh52 alloy under applied magnetic field, uniaxial tension and their combination were studied by direct method. It was found that for single cases, the inverse caloric effect was observed with delta TAD = -2.9 K (1T) at 330 K in the case of the magnetocaloric effect and delta TAD = -0.5 K (104 MPa) at 328 K in the case of the elastocaloric effect. The combination co-application of the external 1 T magnetic field and a 104 MPa tensile results to the observation of a synergistic effect with delta TAD = -3.4 K at 330 K when a, which exceeds similar values for mono caloric effects. As was shown from comparison of calculation and experiments multicaloric effect it is not a sum of mono caloric effects and several factors as geometry of the sample as well the protocol for applying external fields should be taken into account. It was shown that the distribution of mechanical stresses in the Fe48Rh52 sample with a geometry in the shape of a plate with holes is heterogeneous, which should be taken into account when measuring calorific effects using tension through holes</description>

      <title>Inverse Materials Design by Large Language Model-Assisted Generative Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models hold great promise for inverse materials design, yet their efficiency and accuracy remain constrained by data scarcity and model architecture. Here, we introduce AlloyGAN, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted text mining with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to enhance data diversity and improve inverse design. Taking alloy discovery as a case study, AlloyGAN systematically refines material candidates through iterative screening and experimental validation. For metallic glasses, the framework predicts thermodynamic properties with discrepancies of less than 8% from experiments, demonstrating its robustness. By bridging generative AI with domain knowledge and validation workflows, AlloyGAN offers a scalable approach to accelerate the discovery of materials with tailored properties, paving the way for broader applications in materials science.</description>

      <title>Luttinger compensated bipolarized magnetic semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetic materials, with real-space antiferromagnetic arrangement and reciprocal-space anisotropic spin splitting, have attracted much attention. However, the spin splitting is small in most altermagnetic materials, which is a disadvantage to their application in electronic devices. In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict for the first time two Luttinger compensated bipolarized magnetic semiconductors Mn(CN)2 and Co(CN)2 with isotropic spin splitting as in the ferromagnetic materials. Our further analysis shows that the Luttinger compensated magnetism here depends not only on spin group symmetry, but also on the crystal field splitting and the number of d-orbital electrons. In addition, the polarized charge density indicates that both Mn(CN)2 and Co(CN)2 have the quasi-symmetry T{\tau} , resulting from the crystal field splitting and the number of d-orbital electrons. The Luttinger compensated magnetism not only has the zero total magnetic moment as the antiferromagnetism, but also has the isotropic spin splitting as the ferromagnetism, thus our work not only provides theoretical guidance for searching Luttinger compensated magnetic materials with distinctive properties, but also provides a material basis for the application in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetodielectric Properties in Two Dimensional Magnetic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetodielectric (MD) materials are important for their ability to spin-charge conversion, magnetic field control of electric polarization and vice versa. Among these, two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are of particular interest due to the presence of magnetic anisotropy (MA) originating from the interaction between the magnetic moments and the crystal field. Also, these materials indicate a high degree of stability in the long-range spin order and may be described using suitable spin Hamiltonians of the Heisenberg, XY, or Ising type. Recent reports have suggested effective interactions between magnetization and electric polarization in 2D magnets. However, MD coupling studies on layered magnetic materials are still few. This review covers the fundamentals of magnetodielectric coupling by explaining related key terms. It includes the necessary conditions for having this coupling and sheds light on the possible physical mechanisms behind this coupling starting from phenomenological descriptions. Apart from that, this review classifies 2D magnetic materials into several categories for reaching out each and every class of materials. Additionally, this review summarizes recent advancements of some pioneer 2D magnetodielectric materials. Last but not the least, the current review provides possible research directions for enhancing magnetodielectric coupling in those and mentions the possibilities for future developments.</description>

      <title>Coexisting Triferroic and Multiple Types of Valley Polarization by Structural Phase Transition in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiferroic materials, which coexist magnetism, ferroelectric, and ferrovalley, have broad practical application prospects in promoting the miniaturization and integration of spintronic and valleytronic devices. However, it is rare that there are triferroic orders and multiple types of valley polarization in a real material. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize triferroic order coexistence and multiple types of valley polarization by structural phase transition in two-dimensional (2D) materials. The 1T and 2H phase OsBr2 monolayers exhibit non-magnetic semiconductor and ferromagnetic semiconductor with valley polarization up to 175.49 meV, respectively. Interestingly, the 1T phase OsBr2 bilayer shows the tri-state valley polarization due to lattice symmetry breaking, while the valley polarization of 2H phase bilayer originates from the combined effect of time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, the valley polarization and ferroelectric polarization of 1T phase AB stackings and 2H phase AA stackings can be manipulated via interlayer sliding. Importantly, we have verified that the 2H phase can be transformed to 1T phase by Li+ ion intercalation, while the 2H phase can occur the structural phase transition into the 1T phase by infrared laser induction. Our work provides a feasible strategy for manipulating valley polarization and a design idea for nano-devices with nonvolatile multiferroic properties.</description>

      <title>Agnostic calculation of atomic free energies with the descriptor density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to evaluate vibrational free energies of atomic systems without a priori specification of an interatomic potential. Our model-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors of atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor density of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching. Casting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we show free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor entropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign requires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel, reducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing lightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free energy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds of CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential variations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty quantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic integration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15 phases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the stringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase prediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors. We also demonstrate targeted fine-tuning, reducing the alpha-gamma transition temperature in a non-magnetic machine learning model of Fe from 2030 K to 1063 K through back-propagation, with no additional sampling. Applications to liquids and fine-tuning foundational models are discussed along with the many problems in computational science which estimate high-dimensional integrals.</description>

      <title>Reversible magneto ionics in crystallized W Co20Fe60B20 MgO HfO2 ultra-thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated electric field (E-field) induced modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in both amorphous and crystalline W/CoFeB/MgO/HfO2 ultra-thin films. We find that in the amorphous state, the E-field effect is volatile and reversible, which is consistent with the conventional electrostatic effect through charge accumulation and depletion. In the crystallized system annealed at 370{\deg}C, we find that two effects are at play, a non-volatile and reversible voltage-induced effect on PMA and an electrostatic response. We discuss these results in terms of higher oxygen mobility at the crystallized CoFeB-MgO interface, which induces a non-volatile magneto-ionic response. Modulating PMA in crystallized CoFeB-MgO materials through ionic migration opens the path to integrating magneto-ionics in full magnetic tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>Halbach 2.0 -- Creating homogeneous fields with finite size magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneous magnetic fields can be generated through the strategic arrangement of permanent magnets. The Halbach array serves as a prominent example of an effective design following this principle. However, it is a two-dimensional approach because it is optimal when placing infinitely long magnets -- line dipoles -- on a circle. If shorter, more realistic magnets are to be used, the optimal arrangement of magnetic moments diverges from the classical Halbach geometry. This paper presents optimal solutions for three-dimensional arrangements calculated for point dipoles, including optimized orientations for single rings and stacks of two rings. They are superior to the original Halbach arrangement and a modification described in the literature, both in terms of the strength and the homogeneity of the magnetic field. Analytic formulae are provided for both cases and tested by experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Table-top three-dimensional photoemission orbital tomography with a femtosecond extreme ultraviolet light source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).</description>

      <title>Imaging thick objects with deep-sub-angstrom resolution and deep-sub-picometer precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Size effects are ubiquitous in the structural, mechanical, and physical properties of materials, making it highly desirable to study the intrinsic properties of thick objects through high-resolution structural analysis in transmission electron microscopy. Although deep-sub-angstrom resolution has been achieved with multislice electron ptychography, the sample thickness is typically very limited. By combining energy filtering and extended local-orbital ptychography (eLOP) that retrieves varying aberrations during electron scanning, here we report ptychographic reconstructions for silicon as thick as 85 nm, approximately three times larger than usual thickness threshold for conventional multislice electron ptychography. The elimination of aberration variations contributes to accurate reconstructions with an information limit of 18 pm and atomic position precision of 0.39 pm. Accurate ptychographic reconstructions for thick objects can facilitate the discovery or interpretation of intrinsic structural and physical phenomena in solids, which is of great significance in physics, chemistry, materials science, and semiconductor device engineering.</description>

      <title>A novel spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>

      <title>In situ growth and magnetic characterization of Cr Chloride monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer Chromium Dihalides and Trihalides materials can be grown on a variety of substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) regardless of the lattice mismatch, thanks to the van der Waals epitaxy. In this work, we studied the magnetic nature of Cr Chloride monolayers grown on Au(111), Ni(111) and graphene passivated-Ni(111) from the evaporation in ultra-high vacuum of the same halide precursor. Structural, morphological and chemical characterization were conducted in situ by low energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy and Xray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). Owing to opposite chemical behaviour, Au(111) and Ni(111) promote the formation of two different valence compounds, i.e. CrCl$_3$ and CrCl$_2$, showing distinct magnetic properties at 4 K. When graphene is used to passivate the Ni(111) surface, the formation of CrCl$_3$ becomes allowed on this substrate. The coexistence of CrCl$_3$ and CrCl$_2$, both showing few nm lateral size and super-paramagnetic features, is demonstrated by XMCD spectra displaying two dichroic peaks at the characteristic Cr$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{2+}$ energies. Site selective magnetization measurements performed with the photon energy tuned on the two absorption edges show reversed magnetization of some of the CrCl$_2$ islands with respect to the CrCl$_3$ domains, which is interpreted in terms of magnetic frustration.</description>

      <title>Lattice Parameters and Bulk Modulus of SrTi$_{1-\mathit{x}}$Mn$_{\mathit{x}}$O$_{3}$ Perovskites: A Comparison of Exchange-Correlation Functionals with Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assessed four exchange-correlation functionals (LDA CA-PZ, GGA parametrized by PBE, PBEsol, and WC) in predicting the lattice parameters of SrTi$_{1-\mathit{x}}$Mn$_{\mathit{x}}$O$_{3}$ perovskites, assuming cubic structures. Predictions were verified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) for Mn content of $\mathit{x}$ = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, confirming cubic symmetry and a linear decrease in lattice parameters with increasing Mn. PBEsol and WC demonstrated the highest precision (deviations &lt; 0.20%). Additionally, bulk moduli were calculated using the same functionals and verified with the experimental bulk modulus of SrTiO$_{3}$ (183 $\pm$ 2 GPa, Pulse-Echo method). The predicted bulk moduli exhibited a slow, linear increase with increasing Mn. The best correspondence with the experimental bulk modulus was achieved by PBEsol and WC (deviations &lt; 0.7%). These findings highlight the reliability of PBEsol and WC functionals for accurately modeling structural properties of SrTi$_{1-\mathit{x}}$Mn$_{\mathit{x}}$O$_{3}$ perovskites, having better precision than commonly employed LDA and PBE functionals.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale characterization of atomic positions in orthorhombic perovskite thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystal structure determines many of the physical properties of oxide perovskites (ABO$_3$) and only a tiny modification of the lattice structure causes major changes in the functional properties through the interplay among spin, orbital and charge orders. The determination of characteristic distortions and symmetries is a valuable asset for understanding the structure-properties relationship and guiding the design of epitaxial oxide heterostructures, where electron degrees of freedom and correlated electronic states can be tailored. Even until new phases, otherwise absent in bulk materials, may appear. Here, we report on the in-depth structural characterization of 50~nm-LaVO$_3$ thin film grown onto (110)-oriented DyScO$_3$ by molecular beam epitaxy. We have investigated the heterostructure by means of x-ray diffraction, high-resolution and scanning transmission electron microscopies, scanning precession electron diffraction tomography and first-principle calculations. LaVO$_3$ crystallizes in the orthorhombic $Pbnm$ space group and is constrained by the substrate, which imposes a growth along the $[110]$ orthorhombic direction, over the 140 deposited unit cells. The mapping of the reciprocal space allows determining the orientation of the film and refining the lattice parameters. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy, we analyzed the structure of LaVO$_3$, focusing on the determination of the antipolar displacement of the rare earth. Additionally, 3D electron diffraction enabled to resolve the atomic positions of all species within the film.</description>

      <title>Mastering the growth of antimonene on Bi2Se3: strategies and insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimonene, the two-dimensional phase of antimony, appears in two distinct allotropes when epitaxially grown on Bi2Se3: the puckered asymmetric washboard ({\alpha}) and buckled honeycomb ({\beta}) bilayer structures. As-deposited antimony films exhibit varying proportions of single {\alpha} and {\beta} structures. We identify the conditions necessary for ordered, pure-phase growth of single to triple {\beta}-antimonene bilayers. Additionally, we determine their electronic structure, work function, and characteristic core-level binding energies, offering an explanation for the relatively large chemical shifts observed among the different phases. This study not only establishes a protocol for achieving a single {\beta} phase of antimonene but also provides key signatures for distinguishing between the different allotropes using standard spectroscopic and microscopic techniques.</description>

      <title>Broadband surface phonon spectroscopy by time-domain extreme ultraviolet diffuse scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence that the dynamics of surface acoustic waves, with wavelengths ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers, are encoded in the time-dependent diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light. By measuring the diffuse scattering from a surface after an ultrafast optical excitation, we determined the dispersion relation of surface acoustic wave-packets across a broad range of wavevectors in various samples. The comparison of the signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies suggests that the underlying excitation mechanism is related to the natural roughness of the samples surface. This simple and contactless approach represents a complementary experimental tool to transient grating or Brillouin spectroscopy, providing valuable insights into nanoscale surface dynamics.</description>

      <title>A generalized dual potential for inelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks: A JAX implementation at finite strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for designing a generalized dual potential, or pseudo potential, for inelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (iCANNs). This potential, expressed in terms of stress invariants, inherently satisfies thermodynamic consistency for large deformations. In comparison to our previous work, the new potential captures a broader spectrum of material behaviors, including pressure-sensitive inelasticity.
  To this end, we revisit the underlying thermodynamic framework of iCANNs for finite strain inelasticity and derive conditions for constructing a convex, zero-valued, and non-negative dual potential. To embed these principles in a neural network, we detail the architecture's design, ensuring a priori compliance with thermodynamics.
  To evaluate the proposed architecture, we study its performance and limitations discovering visco-elastic material behavior, though the method is not limited to visco-elasticity. In this context, we investigate different aspects in the strategy of discovering inelastic materials. Our results indicate that the novel architecture robustly discovers interpretable models and parameters, while autonomously revealing the degree of inelasticity.
  The iCANN framework, implemented in JAX, is publicly accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14894687.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Design of Frequency Selective Surface based Radar Absorbing Material via Image Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents an innovative methodology for designing frequency selective surface (FSS) based radar absorbing materials using machine learning (ML) technique. In conventional electromagnetic design, unit cell dimensions of FSS are used as input and absorption coefficient is then predicted for a given design. In this paper, absorption coefficient is considered as input to ML model and image of FSS unit cell is predicted. Later, this image is used for generating the FSS unit cell parameters. Eleven different ML models are studied over a wide frequency band of 1GHz to 30GHz. Out of which six ML models (i.e. (a) Random Forest classification, (b) K- Neighbors Classification, (c) Grid search regression, (d) Random Forest regression, (e) Decision tree classification, and (f) Decision tree regression) show training accuracy more than 90%. The absorption coefficients with varying frequencies of these predicted images are subsequently evaluated using commercial electromagnetic solver. The performance of these ML models is encouraging, and it can be used for accelerating design and optimization of high performance FSS based radar absorbing material for advanced electromagnetic applications in future.</description>

      <title>On the Electronic Structure of Kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Cs, Rb) have become a fascinating materials platform following the discovery of many novel quantum states due to the interplay between electronic correlation, topology, and geometry. Understanding their physical origin requires constructing effective theories that capture the low-energy electronic structure and electronic interactions. While the band structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) broadly agrees with experiments in the unbroken symmetry phase, the multiorbital nature challenges a proper understanding of the band structure and its description by tight-binding models. Here, we point out the unusual and puzzling properties of the DFT electronic structure, including the sublattice type of the van Hove singularities, the geometric shape of the Fermi surface, and the orbital content of the low-energy band dispersion, which cannot be described by the commonly used one-orbital or multiorbital kagome tight-binding models. We address these fundamental puzzles and develop an extended Slater-Koster formalism that can successfully resolve these issues. We discover the important role of site-symmetry and interorbital hopping structure and provide a concrete multiorbital tight-binding model description of the electronic structure for $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and the family of ``135'' compounds with other transition metals. This is a crucial step toward studying the effects of electron-electron interactions for the correlated and topological states in kagome metals and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spin relaxation and transport behaviors in altermagnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The D'yakonov-Perel' (DP) spin-relaxation mechanism has traditionally been associated with either relativistic spin-orbit coupling, which breaks space-inversion symmetry, or inhomogeneous magnetization, which breaks both time-reversal and translational symmetries. Here, we investigate spin relaxation mechanism in altermagnetic systems which possess novel magnetic states characterized by sublattices connected through crystal-rotation symmetries and opposite spins with zero overall net magnetization and absence of spin-orbit coupling. We find that altermagnetic states exhibit DP-type spin relaxations in both strong- and weak-scattering regimes, with the spin relaxation rate decreasing to zero as the temperature approaches the critical temperature of the altermagnetic phase transition. However, the scattering time involved in this spin relaxation mechanism is not the momentum relaxation time, in contrast to the conventional DP spin relaxation. Using a kinetic approach incorporating rigorous microscopic scattering, we demonstrate that the spin Hall current is highly anisotropic and proportional to the degree of altermagnetic order.</description>

      <title>High-Q, size-independent, and reconfigurable optical antennas via zero-index material dispersion engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interactions at the nanoscale is foundational to nanophotonics, with epsilon near zero (ENZ) materials demonstrating significant potential.High-quality (Q) factor resonances maximizing these interactions are typically realized in photonic crystals requiring sub-50 nm precision nanofabrication over large areas, limiting scalability and increasing complexity. Mie resonances offer an alternative but are constrained by low Q factors due to the scarcity of high refractive index materials, necessitating large refractive index changes for effective resonance switching and limiting dynamic reconfigurability. We overcome these limitations by embedding Mie resonators within ENZ media, thereby enhancing Q- factors, mitigating geometric dispersion and fabrication challenges, and maximizing optical reconfigurability. We introduce three resonator-ENZ configurations - voids in AlN, Ge in $SiO_2$, and intrinsic InSb in doped InSb - spanning from low-loss phononic to lossy plasmonic ENZ modes.Using novel epitaxial regrowth techniques, we achieve significant Q-factor improvements over non-embedded resonators. Notably, an air-based Mie resonator embedded in AlN supports resonant Q-factors exceeding 100, with negligible geometric dispersion across sizes from 800 nm to 2,800 nm. Additionally, we demonstrate dynamic reconfigurability of intrinsic InSb resonators by thermally tuning the ENZ wavelength over a 2$\mu$m range in the mid-infrared (11-16 $\mu$m) wavelength regime. These results showcase the potential of Mie resonators embedded in ENZ media for high-fidelity sensors, thermal emitters, and reconfigurable metasurfaces, bridging theoretical predictions with practical applications, advancing the development of dynamic, high-Q optical devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport in Reduced Graphene Oxide Measured by Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report combined scanning probe microscopy and transport measurements to investigate the local electronic transport properties of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that the quantum transport properties in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied by an atomic force microscope (AFM) conducting tip. Scanning gate microscopy measurements show a distinct p-type response, where the AFM tip locally gates the rGO, thereby modulating the transport current. Additional scanning impedance microscopy measurements indicate shifts in the Fermi energy under different gating conditions, highlighting the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on the transport characteristics of rGO. We demonstrate that the interplay between the tip-induced Fermi level shifts and defect-mediated scattering processes plays a key role in determining the observed transport behavior. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of scattering mechanisms, particularly resonant scattering caused by impurities or structural defects, in determining low-dimensional transport behavior in rGO. Notably, rGO exhibits resonant scattering effects akin to those seen in one-dimensional systems like carbon nanotubes, despite its two-dimensional structure. These insights advance our current understanding of charge transport in rGO, and have important implications for its use in nanoscale electronics, flexible sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with extraordinary electrical properties, hold promising for large-scale, flexible electronics. However, their device performance could be hindered due to the excessive defects introduced via traditional electrode integration processes. Transfer printing techniques have been developed for van der Waals contacts integration, while existing techniques encounter limitations in achieving conformal electrode transfer and compatibility with flexible devices. Here we introduce a highly conformal microprinting technique utilizing polypropylene carbonate (PPC)/Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) copolymer, which enables successful transfer of wafer-scale, micropatterned electrodes onto diverse substrates, including those with complex geometries. This technique, implemented with 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), yields 2D field-effect transistors with near-ideal ohmic contacts, and a record-high carrier mobility up to 334 cm2 V-1 s-1 for a WSe2 device. Furthermore, we fabricated transistor arrays on MoS2 thin film, which show uniform device performance. We also present the flexible MoS2 transistors that not only achieve a high electron mobility of up to 111 cm2 V-1 s-1 but also exhibit outstanding mechanical robustness. Our findings represent a significant leap forward in the fabrication of flexible 2D electronics, paving the way for numerous emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Multilevel Phase Lenses with Nanostructures on Polyimide Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of planar meta-lenses on flexible materials has profoundly impacted the long-standing perception of diffractive optics. Despite their advantages, these lenses still face challenges in design and fabrication to obtain high focusing efficiency and resolving power. A nanofabrication technique is demonstrated based on photolithography and polyimide casting for realizing membrane-based multilevel phase-type Fresnel zone plates (FZPs) with high focusing efficiency. By employing advantageous techniques, these lenses with nanostructures are directly patterned into thin polyimide membranes. The computational and experimental results have indicated that the focusing efficiency of these nanostructures at the primary focus increases significantly with increasing the number of phase levels. Specifically, 16-level phase lenses on a polyimide membrane can achieve a focusing efficiency of more than 91.6% of the input signal (9.5 times better than that of a conventional amplitude-type FZP) and focus light into a diffraction-limited spot together with very weak side-lobes. Furthermore, these lenses exhibit considerably reduced unwanted diffraction orders and produce extremely low background signals. The potential impact of these lenses extends across various applications and techniques including microscopy, imaging, micro-diffraction, remote sensing, and space flight instruments which require lightweight and flexible configurations.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of Tc enhancement above 50 K and diode and paramagnetic-Meissner effects, in Nickelate films on highly reduced $SrTiO_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in nickelate thin films in 2019, the quest for enhancing their $T_c$ has been ongoing. Here we provide experimental evidence for $T_c$ enhancement in oxygen deficient films on highly reduced and conducting $SrTiO_3$ substrates. $T_c$ onset of 50-70 K was found in Meissner and transport measurements, which indicates superconductivity in islands or domains in our films, where $T_c$ of zero resistance is obtained at 20-25 K. In addition, we observed a giant paramagnetic-Meissner effect peak at about 48 K, which further supports the existence of a superconductive transition just above it. Furthermore, an asymmetric or nonreciprocal and non-hysteretic superconductive diode effect was observed. The later could be fully polarized, and its polarity could be reversed. The specific phase responsible for these notable effects was not yet identified, and further research is needed in order to identify and isolate the relevant phase.</description>

Abstract: The interplay of electronic interactions and nontrivial topology can give rise to a wealth of exotic quantum states. A notable example is the formation of Wigner crystals driven by strong electron-electron interactions. When these electronic crystals emerge in a parent band carrying a large Berry curvature, they can exhibit topologically nontrivial properties as anomalous Hall crystals, spontaneously breaking both continuous translational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report the experimental observation of tunable anomalous Hall crystals in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene moir\'e superlattices. At filling factors near one electron per moir\'e unit cell (v=1), we identify a series of incommensurate Chern insulators with a Chern number of C=1. Furthermore, we observe spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking spanning the entire filling range from v=1 to v=2, manifesting as anomalous Hall effects with pronounced magnetic hysteresis. Notably, anomalous Hall crystals with a high Chern number C=3 are observed over generic fillings ranging from v=1.5 to v=2. These anomalous Hall crystals are incommensurate with the moir\'e superlattice and exhibit dispersive fan diagrams consistent with the Streda formula, with their positions continuously tunable through displacement fields. Remarkably, these partially filled Chern insulators display Chern numbers distinct from their parent bands. Our findings demonstrate the rich variety of electronic crystalline states in rhombohedral graphene moir\'e superlattices, offering valuable insights into the strongly correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Deuterium retention in pre-lithiated samples and Li-D co-deposits in the DIII-D tokamak</title>

Abstract: Divertor designs involving liquid lithium have been proposed as an alternative to solid designs and wall conditioning techniques. However, Li affinity with tritium poses a risk for the fuel cycle. This study investigates deuterium retention in pre-lithiated samples and Li-D co-deposits in the DIII-D tokamak, making for the first time a direct comparison between Li-D co-deposits and pre-deposited Li films. Samples were exposed to H-mode plasmas in the far scrape-off layer (SOL), and Li powder was injected in-situ with the impurity powder dropper to study the uniformity of Li coatings, and the dependence of fuel retention on Li thickness. The results show that at temperatures below the melting point of lithium, deuterium retention is independent of the thickness of pre-deposited Li layers, with Li-D co-deposits being the primary factor for fuel retention. Both pre-deposited and in-situ deposited Li showed lower erosion than predicted by sputtering yield calculations. These results suggest that fuel retention in fusion reactors using lithium in the divertor will likely be dominated by co-deposits rather than in the divertor itself. If one desires to use Li to achieve flatter temperature profiles, operando Li injection is advantageous over pre-deposited Li films, at least at temperatures below the melting point of lithium.</description>

Abstract: Interfacial superconductivity discovered in bilayer nickelate heterostructures opens new avenues for effective tunability and control. Here, we report the superconductor-insulator transition in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ interfaces, with corresponding electronic structures revealed using synchrotron low-temperature X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray linear dichroism (XLD). In addition to the valence states of each element within the films determined by XAS, XLD at the O K edge pre-peak reveals hybridizations involving both 2p$_{z}$ and 2p$_{x}$/2p$_{y}$ orbitals, which are concomitantly suppressed upon oxygen loss. Intriguingly, such oxygen loss that eliminates superconductivity, induces a qualitative XLD change at the Ni L$_{2}$ edge, implying significant transformations among 3d$_{x^{2}}$ $_{-y^{2}}$ and 3d$_{z^{2}}$ energy bands near the Fermi level. Our findings establish an element- and orbital-resolved electronic framework for the origin of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors induced by magnetic field. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experiments find that the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature at which the longitudinal thermal conductivity peaks. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions (which do not produce entropy) dominate Umklapp and boundary scattering events (which do). In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a geometric [Berry] phase. I will argue here that the survival of this phase in a crystal implies a complex amplitude for transverse phonons. This modifies three-phonon interference patterns, twisting the quasi-momentum of the outgoing phonon. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{max}$, and the crest displacement amplitude, $u_m$, of transverse acoustic phonons at $T_{max}$. Combined with the interatomic distance, $a$ and the magnetic length, $\ell_B$, it yields: $\Theta_H \approx \lambda_{max}^2u_m^2a^{-2}\ell_B^{-2}$. This is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

      <title>Tuning of Josephson junctions -- the effects of depinning physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Deployable Nanoelectromechanical Bound States in the Continuum Enabled by GHz Lamb Wave Phononic Crystals on LiNbO3 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are a fascinating class of eigenstates that trap energy within the continuum, enabling breakthroughs in ultra-low-threshold lasing, high-Q sensing, and advanced wave-matter interactions. However, their stringent symmetry requirements hinder practical integration, especially in acoustic and electromechanical systems where efficient mode excitation is challenging. Here, we demonstrate deployable nanoelectromechanical quasi-BICs on suspended lithium niobate (LiNbO3) thin films, enabled by nanoscale Lamb wave phononic crystals (PnCs) operating at gigahertz frequencies. By exploiting the decoupling of symmetric (S) and antisymmetric (A) Lamb wave modes, we create a robust framework for BICs. Controlled mirror symmetry breaking induces targeted coupling between the S and A modes, resulting in quasi-BICs that preserve high-Q characteristics and can be excited by traveling waves, eliminating the need for specialized excitation schemes. Our approach enables the multiplexing of quasi-BIC resonators along a single transmission line, each corresponding to a unique frequency and spatial position. This work presents a scalable route for the on-chip integration of BICs, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical nanoelectromechanical devices, and opening new avenues in advanced signal processing, high-precision sensing, and quantum acoustics.</description>

      <title>Monolithic On-Chip Phononic Chiral Anomalous Bulk States on LiNbO3 Thin-films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phononic materials are crucial for developing efficient, robust mechanical waveguides with strong transport properties, enabling advances in sensing, signal processing, energy harvesting, and microfluidics. A key motivation is their integration into monolithic systems for on-chip applications. While topological phononic materials developed in the past decade offer unidirectional edge states immune to backscattering, their integration requires large volumes to control localized small volumes' transport properties, limiting their efficiency and application in modern phononic circuits. The recently introduced chiral anomalous bulk states (CABSs) combine the advantages of topological materials with innovative boundary designs, overcoming transmission limitations and ensuring full material utilization for superior wave propagation. Here, we present the first on-chip monolithic CABS device integrated on a suspended LiNbO3 thin film. This breakthrough enables the creation of phononic waveguides with unmatched unidirectionality, low loss, and high transmission efficiency, seamlessly integrated with broadband piezoelectric transducers, and showcasing their potential for high-fidelity, broad-bandwidth microwave signal transmission. Additionally, we exploit the slow-wave characteristics of CABSs for delay lines and high-density signal processing. Tailoring wave propagation through boundary engineering opens a new paradigm for phononic/photonic device design, with implications across microelectronics, high-frequency communications, radar, and advanced sensing technologies. The work sets the stage for the future development of highly scalable, multifunctional, and robust phononic systems, unlocking new avenues for integrated acoustic technologies.</description>

      <title>Controllable Interlocking from Irregularity in Two-Phase Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural materials often feature a combination of soft and stiff phases, arranged to achieve excellent mechanical properties, such as high strength and toughness. Many natural materials have even independently evolved to have similar structures to obtain these properties. For example, interlocking structures are observed in many strong and tough natural materials, across a wide range of length scales. Inspired by these materials, we present a class of two-phase composites with controllable interlocking. The composites feature tessellations of stiff particles connected by a soft matrix and we control the degree of interlocking through irregularity of particle size, geometry and arrangement. We generate the composites through stochastic network growth, using an algorithm which connects a hexagonal grid of nodes according to a coordination number, defined as the average number of connections per node. The generated network forms the soft matrix phase of the composites, while the areas enclosed by the network form the stiff reinforcing particles. At low coordination, composites feature highly polydisperse particles with irregular geometries, which are arranged non-periodically. In response to loading, these particles interlock with each other and primarily rotate and deform to accommodate non-uniform kinematic constraints from adjacent particles. In contrast, higher coordination composites feature more monodisperse particles with uniform geometries, which collectively slide. We then show how to control the degree of interlocking as a function of coordination number alone, demonstrating how irregularity facilitates controllability.</description>

Abstract: All-optical switching (AOS) involves manipulating magnetization using only pulsed laser, presenting a promising approach for next-generation magnetic recording devices. NiCo2O4 (NCO) thin films, a rare-earth-free ferrimagnetic oxide, exhibit a high Curie temperature and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This study demonstrates AOS in NCO thin films at room temperature using long-duration laser pulses and high repetition rates. Unlike previous findings, the AOS phenomena we report here are helicity-dependent and observable with an ultrashort pulsed laser. Consequently, two distinct types of AOS can be observed in a single NCO thin film, contingent on the characteristics of the laser pulses and temperature.</description>

Abstract: Exploring intrinsic magnetic topological insulators (TIs) for next-generation spintronic devices is still challenging in recent years. Here, we present a theoretical investigation on the electronic, magnetic and topological properties of monolayer (ML) Janus MnBi2TexSe4-x, derived from two trivial magnetic semiconductors ML MnBi2Se4 and MnBi2Te4. Our band structure analysis reveals that two out of the eight Janus structures exhibit band inversion induced by spin-orbit coupling. These structures are confirmed to have nonzero integer Chern numbers, indicating their topological nature. Moreover, the topological state is robust under moderate biaxial strains. Interestingly, applying compressive strain results in a high Chern number of 2 and enhances their magnetic stability at elevated temperatures. Our findings offer an effective strategy to engineer magnetic TI states within the ML MnBi2Te4 family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic grain boundary mobility tensor from three-dimensional interface random walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, studies have demonstrated that the grain boundary (GB) migration is a three-dimensional (3D) process, characterized by a 3D mobility tensor. In this study, we develop a 3D interface random walk theory to extract the GB mobility and shear coupling tensors at equilibrium state based on the random walk of the GB position. Using this approach, we mathematically prove the symmetry of the GB mobility tensor in the case of overdamped GB migration. The theory and its conclusions align with molecular dynamics simulation results and disconnection analysis, and the extracted GB mobility and shear coupling tensors reflect the intrinsic GB properties, unaffected by the large driving forces in atomistic simulations. Additionally, we refined the fast adapted random walk (FAIRWalk) method, enabling efficient extraction of the GB mobility tensor from fewer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. Building on this advancement, we conducted an extensive survey of the mobility, shear coupling, and activation energy for the migration of 388 coincidence-site lattice Ni GBs in the Olmsted database. Several intriguing phenomena were observed, including temperature-induced sudden emergence, disappearance, or inversion of shear coupling; GBs with "zero" normal mobility but high shear mobility; and a non-linear relationship between activation energy and mobility. These findings challenge the traditional understanding of GB migration and warrant further investigation.</description>

Abstract: A current challenge in atomistic machine learning is that of efficiently predicting the response of the electron density under electric fields. We address this challenge with symmetry-adapted kernel functions that are specifically derived to account for the rotational symmetry of a three-dimensional vector field. We demonstrate the equivariance of the method on a set of rotated water molecules and show its high efficiency with respect to number of training configurations and features for liquid water and naphthalene crystals. We conclude showcasing applications for relaxed configurations of gold nanoparticles, reproducing the scaling law of the electronic polarizability with size, up to systems with more than 2000 atoms. By deriving a natural extension to equivariant learning models of the electron density, our method provides an accurate and inexpensive strategy to predict the electrostatic response of molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>Integrating Deep-Learning-Based Magnetic Model and Non-Collinear Spin-Constrained Method: Methodology, Implementation and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a non-collinear spin-constrained method that generates training data for deep-learning-based magnetic model, which provides a powerful tool for studying complex magnetic phenomena at the atomic scale. First, we propose a projection method for atomic magnetic moments by applying a radial truncation to the numerical atomic orbitals. We then implement a Lagrange multiplier method that can yield the magnetic torques of atoms by constraining the magnitude and direction of atomic magnetic moments. The method is implemented in ABACUS with both plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbital basis. We benchmark the iron (Fe) systems with the new method and analyze differences from calculations with the plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbitals basis in describing magnetic energy barriers. Based on more than 30,000 first-principles data with the information of magnetic torque, we train a deep-learning-based magnetic model DeePSPIN for the Fe system. By utilizing the model in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we successfully predict Curie temperatures of $\alpha$-Fe close to experimental values.</description>

Abstract: Quantifying the evolution and complexity of materials is of importance in many areas of science and engineering, where a central open challenge is developing experimental complexity measurements to distinguish random structures from evolved or engineered materials. Assembly Theory (AT) was developed to measure complexity produced by selection, evolution and technology. Here, we extend the fundamentals of AT to quantify complexity in inorganic molecules and solid-state periodic objects such as crystals, minerals and microprocessors, showing how the framework of AT can be used to distinguish naturally formed materials from evolved and engineered ones by quantifying the amount of assembly using the assembly equation defined by AT. We show how tracking the Assembly of repeated structures within a material allows us formalizing the complexity of materials in a manner accessible to measurement. We confirm the physical relevance of our formal approach, by applying it to phase transformations in crystals using the HCP to FCC transformation as a model system. To explore this approach, we introduce random stacking faults in closed-packed systems simplified to one-dimensional strings and demonstrate how Assembly can track the phase transformation. We then compare the Assembly of closed-packed structures with random or engineered faults, demonstrating its utility in distinguishing engineered materials from randomly structured ones. Our results have implications for the study of pre-genetic minerals at the origin of life, optimization of material design in the trade-off between complexity and function, and new approaches to explore material technosignatures which can be unambiguously identified as products of engineered design.</description>

      <title>Robust Super-Moir\'e in Large Angle Single-Twist Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forming long wavelength moir\'e superlattices (MSL) at small-angle twist van der Waals (vdW) bilayers has been a key approach to creating moir\'e flat bands. The small-angle twist, however, leads to strong lattice reconstruction, causing domain walls and moir\'e disorders, which pose considerable challenges in engineering such platforms. At large twist angles, the rigid lattices render a more robust, but shorter wavelength MSL, making it difficult to engineer flat bands. Here, we depict a novel approach to tailoring robust super-moir\'e (SM) structures that combines the advantages of both small-twist and large-twist transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) bilayers using only a single twist angle near a commensurate angle. Structurally, we unveil the spontaneous formation of a periodic arrangement of three inequivalent commensurate moir\'e (CM) stacking, where the angle deviation from the commensurate angle can tune the periodicity. Electronically, we reveal a large set of van Hove singularities (VHSs) that indicate strong band hybridization, leading to flat bands near the valence band maximum. Our study paves the way for a new platform of robust SM bilayers with structural rigidity and controllable wavelength, extending the investigation of the interplay among band topology, quantum geometry, and moir\'e superconductivity to the large twist angle regime.</description>

      <title>Giant Topological Hall Effect Across Wide Temperature in Pt/NiCo2O4 Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological Hall effect (THE), a quantum phenomenon arising from emergent magnetic field generated by topological spin texture, is a key method for detecting non-coplanar spin structures like skyrmions in magnetic materials. Here, we investigate a bilayer structure of Pt and conducting ferrimagnet NiCo2O4 (NCO) of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and demonstrate giant THE across a temperature range 2 - 350 K. The absence of THE in single-layer Pt and NCO, as well as in Pt/Cu/NCO, suggests its interfacial origin. The maximum THE occurring just before the NCO coercive field indicates its connection to magnetic nucleation centers, which are topologically equivalent to skyrmions. The large normalized THE, based on the emergent-field model, points to a high population density of small nucleation centers. This aligns with the unresolvable domain structures during magnetization reversal, even though clear domain structures are detected after zero-field cooling. These results establish heavy metal/NCO as a promising system for exploring topological spin structures.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Spin-Orbit-Coupled Magnetoelectricity in Type-II Multiferroic NiI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type-II multiferroics, where spin order induces ferroelectricity, exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling. However, for the typical 2D type-II multiferroic NiI$_2$, the underlying magnetoelectric mechanism remains unclear. Here, applying generalized spin-current model, together with first-principles calculations and a tight-binding approach, we build a comprehensive magnetoelectric model for spin-induced polarization. Such model reveals that the spin-orbit coupling extends its influence to the third-nearest neighbors, whose contribution to polarization rivals that of the first-nearest neighbors. By analyzing the orbital-resolved contributions to polarization, our tight-binding model reveals that the long-range magnetoelectric coupling is enabled by the strong $e_g$-$p$ hopping of NiI$_2$. Monte Carlo simulations further predict a Bloch-type magnetic skyrmion lattice at moderate magnetic fields, accompanied by polar vortex arrays. These findings can guide the discovery and design of strongly magnetoelectric multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Stability-Aware Training of Machine Learning Force Fields with Differentiable Boltzmann Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are an attractive alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, they can produce unstable simulations, limiting their ability to model phenomena occurring over longer timescales and compromising the quality of estimated observables. To address these challenges, we present Stability-Aware Boltzmann Estimator (StABlE) Training, a multi-modal training procedure which leverages joint supervision from reference quantum-mechanical calculations and system observables. StABlE Training iteratively runs many MD simulations in parallel to seek out unstable regions, and corrects the instabilities via supervision with a reference observable. We achieve efficient end-to-end automatic differentiation through MD simulations using our Boltzmann Estimator, a generalization of implicit differentiation techniques to a broader class of stochastic algorithms. Unlike existing techniques based on active learning, our approach requires no additional ab-initio energy and forces calculations to correct instabilities. We demonstrate our methodology across organic molecules, tetrapeptides, and condensed phase systems, using three modern MLFF architectures. StABlE-trained models achieve significant improvements in simulation stability, data efficiency, and agreement with reference observables. The stability improvements cannot be matched by reducing the simulation timestep; thus, StABlE Training effectively allows for larger timesteps. By incorporating observables into the training process alongside first-principles calculations, StABlE Training can be viewed as a general semi-empirical framework applicable across MLFF architectures and systems. This makes it a powerful tool for training stable and accurate MLFFs, particularly in the absence of large reference datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/ASK-Berkeley/StABlE-Training.</description>

      <title>General theory for packing icosahedral shells into multi-component aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for designing a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. The predictions of our design strategy are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations for several multi-component atomic clusters and nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Current-induced brightening of vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform photoluminescence measurements on vacancy-related emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that are notorious for their low quantum yields. The gating of these emitters via few-layer graphene electrodes reveals a reproducible, gate-dependent brightening of the emitter, which coincides with a change in the direction of the simultaneously measured leakage current across the hBN layers. At the same time, we observe that the relative increase of the brightening effect scales linearly with the intensity of the excitation laser. Both observations can be explained in terms of a photo-assisted electroluminescence effect. Interestingly, emitters can also show the opposite behavior, i.e. a decrease in emitter intensity that depends on the gate leakage current. We explain these two opposing behaviors with different concentrations of donor and acceptor states in the hBN and show that precise control of the doping of hBN is necessary to gain control over the brightness of vacancy-related emitters by electrical means. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of vacancy-related defects in hBN that is necessary to make use of their potential for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface reconstruction and enhanced spin fluctuations in strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ on LaAlO$_3$(001) and SrTiO$_3$(001)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the structural and electronic properties of the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 on LaAlO3(001) and SrTiO3(001) by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. For La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/LaAlO$_3$(001), we find that compressive strain and electron doping across the interface result in the unconventional occupation of the antibonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states. In sharp contrast, no charge transfer is observed for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$/SrTiO$_3$(001). Surprisingly, tensile strain drives a metallization of the bonding Ni $3d_{z^2}$ states, rendering a Fermi surface topology akin to superconducting bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ under high pressure, yet with spin fluctuations enhanced considerably beyond pressure effects. Concomitantly, significant octahedral rotations are retained. We discuss the fundamental differences between hydrostatic pressure versus epitaxial strain and establish that strain provides a much stronger control over the Ni $e_g$ orbital polarization. The results suggest epitaxial La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, particularly under tensile strain, as interesting system to provide novel insights into the physics of bilayer nickelates and possibly induce superconductivity without external pressure.</description>
