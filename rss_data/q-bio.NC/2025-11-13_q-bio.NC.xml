      <title>Data-driven spatiotemporal modeling reveals personalized trajectories of cortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive spread of pathology across brain networks, yet forecasting this cascade at the individual level remains challenging. We present a personalized graph-based dynamical model that captures the spatiotemporal evolution of cortical atrophy from longitudinal MRI and PET data. The approach constructs individualized brain graphs and learns the dynamics driving regional neurodegeneration. Applied to 1,891 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the model accurately predicts key AD biomarkers -- including amyloid-beta, tau, neurodegeneration, and cognition -- outperforming clinical and neuroimaging benchmarks. Patient-specific parameters reveal distinct progression subtypes and anticipate future cognitive decline more effectively than standard biomarkers. Sensitivity analysis highlights regional drivers of disease spread, reproducing known temporolimbic and frontal vulnerability patterns. This network-based digital twin framework offers a quantitative, personalized paradigm for AD trajectory prediction, with implications for patient stratification, clinical trial design, and targeted therapeutic development.</description>

      <title>Characterizing sleep stages through the complexity-entropy plane in human intracranial data and in a whole-brain model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the brain dynamics during different cortical states can reveal valuable information about its patterns across various cognitive processes. In particular, studying the differences between awake and sleep stages can shed light on the understanding of brain processes essential for physical and mental well-being, such as memory consolidation, information processing, and fatigue recovery. Alterations in these patterns may indicate disorders and pathologies such as obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, as well as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here, we analyze time series obtained from intracranial recordings of 106 patients, covering four sleep stages: Wake, N2, N3, and REM. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), which can include electrocorticography (ECoG) and depth recordings, represents the state-of-the-art measurements of brain activity, offering unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution for investigating neural dynamics. We characterize the signals using Bandt and Pompe symbolic methodology to calculate the Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE) and the Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) based on the Jensen and Shannon disequilibrium. By mapping the data onto the complexity-entropy plane, we observe that each stage occupies a distinct region, revealing its own dynamic signature. We show that our empirical results can be reproduced by a whole-brain computational model, in which each cortical region is described by a mean-field formulation based on networks of Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) neurons, adjusting the adaptation parameter to simulate the different sleep stages. Finally, we show that a classification approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) provides high accuracy in distinguishing between cortical states.</description>

      <title>A thermoinformational framework for the description of neuropsychological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a statistical thermodynamics-inspired framework that summarizes multichannel EEG and behavior using macroscopic state variables (entropy, internal energy, temperature, Helmholtz free energy) to quantify stability and reconfiguration in neuropsychological systems. Applied to mother-infant EEG dyads performing the A-not-B task, these variables dissociate neural reconfiguration from behavioral success across a large set of model and feature configurations. Informational heat increases during environmental switches and decision errors, consistent with increased information exchange with the task context. In contrast, correct choices are preceded by lower temperature and higher free energy in the window, and are followed by free-energy declines as the system re-stabilizes. In an independent optogenetic dam-pup paradigm, the same variables separate stimulation conditions and trace coherent trajectories in thermodynamic state space. Together, these findings show that the thermoinformational framework yields compact, physically grounded descriptors that hold in both human and mouse datasets studied here.</description>

      <title>Multi-step Predictive Coding Leads To Simplicity Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.</description>

      <title>On sources to variabilities of simple cells in the primary visual cortex: A principled theory for the interaction between geometric image transformations and receptive field responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02139v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives an overview of a theory for modelling the interaction between geometric image transformations and receptive field responses for a visual observer that views objects and spatio-temporal events in the environment. This treatment is developed over combinations of (i) uniform spatial scaling transformations, (ii) spatial affine transformations, (iii) Galilean transformations and (iv) temporal scaling transformations.
  By postulating that the family of receptive fields should be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, it follows that the receptive field shapes should be expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding image transformations, to enable a formal matching between the receptive field responses computed under different viewing conditions for the same scene or for a structurally similar spatio-temporal event.
  We conclude the treatment by discussing and providing potential support for a working hypothesis that the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under these classes of geometric image transformations, and thus have the shapes of their receptive fields expanded over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding geometric image transformations.</description>

      <title>Fractal geometry predicts dynamic differences in structural and functional connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the intricate architecture of brain networks and its connection to brain function is essential for deciphering the underlying principles of cognition and disease. While traditional graph-theoretical measures have been widely used to characterize these networks, they often fail to fully capture the emergent properties of large-scale neural dynamics. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to quantify brain networks that is rooted in complex dynamics, fractal geometry, and asymptotic analysis. We apply these concepts to brain connectomes and demonstrate how quadratic iterations and geometric properties of Mandelbrot-like sets can provide novel insights into structural and functional network dynamics. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions between structural (positive) and functional (signed) connectomes, such as the shift of cusp orientation and the variability in equi-M set geometry. Notably, structural connectomes exhibit more robust, predictable features, while functional connectomes show increased variability for non-trivial tasks. We further demonstrate that traditional graph-theoretical measures, when applied separately to the positive and negative sub-networks of functional connectomes, fail to fully capture their dynamic complexity. Instead, size and shape-based invariants of the equi-M set effectively differentiate between rest and emotional task states, which highlights their potential as superior markers of emergent network dynamics. These results suggest that incorporating fractal-based methods into network neuroscience provides a powerful tool for understanding how information flows in natural systems beyond static connectivity measures, while maintaining their simplicity.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Cartography of the Epistemic Diffusion of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroscience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroscience and AI have an intertwined history, largely relayed in the literature of both fields. In recent years, due to the engineering orientations of AI research and the monopoly of industry for its large-scale applications, the mutual expansion of neuroscience and AI in fundamental research seems challenged. In this paper, we bring some empirical evidences that, on the contrary, AI and neuroscience are continuing to grow together, but with a pronounced interest in the fields of study related to neurodegenerative diseases since the 1990s. With a temporal knowledge cartography of neuroscience drawn with advanced document embedding techniques, we draw the dynamical shaping of the discipline since the 1970s and identified the conceptual articulation of AI with this particular subfield mentioned before. However, a further analysis of the underlying citation network of the studied corpus shows that the produced AI technologies remain confined in the different subfields and are not transferred from one subfield to another. This invites us to discuss the genericity capability of AI in the context of an intradisciplinary development, especially in the diffusion of its associated metrology.</description>

      <title>ActiTect: A Generalizable Machine Learning Pipeline for REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening through Standardized Actigraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements, they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns. Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range = 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model using wearable devices.</description>
