      <title>Gene-R1: Reasoning with Data-Augmented Lightweight LLMs for Gene Set Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for uncovering the molecular functions associated with a group of genes. Recently, LLM-powered methods have emerged to annotate gene sets with biological functions together with coherent explanatory insights. However, existing studies primarily focus on proprietary models, which have been shown to outperform their open-source counterparts despite concerns over cost and data privacy. Furthermore, no research has investigated the application of advanced reasoning strategies to the GSA task. To address this gap, we introduce Gene-R1, a data-augmented learning framework that equips lightweight and open-source LLMs with step-by-step reasoning capabilities tailored to GSA. Experiments on 1,508 in-distribution gene sets demonstrate that Gene-R1 achieves substantial performance gains, matching commercial LLMs. On 106 out-of-distribution gene sets, Gene-R1 performs comparably to both commercial and large-scale LLMs, exhibiting robust generalizability across diverse gene sources.</description>

      <title>Generalized Additive Modeling of TRPM4-Ribo Transcriptional Space in Prostate Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TRPM4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) associated with metastasis or recurrence. There is paucity of information pertaining to TRPM4 characterization and functions at single-cell level in PCa. In this study, generalized additive model (GAM) was utilized to model the relationship between TRPM4 and genes shortlisted using Spearman-Kendall dual-filter in aggressive PCa and benign prostate (BP) control cells derived from scRNA-seq dataset. Seven ribosomal genes (RPL10, RPL27, RPL28, RPS2, RPS8, RPS12, and RPS26; averaged into Ribo as the gene set), passed the dual-filter specifically in PCa cells. GAM modeling of TRPM4-Ribo significantly outperformed TRPM4 modeling with alternative cancer gene sets (GSK-3B, mTOR, NF-KB, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt). Cell explanatory power (CEP) classification was devised and verified by cross-validation to identify individual PCa cells most well-predicted by the model. CEP classification binarized PCa cells into top-ranked explanatory power (TREP; more well-predicted by the model) and non-TREP cells. In TRPM4-Ribo GAM plots, distribution pattern of TREP cells shifted at an inflection point (IP) i.e., the specific TRPM4 expression value that further binarized the plot into pre-IP (TRPM4 values below IP) and post-IP (TRPM4 values above IP) regions, producing a quadrant of TREP versus non-TREP cells for each PCa patient. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that pre-IP TREP cells enriched for immune-related GOs, while post-IP TREP cells enriched for ribosomal, translation, and cell adhesion GOs. In conclusion, the CEP-IP framework based on pairwise genes produces quadrants of cancer cell subpopulations, enabling the identification of distinctive biology with potential therapeutic implications.</description>
