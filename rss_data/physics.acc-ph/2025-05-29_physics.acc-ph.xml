      <title>High Precision RF Pulse Shaping with Direct RF Sampling for Future Linear Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In various of particle accelerator designs, amplitude and phase modulation methods are commonly applied to shape the RF pulses for implementing pulse compressors or compensating for the fluctuations introduced by the high-power RF components and beam loading effects. Phase modulations are typically implemented with additional phase shifters that require drive or control electronics. With our recent next-generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) platform developed based on direct RF sampling technology of RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) devices, RF pulse shaping can be realized without the analogue phase shifters, which can significantly simplify the system architecture. We performed a range of high-power experiments in the C-band to evaluate the RF pulse-shaping capabilities of the NG-LLRF system at different stages of the RF circuits. In this paper, the high-power characterization results with the Cool Copper Collider (C3) structure driven by RF pulses with different modulation schemes will be described. With the pulse modulation and demodulation completely implemented in the digital domain, the RF pulse shaping schemes can be rapidly adapted for X-band structures simply by adding analogue mixers.</description>

      <title>Next Generation LLRF Control and Monitoring System for S-Band Linear Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-level RF (LLRF) systems for S-band linear accelerating structures are typically implemented with heterodyne base architectures. We have developed and characterized the next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) based on the RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) for C-band accelerating structures, and the platform delivered the pulse-to-pulse fluctuation levels considerably better than the requirement of the targeted applications. The NG-LLRF system uses the direct RF sampling technique of the RFSoC, which significantly simplified the architecture compared to the conventional LLRF. We have extended the frequency range of the NG-LLRF to S-band and experimented with different RFSoC devices and system designs to meet the more stringent requirements for S-band LLRF applications. In this paper, the characterization results of the platform with different system architectures will be summarized and the high-power test results of the NG-LLRF with the S-band accelerating structure in the Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator (NLCTA) test facility at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory will be presented and analyzed.</description>
