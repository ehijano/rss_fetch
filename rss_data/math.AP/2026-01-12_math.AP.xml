      <title>A dimension-independent critical exponent in a nutrient taxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a ball $\Omega\subset R^n$ with arbitrary $n\ge 1$, the chemotaxis-consumption system \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  u_t = \nabla \cdot \big(D(u)\nabla u\big) - \nabla \cdot (u\nabla v), \\[1mm]
  0 = \Delta v - uv,
  \end{array} \right. \] is considered under no-flux boundary conditions for $u$, and for prescribed constant positive boundary data for $v$. Under the assumption that $D\in C^3([0,\infty))$ satisfies \[
  D(\xi)\ge k_D (\xi+1)^{-\alpha}
  \qquad \mbox{for all } \xi\ge 0
  \qquad \qquad
  (\star) \] with some $\alpha&lt;1$ and some $k_D&gt;0$, it is shown that for each nonnegative and radially symmetric $u_0\in \bigcup_{q&gt;\max\{2,n\}} W^{1,q}(\Omega)$, a uniquely determined global bounded classical solution exists.
  This complements a previous result according to which given any positive $D\in C^3([0,\infty))$ fulfilling $D(\xi) \le K_D (\xi+1)^{-\alpha}$ with some $\alpha&gt;1$ and $K_D&gt;0$, one can find nonnegative radial initial data $u_0\in C_0^\infty(\Omega)$ such that no global solution exists.</description>

      <title>Threshold solutions for the $3d$ cubic INLS: the energy-subcritical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the work [L. Campos and J. Murphy, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 55 (2023), pp. 3807--3843], which classified the dynamics of $H^1$ solutions at the ground state threshold for cubic inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of the form $i\partial_t u + \Delta u + |x|^{-b}|u|^2 u = 0$ in the range $b\in(0,\tfrac12)$. By modifying the modulation analysis and using Strichartz estimates in place of pointwise bounds, we extend the result to the full energy-subcritical range $b\in(0,1)$. This strategy is expected to carry over to other dispersive equations with singular potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy-critical $3d$ cubic inhomogeneous NLS equation $i\partial_t u + \Delta u + |x|^{-1}|u|^2 u=0$. In this work, we prove the existence of special solutions $W^\pm$ with energy equal to that of the ground state $W$ and use these solutions to characterize the behavior of solutions at the ground state energy. The singular factor $|x|^{-1}$ in the nonlinearity significantly limits the smoothness of the ground state and prompts a novel approach to the modulation analysis.</description>

      <title>Diffusive synchronization of phase waves in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze synchronization of relaxation oscillations in multiple-timescale reaction-diffusion systems. Interpreting synchronization as convergence to frequency-synchronized wave-train solutions, we resolve for the first time the case of phase waves. These waves are nearly phase-synchronized relaxation oscillations, featuring quasistationary plateaus of length $\varepsilon^{-1}$ separated by fast transition layers, where $\varepsilon\ll1$ is the timescale separation parameter. Tracking the decay of modulations via a Bloch-wave eigenfunction analysis, we find a remarkably weak interaction strength of order $\varepsilon^{8/3}$. This weak layer interaction and many of the technical difficulties arise from repeated scattering of eigenfunctions through fold points at the ends of the quasistationary plateaus. We capture this by combining a novel geometric desingularization approach with Lin's method, exponential trichotomies, and the Riccati transform. While our spectral stability analysis yields diffusive synchronization of all phase waves in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, it also identifies potential finite-wavelength instabilities, which we realize in a system variant.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of a kinetic equation for mechanotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new kinetic equation for cell migration driven by mechanical interactions with the substrate, an effect not previously captured in kinetic models, and essential for explaining observed collective behaviors such as those in bacterial colonies. The model introduces an acceleration term that accounts for the dynamics of motile cells undergoing mechanotaxis, where extracellular signals modulate the forces arising from cell-substrate interactions. From this formulation, we derive a family of macroscopic limit equations and analyze their principal properties. In particular, we examine linear stability and pattern formation ability through theoretical analysis, supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On a class of Cauchy problems with applications in nonlinear partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and nonexistence of entire solutions to a general class of Cauchy problems in the positive half line. Our results provide a unified approach to proving sharp local and entire solvability of nonlinear partial differential equations in n-dimensional Euclidean space. As applications of the general framework, we present such results for two series of nonlinear equations: a series of k-Hessian type equations and a new series of P-k-Hessian type equations. These results are also proved for the more general p-Hessian matrices, with p &gt; 1, and degenerate non homogeneous terms.</description>

      <title>On the traces of harmonic functions $H^{1/2}$ and $H^{3/2}$ in Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the following estimate due to Dahlberg \cite{Dahl}. Let $\textit{\textbf x}_0$ a fixed point in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$. Then there exists a constant $C &gt; 0$ such that if $u$ is a harmonic function in $\Omega$ and vanishes at $\textit{\textbf x}_0$, then \begin{equation*} C^{-1} \Vert u \Vert_{L^2(\Gamma)} \leq \Big(\int_\Omega \varrho\vert \nabla u \vert^2\Big)^{1/2} \leq C \Vert u \Vert_{L^2(\Gamma)}, \end{equation*} where $\varrho$ is the distance to the boundary of $\Omega$. Using Grisvard's work and interpolation theory for subspaces, we complete the solvability of the inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem: $$ (\mathscr{L}_D^0)\ \ \ \ -\Delta u = f\quad \ \mbox{in}\ \Omega \quad \mbox{and } \quad u = 0 \ \ \mbox{on }\Gamma, $$ in a framework of fractional Sobolev spaces $H^s(\Omega)$, when $\Omega$ is a polygon or a polyhedron domain and $1/2 \leq s \leq 2$. Thanks to these regularity results and an explicit function given by Ne$\mathrm{\check{c}}$as, we show that the above inequalities cannot be valid in their current form. On the other hand, we identify a functional space which satisfies the embeddings $H^{1/2}_{00}(\Omega)\hookrightarrow E(\nabla;\, \Omega) \hookrightarrow H^{1/2}(\Omega)$ and the trace operator $\gamma_0$ from $E(\nabla;\, \Omega)$ into $L^2(\Gamma)$ is well-defined and continuous. This leads to an alternative to the functions $H^{1/2}(\Omega)$, non necessarily harmonic, for having a trace in $L^2(\Gamma)$ and also to a new characterization of $H^{1/2}_{00}(\Omega)$ as the kernel of this operator. However, we show that if the domain $\Omega$ is of class $\mathscr{C}^{1, 1}$, then the above inequalities are valid.</description>

      <title>Harnack-type inequalities for nonlinear evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnack inequalities are useful qualitative tools for understanding the properties of partial differential equations. Originally discovered as a property of harmonic functions, Harnack inequalities have since been studied for solutions of wider classes of elliptic and parabolic problems. In this monograph, we take particular interest in deriving Harnack inequalities for solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. We focus on exploring the methods introduced by Li and Yau in the case of the linear heat equation and later extended to nonlinear problems by Auchmuty and Bao. Prior to presenting these results, we study a minimisation problem, which appears naturally in the proofs. After establishing a family of three general Harnack inequality results by Auchmuty and Bao, we investigate applications to deriving Harnack inequalities satisfied by solutions of the porous medium equation and weak solutions of the parabolic problem associated with the $p$-Laplace operator, which we refer to here as the $p$-diffusion equation. Finally, we demonstrate a common application of Harnack inequalities by proving the local space-time H\"older continuity of solutions to a class of linear evolution problems. The proof is based on methods introduced by Moser during his seminal work on Harnack inequalities during the 1960s. We conclude by suggesting potential opportunities for future work following on from the topics discussed here.</description>

      <title>Identical Free Boundaries in two partially Segregated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare two singularly perturbed elliptic systems modeling partially phase segregation. Although the formulations are fundamentally different, we prove that their limiting configurations have identical free boundaries. The result shows that interface geometry depends only on basic structural properties of the limit segregation, harmonicity in positivity sets, and boundary data, while the limiting solution values may differ. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained ellipticity and De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove local boundedness and a Harnack inequality for nonnegative weak solutions of the equation $-\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{a}(x)\nabla u)=0$ under a coarse-grained ellipticity assumption on the symmetric coefficient field $\mathbf{a}$. Coarse-grained ellipticity is a scale-dependent condition, defined for fields with only $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{a}^{-1}\in L^1$, in terms of families of effective diffusion matrices on triadic cubes of all sizes, and our estimates depend quantitatively on a corresponding coarse-grained ellipticity ratio. We show that coarse-grained ellipticity can be enforced by purely negative Sobolev regularity hypotheses: if $\mathbf{a}\in L^1\cap W^{-s,p}(U)$ and $\mathbf{a}^{-1}\in L^1\cap W^{-t,q}(U)$ for exponents $p,q\in[1,\infty]$ and $s,t\in[0,1)$ satisfying $s&lt;1-\frac{1}{p}$, $t&lt;1-\frac{1}{q}$ and \[ \frac{s+t}{2} + \frac{d}{2}\Bigl(\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}\Bigr) &lt; 1, \] then $\mathbf{a}$ is coarse-grained elliptic in $U$ and every nonnegative solution satisfies a quantitative unit-scale Harnack inequality. In particular, when $s=t=0$ we recover Trudinger's classical result under the integrability condition $\mathbf{a}\in L^p$, $\mathbf{a}^{-1}\in L^q$ with $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}&lt;\frac{2}{d}$, and we obtain the sharp scaling of the Harnack constant in terms of $\|\mathbf{a}\|_{L^p}$ and $\|\mathbf{a}^{-1}\|_{L^q}$. More importantly, our criteria apply to new classes of degenerate and singular coefficient fields for which $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{a}^{-1}\notin L^{1+\delta}$ for all $\delta&gt;0$, including examples generated by singular fractal measures and Gaussian multiplicative chaos, beyond the reach of previous approaches based solely on integrability assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $n \geq 3$ and any closed manifold $\mathcal{N}$ with $\pi_{n+k}(\mathcal{N}) \neq \{0\}$ for some $k \geq 0$, we establish the existence of nontrivial $n$-harmonic maps from $\mathbb{S}^n$ into $\mathcal{N}$. When $k\geq 1$, these maps naturally appear as bubbling limits of $p$-harmonic maps with $p &gt; n$, obtained by min-max constructions in the limit $p \to n^+$.</description>

      <title>Stability and dynamics of planar fronts in reaction-diffusion systems under nonlocalized perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stability and dynamics of bistable planar fronts in multicomponent reaction-diffusion systems on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Under standard spectral stability assumptions, we establish Lyapunov stability of the front against fully nonlocalized perturbations. Such perturbations could previously be treated only for scalar equations via comparison principles. We also prove that the leading-order dynamics of the perturbed front are governed by a modulation that tracks the motion of the front interface and evolves according to a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This effective description reveals that asymptotic orbital stability does not hold in general. However, asymptotic stability can be recovered by imposing localization of perturbations in the transverse spatial directions. The treatment of nonlocalized perturbations on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ poses significant challenges, both at the linear and nonlinear level. At the linear level, the neutral translational mode gives rise to continuous spectrum which touches the origin and cannot be projected out by conventional means, resulting in merely algebraic decay rates for the residual. Our linear estimates are necessarily $L^{\infty}$-based, yielding significantly weaker decay rates than those available for $L^p$-localized perturbations. At the nonlinear level, quadratic gradient terms decay at a critical rate and cannot be treated perturbatively. We overcome these challenges by carefully decomposing the linearized dynamics, blending semigroup methods with ideas from the stability analysis of viscous shock waves, and introducing a novel nonlinear tracking scheme that combines spatiotemporal modulation with forcing techniques and the Cole-Hopf transform.</description>

      <title>Non-conservation of a generalized helicity in the Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $C^1_{t,x}$ solution $u$ to the incompressible 3D Euler equations, the helicity $H(u(t))=\int_{\mathbb{T}^3} u \cdot \textrm{curl}\, u$ is constant in time. For general low-regularity weak solutions, it is not always clear how to define the helicity, or whether it must be constant in time in the case that there is a clear definition. In this paper, we define a generalized helicity which extends the classical definitions and construct weak solutions of Euler of almost Onsager-critical regularity in $L^3$ with prescribed generalized helicity and kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Application of a profile decomposition theorem to elliptic equations with critical growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces new variational methods centered on the direct application of a profile decomposition theorem for bounded sequences in Sobolev spaces. We employ these methods to prove the existence of ground state solutions for a class of semilinear elliptic equations in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with critical Sobolev growth, set in an asymptotically periodic framework where the coefficients converge to periodic functions at infinity. Our approach successfully addresses highly general nonlinearities, including a subcritical term that does not need to satisfy the classical Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition and a critical term that extends far beyond the standard pure power assumption to include functions with oscillatory behavior. We prove the existence of ground states under two alternative conditions: either a strict energy gap between the minimax levels of the original and asymptotic problems or a direct energy comparison between the associated functionals. Some restrictive assumptions, such as specific decay rates for the coefficients or monotonicity properties of the nonlinearities, are not required in our results.</description>

      <title>A Unified Spectral Framework for Aging, Heterogeneous, and Distributed Order Systems via Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard fractional calculus has successfully modeled systems with power-law memory. However, complex phenomena in heterogeneous media often exhibit multi-scale memory effects and aging properties that classical operators cannot capture. In this work, we construct a unified framework by defining the \textit{Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators}. This formalism offers a fundamental generalization of fractional calculus, freeing the theory from the constraints of power-law memory (via Sonine kernels), time-translation invariance (via scale and weight functions), and artificial history truncation (via Weyl integration).
  The main result is a Generalized Spectral Mapping Theorem, proving that the Weighted Fourier Transform acts as a universal diagonalization map for these operators. We rigorously characterize the admissible memory kernels through the class of \textit{Complete Bernstein Functions}, ensuring that the resulting operators preserve the fundamental properties of positivity and monotonicity. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical bridge between the algebraic Sonine definition and the analytical Marchaud representation involving L\'evy measures.
  Finally, we apply this theory to solve generalized relaxation equations and \textit{Weighted Distributed Order} evolution problems, demonstrating that phenomena of ultra-slow diffusion and retarded aging can be treated explicitly within this unified spectral framework.</description>

      <title>Viscous Approximation of Optimal Control Problems Governed by Rate-Independent Systems with Non-Convex Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem governed by a rate-inde\-pendent system with non-convex energy. The state equation is approximated by means of viscous regularization w.r.t.\ to hierarchy of two different Hilbert spaces. The regularized problem corresponds to an optimal control problem subject to a non-smooth ODE in Hilbert space, which is substantially easier to solve than the original optimal control problem. The convergence properties of the viscous regularization are investigated. It is shown that every sequence of globally optimal solutions of the viscous problems admits a (weakly) converging subsequence whose limit is a globally optimal solution of the original problem, provided that the latter admits at least one optimal solution with an optimal state that is continuous in time.</description>

      <title>Combined effects of evaporation, sedimentation and solute crystallization on the dynamics of aerosol size distributions on multiple length and time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate three aspects of aerosol-mediated air-borne viral infection mechanisms on different length and time scales. First, we address the evolution of the size distribution of a non-interacting ensemble of droplets that are subject to evaporation and sedimentation using a sharp droplet-air interface model. From the exact solution of the evolution equation we derive the viral load in the air and show that it depends sensitively on the relative humidity. Secondly, from Molecular Dynamics simulations we extract the molecular reflection coefficient of single water molecules from the air-water interface. This parameter determines the water condensation and evaporation rate at a liquid droplet surface and therefore the evaporation rate of aqueous droplets. We find the reflection of water to be negligible at room temperature but to rise significantly at elevated temperatures and for grazing incidence angles. Thirdly, we derive a thermodynamically consistent three-dimensional diffuse-interface model for solute-containing droplets that is formulated as a three-phase Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn system. By numerically solving the coupled system of equations, we explore representative scenarios that show that this model reproduces and generalizes features of the sharp-interface model. These interconnected studies on the dynamics of aerosol droplet evaporation are relevant in order to quantitatively assess the airborne infection risk under varying environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>On a stochastic phase-field model of cell motility with singular diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study existence of solutions in the variational sense for a class of stochastic phase-field models describing moving boundary problems. The models consist of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with singular diffusion forced by a phase-field. We investigate both the case of an independently evolving phase-field and of coupled phase-field evolution driven by a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Such systems are used in the modelling of single-cell chemotaxis, where the contour of the cell shape corresponds to a level set of the phase-field. The technical challenge lies in the singularities at zero level sets of the phase-field. For large classes of initial data, we establish global existence of probabilistically weak solutions in $L^2$-spaces with weights which compensate for the singularities.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive central limit theorem for a class of driven diffusive systems at the critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large-scale behaviour of a class of driven diffusive systems modelled by a Stochastic Partial Differential Equation, the Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE) with general nonlinearity, at the critical dimension and in infinite volume. Our main result shows that, under a logarithmically superdiffusive space-time scaling, it is given by the same explicit Gaussian Fixed point obtained in [G. Cannizzaro, Q. Moulard, &amp; F. Toninelli, arxiv.org/abs/2501.00344, 2025] for the quadratic SBE, but with suitably renormalised coefficients, thereby rigorously justifying and partly correcting the classical Physics derivation of the SBE in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner, &amp; H. Spohn, Phys. Rev. Lett., 1986] based on Spohn's theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics. Besides, ours is the first universality-type result for out-of-equilibrium systems and the first extension of [M. Hairer, J. Quastel, Forum of Mathematics, Pi, Vol. 6, 2018, e3], to the critical dimension and beyond weak coupling. The major challenge in our work is the mild growth condition on the nonlinearity which renders even the well-posedness of the microscopic equation non-trivial. Additional key novelties include the derivation of fine estimates on the non-quadratic part of the generator as well as a new approximation for the resolvent associated to the solution of the quadratic SBE.</description>

      <title>Refined uniqueness results for 2D Euler and gSQG with rough Kraichnan noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove strong well-posedness results for the stochastic 2D Euler equations in vorticity form and generalized SQG equations, with $L^p$ initial data and driven by a spatially rough, incompressible transport noise of Kraichnan type. Previous works addressed this problem with noise of spatial regularity $\alpha\in (0,1/2)$, in a setting where a rougher noise yields a stronger regularization. We remove this limitation by allowing any $\alpha \in (0,1)$, covering the same range of parameters for which anomalous regularization effects are known to occur in passive scalars. In particular, this covers the physically relevant case $\alpha=2/3$, associated with the Richardson-Kolmogorov scaling of energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Landau damping and survival threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the linearized Vlasov-Poisson system near general spatially homogenous equilibria $\mu(\frac12|v|^2)$ with connected support on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3_x \times \mathbb{R}^3_v$ or on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3_x \times \mathbb{R}^3_v$, including those that are non-monotone. The problem can be solved completely mode by mode for each spatial wave number, and their longtime dynamics is intimately tied to the ``survival threshold'' of wave numbers computed by $$\kappa_0^2 = 4\pi \int_0^\Upsilon \frac{u^2\mu(\frac12 u^2)}{\Upsilon^2-u^2} \;du$$ where $\Upsilon$ is the maximal speed of particle velocities. It is shown that purely oscillatory electric fields exist and obey a Klein-Gordon's type dispersion relation for wave numbers below { and up to} the threshold, thus rigorously confirming the existence of Langmuir's oscillatory waves { for a non-trivial range of spatial frequencies in this linearized setting}. At the threshold, the phase velocity of these oscillatory waves enters the range of admissible particle velocities, namely there are particles that move at the same propagation speed of the waves. It is this exact resonant interaction between particles and the oscillatory fields that causes the waves to be damped, classically known as Landau damping. Landau's law of decay is explicitly computed and is sensitive to the decaying rate of the background equilibria. The faster it decays at the maximal velocity, the weaker Landau damping is. Beyond the threshold, the electric fields are a perturbation of those generated by the free transport dynamics and thus decay rapidly fast due to the phase mixing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory for self-adjoint Dirac operators with periodic potentials and inverse scattering transform for the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse spectral theory for a self-adjoint one-dimensional Dirac operator associated periodic potentials is formulated via a Riemann-Hilbert problem approach. The resulting formalism is also used to solve the initial value problem for the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. A uniqueness theorem for the solutions of the Riemann-Hilbert problem is established, which provides a new method for obtaining the potential from the spectral data. Two additional, scalar Riemann-Hilbert problems are also formulated that provide conditions for the periodicity in space and time of the solution generated by arbitrary sets of spectral data. The formalism applies for both finite-genus and infinite-genus potentials. The formalism also shows that only a single set of Dirichlet eigenvalues is needed in order to uniquely reconstruct the potential of the Dirac operator and the corresponding solution of the defocusing NLS equation, in contrast with the representation of the solution of the NLS equation via the finite-genus formalism, in which two different sets of Dirichlet eigenvalues are used.</description>

Abstract: Our motivation is to consider an electromagnetic Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_q$, depending on a parameter such that, for $q=1$ it corresponds to the Born-Infeld Lagrangian density and for $q=2$ it restores the Maxwell one. The model in the presence of given charge and current densities is investigated. We solve the pure magnetostatic problem for $q\in(6/5,2)$. We also study the electrostatic problem in the presence of an assigned magnetic field for $q\in[1,2)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer of energy to high frequencies in a quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation with sublinear dispersion, on the one dimensional torus. We exhibit initial data undergoing finite but arbitrary large Sobolev norm explosion: their initial norm is arbitrary small in Sobolev spaces of high regularity, but at a later time becomes arbitrary large. We develop a novel mechanism producing instability, which is based on extracting, via paradifferential normal forms, an effective equation driving the dynamics whose leading term is a non-trivial transport operator with non-constant coefficients. We prove that such operator is responsible for energy cascades via a positive commutator estimate inspired by Mourre's commutator theory.</description>

      <title>Stochastic interpretations of the oceanic primitive equations with relaxed hydrostatic assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how weakening the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis impacts the well-posedness of the stochastic LU primitive equations. The models we consider are intermediate between the incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and the LU primitive equations with standard hydrostatic balance. As such, they are expected to be numerically tractable, while accounting well for phenomena within the grey zone between hydrostatic balance and non-hydrostatic processes. Our main result is the well-posedness of a low-pass filtering-based stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations, with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, in the limit of ``quasi-barotropic'' flow. This assumption is linked to the structure assumption proposed in the work of Agresti et al., which can be related to the dynamical regime where the primitive equations remain valid. Furthermore, we present and study two eddy-(hyper)viscosity-based models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system, where the speed of light $c$ is an arbitrary constant no less than 1, and we establish global existence and nonlinear stability of the vacuum for small initial data, with bounds that are uniform in $c$. The analysis is based on the vector field method combined with the Glassey-Strauss decomposition of the electromagnetic field, and does not require any compact support assumption on the initial data. A key ingredient of the proof is the derivation of a chain rule for the relativistic Boltzmann collision operator that is compatible with the commutation properties of the vector fields. These tools allow us to control the coupled kinetic and electromagnetic equations and to obtain global stability near vacuum.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for stochastic Galerkin approximations of elliptic random PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers stochastic Galerkin approximations of linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with stochastic forcing terms and stochastic diffusion coefficients, that cannot be bounded uniformly away from zero and infinity. A traditional numerical method for solving the resulting high-dimensional coupled system of PDEs is replaced by deep learning techniques. In order to achieve this, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which typically operate on the strong residual of the PDE and can therefore be applied in a wide range of settings, are considered. As a second approach, the Deep Ritz method, which is a neural network that minimizes the Ritz energy functional to find the weak solution, is employed. While the second approach only works in special cases, it overcomes the necessity of testing in variational problems while maintaining mathematical rigor and ensuring the existence of a unique solution. Furthermore, the residual is of a lower differentiation order, reducing the training cost considerably. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on several model problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This contribution provides numerical experiments for a finite volume scheme for an approximation of the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The approximation is done by a Yosida approximation of the subdifferential operator. The problem is set on a polygonal bounded domain in two or three dimensions. The non-linear character of the projection term induces challenges to implement the scheme. To this end, we provide a splitting method for the finite volume scheme. We show that the splitting method is accurate. The computational error estimates induce that the squared $L^2$-error w.r.t. time is of order $1$ as long as the noise term is small enough. For larger noise terms the order of convergence w.r.t. time might become worse.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we propose and investigate a multi-dimensional opinion dynamics model where people are characterised by both opinions and importance weights across these opinions. Opinion changes occur through binary interactions, with a novel coupling mechanism: the change in one topic depends on the weighted similarity across the full opinion vector. We state the kinetic equation for this process and derive its mean-field partial differential equation to describe the overall dynamics. Analytical computations and numerical simulations confirm that this model generates complex stationary states, and we demonstrate that the final opinion structures are critically determined by the peoples' opinion weights.</description>
