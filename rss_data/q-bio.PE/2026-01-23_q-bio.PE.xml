      <title>Final size of a structured SIRD Model with active-population force of infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a SIRD epidemic model for a population composed of two groups of individuals with asymmetric interactions, where the force of infection depends on the active (alive) population in each group, rather than on the total population, as in the classical formulation. We prove that the final state for susceptible individuals is always positive and characterize it as the unique fixed point of a map. We also relate the final size to the basic reproduction number and show that the final number of susceptibles decreases when transmission rates increase. Numerical simulations compare the active-population and classical two-group SIRD models, showing differences in final size and the occurrence of multiple epidemic waves. The convergence of the fixed point approach is also illustrated.</description>

      <title>A computation of maximum likelihood for 4-states-triplets under Jukes-Cantor and MC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ChorHendySnir2006 evolutionary model, which consists of a rooted phylogenetic tree with three leaves, subject to the Jukes--Cantor (JC69) molecular evolutionary model and molecular clock. We show that the likelihood function associated with this model has a unique maximum which depends analytically of the parameters (as it was conjectured in ChorHendySnir2006), assuming that these parameters verify some very precise inequalities; some of which arise naturally from the model. With a typical argument of differential topology we reduce the proof to answer a question of algebra, very simple, although computationally involved, that we solve using some Maple libraries. We are very indebted to Marta Casanellas, who presented the problem to us and gave us the first insights on it.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Population Dynamics from the Continuous McKendrick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive study of the continuous McKendrick model, which serves as a foundational framework in population dynamics and epidemiology. The model is formulated through partial differential equations that describe the temporal evolution of the age distribution of a population using continuously defined birth and death rates. In this work, we provide rigorous derivations of the renewal equation, establish the appropriate boundary conditions, and perform a detailed analysis of the survival functions. The central result demonstrates that the population approaches extinction if and only if the net reproduction number $R_{n}$ is strictly less than unity. We present two independent proofs: one based on Laplace transform techniques and Tauberian theorems, and another employing a reformulation as a system of ordinary differential equations with eigenvalue analysis. Additionally, we establish the connection between the deterministic framework and stochastic process formulations, showing that the McKendrick equation emerges as the fluid limit of an individual-based stochastic model.</description>

      <title>A phenotype-structured mathematical model for the influence of hypoxia on oncolytic virotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy is significantly affected by several elements of the tumour microenvironment, which reduce the ability of the virus to infect cancer cells. In this work, we focus on the influence of hypoxia on this therapy and develop a novel continuous mathematical model that considers both the spatial and epigenetic heterogeneity of the tumour. We investigate how oxygen gradients within tumours affect the spatial distribution and replication of both the tumour and oncolytic viruses, focusing on regions of severe hypoxia versus normoxic areas. Additionally, we analyse the evolutionary dynamics of tumour cells under hypoxic conditions and their influence on susceptibility to viral infection. Our findings show that the reduced metabolic activity of hypoxic cells may significantly impact the virotherapy effectiveness; the knowledge of the tumour's oxygenation could, therefore, suggest the most suitable type of virus to optimise the outcome. The combination of numerical simulations and theoretical results for the model equilibrium values allows us to elucidate the complex interplay between viruses, tumour evolution and oxygen dynamics, ultimately contributing to developing more effective and personalised cancer treatments.</description>

      <title>Where do We Poop? City-Wide Simulation of Defecation Behavior for Wastewater-Based Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wastewater surveillance, which regularly examines the pathogen biomarkers in wastewater samples, is a valuable tool for monitoring infectious diseases circulating in communities. Yet, most wastewater-based epidemiology methods, which use wastewater surveillance results for disease inferences, implicitly assume that individuals excrete only at their residential locations and that the population contribute to wastewater samples are static. These simplifying assumptions ignore daily mobility, social interactions, and heterogeneous toilet use behavior patterns, which can lead to biased interpretation of wastewater results, especially at upstream sampling locations such as neighborhoods, institutions, or buildings. Here, we introduce an agent-based geospatial simulation framework: Building on an established Patterns of Life model, we simulate daily human activities, mobility, and social contacts within a realistic urban environment and extend this agent-based framework with a physiologically motivated defecation cycle and toilet usage patterns. We couple this behavioral model with an infectious disease model to simulate transmissions through spatial and social interactions. When a defecation occurs for an infected agent, we use a pathogen shedding model to determine the amount of pathogen shed in the feces. Such a framework, integrating population mobility, disease transmission, toilet use behavior, and pathogen shedding models, is capable to simulate the Spatial-temporal dynamics of wastewater signals for a city. Using a case study of 10,000 simulated agents in Fulton County, Georgia, we examine how varying infection rates alter epidemic trajectories, pathogen loads in wastewater, and the spatial distribution of contamination across time.</description>
