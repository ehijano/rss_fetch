      <title>The role of self-adjoint extensions in the bulk-edge correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of self-adjoint extensions in the bulk-edge correspondence for topological insulators. While the correspondence is well understood in discrete models with spectral gaps, complications arise in the presence of unbounded Hamiltonians and varying boundary conditions, leading to anomalous behavior that has recently been dubbed violations of bulk-edge correspondence. In this work we use a K-theoretic framework to identify precise conditions needed for unbounded Hamiltonians to be affiliated to the respective observable algebras and define K-theory classes. In special cases we can then exclude anomalous behaviour and obtain the standard bulk-edge correspondence, or, under weaker conditions, obtain a relative bulk-edge correspondence theorem, which compares pairs of Hamiltonians. Applying that relative approach in the bulk we recover among other things the so-called bulk-difference-interface correspondence for Hamiltonians that fail to define a bulk K-theory class in the conventional way. The second main result is that one can define K-theory classes in terms of von Neumann unitaries, which under changes in boundary conditions directly contribute to the number of protected edge states. This approach clarifies apparent violations of the classical bulk-edge paradigm and provides a systematic account of boundary-induced topological corrections.</description>

      <title>Entropy for a class of micro-economic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chater and MacKay [CM] derived an entropy function of state for exchange economies satisfying a list of axioms, and showed that a change of state of a system of such economies is possible if and only if their total entropy does not decrease. In this paper, a large class of agent-based models is proved to satisfy the axioms in the thermodynamic limit, and the entropy is shown to be the logarithm of the partition function for their stationary distributions.</description>

      <title>Free-energy variations for determinantal 2D plasmas with holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Gibbs equilibrium of a classical 2D Coulomb gas in the determinantal case = 2. The external potential is the sum of a quadratic term and the potential generated by individual charges pinned in several extended groups. This leads to an equilibrium measure (droplet) with flat density and macroscopic holes. We consider ''correlation energy'' (free energy minus its mean-field approximation) expansions, for large particle number . Under the assumptions that the holes are sufficiently small, separated, and far from the droplet's outer boundary, we prove that (i) the correlation energy up to order 1 is independent of the holes' locations and orientations, and (ii) the difference between the correlation energies of systems differing by their number of holes involves ''topological'' O(log N ) and O (1) terms.</description>

      <title>Waves, structures, and the Riemann problem for a system of hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of hyperbolic conservation laws $$ \partial_t u + \partial_x \partial_u Q = 0, \quad
  Q = u_1^3 / 3 + u_1 u_2^2, \qquad
  u = u(x,t) \in\mR^2, $$ as well as its viscous regularization $$
  \partial_t u + \partial_x \partial_u Q = \calM \partial_x^2 u, \qquad
  \calM = \diag (\mu_1,\mu_2), \quad \mu_1&gt;0,\, \mu_2&gt;0, $$ are studied. It is assumed that admissible shocks are those that satisfy the requirement of existence of a structure (the traveling wave criterion). A solution of the Riemann problem is constructed that consists of rarefaction waves and shocks with structure. Depending on the conditions imposed at $\pm\infty$, the solution also contains undercompressive shocks and Jouguet waves.</description>

      <title>The g-2 in the neutral Electroweak model with cutoff: convergent expansion, RG and the Jackiw-Weinberg formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of the anomalous gyromagnetic factor of the electron, started with the evaluation of the electromagnetic contribution by Schwinger (1948) and of the weak contribution by Jackiw and Weinberg (1972), is one of the major successes of Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model. The results obtained truncating the series are in spectacular agreement with experiments. Yet, a mathematical justification and an estimate of the truncation error are problematic, being such series diverging and not asymptotic to any QFT. For a non perturbative result, one has to consider the Standard Model as an effective theory valid up to certain energy scales. In this paper we consider the neutral sector of the Electroweak model with a momentum cutoff; we rigorously prove that the anomalous gyromagnetic factor in the effective regularized theory coincides with the Jackiw-Weinberg result, obtained by the truncation of the formal expansion with no cutoffs (whose sum is not expected to exist), up to a regularization-dependent correction which is subdominant in the weak coupling regime if the cutoff is smaller than the inverse coupling and larger than the boson mass. The proof is based on a convergent expansions and Renormalization Group (RG) methods; cancellations based on exact and approximated symmetries are needed to get lowest order dominance.</description>

      <title>The noncommutative KP hierarchy and its solution via descent algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the solution to the complete noncommutative Kadomtsev--Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy. We achieve this via direct linearisation which involves the Gelfand--Levitan--Marchenko (GLM) equation. This is a linear integral equation in which the scattering data satisfies the linearised KP hierarchy. The solution to the GLM equation is then shown to coincide with the solution to the noncommutative KP hierarchy. We achieve this using two approaches. In the first approach we use the standard Sato-Wilson dressing transformation. In the second approach, which was pioneered by Poppe, we assume the scattering data is semi-additive and by direct substitution, we show that the solution to the GLM equation satisfies the infinite set of field equations representing the noncommutative KP hierarchy. This approach relies on the augmented pre-Poppe algebra. This is a representative algebra that underlies the field equations representing the hierarchy. It is nonassociative and isomorphic to a descent algebra equipped with a grafting product. While we perform computations in the nonassociative descent algebra, the final result which establishes the solution to the complete hierarchy, resides in the natural associative subalgebra. The advantages of this second approach are that it is constructive, explicit, highlights the underlying combinatorial structures within the hierarchy, and reveals the mechanisms underlying the solution procedure.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping supersymmetric (matrix) quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the quantum-mechanics bootstrap to supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) and to its matrix relative, the Marinari-Parisi model, which is conjectured to describe the worldvolume of unstable $D0$ branes. Using positivity of moment matrices together with Heisenberg, gauge, and (zero-temperature) thermal constraints, we obtain rigorous bounds on ground-state data. In the cases where SUSY is spontaneously broken, we find bounds that apply to the lowest-energy normalizable eigenstate.
  For $N = 1$ SUSY QM with a cubic superpotential, we obtain tight bounds that agree well with available approximation methods. At weak coupling they match well with the semiclassical instanton contribution to SUSY-breaking ground-state energy, while at strong coupling they exhibit the expected scaling and match well with Hamiltonian truncation.
  For the SUSY matrix QM, we construct a $44 \times 44$ bootstrap matrix and obtain bounds at large $N$. At strong coupling, we obtain the expected $E \sim \kappa \ g^{2/3}$ scaling of $E$ with $g$ and extract a lower bound on the coefficient $\kappa &gt; .196$. At small coupling, the theory has a critical point $g_c$ where the two wells merge into one. We find a spurious kink at $g = \sqrt{2} g_c$. We attribute this to truncation error and solver limitations, and discuss possible improvements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</description>

      <title>Zero-free regions for the independence polynomial on restricted graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalising the Heilman-Lieb Theorem from statistical physics, Chudnovsky and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 97(3):350--357] showed that the univariate independence polynomial of any claw-free graph has all of its zeros on the negative real line. In this paper, we show that for any fixed subdivded claw $H$ and any $\Delta$, there is an open set $F \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ containing $[0, \infty)$ such that the independence polynomial of any $H$-free graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ has all of its zeros outside of $F$. We also show that no such result can hold when $H$ is any graph other than a subdivided claw or if we drop the maximum degree condition.
  We also establish zero-free regions for the multivariate independence polynomial of $H$-free graphs of bounded degree when $H$ is a subdivided claw. The statements of these results are more subtle, but are again best possible in various senses.</description>

      <title>Correlation estimates for Brownian particles with singular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study particle systems with singular pairwise interactions and non-vanishing diffusion in the mean-field scaling. A classical approach to describing corrections to mean-field behavior is through the analysis of correlation functions. For bounded interactions, the optimal estimates on correlations are well known: the $m$-particle correlation function is $G_{N,m}=O(N^{1-m})$ for all $m$. Such estimates, however, have remained out of reach for more singular interactions. In this work, we develop a new framework based on linearized correlation functions, which allows us to derive robust bounds for systems with merely square-integrable interaction kernels, providing the first systematic control of correlations in the singular setting. Although at first not optimal, our estimates can be partially refined a posteriori using the BBGKY hierarchy: in the case of bounded interactions, our method recovers the known optimal estimates with a simplified argument. As key applications, we establish the validity of the Bogolyubov correction to mean field and prove a central limit theorem for the empirical measure, extending these results beyond the bounded interaction regime for the first time.</description>

      <title>Weyl double copy in bimetric massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weyl double copy formalism, which relates the Weyl spinor with the square of the field strength, is studied in the context of Hassan-Rosen bigravity for stationary and time-dependent solutions. We consider the dyonic Kerr-Newman-(A)dS solution and the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski metric in the context of bigravity. These solutions are studied in the Weyl double copy both with matter independently coupled and show that no massive modes are present in the Weyl spinor. The equations of motion for the gauge and scalar fields are those of Maxwell equations coupled to an external source, and massless Klein-Gordon equations with a conformal curvature term and an external source, all of them consistent with general relativity. For wave solutions, massive modes are manifest in the Weyl spinor and a formulation in bigravity for these massive modes is proposed. The resulting equations of motion are Proca equations with a conformal term and massive Klein-Gordon equations. In the case of the matter contributions for waves, we show how the resonance mass is present in equations of motion of the fields obtained from the Weyl double copy. The solutions studied are written in a Kerr-Schild form, connecting with the Kerr-Schild double copy.</description>

      <title>Directionality and quantum backfire in continuous-time quantum walks from delocalized states: Exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive analytical results for continuous-time quantum walks from a new class of initial states with tunable delocalization. The dynamics are governed by a Hamiltonian with complex hopping amplitudes. We provide closed-form equations for key observables, revealing three notable findings: (1) the emergence of directed quantum transport from completely unbiased initial conditions; (2) a quantum backfire effect, where greater initial delocalization enhances short-time spreading but counterintuitively induces a comparatively smaller long-time spreading after a crossing time $t_{\mathrm{cross}}$; and (3) an exact characterization of survival probability, showing that the transition to an enhanced $t^{-3}$ decay is a fine-tuned effect. Our work establishes a comprehensive framework for controlling quantum transport through the interplay between intermediate initial delocalization and Hamiltonian phase.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a coordinate- and foliation-independent Heisenberg-type lower bound for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r$ on spacelike hypersurfaces of arbitrary spacetimes (with matter and a cosmological constant). The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p\,r \ge \hbar/2$, whose constant is optimal and never attained (Corollary). This result abstracts and extends the framework recently introduced for black-hole slices in [10].</description>

      <title>A variational formulation of stochastic thermodynamics. Part I: Finite-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a variational foundation for stochastic thermodynamics of finite-dimensional, continuous-time systems. Requiring the second law (non-negative average total entropy production) systematically yields a consistent thermodynamic structure, from which novel generalized fluctuation-dissipation relations emerge naturally, ensuring local detailed balance. This principle extends key results of stochastic thermodynamics including an individual trajectory level description of both configurational and thermal variables and fluctuation theorems in an extended thermodynamic phase space. It applies to both closed and open systems, while accommodating state-dependent parameters, nonlinear couplings between configurational and thermal degrees of freedom, and cross-correlated noise consistent with Onsager symmetry. This is achieved by establishing a unified geometric framework in which stochastic thermodynamics emerges from a generalized Lagrange-d'Alembert principle, building on the variational structure introduced by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura [Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 381, 2256 (2023)]. Irreversible and stochastic forces are incorporated through nonlinear nonholonomic constraints, with entropy treated as an independent dynamical variable. This work provides a novel approach for thermodynamically consistent modeling of stochastic systems, and paves the way to applications in continuum systems such as active and complex fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a reformulation of the problem of optimally controlled transitions in stochastic thermodynamics. We impose that any terminal cost specified by a thermodynamic functional should depend only on state variables and not on control protocols, according to the canonical Bolza form. In this way, we can unambiguously discriminate between transitions at minimum dissipation between genuine equilibrium states, and transitions at minimum work driving a system from a genuine equilibrium to a non-equilibrium state. For underdamped dynamics subject to a mechanical force, genuine equilibrium means a Maxwell-Boltzmann probability distribution defining a vanishing current velocity. Transitions at minimum dissipation between equilibria are a model of optimal swift engineered equilibration. Remarkably, we show that transitions at minimum work do not directly imply explicit boundary conditions on terminal values of parameters of the mechanical force and on control protocols. Thus, the problem often discussed in the literature, that optimal protocols need terminal jumps to satisfy boundary conditions, completely disappears. The quantitative properties of optimal controls are entirely determined by the form of the penalty modelling an experimental setup. More generally, we use centre manifold theory to analytically account for the tendency of optimal controls to exhibit a turnpike property: optimal protocols in the bulk of the control horizon tend to converge to a universal centre manifold determined only by the running cost. Exponential deviations from the centre manifold occur at the ends of the control horizon in order to satisfy the boundary conditions. Our findings are supported numerically.</description>

      <title>Erdos-Turan photonic Ising machines with record-high coupling resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as promising platforms for efficiently tackling a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems relevant to resource allocation, statistical inference and deep learning, yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by the coarse resolution of spin-spin couplings (Jij). Current implementations, relying on direct modulation of physical parameters, achieve at most 256 discrete coupling levels, which severely hinder the faithfully modeling of arbitrary real-valued interactions in realistic applications. Here we present a novel photonic Ising machine that encodes spins in random lattices while programming couplings in the momentum space of light. By introducing the Sidon set-a mathematical structure ensuring pairwise difference uniqueness - and employing the Erdos-Turan bound, we establish an optical framework in which each spin pair can be assigned a unique Jij. This approach decouples the resolution limit from hardware modulation to the spatial precision in the momentum space of light. Experimentally, we demonstrate a record-high coupling resolution of 7,038 on a simple photonic platform, surpassing previous Ising machines. Our results highlight the power of uniting discrete mathematics with momentum-space photonics, paving the way toward scalable Ising machines capable of faithfully modeling real-world optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Global forms of $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories and non-minimal Seiberg-Witten solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To each four dimensional $\mathcal{N}\geq 2$ supersymmetric quantum field theory, one can associate an algebraic completely integrable (ACI) system that encodes the low energy dynamics of theory. In this paper we explicitly derive the appropriate ACI systems for the global forms of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (sYM) using isogenies of polarised abelian varieties. In doing so, we relate the complex moduli of the resulting varieties to the exactly marginal coupling of the theory, thus allowing us to probe the $S$-duality groups of the global forms. Finally, we comment on whether the resulting varieties are the Jacobians of a minimal genus Riemann surface, coming to the conclusion that many global forms of $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM do not admit a minimal genus Seiberg-Witten curve that correctly reproduces the global form.</description>

      <title>Quiver Yangian algebras associated to Dynkin diagrams of A-type and their rectangular representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between simple Lie algebras and their Yangian algebras has a long history. In this work, we construct finite-dimensional representations of Yangian algebras $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{sl}_{n})$ using the quiver approach. Starting from quivers associated to Dynkin diagrams of type A, we construct a family of quiver Yangians. We show that the quiver description of these algebras enables an effective construction of representations with a single non-zero Dynkin label. For these representations, we provide an explicit construction using the equivariant integration over the corresponding quiver moduli spaces. The resulting states admit a crystal description and can be identified with the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n}$ algebras. Finally, we show that the resulting Yangians possess notable algebraic properties, and the algebras are isomorphic to their alternative description known as the second Drinfeld realization.</description>

      <title>On Lieb-Thirring inequalities for multidimensional Schr\"odinger operators with complex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the open problem by Demuth, Hansmann, and Katriel announced in [Integr. Equ. Oper. Theory 75 (2013), 1-5] by a counter-example construction. The problem concerns a possible generalisation of the Lieb-Thirring inequality for Schr\"odinger operators in to the case of complex-valued potentials. A counter-example has already been found for the one-dimensional case by the first and third authors in [J. Spectr. Theory 11 (2021), 1391-1413]. Here we generalise the counter-example to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative multiple bi-orthogonal polynomials: formal approach and integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the non-commutative multiple bi-orthogonal polynomial systems, which simultaneously generalize the concepts of multiple orthogonality, matrix orthogonal polynomials and of the bi-orthogonality. We present quasideterminantal expressions for such polynomial systems in terms of formal bi-moments. The normalization functions for such monic polynomials satisfy the non-commutative Hirota equations, while the polynomials provide solution of the corresponding linear system. This shows, in particular, that our polynomial systems form a part of the theory of integrable systems. We study also a specialization of the problem to non-commutative multiple orthogonal polynomials, what results in the corresponding Hankel-type quasideterminantal expressions in terms of the moments. Moreover, such a reduction allows to introduce in a standard way the discrete-time variable and gives rise to an integrable system which is non-commutative version of the multidimensional discrete-time Toda equations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Lieb-Thirring type inequalities for Schr\"odinger and Jacobi operators with complex potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove optimal Lieb-Thirring type inequalities for Schr\"odinger and Jacobi operators with complex potentials. Our results bound eigenvalue power sums (Riesz means) by the $L^p$ norm of the potential, where in contrast to the self-adjoint case, each term needs to be weighted by a function of the ratio of the distance of the eigenvalue to the essential spectrum and the distance to the endpoint(s) thereof. Our Lieb-Thirring type bounds only hold for integrable weight functions. To prove optimality, we establish divergence estimates for non-integrable weight functions. The divergence rates exhibit a logarithmic or even polynomial gain compared to semiclassical methods (Weyl asymptotics) for real potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the asymptotic behaviors of the transition probability for two-level avoided crossings are studied under the limit where two parameters (adiabatic parameter and energy gap parameter) tend to zero. This is a continuation of our previous works where avoided crossings are generated by tangential intersections and obey a non-adiabatic regime. The main results elucidate not only the asymptotic expansion of transition probability but also a quantum interference caused by several avoided crossings and a coexistence of two-parameter regimes arising from different vanishing orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization of the determinant appears in particle physics in effective Lagrangian interaction terms that model the chiral anomaly in Quantum Chromodynamics (PRD 97 (2018) 9, 091901 PRD 109 (2024) 7, L071502), in particular in connection to mesons. This \textit{polydeterminant function}, known in the mathematical literature as a mixed discriminant, associates $N$ distinct $N\times N$ complex matrices into a complex number and reduces to the usual determinant when all matrices are taken as equal. Here, we explore the main properties of the polydeterminant applied to (quantum) fields by using a formalism and a language close to high-energy physics approaches. We discuss its use as a tool to write down novel chiral anomalous Lagrangian terms and present an explicit illustrative model for mesons. Finally, the extension of the polydeterminant as a function of tensors is shown.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the asymptotic dynamics of solutions to the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation, with a specific focus on ship roll stability in dynamic sea conditions. Utilizing a fourth-order filter, we conduct a thorough analysis of the time evolution of the probability distributions for roll angles, roll speeds, and roll excitations. Our theoretical framework provides new insights into the long-term behavior of these systems, emphasizing the role of stochastic perturbations. Key findings reveal that the probability of capsizing remains constant over time, offering significant contributions to the stability assessment of maritime vessels under uncertain environmental conditions. This work paves the way for more robust models in maritime engineering and dynamic stability analysis.</description>

Abstract: A bootstrap program is presented for algebraically solving the $R$-matrix of a generic integrable quantum spin chain from its Hamiltonian. The Yang-Baxter equation contains an infinite number of seemingly independent constraints on the operator valued coefficients in the expansion of the $R$-matrices with respect to their spectral parameters, with the lowest order one being the Reshetikhin condition. These coefficients can be solved iteratively using Kennedy's inversion formula, which reconstructs the $R$-matrix after an infinite number of steps. For a generic Hamiltonian, the procedure could fail at any step, making the conditions useful as an integrability test. However in all known examples they all turn out to be satisfied whenever the lowest order condition is. It remains to be understood whether they are all implied by the Reshetikhin condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Macdonald operator is known to coincide with a certain element of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra in the Fock representation of levels $(1,0)$. A generalization of this operator to higher levels $(r,0)$ can be built using the coproduct structure, it is diagonalized by the generalized Macdonald symmetric functions, indexed by $r$-tuple partitions and depending on $r$ alphabets. In this paper, we extend to the generalized case some of the known formulas obeyed by ordinary Macdonald symmetric functions, such as the $e_1$-Pieri rule or the identity relating them to Whittaker vectors obtained by Garsia, Haiman, and Tesler. We also propose a generalization of the five-term relation, and the Fourier/Hopf pairing. In addition, we prove the factorized expression of the generalized Macdonald kernel conjectured previously by Zenkevich.</description>

      <title>Effective eigenvalue approximation from moments for self-adjoint trace-class operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral properties of bounded linear operators play a crucial role in several areas of mathematics and physics. For each self-adjoint, trace-class operator $O$ we define a set $\Lambda_n\subset \mathbb{R}$, and we show that it converges to the spectrum of $O$ in the Hausdorff metric under mild conditions. Our set $\Lambda_n$ only depends on the first $n$ moments of $O$. We show that it can be effectively calculated for physically relevant operators, and it approximates the spectrum well without diagonalization.
  We prove that using the above method we can converge to the minimal and maximal eigenvalues with super-exponential speed.
  We also construct monotone increasing lower bounds $q_n$ for the minimal eigenvalue (or decreasing upper bounds for the maximal eigenvalue). This sequence only depends on the moments of $O$ and a concrete upper estimate of its $1$-norm; we also demonstrate that $q_n$ can be effectively calculated for a large class of physically relevant operators. This rigorous lower bound $q_n$ tends to the minimal eigenvalue with super-exponential speed provided that $O$ is not positive semidefinite. As a by-product, we obtain computable upper bounds for the $1$-norm of $O$, too.
  Numerical examples demonstrate the relevance of our approximation in estimating entropy and negativity, which is useful, among others, in quantum optical and in open quantum system models. The results can be directly applicable to problems in quantum information, statistical mechanics, and quantum thermodynamics, where using traditional techniques based on diagonalization is impractical.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between quantum error correcting codes and quantum reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a gauge theory, a collection of kinematical degrees of freedom is used to redundantly describe a smaller amount of gauge-invariant information. In a quantum error correcting code (QECC), a collection of computational degrees of freedom that make up a device's physical layer is used to redundantly encode a smaller amount of logical information. We elaborate this parallel in terms of quantum reference frames (QRFs), which are a universal toolkit for dealing with symmetries in quantum systems and which define the gauge theory analog of encodings. The result is a precise dictionary between QECCs and QRF setups within the perspective-neutral framework for gauge systems. Concepts from QECCs like error sets and correctability translate to novel insights into the informational architecture of gauge theories. Conversely, the dictionary provides a systematic procedure for constructing symmetry-based QECCs and characterizing their error correcting properties. In this initial work, we scrutinize the dictionary between Pauli stabilizer codes and their corresponding QRF setups. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal correctable error sets and tensor factorizations splitting system from error-generated QRF degrees of freedom. Relative to this split, errors corrupt only redundant frame data, leading to a novel characterization of correctability. When passed through the dictionary, standard Pauli errors behave as electric excitations that are dual, via Pontryagin duality, to magnetic excitations related to gauge-fixing. This gives rise to a new class of correctable errors and a systematic error duality. We illustrate our findings in surface codes, which themselves connect quantum error correction with gauge systems. Our exploratory investigations pave the way for foundational applications to gauge theories and for eventual practical applications to quantum simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commutative analogues of Clifford algebras are algebras defined in the same way as Clifford algebras except that their generators commute with each other, in contrast to Clifford algebras in which the generators anticommute. In this paper, we solve the problem of finding multiplicative inverses in commutative analogues of Clifford algebras by introducing a matrix representation for these algebras and the notion of determinant in them. We give a criteria for checking if an element has a multiplicative inverse or not and, for the first time, explicit formulas for multiplicative inverses in the case of arbitrary dimension. The new theorems involve only operations of conjugation and do not involve matrix operations. We also consider notions of trace and other characteristic polynomial coefficients and give explicit formulas for them without using matrix representations.</description>

      <title>A Simple and General Equation for Matrix Product Unitary Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix Product Unitaries (MPUs) have emerged as essential tools for representing locality-preserving 1D unitary operators, with direct applications to quantum cellular automata and quantum phases of matter. A key challenge in the study of MPUs is determining when a given local tensor generates an MPU, a task previously addressed through fixed-point conditions and canonical forms, which can be cumbersome to evaluate for an arbitrary tensor. In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor $M$ to generate an MPU of size $N$, given by $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_M^N) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_T^N) = 1$, where $\mathbb{E}_M$ and $\mathbb{E}_T$ are the transfer matrices of $M$ and $T = MM^\dagger$. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of the Hat and Spectre tilings and some of their relatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffraction spectra of the Hat and Spectre monotile tilings, which are known to be pure point, are derived and computed explicitly. This is done via model set representatives of self-similar members in the topological conjugacy classes of the Hat and the Spectre tiling, which are the CAP and the CASPr tiling, respectively. This is followed by suitable reprojections of the model sets to represent the original Hat and Spectre tilings, which also allows to calculate their Fourier--Bohr coefficients explicitly. Since the windows of the underlying model sets have fractal boundaries, these coefficients need to be computed via an exact renormalisation cocycle in internal space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a measure for evaluating the efficiency of finite universal quantum gate sets $\mathcal{S}$, called the Quantum Circuit Overhead (QCO), and the related notion of $T$-Quantum Circuit Overhead ($T$-QCO). The overhead is based on the comparison between the efficiency of $\mathcal{S}$ versus the optimal efficiency among all gate sets with the same number of gates. We demonstrate the usefulness of the ($T$-)QCO by extensive numerical calculations of its upper bounds, providing insight into the efficiency of various choices of single-qubit $\mathcal{S}$, including Haar-random gate sets and the gate sets derived from finite subgroups, such as Clifford and Hurwitz groups. In particular, our results suggest that, in terms of the upper bounds on the $T$-QCO, the famous T gate is a highly non-optimal choice for the completion of the Clifford gate set, even among the gates of order 8. We identify the optimal choices of such completions for both finite subgroups.</description>

      <title>Recurrence of the VRJP and Exponential Decay in the \(H^{2|2}\)-Model on the Hierarchical Lattice for \(d\le 2\)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the vertex-reinforced jump processes on a \(d\)-dimensional hierarchical lattice are recurrent for \(d &lt; 2\) and transient for \(d &gt; 2\). We also explore certain regimes when \(d = 2\). The proof of recurrence relies on an exponential decay estimate of the fractional moment of the Green's function, which, unlike the classical approach used for \(\mathbb{Z}^d\), requires additional entropy estimates via stability of the model distribution under coarse grain operation, which leverages its linear reinforcement.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions for bow varieties and their Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type A bow varieties. Vertex functions are K-theoretic analogs of I-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the q-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements. The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the q-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar\to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about I-functions of flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Accretion of a Vlasov gas by a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the accretion of a collisionless, relativistic kinetic gas by a rotating Kerr black hole, assuming that at infinity the state of the gas is described by a distribution function depending only on the energy of the particles. Neglecting the self-gravity of the gas, we show that relevant physical observables, including the particle current density and the accretion rates associated with the mass, the energy, and the angular momentum, can be expressed in the form of closed integrals that can be evaluated numerically or approximated analytically in the slow-rotation limit. The accretion rates are computed in this manner for both monoenergetic particles and the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution and compared with the corresponding results in the non-rotating case. We show that the angular momentum accretion rate decreases the absolute value of the black hole spin parameter. It is also found that the rotation of the black hole has a small but non-vanishing effect on the mass and the energy accretion rates, which is remarkably well described by an analytic calculation in the slow-rotation approximation to quadratic order in the rotation parameter. The effects of rotation on the morphology of the accretion flow are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Pauli Stabilizer Models for Gapped Boundaries of Twisted Quantum Doubles and Applications to Composite Dimensional Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide new algorithms and provide example constructions of stabilizer models for the gapped boundaries, domain walls, and $0D$ defects of Abelian composite dimensional twisted quantum doubles. Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Teleparallel Robertson-Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a Chaplygin gas, and then for any polytropic gas cosmological source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity field equations (FEs) for each $k$-parameter value case and the relevant gas equation of state (EoS) to find the new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For flat $k=0$ cosmological case, we find analytical solutions valid for any cosmological scale factor. For curved $k=\pm 1$ cosmological cases, we find new approximated teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for slow, linear, fast and very fast universe expansion cases summarizing by a double power-law function. All the new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications on dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy, Anti-deSitter (AdS) spacetimes and several other cosmological processes.</description>

      <title>Bondi-type accretion onto a Kerr black hole in the kinetic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact solution representing a Bondi-type stationary accretion of a kinetic (Vlasov) gas onto the Kerr black hole. The solution is exact in the sense that relevant physical quantities, such as the particle current density or the accretion rates, are expressed as explicit integrals, which can be evaluated numerically. We provide an analytic approximation which allows us to obtain simple formulas for the mass, energy, and angular momentum accretion rates. These formulas are used to derive characteristic time scales of the black hole mass growth and the associated spin-down in two different scenarios: assuming that the ambient energy density is either constant or decreases on a cosmological scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy decay rates of damped waves on the torus depend on the behavior of the damping near the undamped region and on the geometry of the damped set. In this paper we refine these geometric considerations, by introducing the concept of order of a glancing undamped point, and estimating decay rates in terms of this order. The proof is based on generalizing an averaging argument due to Sun. We also show that damping sets which attain these improvements are generic among polygons and smooth curves.</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and BRST Cohomology of Schwarzschild in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kerr-Schild double copy is celebrated for producing exact gravitational spacetimes from gauge fields, yet the preservation of symmetry content remains largely unexplored. We investigate the fate of residual symmetries in the Kerr-Schild double copy, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution. On the gauge theory side, we derive the residual transformations that preserve the Abelian and non-Abelian Kerr-Schild ansatz\"e, finding they both form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra parameterized by arbitrary null functions. On the gravity side, we analyze the resulting residual diffeomorphisms of the Kerr-Schild Schwarzschild metric. Restricting our focus to the Killing vector class of solutions, we find that the only surviving diffeomorphisms are the finite-dimensional global isometries of Schwarzschild, reducing the residual gauge algebra to the Poincar\'e subalgebra containing exclusively time translations and spatial rotations. This finding confirms a fundamental structural mismatch: the infinite-dimensional algebra of the gauge side admits no analogous structure in this gravitational sector. We formalize this by showing that the BRST operator for the residual symmetry is trivialized under the Killing condition, establishing the consistency of this algebraic reduction within a quantum field theoretic framework. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In the second paper, we complete this analysis by examining the more complex proper conformal Killing vector class of solutions and formulating a unified BRST framework.</description>
