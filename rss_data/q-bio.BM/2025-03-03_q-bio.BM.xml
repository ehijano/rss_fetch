      <title>Lattice Protein Folding with Variational Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the principles of protein folding is a cornerstone of computational biology, with implications for drug design, bioengineering, and the understanding of fundamental biological processes. Lattice protein folding models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the complexities of protein folding, enabling the exploration of energetically optimal folds under constrained conditions. However, finding these optimal folds is a computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding. By leveraging Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with an annealing process driven by temperature-like fluctuations, our method accurately predicts optimal folds for benchmark systems of up to 60 beads. Our approach also effectively masks invalid folds from being sampled without compromising the autoregressive sampling properties of RNNs. This scheme is generalizable to three spatial dimensions and can be extended to lattice protein models with larger alphabets. Our findings emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in tackling complex protein folding problems and a broader class of constrained combinatorial optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>BAnG: Bidirectional Anchored Generation for Conditional RNA Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing RNA molecules that interact with specific proteins is a critical challenge in experimental and computational biology. Existing computational approaches require a substantial amount of experimentally determined RNA sequences for each specific protein or a detailed knowledge of RNA structure, restricting their utility in practice. To address this limitation, we develop RNA-BAnG, a deep learning-based model designed to generate RNA sequences for protein interactions without these requirements. Central to our approach is a novel generative method, Bidirectional Anchored Generation (BAnG), which leverages the observation that protein-binding RNA sequences often contain functional binding motifs embedded within broader sequence contexts. We first validate our method on generic synthetic tasks involving similar localized motifs to those appearing in RNAs, demonstrating its benefits over existing generative approaches. We then evaluate our model on biological sequences, showing its effectiveness for conditional RNA sequence design given a binding protein.</description>

      <title>Quantum-machine-assisted Drug Discovery: Survey and Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug discovery and development is a highly complex and costly endeavor, typically requiring over a decade and substantial financial investment to bring a new drug to market. Traditional computer-aided drug design (CADD) has made significant progress in accelerating this process, but the development of quantum computing offers potential due to its unique capabilities. This paper discusses the integration of quantum computing into drug discovery and development, focusing on how quantum technologies might accelerate and enhance various stages of the drug development cycle. Specifically, we explore the application of quantum computing in addressing challenges related to drug discovery, such as molecular simulation and the prediction of drug-target interactions, as well as the optimization of clinical trial outcomes. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of quantum computing, we might be able to reduce the time and cost associated with bringing new drugs to market, ultimately benefiting public health.</description>

      <title>UniGEM: A Unified Approach to Generation and Property Prediction for Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular generation and molecular property prediction are both crucial for drug discovery, but they are often developed independently. Inspired by recent studies, which demonstrate that diffusion model, a prominent generative approach, can learn meaningful data representations that enhance predictive tasks, we explore the potential for developing a unified generative model in the molecular domain that effectively addresses both molecular generation and property prediction tasks. However, the integration of these tasks is challenging due to inherent inconsistencies, making simple multi-task learning ineffective. To address this, we propose UniGEM, the first unified model to successfully integrate molecular generation and property prediction, delivering superior performance in both tasks. Our key innovation lies in a novel two-phase generative process, where predictive tasks are activated in the later stages, after the molecular scaffold is formed. We further enhance task balance through innovative training strategies. Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate our significant improvements in both tasks. The principles behind UniGEM hold promise for broader applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.</description>
