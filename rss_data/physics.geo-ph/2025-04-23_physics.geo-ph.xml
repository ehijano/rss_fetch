      <title>Full-waveform variational inference with full common-image gathers and diffusion network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate seismic imaging and velocity estimation are essential for subsurface characterization. Conventional inversion techniques, such as full-waveform inversion, remain computationally expensive and sensitive to initial velocity models. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-based inference framework with conditional elucidated diffusion models for posterior velocity-model sampling. Our approach incorporates both horizontal and vertical subsurface offset common-image gathers to capture a broader range of reflector geometries, including gently dipping structures and steep dipping layers. Additionally, we introduce the background-velocity model as an input condition to enhance generalization across varying geological settings. We evaluate our method on the SEAM dataset, which features complex salt geometries, using a patch-based training approach. Experimental results demonstrate that adding the background-velocity model as an additional conditioning variable significantly enhances performance, improving SSIM from $0.717$ to $0.733$ and reducing RMSE from $0.381\,$km/s to $0.274\,$km/s. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification analysis shows that our proposed approach yields better-calibrated uncertainty estimates, reducing uncertainty calibration error from $6.68\,$km/s to $3.91\,$km/s. These results show robust amortized seismic inversion with uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Poised to Rocket: Modeling the Environmental Impact of LEO Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of satellite megaconstellations in low Earth orbit (LEO) represents a significant advancement in global broadband connectivity. However, we urgently need to understand the potential environmental impacts, particularly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with these constellations. This study addresses a critical gap in modeling current and future GHG emissions by developing a comprehensive open-source life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, applied to 10 launch vehicles and 15 megaconstellations. Our analysis reveals that the production of launch vehicles and propellant combustion during launch events contribute most significantly to overall GHG emissions, accounting for 72.6% of life cycle emissions. Among the rockets analyzed, reusable vehicles like Falcon-9 and Starship demonstrate 95.4% lower production emissions compared to non-reusable alternatives, highlighting the environmental benefits of reusability in space technology. The findings underscore the importance of launch vehicle and satellite design choices to minimize potential environmental impacts. The Open-source Rocket and Constellation Lifecycle Emissions (ORACLE) repository is freely available and aims to facilitate further research in this field. This study provides a critical baseline for policymakers and industry stakeholders to develop strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of the space industry, especially satellite megaconstellations.</description>

      <title>Cluster and statistical analysis of spatial earthquake patterns in the South Caucasus region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Caucasus region is characterized by heterogeneous and strong seismicity as a result of collision between Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates. A rich variety of seismic events also distinguishes Azerbaijan, located in its south part. In this research, we consider the earthquakes, specifically spatial earthquake patterns that occurred in Azerbaijan and adjacent areas from 2010 to 2023. Applying density-based clustering algorithms to the earthquake catalog, the proper partitions of spatial earthquake distributions were obtained. The statistical properties of the catalog's partition into 7 clusters are studied in more detail. In particular, we consider the random variable, which is the distance from the fixed point of the earth's surface to earthquake epicenters. The analytical approximation of the cumulative distribution function is constructed for the case when the fixed point coincides with the cluster center and epicenters in the cluster are distributed by the bi-variate normal distribution. For comparison, the numerical distribution functions are evaluated on the basis of Johnson curves and good agreement is observed. Another case is also considered when the fixed point lies outside of a cluster. Under the assumption that a cluster is a circle and epicenters in it are distributed uniformly, the cumulative and probability distribution functions are derived. Applying these functions to the approximation of histograms for the distances from the Shamkir hydroelectric power station to the clusters shows that satisfactory agreement can be achieved. These results are promising for performing the seismic risk assessment for the Shamkir station or other objects of Azerbaijan's critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Surface to Seafloor: A Generative AI Framework for Decoding the Ocean Interior State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15308v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding subsurface ocean dynamics is essential for quantifying oceanic heat and mass transport, but direct observations at depth remain sparse due to logistical and technological constraints. In contrast, satellite missions provide rich surface datasets-such as sea surface height, temperature, and salinity-that offer indirect but potentially powerful constraints on the ocean interior. Here, we present a probabilistic framework based on score-based diffusion models to reconstruct three-dimensional subsurface velocity and buoyancy fields, including the energetic ocean eddy field, from surface observations. Using a 15-level primitive equation simulation of an idealized double-gyre system, we evaluate the skill of the model in inferring the mean circulation and the mesoscale variability at depth under varying levels of surface information. We find that the generative model successfully recovers key dynamical structures and provides physically meaningful uncertainty estimates, with predictive skill diminishing systematically as the surface resolution decreases or the inference depth increases. These results demonstrate the potential of generative approaches for ocean state estimation and uncertainty quantification, particularly in regimes where traditional deterministic methods are underconstrained or ill-posed.</description>

      <title>Full waveform inversion with CNN-based velocity representation extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) updates the velocity model by minimizing the discrepancy between observed and simulated data. However, discretization errors in numerical modeling and incomplete seismic data acquisition can introduce noise, which propagates through the adjoint operator and affects the accuracy of the velocity gradient, thereby impacting the FWI inversion accuracy. To mitigate the influence of noise on the gradient, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to refine the velocity model before performing the forward simulation, aiming to reduce noise and provide a more accurate velocity update direction. We use the same data misfit loss to update both the velocity and network parameters, thereby forming a self-supervised learning procedure. We propose two implementation schemes, which differ in whether the velocity update passes through the CNN. In both methodologies, the velocity representation is extended (VRE) by using a neural network in addition to the grid-based velocities. Thus, we refer to this general approach as VRE-FWI. Synthetic and real data tests demonstrate that the proposed VRE-FWI achieves higher velocity inversion accuracy compared to traditional FWI, at a marginal additional computational cost of approximately 1%.</description>

      <title>Differentiable graph neural network simulator for forward and inverse modeling of multi-layered slope system with multiple material properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural network simulators (GNS) have emerged as a computationally efficient tool for simulating granular flows. Previous efforts have been limited to simplified geometries and material characterizations, typically considering only friction angle, which does not reflect the complexity of realistic geotechnical systems such as slopes encountered in engineering practice. This study introduces a differentiable GNS framework designed for multi-layered slope systems comprising both forward and inverse modeling components. The forward component relies on a fine-tuned GNS that incorporates both friction angle and cohesion. Its performance is demonstrated through column collapse and multi-layered slope runout simulations, where GNS replicates multi-material flow dynamics while achieving up to 145x computational speedup over the Material Point Method (MPM). The inverse modeling component leverages the trained GNS, reverse-mode automatic differentiation, and L-BFGS-B optimization to infer material properties from a target runout geometry. Its performance is demonstrated by back-calculating the material strengths that led to failure-induced runout in a dam system composed of multiple materials. Results are obtained within minutes and show good agreement with the target strength values. The framework introduced in this study provides an efficient approach for forward runout assessments and inverse strength back-calculation in realistic slope systems.</description>

      <title>Fourier analysis of the physics of transfer learning for data-driven subgrid-scale models of ocean turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) is a powerful tool for enhancing the performance of neural networks (NNs) in applications such as weather and climate prediction and turbulence modeling. TL enables models to generalize to out-of-distribution data with minimal training data from the new system. In this study, we employ a 9-layer convolutional NN to predict the subgrid forcing in a two-layer ocean quasi-geostrophic system and examine which metrics best describe its performance and generalizability to unseen dynamical regimes. Fourier analysis of the NN kernels reveals that they learn low-pass, Gabor, and high-pass filters, regardless of whether the training data are isotropic or anisotropic. By analyzing the activation spectra, we identify why NNs fail to generalize without TL and how TL can overcome these limitations: the learned weights and biases from one dataset underestimate the out-of-distribution sample spectra as they pass through the network, leading to an underestimation of output spectra. By re-training only one layer with data from the target system, this underestimation is corrected, enabling the NN to produce predictions that match the target spectra. These findings are broadly applicable to data-driven parameterization of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Interacting Immediate Neighbour Interpolation for Geoscientific Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A diverse range of interpolation methods, including Kriging, spline/minimum curvature and radial basis function interpolation exist for interpolating spatially incomplete geoscientific data. Such methods use various spatial properties of the observed data to infer its local and global behaviour. In this study, we exploit the adaptability of locally interacting systems from statistical physics and develop an interpolation framework for numerical geoscientific data called Interacting Immediate Neighbour Interpolation (IINI), which solely relies on local and immediate neighbour correlations. In the IINI method, medium-to-long range correlations are constructed from the collective local interactions of grid centroids. To demonstrate the functionality and strengths of IINI, we apply our methodology to the interpolation of ground gravity, airborne magnetic and airborne radiometric datasets. We further compare the performance of IINI to conventional methods such as minimum curvature surface fitting. Results show that IINI is competitive with conventional interpolation techniques in terms of validation accuracy, while being significantly simpler in terms of algorithmic complexity and data pre-processing requirements. IINI demonstrates the broader applicability of statistical physics concepts within the field of geostatistics, highlighting their potential to enrich and expand traditional geostatistical methods.</description>

      <title>Upscaling the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard model for incompressible multiphase flow in inhomogeneous porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a macroscopic model for the flow of two immiscible and incompressible fluids in inhomogeneous porous medium. At the pore scale, the flow is governed by the fully Navier-Stokes equations while the evolution of the phase interface is captured by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Using the volume averaging method, the upscaled equations describing the averaged behavior of two fluids at the Darcy scale are obtained, with unclosed terms related to spatial deviations. Then, spatial derivations are carefully modeled up to some undetermined coefficients, which could be evaluated by solving simplified closure problems in each representative volume element. In particular, the wetting behavior is incorporated into the averaged chemical potential. The differences between the proposed equations and the empirical two-phase Darcy-type models are discussed. Finally, a phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann model for the averaged equations is presented, and numerical results demonstrate the abilities of the proposed model.</description>
