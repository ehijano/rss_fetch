      <title>On the Uniqueness of the Norton-Sullivan Quasiconformal extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the extension map \[ \mathcal{E}_{NS}(f)(z)=\frac{f(x+y)+f(x-y)}{2}+i\frac{f(x+y)-f(x-y)}{2}\mbox{ for all }z=x+iy\in\mathbb{H}\,, \] defined by Norton and Sullivan in '96, is the only locally linear extension map taking bi-Lipschitz functions on $\mathbb{R}$ to quasiconformal functions on $\mathbb{H}$, modulo the action of a group isomorphic to the linear group. In fact, we discovered many other extension like this one (lying in the orbit of such group action), such as: $f(x)\mapsto f(x)+i(f(x)-f(x-y))$.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and compactness kernel theorem for $\alpha$-modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to establishing the kernel theorems for $\alpha$-modulation spaces in terms of boundedness and compactness. We characterize the boundedness of a linear operator $A$ from an $\alpha$-modulation space $M^p_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ into another $\alpha$-modulation space $M^q_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, by the membership of its distributional kernel in mixed $\alpha$-modulation spaces. We also characterize the compactness of $A$ by means of the kernel in a certain closed subspace of mixed $\alpha$-modulation spaces. The proofs are based on the viewpoint that the action of the linear operator on certain function space can be reduced to the action on the suitable atoms of this function space.</description>

      <title>Smoothness of linearization by mixing parameters of dichotomy, bounded growth and perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the smoothness properties of a global and nonautonomous topological conjugacy between a linear system and a quasilinear perturbation. The linear system exhibits a nonuniform exponential dichotomy with a nontrivial projector and nonuniform bounded growth property. Additionally, the quasilinear perturbation is dominated by an increasing exponential function. Emphasis is placed on employing a set of parameters to describe the conditions of dichotomy, bounded growth and quasilinear perturbations. Finally, we prove that modifying these conditions enables us to achieve a broader smoothness interval.</description>

      <title>Convex bodies with algebraic section volume functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The section volume function $A_K(\xi,t), \ \xi \in \mathbb R^n, \ t \in \mathbb R,$ of a body $K \subset \mathbb R^n$ evaluates the $(n-1)$-dimensional volume of the cross-section $K$ by the hyperplane $\{ x \cdot \xi=t \}.$ We are concerned with the question: can the shape of a body $K$ be detected from an algebraic type of its section function? We prove that among strictly convex bodies $K$ with $C^{\infty}$ boundaries, ellipsoids are completely described by the algebraic equation $qA_K^m+p=0,$ where $m \in \mathbb N$ and $q=q(\xi), \ p=p(\xi,t)$ are polynomials. The result is motivated by Arnold's problem on algebraically integrable domains (which, in turn, has its roots in Newton's Lemma about ovals) and generalizes known results on polynomially integrable domains.</description>

      <title>On positive Jacobi matrices with compact inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider positive Jacobi matrices $J$ with compact inverses and consequently with purely discrete spectra. A number of properties of the corresponding sequence of orthogonal polynomials is studied including the convergence of their zeros, the vague convergence of the zero counting measures and of the Christoffel--Darboux kernels on the diagonal. Particularly, if the inverse of $J$ belongs to some Schatten class, we identify the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of orthogonal polynomials and express it in terms of its regularized characteristic function. In the even more special case when the inverse of $J$ belongs to the trace class we derive various formulas for the orthogonality measure, eigenvectors of $J$ as well as for the functions of the second kind and related objects. These general results are given a more explicit form in the case when $-J$ is a generator of a Birth--Death process. Among others we provide a formula for the trace of the inverse of $J$. We illustrate our results by introducing and studying a modification of $q$-Laguerre polynomials corresponding to a determinate moment problem.</description>

      <title>Factorization of positive-semidefinite operators with absolutely summable entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A problem by Feichtinger, Heil, and Larson asks whether a positive-definite integral operator with $M_1$ kernel admits a symmetric rank-one decomposition which is strongly square-summable with respect to the $M_1$ norm. In conjunction with a concurrent result by Bandeira-Mixon-Steinerberger, we provide a negative answer to the problem and study special cases where such factorization is possible. We also discuss an application of the results to the semidefinite relaxation of a quadratic program.</description>

Abstract: We prove $L^p$ bounds, $\frac{d^2 + 4d + 2}{(d+1)^2} &lt; p &lt; 2(d+1)$, for maximal linear modulations of singular integrals along paraboloids with frequencies in certain subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, for $d \geq 2$. This generalizes Carleson's theorem on convergence of Fourier series, and complements a corresponding result by Pierce and Yung with polynomial modulations without linear terms.</description>

      <title>Convexity, Fourier transforms, and lattice point discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a well-known paper by Bruna, Nagel and Wainger [BNW], Fourier transform decay estimates were proved for smooth hypersurfaces of finite line type bounding a convex domain. In this paper, we generalize their results in the following ways. First, for a surface that is locally the graph of a convex real analytic function, we show that a natural analogue holds even when the surface in question is not of finite line type. Secondly, we show a result for a general surface that is locally the graph of a convex $C^2$ function, or a piece of such a surface defined through real analytic equations, that implies an analogous Fourier transform decay theorem in situations where the oscillatory index is less than $1$. In such situations, for a compact surface the exponent provided is sharp. This result has implications for lattice point discrepancy problems, which we describe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the small and large $x$ asymptotics of the special function solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation. We use the representation of solution in terms of Toeplitz determinants of Bessel functions, which is new. Toeplitz determinants are rewritten as multiple contour integrals using Andr\`eief identity. Finally small and large $x$ asymptotics is obtained using elementary asymptotic methods. The claimed result has not appeared in the literature before. Our formulas are useful for numerical computations of corresponding solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative estimates for singularity for conjugate equations driven by linear fractional transformations</title>

Abstract: We consider the conjugate equation driven by two families of finite maps on the unit interval satisfying a compatibility condition. This framework contains de Rham's functional equations. We give sufficient conditions for singularity of the solution with quantitative estimates in the case that the equation is driven by non-affine maps, in particular, linear fractional transformations.</description>

Abstract: We show, by applying discrete weighted norm inequalities and the Rubio de Francia algorithm, that the discrete Hilbert transform and discrete Riesz potential are bounded on variable $\ell^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{Z})$ spaces whenever the discrete Hardy-Littlewood maximal is bounded on $\ell^{p'(\cdot)}(\mathbb{Z})$. We also obtain vector-valued inequalities for the discrete fractional maximal operator.</description>

      <title>Flow of the zeros of polynomials under iterated differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a sequence of polynomials $Q_n$ of degree $n$, we consider the triangular table of derivatives $Q_{n, k}(x)=d^k Q_n(x) /d x^k$. Under the only assumption that the sequence $\{Q_n\}$ has a weak* limiting zero distribution (an empirical distribution of zeros) represented by a unit measure $\mu_0$ with compact support in the complex plane, we show that as $n, k \rightarrow \infty$ such that $k / n \rightarrow t \in(0,1)$, the Cauchy transform of the zero-counting measure of the polynomials $Q_{n, k}$ converges in a neighborhood of infinity to the Cauchy transform of a measure $\mu_t$.
  The family of measures $\mu_t $, $t \in(0,1)$, whose dependence on the parameter $t$ can be interpreted as a flow of the zeros under iterated differentiation, has several interesting connections with the inviscid Burgers equation, the fractional free convolution of $\mu_0$, or a nonlocal diffusion equation governing the density of $\mu_t$ on $\mathbb R$.
  The main goal of this paper is to provide a streamlined and elementary proof of all these facts.</description>

      <title>The number of real zeros of polynomials with constrained coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there is an absolute constant $c &gt; 0$ such that every polynomial $P$ of the form $$P(z) = \sum_{j=0}^{n}{a_jz^j}\,, \quad |a_0| = 1\,, \quad |a_j| \leq M\,, \quad a_j \in \Bbb{C}\,, \quad M \geq 1\,,$$ has at most $cn^{1/2}(1+\log M)^{1/2}$ zeros in the interval $[-1,1]$. This result is sharp up to the multiplicative constant $c &gt; 0$ and extends an earlier result of Borwein, Erd\'elyi, and K\'os from the case $M=1$ to the case $M \geq $1. This has also been proved recently with the factor $(1+\log M)$ rather than $(1+\log M)^{1/2}$ in the Appendix of a recent paper by Jacob and Nazarov by using a different method. We also prove that there is an absolute constant $c &gt; 0$ such that every polynomial $P$ of the above form has at most $(c/a)(1+\log M)$ zeros in the interval $[-1+a,1-a]$ with $a \in (0,1)$. Finally we correct a somewhat incorrect proof of an earlier result of Borwein and Erd\'elyi by proving that there is a constant $\eta &gt; 0$ such that every polynomial $P$ of the above form with $M = 1$ has at most $\eta n^{1/2}$ zeros inside any polygon with vertices on the unit circle, where the multiplicative constant $\eta &gt; 0$ depends only on the polygon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09083v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the series of reciprocals of those positive integers with exactly $k$ occurrences of a given $b$-ary digit $d$ (Irwin series), and obtain for their sums geometrically convergent representations. They are expressed in terms of the moments and Stieltjes transforms of certain measures on the unit interval and involve certain recurrences which convert straightforwardly into a numerical implementation. This framework allows a new perspective on the limit for large $k$, and is the basis for obtaining, as the author has done in further works, the asymptotics for large $b$.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on Riesz transform on exterior Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $n\ge2$ and $\mathcal{L}=-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla\cdot)$ be an elliptic operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Given an exterior Lipschitz domain $\Omega$, let $\mathcal{L}_D$ be the elliptic operator $\mathcal{L}$ on $\Omega$ subject to the Dirichlet boundary condition. Previously it was known that the Riesz operator $\nabla \mathcal{L}_D^{-1/2}$ is not bounded for $p&gt;2$ and $p\ge n$, even if $\mathcal{L}=-\Delta$ being the Laplace operator and $\Omega$ being a domain outside a ball. Suppose that $A$ are CMO coefficients or VMO coefficients satisfying certain perturbation property, and $\partial\Omega$ is $C^1$, we prove that for $p&gt;2$ and $p\in [n,\infty)$, it holds $$ \inf_{\phi\in\mathcal{K}_p(\mathcal{L}_D^{1/2})}\left\|\nabla (f-\phi)\right\|_{L^p(\Omega)}\sim \inf_{\phi\in\mathcal{K}_p(\mathcal{L}_D^{1/2})}\left\|\mathcal{L}^{1/2}_D (f-\phi)\right\|_{L^p(\Omega)} $$ for $f\in \dot{W}^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$. Here $\mathcal{K}_p(\mathcal{L}_D^{1/2})$ is the kernel of $\mathcal{L}_D^{1/2}$ in $\dot{W}^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$, which coincides with $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}^p_0(\Omega):=\{f\in \dot{W}^{1,p}_0(\Omega):\,\mathcal{L}_Df=0\}$ and is a one dimensional subspace. As an application, we provide a substitution of $L^p$-boundedness of $\sqrt{t}\nabla e^{-t\mathcal{L}_D}$ which is uniform in $t$ for $p\ge n$ and $p&gt;2$.</description>
