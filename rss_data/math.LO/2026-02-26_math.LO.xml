      <title>Quantifier Elimination and Invariant Theory: Applications to Quaternions, Octonions, and Other Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on our previous paper~\cite{constructive} by using the general method introduced there in conjunction with invariant theory. This yields quantifier elimination results for the classical quaternions, octonions, as well as other classes of finite-dimensional algebras over real closed and algebraically closed fields. In particular, the first two examples answer an open question posed recently in~\cite{savi}.</description>

      <title>Quantales carrying ortholattice structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the intersection of residuated structures from many-valued logic and orthomodular lattices from quantum logic. We explore whether non-Boolean structures can simultaneously satisfy residuation principles and orthocomplementation requirements. Our main contribution is a study of Girard posets with inversions, providing a characterization theorem where a unital residuated poset is Girard if and only if it admits an inversion satisfying specific adjointness conditions. We prove that any complemented lattice admitting an integral residuated structure must be Boolean, which motivates our search for orthomodular examples in the non-integral case. We answer this by demonstrating that the lattice $C(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of closed subspaces of $n$-dimensional real coordinate space carries both an orthomodular and a commutative Girard quantale structure. This construction provides a concrete non-Boolean framework unifying quantum-logical and many-valued logical reasoning.</description>

      <title>There are only countably many locally tabular bi-intermediate logics of co-trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bi-Heyting algebra validates the G\"odel-Dummett axiom $(p \to q) \lor (q \to p)$ iff the poset of its prime filters is a disjoint union of co-trees. Bi-Heyting algebras of this kind are called bi-G\"odel algebras and form a variety $\operatorname{\mathsf{bi-GA}}$ that algebraizes the extension $\operatorname{\mathsf{bi-GD}}$ of bi-intuitionistic logic axiomatized by the G\"odel-Dummett axiom. In this paper we show that there are only countably many locally tabular bi-intermediate logics of co-trees, all of which are finitely axiomatizable.
  The theory of canonical formulas of bi-G\"odel algebras has shown that $\operatorname{\mathsf{bi-GA}}$ has continuum many subvarieties, among which the locally finite ones coincide with the subvarieties of the $\mathsf{V}_n \coloneqq \{\mathbf{A} \in \operatorname{\mathsf{bi-GA}} \colon \mathbf{A} \models \beta(\mathfrak{C}_n)\}$ (where $\beta(\mathfrak{C}_n)$ is the subframe formula of the $n$-comb). We identify the multiset projectivity relation (a binary relation that, when defined on the set of finite multisets of a better partial order, is necessarily a better partial order) and use it to prove that every $\mathsf{V}_n$ is a Specht variety, hence has only countably many subvarieties, all of which are finitely axiomatizable. By the algebraizability of $\operatorname{\mathsf{bi-GD}}$, the main result follows. We also provide an informative depiction of the lattice of varieties of bi-G\"odel algebras.</description>

      <title>Reflection Principles in ZFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We separate the Collection Principle, the Reflection Principle, and the Partial Reflection Principle in ZF with urelements (ZFU), despite their equivalence under the Axiom of Choice. In particular, Collection and the Partial Reflection Principle are independent of one another, and Collection together with Partial Reflection does not imply the Reflection Principle. We show that Reflection and Collection are equivalent assuming either the Tail axiom or Small Violations of Choice.</description>

      <title>Sheaves as oracle computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In type theory, an oracle may be specified abstractly by a predicate whose domain is the type of queries asked of the oracle, and whose proofs are the oracle answers. Such a specification induces an oracle modality that captures a computational intuition about oracles: at each step of reasoning we either know the result, or we ask the oracle a query and proceed upon receiving an answer. We characterize an oracle modality as the least one forcing the given predicate. We establish an adjoint retraction between modalities and propositional containers, from which it follows that every modality is an oracle modality. The left adjoint maps sums to suprema, which makes suprema of modalities easy to compute when they are given in terms of oracle modalities. We also study sheaves for oracle modalities. We describe sheafification in terms of a quotient-inductive type of computation trees, and describe sheaves as algebras for the corresponding monad. We also introduce equifoliate trees, an intensional notion of oracle computation given by a (non-propositional) container. Equifoliate trees descend to sheaves, and lift from sheaves in case the container is projective. As an application, we give a concrete description of all Lawvere-Tierney topologies in a realizability topos, closely related to a game-theoretic characterization by Takayuki Kihara.</description>

      <title>Ternary Idempotent $\Gamma$-Semirings, Non-Reducibility, and Higher-Order Path Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary idempotent semirings govern classical path algebras. Their multiplicative structure is dyadic. We examine whether this restriction is structural or accidental.
  We define ternary idempotent $\Gamma$-semirings as higher-arity ordered algebraic systems admitting associative ternary composition compatible with idempotent addition. We prove that such structures strictly extend classical semiring path algebras. In particular, we construct a ternary associative operation which cannot be represented as an iterated associative binary operation. This establishes non-reducibility.
  We formulate a higher-order path problem in directed graphs with weights in a ternary idempotent $\Gamma$-semiring. The associated relaxation operator is shown to be monotone on a complete lattice and to admit a least fixed point. Convergence follows under a finite acyclicity condition. The combinatorial growth of interaction windows yields a distinct complexity class relative to binary path schemes.
  These results indicate that dyadic semiring frameworks do not exhaust algebraic path formalisms. Higher-arity composition introduces structural phenomena absent in binary systems.</description>

      <title>Largeness notions and polytime translation for $\forall \Sigma^0_3$-consequences of $\mathsf{RT}^2_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Le Hou\'erou, Patey and Yokoyama defined a parameterized version of $\alpha$-largeness to prove that $\mathsf{WKL}_0 + \mathsf{RT}^2_2$ is a $\forall \Sigma^0_3$-conservative extension of $\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma^0_2$, where $\forall \Sigma^0_3$ is the universal set-closure of the class of $\Sigma^0_3$-formulas. We introduce a variant of this notion of largeness and obtain polynomial bounds, using a tree partition theorem based on Milliken's tree theorem. Thanks to the framework of forcing interpretation, this yields that any proof of a $\forall \Sigma^0_3$-sentence in the theory $\mathsf{WKL}_0 + \mathsf{RT}^2_2$ can be translated into a proof in $\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma^0_2$ at the cost of a polynomial increase in size.</description>

      <title>Rigid many-one degrees contain infinite antichains of $1$-degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odifreddi asked whether every non-irreducible many-one degree must contain an infinite antichain of one-one degrees. Positive answers are known for computably enumerable many-one degrees (Degtev) and, more recently, for many-one degrees admitting a $\Delta^0_2$ representative (Batyrshin). In this note we isolate a rigidity principle behind these phenomena.
  Call a set $A\subseteq\omega$ \emph{$m$-rigid} if every total computable $m$-autoreduction of $A$ is eventually the identity. We prove that if $A$ is $m$-rigid, then its many-one degree $\deg_m(A)$ contains an infinite antichain of $1$-degrees. The proof uses a uniform duplication construction: for each computable parameter $S$ we define $B_S\equiv_m A$ so that any injective reduction $B_S\le_1 B_T$ induces an $m$-autoreduction of $A$ and therefore forces $S\subseteq^{*}T$. Choosing an almost-inclusion infinite antichain of computable sets yields the desired infinite $1$-antichain inside $\deg_m(A)$.
  As applications, Jockusch's rigidity theorem implies that every $1$-generic set is $m$-rigid, giving a comeager family of positive instances. Moreover, $m$-rigidity holds with Lebesgue measure $1$ (indeed, every Martin-L\"of random real is $m$-rigid). Consequently, Odifreddi's Question~5 has a positive answer \emph{with probability $1$} for a fair-coin random $A\in 2^\omega$; any counterexample (if it exists) is confined to a null set (and, by genericity, also to a meager set).</description>

      <title>Strong Normalization for the Safe Fragment of a Minimal Rewrite Calculus: A Triple-Lexicographic Proof and a Conjecture on Full-Termination Limits for Pure Recursive Calculi (PRC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00081v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study KO7, a minimal operator-only rewrite calculus in the Pure Recursive Calculus (PRC) framing: no binders, no external memory, no imported axioms, and an unrestricted step-duplicating recursor. KO7 is used as a calibrated witness system, not as the whole PRC class. It has seven constructors and eight rules. The rec-succ rule duplicates its step argument, creating the central termination stressor and blocking strict decrease for additive and related internal ranking families.
  We isolate a guarded fragment, SafeStep, with per-rule guards (delta-flag, kappa^M, and disequality). For SafeStep we prove strong normalization via a computable triple-lex measure (delta-phase bit, Dershowitz-Manna multiset component kappa^M, and tie-break rank tau). The development includes a certified normalizer (totality and soundness), a formal Newman-style confluence pipeline with fully discharged local-join hypotheses, and unique normal forms for the safe fragment. For the unrestricted full relation Step, we provide an explicit non-local-join witness at eqW void void, so full confluence is not claimed.
  We also machine-check impossibility barriers across twelve strategy families (including additive, polynomial, weight-based, and precedence-based methods), with additional meta-theoretical boundary observations. These results motivate a scoped conjectural boundary: for PRCs, no internally definable method currently known to us proves full-calculus termination under our explicit internal-method definition. The formal Lean 4 development is sorry/admit/unsafe-free (~6,000 LOC) and available at https://github.com/MosesRahnama/OperatorKO7.</description>
