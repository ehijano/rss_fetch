      <title>Cluster-weighted modeling of lifetime hierarchical data for profiling COVID-19 heart failure patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the heterogeneity in survival times among COVID-19 patients with Heart Failure (HF) hospitalized in the Lombardy region of Italy during the pandemic. To address this, we propose a novel mixture model for right-censored lifetime data that incorporates random effects and allows for local distributions of the explanatory variables. Our approach identifies latent clusters of patients while estimating component-specific covariate effects on survival, taking into account the hierarchical structure induced by the healthcare facility. Specifically, a shared frailty term, unique to each cluster, captures hospital-level variability enabling a twofold decoupling of survival heterogeneity across both clusters and hierarchies. Two EM-based algorithms, namely a Classification EM (CEM) and a Stochastic EM (SEM), are proposed for parameter estimation. The devised methodology effectively uncovers latent patient profiles, evaluates within-cluster hospital effects, and quantifies the impact of respiratory conditions on survival. Our findings provide new information on the complex interplay between the impacts of HF, COVID-19, and healthcare facilities on public health, highlighting the importance of personalized and context-sensitive clinical strategies.</description>

      <title>Forecasting sub-population mortality using credibility theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of the present paper is to forecast mortality rates for small sub-populations that are parts of a larger super-population. In this setting the assumption is that it is possible to produce reliable forecasts for the super-population, but the sub-populations may be too small or lack sufficient history to produce reliable forecasts if modelled separately. This setup is aligned with the ideas that underpin credibility theory, and in the present paper the classical credibility theory approach is extended to be able to handle the situation where future mortality rates are driven by a latent stochastic process, as is the case for, e.g., Lee-Carter type models.
  This results in sub-population credibility predictors that are weighted averages of expected future super-population mortality rates and expected future sub-population specific mortality rates. Due to the predictor's simple structure it is possible to derive an explicit expression for the mean squared error of prediction. Moreover, the proposed credibility modelling approach does not depend on the specific form of the super-population model, making it broadly applicable regardless of the chosen forecasting model for the super-population.
  The performance of the suggested sub-population credibility predictor is illustrated on simulated population data. These illustrations highlight how the credibility predictor serves as a compromise between only using a super-population model, and only using a potentially unreliable sub-population specific model.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Temporal Point Process Modeling of Aggressive Behavior Onset in Psychiatric Inpatient Youth with Autism for Branching Factor Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggressive behavior in autistic inpatient youth often arises in temporally clustered bursts complicating efforts to distinguish external triggers from internal escalation. The sample population branching factor-the expected number of new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in behavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring patient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes process with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial pooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency individuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian inference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via convergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbin's modification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem (RTCT). The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise branching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +- 0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This led to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical model. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood perturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse individuals. GOF measures consistently favored or on par to the hierarchical model. Hierarchical Hawkes modeling with edge-effect correction provides robust estimation of branching dynamics by capturing both within- and between-patient variability. This enables clearer separation of endogenous from exogenous events supports linkage to physiological signals and enhances early warning systems individualized treatment and resource allocation in inpatient care.</description>

      <title>R2 priors for Grouped Variance Decomposition in High-dimensional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Group-R2 decomposition prior, a hierarchical shrinkage prior that extends R2-based priors to structured regression settings with known groups of predictors. By decomposing the prior distribution of the coefficient of determination R2 in two stages, first across groups, then within groups, the prior enables interpretable control over model complexity and sparsity. We derive theoretical properties of the prior, including marginal distributions of coefficients, tail behavior, and connections to effective model complexity. Through simulation studies, we evaluate the conditions under which grouping improves predictive performance and parameter recovery compared to priors that do not account for groups. Our results provide practical guidance for prior specification and highlight both the strengths and limitations of incorporating grouping into R2-based shrinkage priors.</description>

      <title>Bias reduction method for prior event rate ratio, with application to emergency department visit rates in patients with advanced cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: Prior event rate ratio (PERR) is a promising approach to control confounding in observational and real-world evidence research. One of its assumptions is that occurrence of outcome events does not influence later event rate, or in other words, absence of 'event dependence'. This study proposes, evaluates and illustrates a bias reduction method when this assumption is violated. Study Design and Setting: We propose the conditional frailty method for implementation of PERR in the presence of event dependence and evaluate its performance by simulation. We demonstrate the use of the method with a study of emergency department visit rate and palliative care in patients with advanced cancer in Singapore. Results: Simulations showed that, in the presence of negative (positive) event dependence, the crude PERR estimate of treatment effect was biased towards (away from) the null value. The proposed method successfully reduced the bias, with median of absolute level of relative bias at about 5%. Dynamic random-intercept modelling revealed positive event dependence in emergency department visits among patients with advanced cancer. While conventional time-to-event regression analysis with covariate adjustment estimated higher rate of emergency department visits among palliative care recipients (HR=3.61, P&lt;0.001), crude PERR estimate and the proposed PERR estimate were 1.45 (P=0.22) and 1.22 (P=0.57), respectively. Conclusions: The proposed bias reduction method mitigates the impact of violation of the PERR assumption of absence of event dependence. It allows broader application of the PERR approach.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap prediction intervals for the age distribution of life-table death counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonparametric bootstrap procedure based on a dynamic factor model to construct pointwise prediction intervals for period life-table death counts. The age distribution of death counts is an example of constrained data, which are nonnegative and have a constrained integral. A centered log-ratio transformation is used to remove the constraints. With a time series of unconstrained data, we introduce our bootstrap method to construct prediction intervals, thereby quantifying forecast uncertainty. The bootstrap method utilizes a dynamic factor model to capture both nonstationary and stationary patterns through a two-stage functional principal component analysis. To capture parameter uncertainty, the estimated principal component scores and model residuals are sampled with replacement. Using the age- and sex-specific life-table deaths for Australia and the United Kingdom, we study the empirical coverage probabilities and compare them with the nominal ones. The bootstrap method has superior interval forecast accuracy, especially for the one-step-ahead forecast horizon.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Covariate Distribution and Positivity Violation on Weighting-Based Indirect Comparisons: a Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population-Adjusted Indirect Comparisons (PAICs) are used to estimate treatment effects when direct comparisons are infeasible and individual patient data (IPD) are only available for one trial. Among PAIC methods, Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) is the most widely used. However, little is known about how MAIC performs under challenging conditions such as limited covariate overlap or markedly non-normal covariate distributions.
  We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study comparing three estimators: (i) MAIC matching first moment (MAIC-1), (ii) MAIC matching first and second moments (MAIC-2), and (iii) a benchmark method leveraging full IPD -- Propensity Score Weighting (PSW). We examined eight scenarios ranging from ideal conditions to situations with positivity violations and non-normal (including bimodal) covariate distributions. We assessed both anchored and unanchored estimators and examined the impact of adjustment model misspecification. We also applied these estimators to real-world data from the AKIKI and AKIKI-2 trials, comparing renal replacement therapy strategies in critically ill patients.
  MAIC-1 demonstrated robust performance, remaining unbiased in the presence of moderate positivity violations and non-normal covariates, while MAIC-2 and PSW appeared more sensitive to positivity violations. All methods showed substantial bias when key confounders were omitted, emphasizing the importance of correct model specification. In real-world data, a consistent trend was found with MAIC-1 showing narrower confidence intervals with positivity violation.
  Our findings support the cautious use of unanchored MAICs and highlight MAIC-1's resilience across moderate violations of assumptions. However, the method's limited flexibility underscores the need for careful use in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Climate Policy Uncertainty: Evidence from the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting Climate Policy Uncertainty (CPU) is essential as policymakers strive to balance economic growth with environmental goals. High levels of CPU can slow down investments in green technologies, make regulatory planning more difficult, and increase public resistance to climate reforms, especially during times of economic stress. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting the US CPU index by building the Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model with a large set of covariates, including economic indicators, financial cycle data, and public sentiments captured through Google Trends. The key strength of the BSTS model lies in its ability to efficiently manage a large number of covariates through its dynamic feature selection mechanism based on the spike-and-slab prior. To validate the effectiveness of the selected features of the BSTS model, an impulse response analysis is performed. The results show that macro-financial shocks impact CPU in different ways over time. Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the BSTS model with exogenous variables on the US CPU dataset over different forecasting horizons. The empirical results confirm that BSTS consistently outperforms classical and deep learning frameworks, particularly for semi-long-term and long-term forecasts.</description>

      <title>Surrogate modeling for uncertainty quantification in nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the behavior of complex systems in engineering often involves significant uncertainty about operating conditions, such as external loads, environmental effects, and manufacturing variability. As a result, uncertainty quantification (UQ) has become a critical tool in modeling-based engineering, providing methods to identify, characterize, and propagate uncertainty through computational models. However, the stochastic nature of UQ typically requires numerous evaluations of these models, which can be computationally expensive and limit the scope of feasible analyses. To address this, surrogate models, i.e., efficient functional approximations trained on a limited set of simulations, have become central in modern UQ practice. This book chapter presents a concise review of surrogate modeling techniques for UQ, with a focus on the particularly challenging task of capturing the full time-dependent response of dynamical systems. It introduces a classification of time-dependent problems based on the complexity of input excitation and discusses corresponding surrogate approaches, including combinations of principal component analysis with polynomial chaos expansions, time warping techniques, and nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX models). Each method is illustrated with simple application examples to clarify the underlying ideas and practical use.</description>

      <title>Comparative Firm-Level Analysis of ESG and Sentiment Effects on Stock Market Performance: Evidence from 16 Companies Using Retrofitted Sentiment Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates how emotion-specific sentiment embedded in financial news headlines interacts with firm-level ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ratings to influence stock return behavior. Using data from 16 firms and integrating retrofitted word embeddings with ESG metrics, the analysis evaluates three hypotheses: (1) emotion-specific sentiment independently predicts stock returns; (2) its moderating effect varies across ESG dimensions; and (3) positive (negative) sentiment amplifies (dampens) ESG performance effects.
  The empirical results support Hypotheses 1 and 2. Emotion-laden headlines -- especially those expressing trust, sadness, and anticipation -- significantly correlate with return variability, particularly when aligned with specific ESG dimensions such as Environmental and Social. However, results for Hypothesis 3 are mixed: while sentiment clearly moderates ESG-return relationships, contradictory interactions (e.g., negative sentiment enhancing returns) were more common and exhibited stronger effects than theory-consistent ones.
  Retrofitted word embeddings outperformed a traditional lexicon-based sentiment model (NRC Emotion Lexicon), offering higher explanatory power across interaction models. The study highlights the nuanced and context-dependent nature of ESG-sentiment dynamics, emphasizing the importance of emotional framing in investor behavior and ESG valuation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Demographic Distribution Matching between real world and virtual phantom population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual imaging trials (VITs) offer scalable and cost-effective tools for evaluating imaging systems and protocols. However, their translational impact depends on rigorous comparability between virtual and real-world populations. This study introduces DISTINCT (Distributional Subsampling for Covariate-Targeted Alignment), a statistical framework for selecting demographically aligned subsamples from large clinical datasets to support robust comparisons with virtual cohorts. We applied DISTINCT to the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and a companion virtual trial dataset (VLST). The algorithm jointly aligned typical continuous (age, BMI) and categorical (sex, race, ethnicity) variables by constructing multidimensional bins based on discretized covariates. For a given target size, DISTINCT samples individuals to match the joint demographic distribution of the reference population. We evaluated the demographic similarity between VLST and progressively larger NLST subsamples using Wasserstein and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distances to identify the maximal subsample size with acceptable alignment. The algorithm identified a maximal aligned NLST subsample of 9,974 participants, preserving demographic similarity to the VLST population. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using risk scores for lung cancer detection showed that area under the curve (AUC) estimates stabilized beyond 6,000 participants, confirming the sufficiency of aligned subsamples for virtual imaging trial evaluation. Stratified AUC analysis revealed substantial performance variation across demographic subgroups, reinforcing the importance of covariate alignment in comparative studies.</description>

      <title>Addressing Outcome Reporting Bias in Meta-analysis: A Selection Model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outcome Reporting Bias (ORB) poses significant threats to the validity of meta-analytic findings. It occurs when researchers selectively report outcomes based on the significance or direction of results, potentially leading to distorted treatment effect estimates. Despite its critical implications, ORB remains an under-recognized issue, with few comprehensive adjustment methods available. The goal of this research is to investigate ORB-adjustment techniques through a selection model lens, thereby extending some of the existing methodological approaches available in the literature. To gain a better insight into the effects of ORB in meta-analysis of clinical trials, specifically in the presence of heterogeneity, and to assess the effectiveness of ORB-adjustment techniques, we apply the methodology to real clinical data affected by ORB and conduct a simulation study focusing on treatment effect estimation with a secondary interest in heterogeneity quantification.</description>

      <title>From Observational Data to Clinical Recommendations: A Causal Framework for Estimating Patient-level Treatment Effects and Learning Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for building patient-specific treatment recommendation models, building on the large recent literature on learning patient-level causal models and inspired by the target trial paradigm of Hernan and Robins. We focus on safety and validity, including the crucial issue of causal identification when using observational data. We do not provide a specific model, but rather a way to integrate existing methods and know-how into a practical pipeline. We further provide a real world use-case of treatment optimization for patients with heart failure who develop acute kidney injury during hospitalization. The results suggest our pipeline can improve patient outcomes over the current treatment regime.</description>
