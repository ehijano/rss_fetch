      <title>Graph burning: an overview of mathematical programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Graph Burning Problem (GBP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that has gained relevance as a tool for quantifying a graph's vulnerability to contagion. Although it is based on a very simple propagation model, its decision version is NP-complete, and its optimization version is NP-hard. Many of its theoretical properties across different graph families have been thoroughly explored, and numerous interesting variants have been proposed. This paper reports novel mathematical programs for the optimization version of the classical GBP. Among the presented programs are a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), two Integer Linear Programs (ILP), and two Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. Most optimization solvers can handle these, being QUBO problems of a capital interest in quantum computing. The primary aim of this paper is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the GBP by examining its different formulations. Compared to other mathematical programs from the literature, the ones presented here are conceptually simpler and involve fewer variables. These make them more practical for finding optimal solutions using optimization algorithms and solvers, as we show by solving some instances with millions of vertices in just a few minutes.</description>

      <title>Using random spanning trees in survivable networks design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a process of joining $k$ random spanning trees on a fixed clique $K_n$. The joined trees may not be disjoint and multiple edges are replaced by one simple edge. This process produces a simple graph $G$ on $n$~vertices with an edge set, which is a union of edge sets of the joined trees. We study a random variable $S_{k}$ of the number of edges in the generated graph $G$. The exact formula is derived for the expected value of the random variable $S_{k}$. In addition, an upper bound on the concentration coefficient of the random variable $S_{k}$ is provided. We use results of our analysis to design an algorithm to generate $k$-edge connected graphs for arbitrarily large values of $k \geq 2$. The designed algorithm solves a particular case of the Survivable Network Design Problem, where the cost of each edge is $c_{e} = 1$ and the connectivity requirement for each pair of vertices $u, v \in V(G)$ is $k$.The proposed algorithm is within a factor strictly less than $2$ of the optimal value (i.e., the number of edges in the generated graph) and its running time is $O(kn\log{n})$.</description>

      <title>Canalization as a stabilizing principle of gene regulatory networks: a discrete dynamical systems perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks exhibit remarkable stability, maintaining functional phenotypes despite genetic and environmental perturbations. Discrete dynamical models, such as Boolean networks, provide systems biologists with a tractable framework to explore the mathematical underpinnings of this robustness. A key mechanism conferring stability is canalization. This perspective synthesizes historical insights, formal definitions of canalization in discrete dynamical models, quantitative measures of stability, illustrative applications, and emerging challenges at the interface of theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Talagrand's convolution conjecture up to loglog via perturbed reverse heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that under the heat semigroup $(P_\tau)$ on the Boolean hypercube, any nonnegative function $f: \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}_+$ exhibits a uniform tail bound that is better than that by Markov's inequality. Specifically, for any $\eta &gt; e^3$ and $\tau &gt; 0$,
  \begin{align*}
  \mathbb{P}_{X \sim \mu}\left( P_\tau f(X) &gt; \eta \int f d\mu \right) \leq c_\tau \frac{ \log \log \eta }{\eta \sqrt{\log \eta}},
  \end{align*}
  where $\mu$ is the uniform measure on the Boolean hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ and $c_\tau$ is a constant that only depends on $\tau$. This resolves Talagrand's convolution conjecture up to a dimension-free $\log\log \eta$ factor. Its proof relies on properties of the reverse heat process on the Boolean hypercube and a coupling construction based on carefully engineered perturbations of this reverse heat process.</description>

      <title>Note about the complexity of the acyclic orientation with parity constraint problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected graph, and let $T$ in $V$ be a subset of vertices. An orientation of $G$ is called $T$-odd if any vertex $v \in V$ has odd in-degree if and only if it is in $T$. Finding a T -odd orientation of G can be solved in polynomial time as shown by Chevalier, Jaeger, Payan and Xuong (1983). Since then, $T$-odd orientations have continued to attract interest, particularly in the context of global constraints on the orientation. For instance, Frank and Kir\'aly (2002) investigated $k$-connected $T$-odd orientations and raised questions about acyclic $T$-odd orientations. This problem is now recognized as an Egres problem and is known as the "Acyclic orientation with parity constraints" problem. Szegedy ( 005) proposed a randomized polynomial algorithm to address this problem. An easy consequence of his work provides a polynomial time algorithm for planar graphs whenever $|T | = |V | - 1$. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether it exists in general. In this paper we contribute to the understanding of the complexity of this problem by studying a more general one. We prove that finding a $T$-odd acyclic orientation on graphs having some directed edges is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Double-Ended Palindromic Trees in Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The palindromic tree (a.k.a. eertree) is a data structure that provides access to all palindromic substrings of a string. In this paper, we propose a dynamic version of eertree, called double-ended eertree, which supports online operations on the stored string, including double-ended queue operations, counting distinct palindromic substrings, and finding the longest palindromic prefix/suffix. At the heart of our construction, we identify a new class of substring occurrences, called surfaces, that are palindromic substring occurrences that are neither prefixes nor suffixes of any other palindromic substring occurrences, which is of independent interest. Surfaces characterize the link structure of all palindromic substrings in the eertree, thereby allowing a linear-time implementation of double-ended eertrees through a linear-time maintenance of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Unique expansions in number systems via refinement equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13066v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2\pi i a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime $n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D. Klarner on the question of P. Erd\"os about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of polytopes with edge length and coplanarity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel setting for polytope rigidity, where a flex must preserve edge lengths and the planarity of faces, but is allowed to change the shapes of faces. For instance, the regular cube is flexible in this notion. We present techniques for constructing flexible polytopes and find that flexibility seems to be an exceptional property. Based on this observation, we introduce a notion of generic realizations for polytopes and conjecture that convex polytopes are generically rigid in dimension $d\geq 3$. We prove this conjecture in dimension $d=3$. Motivated by our findings we also pose several questions that are intended to inspire future research into this notion of polytope rigidity.</description>

      <title>The Squishy Grid Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of approximating Euclidean distances by the infinite integer grid graph. Although the topology of the graph is fixed, we have control over the edge-weight assignment $w:E\to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, and hope to have grid distances be asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, that is, for all grid points $u,v$, $\mathrm{dist}_w(u,v) = (1\pm o(1))\|u-v\|_2$. We give three methods for solving this problem, each attractive in its own way.
  * Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive, non-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid. Distances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove that the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is $(1+1/\Theta(\log^\xi \log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and $\xi=\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can be improved quantitatively.
  * Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of "highways." It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which converges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach.
  * The first two methods are deterministic. An even simpler approach is to sample the edge weights independently from a common distribution $\mathscr{D}$. Whether there exists a distribution $\mathscr{D}^*$ that makes grid distances Euclidean, asymptotically and in expectation, is major open problem in the theory of first passage percolation. Previous experiments show that when $\mathscr{D}$ is a Fisher distribution, grid distances are within 1\% of Euclidean. We demonstrate experimentally that this level of accuracy can be achieved by a simple 2-point distribution that assigns weights 0.41 or 4.75 with probability 44\% and 56\%, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish new depth upper bounds for sorting networks on 27 and 28 channels, improving the previous best bound of 14 to 13. Our 28-channel network is constructed with reflectional symmetry by combining high-quality prefixes of 16- and 12-channel networks, extending them greedily one comparator at a time, and using a SAT solver to complete the remaining layers.</description>

      <title>A note on embracing exchange sequences in oriented matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An open problem in convex geometry asks whether two simplices $A,B\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, both containing the origin in their convex hulls, admit a polynomial-length sequence of vertex exchanges transforming $A$ into $B$ while maintaining the origin in the convex hull throughout. We propose a matroidal generalization of the problem to oriented matroids, concerning exchange sequences between bases under sign constraints on elements appearing in certain fundamental circuits. We formulate a conjecture on the minimum length of such a sequence, and prove it for oriented graphic matroids of directed graphs. We also study connections between our conjecture and several long-standing open problems on exchange sequences between pairs of bases in unoriented matroids.</description>

      <title>A Fast Binary Splitting Approach for Non-Adaptive Learning of Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning an unknown graph via group queries on node subsets, where each query reports whether at least one edge is present among the queried nodes. In general, learning arbitrary graphs with $n$ nodes and $k$ edges is hard in the non-adaptive setting, requiring $\Omega\big(\min\{k^2\log n,\,n^2\}\big)$ tests even when a small error probability is allowed. We focus on learning Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) graphs $G\sim\mathrm{ER}(n,q)$ in the non-adaptive setting, where the expected number of edges is $\bar{k}=q\binom{n}{2}$, and we aim to design an efficient testing--decoding scheme achieving asymptotically vanishing error probability. Prior work (Li--Fresacher--Scarlett, NeurIPS 2019) presents a testing--decoding scheme that attains an order-optimal number of tests $O(\bar{k}\log n)$ but incurs $\Omega(n^2)$ decoding time, whereas their proposed sublinear-time algorithm incurs an extra $(\log \bar{k})(\log n)$ factor in the number of tests. We extend the binary splitting approach, recently developed for non-adaptive group testing, to the ER graph learning setting, and prove that the edge set can be recovered with high probability using $O(\bar{k}\log n)$ tests while attaining decoding time $O(\bar{k}^{1+\delta}\log n)$ for any fixed $\delta&gt;0$.</description>
