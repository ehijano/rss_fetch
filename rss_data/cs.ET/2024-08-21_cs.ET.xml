      <title>Real-Time Digital Twin Platform: A Case Study on Core Network Selection in Aeronautical Ad-Hoc Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of Digital Twins (DTs) is hindered by a lack of specialized, open-source solutions that can meet the demands of dynamic applications. This has caused state-of-the-art DT applications to be validated using offline data. However, this approach falls short of integrating real-time data, which is one of the most important characteristics of DTs. This can limit the validating effectiveness of DT applications in cases such as aeronautical ad-hoc networks (AANETs). Considering this, we develop a Real-Time Digital Twin Platform and implement core network selection in AANETs as a case study. In this, we implement microservice-based architecture and design a robust data pipeline. Additionally, we develop an interactive user interface using open-source tools. Using this, the platform supports real-time decision-making in the presence of data retrieval failures.</description>

      <title>Dependable Classical-Quantum Computer Systems Engineering</title>

Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) offers the potential to enhance traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads by leveraging the unique properties of quantum computers, leading to the emergence of a new paradigm: HPC-QC. While this integration presents new opportunities, it also brings novel challenges, particularly in ensuring the dependability of such hybrid systems. This paper aims to identify integration challenges, anticipate failures, and foster a diverse co-design for HPC-QC systems by bringing together QC, cloud computing, HPC, and network security. The focus of this emerging inter-disciplinary effort is to develop engineering principles that ensure the dependability of hybrid systems, aiming for a more prescriptive co-design cycle. Our framework will help to prevent design pitfalls and accelerate the maturation of the QC technology ecosystem. Key aspects include building resilient HPC-QC systems, analyzing the applicability of conventional techniques to the quantum domain, and exploring the complexity of scaling in such hybrid systems. This underscores the need for performance-reliability metrics specific to this new computational paradigm.</description>

      <title>Single Bridge Formation in Self-Organizing Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local interactions of uncoordinated individuals produce the collective behaviors of many biological systems, inspiring much of the current research in programmable matter. A striking example is the spontaneous assembly of fire ants into "bridges" comprising their own bodies to traverse obstacles and reach sources of food. Experiments and simulations suggest that, remarkably, these ants always form one bridge -- instead of multiple, competing bridges -- despite a lack of central coordination. We argue that the reliable formation of a single bridge does not require sophistication on behalf of the individuals by provably reproducing this behavior in a self-organizing particle system. We show that the formation of a single bridge by the particles is a statistical inevitability of their preferences to move in a particular direction, such as toward a food source, and their preference for more neighbors. Two parameters, $\eta$ and $\beta$, reflect the strengths of these preferences and determine the Gibbs stationary measure of the corresponding particle system's Markov chain dynamics. We show that a single bridge almost certainly forms when $\eta$ and $\beta$ are sufficiently large. Our proof introduces an auxiliary Markov chain, called an "occupancy chain", that captures only the significant, global changes to the system. Through the occupancy chain, we abstract away information about the motion of individual particles, but we gain a more direct means of analyzing their collective behavior. Such abstractions provide a promising new direction for understanding many other systems of programmable matter.</description>

      <title>V-RoAst: A New Dataset for Visual Road Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10872v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Road traffic crashes cause millions of deaths annually and have a significant economic impact, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper presents an approach using Vision Language Models (VLMs) for road safety assessment, overcoming the limitations of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We introduce a new task ,V-RoAst (Visual question answering for Road Assessment), with a real-world dataset. Our approach optimizes prompt engineering and evaluates advanced VLMs, including Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini. The models effectively examine attributes for road assessment. Using crowdsourced imagery from Mapillary, our scalable solution influentially estimates road safety levels. In addition, this approach is designed for local stakeholders who lack resources, as it does not require training data. It offers a cost-effective and automated methods for global road safety assessments, potentially saving lives and reducing economic burdens.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Formal Verification of Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, AI research has primarily focused on large language models (LLMs), and increasing accuracy often involves scaling up and consuming more power. The power consumption of AI has become a significant societal issue; in this context, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution. SNNs operate event-driven, like the human brain, and compress information temporally. These characteristics allow SNNs to significantly reduce power consumption compared to perceptron-based artificial neural networks (ANNs), highlighting them as a next-generation neural network technology. However, societal concerns regarding AI go beyond power consumption, with the reliability of AI models being a global issue. For instance, adversarial attacks on AI models are a well-studied problem in the context of traditional neural networks. Despite their importance, the stability and property verification of SNNs remains in the early stages of research. Most SNN verification methods are time-consuming and barely scalable, making practical applications challenging. In this paper, we introduce temporal encoding to achieve practical performance in verifying the adversarial robustness of SNNs. We conduct a theoretical analysis of this approach and demonstrate its success in verifying SNNs at previously unmanageable scales. Our contribution advances SNN verification to a practical level, facilitating the safer application of SNNs.</description>

      <title>The impact of labeling automotive AI as "trustworthy" or "reliable" on user evaluation and technology acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores whether labeling AI as "trustworthy" or "reliable" influences user perceptions and acceptance of automotive AI technologies. Using a one-way between-subjects design, the research involved 478 online participants who were presented with guidelines for either trustworthy or reliable AI. Participants then evaluated three vignette scenarios and completed a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model, which included variables such as perceived ease of use, human-like trust, and overall attitude. Although labeling AI as "trustworthy" did not significantly influence judgments on specific scenarios, it increased perceived ease of use and human-like trust, particularly benevolence. This suggests a positive impact on usability and an anthropomorphic effect on user perceptions. The study provides insights into how specific labels can influence attitudes toward AI technology.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Evolution for Sustainable Smart Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smart ecosystems are the drivers of modern society. They control infrastructures of socio-techno-economic importance, ensuring their stable and sustainable operation. Smart ecosystems are governed by digital twins -- real-time virtual representations of physical infrastructure. To support the open-ended and reactive traits of smart ecosystems, digital twins need to be able to evolve in reaction to changing conditions. However, digital twin evolution is challenged by the intertwined nature of physical and software components, and their individual evolution. As a consequence, software practitioners find a substantial body of knowledge on software evolution hard to apply in digital twin evolution scenarios and a lack of knowledge on the digital twin evolution itself. The aim of this paper, consequently, is to provide software practitioners with tangible leads toward understanding and managing the evolutionary concerns of digital twins. We use four distinct digital twin evolution scenarios, contextualized in a citizen energy community case to illustrate the usage of the 7R taxonomy of digital twin evolution. By that, we aim to bridge a significant gap in leveraging software engineering practices to develop robust smart ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Graph Neural Network-based Flow-guided Localization to Individual Bloodstreams and Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow-guided localization using in-body nanodevices in the bloodstream is expected to be beneficial for early disease detection, continuous monitoring of biological conditions, and targeted treatment. The nanodevices face size and power constraints that produce erroneous raw data for localization purposes. On-body anchors receive this data, and use it to derive the locations of diagnostic events of interest. Different Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been recently proposed for this task, yet they are currently restricted to a reference bloodstream of a resting patient. As such, they are unable to deal with the physical diversity of patients' bloodstreams and cannot provide continuous monitoring due to changes in individual patient's activities. Toward addressing these issues for the current State-of-the-Art (SotA) flow-guided localization approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose a pipeline for GNN adaptation based on individual physiological indicators including height, weight, and heart rate. Our results indicate that the proposed adaptions are beneficial in reconciling the individual differences between bloodstreams and activities.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Energy Teleportation using a 3-Qubit System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is a novel method that leverages quantum entanglement to transfer energy between two distant locations without any physical movement of the energy. The first realization of QET on superconducting hardware, utilizing a 2-qubit system, demonstrated an average energy retrieval efficiency of 11.4% by the receiver, Bob. In this paper, we present a new approach using a 3-qubit system to enhance the energy efficiency of QET. We have incorporated a novel 3-qubit ground state hamiltonian H to achieve this, that conforms the constraints of Zero mean energy. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in energy retrieval, achieving an average efficiency of 46.4%, which is significantly higher than that of the 2-qubit system. This advancement not only marks a step forward in practical quantum energy applications but also provides a new framework for future research in quantum energy teleportation and related quantum technologies.</description>
