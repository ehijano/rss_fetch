      <title>Multidimensional asymptotic classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework (multidimensional asymptotic classes, or m.a.c.s) for handling classes of finite first order structures with a strong uniformity condition on cardinalities of definable sets: The condition asserts that definable families given by a formula \phi(x,y) should take on a fixed number n_\phi of approximate sizes in any M in the class, with those sizes varying with M. The prototype is the class of all finite fields, where the uniformity is given by a theorem of Chatzidakis, van den Dries and Macintyre. It inspired the development of asymptotic classes of finite structures, which this new framework extends.
  The underlying theory of m.a.c.s is developed, including preservation under bi-interpretability, and a proof that for the m.a.c. condition to hold it suffices to consider formulas \phi(x,y) with x a single variable. Many examples of m.a.c.s are given, including 2-sorted structures (F,V) where V is a vector space over a finite field F possibly equipped with a bilinear form, and an example arising from representations of quivers of finite representation type. We also give examples and structural results for multidimensional exact classes (m.e.c.s), where the definable sets take a fixed number of precisely specified cardinalities, which again vary with M.
  We also develop a notion of infinite generalised measurable structure, whereby definable sets are assigned values in an ordered semiring. We show that any infinite ultraproduct of a m.a.c. is generalised measurable, that values can be taken in an ordered ring if the m.a.c. is a m.e.c., and explore model-theoretic consequences of generalised measurability. Such a structure cannot have the strict order property, and stability-theoretic properties can be read off from the measures in the semiring.</description>

      <title>Diagrams of opposition: an algebraic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the square of opposition and its various geometric generalizations from an algebraic viewpoint. In particular, we show how the various shapes of oppositions can be framed under an algebraic framework and we illustrate this approach with algebraic structures beyond the traditional logical structures.</description>

      <title>Semantical Analysis of Intuitionistic Modal Logics between CK and IK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intuitionistic modal logics considered between Constructive K (CK) and Intuitionistic K (IK) differ in their treatment of the possibility (diamond) connective. It was recently rediscovered that some logics between CK and IK also disagree on their diamond-free fragments, with only some remaining conservative over the standard axiomatisation of intuitionistic modal logic with necessity (box) alone. We show that relational Kripke semantics for CK can be extended with frame conditions for all axioms in the standard axiomatisation of IK, as well as other axioms previously studied. This allows us to answer open questions about the (non-)conservativity of such logics over intuitionistic modal logic without diamond. Our results are formalised using the Coq Proof Assistant.</description>

      <title>Trivial Isomorphisms between Reduced Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06731v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for showing under weak forcing axioms that reduced products of countable models of a theory $T$ have as few automorphisms as possible. We show that such forcing axioms imply that reduced products of countably infinite or finite fields, linear orders, trees, or random graphs have only trivial automorphisms. We also show that Todor\v{c}evi\'c's Open Colouring Axiom, $\mathsf{OCA}_{\mathrm{T}}$, implies that all automorphisms of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})/{\mathrm{Fin}}$ are trivial.</description>

      <title>$\Pi_{2}$-Rule Systems and Inductive Classes of G\"{o}del Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a general theory of $\Pi_{2}$-rules for systems of intuitionistic and modal logic. We introduce the notions of $\Pi_{2}$-rule system and of an Inductive Class, and provide model-theoretic and algebraic completeness theorems, which serve as our basic tools. As an illustration of the general theory, we analyse the structure of inductive classes of G\"{o}del algebras, from a structure theoretic and logical point of view. We show that unlike other well-studied settings (such as logics, or single-conclusion rule systems), there are continuum many $\Pi_{2}$-rule systems extending $\mathsf{LC}=\mathsf{IPC}+(p\rightarrow q)\vee (q\rightarrow p)$, and show how our methods allow easy proofs of the admissibility of the well-known Takeuti-Titani rule. Our final results concern general questions admissibility in $\mathsf{LC}$: (1) we present a full classification of those inductive classes which are inductively complete, i.e., where all $\Pi_{2}$-rules which are admissible are derivable, and (2) show that the problem of admissibility of $\Pi_{2}$-rules over $\mathsf{LC}$ is decidable.</description>

      <title>On the expressive power of inquisitive epistemic logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inquisitive modal logic, InqML, in its epistemic incarnation, extends standard epistemic logic to capture not just the information that agents have, but also the questions that they are interested in. We use the natural notion of bisimulation equivalence in the setting of InqML, as introduced in [Ciardelli/Otto: JSL 2021], to characterise the expressiveness of InqML as the bisimulation invariant fragment of first-order logic over natural classes of two-sorted first-order structures that arise as relational encodings of inquisitive epistemic (S5-like) models. The non-elementary nature of these classes crucially requires non-classical model-theoretic methods for the analysis of first-order expressiveness, irrespective of whether we aim for characterisations in the sense of classical or of finite model theory.</description>
