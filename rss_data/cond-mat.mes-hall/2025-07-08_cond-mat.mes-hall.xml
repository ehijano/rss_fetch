      <title>Link between Continuous and Discrete Descriptions of Noise in Nonlinear Resistive Electrical Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the modeling of a nonlinear, classical, resistive electrical component using two models: i) a continuous description based on a stochastic differential equation with a white thermal Gaussian noise; ii) a discrete, shot noise model based on a Markovian master equation. We show that thermodynamics imposes in i) the use of the H\"anggi-Klimontovich (H-K) prescription when the noise depends on bias voltage, and implies a generalized Johnson-Nyquist relation for the noise where the conductance is replaced by the ratio mean current over voltage. In ii) we show that the discrete description compatible with thermodynamics leads to the continuous one of i) with again the H-K prescription. Here the generalized Johnson-Nyquist relation for noise is recovered only at low voltage, when the continuous description is valid.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics in semiconducting devices II : Solving the Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of iterative schemes to achieve self-consistency in mean field problems such as the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation is notoriously capricious. It is particularly difficult in regimes where the non-linearities are strong such as when an electron gas in partially depleted or in presence of a large magnetic field. Here, we address this problem by mapping the self-consistent quantum-electrostatic problem onto a Non-Linear Helmoltz (NLH) equation at the cost of a small error. The NLH equation is a generalization of the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We show that one can build iterative schemes that are provably convergent by constructing a convex functional whose minimum is the seeked solution of the NLH problem. In a second step, the approximation is lifted and the exact solution of the initial problem found by iteratively updating the NLH problem until convergence. We show empirically that convergence is achieved in a handfull, typically one or two, iterations. Our set of algorithms provide a robust, precise and fast scheme for studying the effect of electrostatics in quantum nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Revealing electron-electron interactions in graphene at room temperature with the quantum twisting microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Twisting Microscope (QTM) is a groundbreaking instrument that enables energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of quantum phases via tunneling spectroscopy across twistable van der Waals heterostructures. In this work, we significantly enhance the QTMs resolution and extend its measurement capabilities to higher energies and twist angles by incorporating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a tunneling dielectric. This advancement unveils previously inaccessible signatures of the dispersion in the tunneling between two monolayer graphene (MLG) sheets, features consistent with a logarithmic correction to the linear Dirac dispersion arising from electron-electron (e-e) interactions with a fine-structure constant of alpha = 0.32. Remarkably, we find that this effect, for the first time, can be resolved even at room temperature, where these corrections are extremely faint. Our results underscore the exceptional resolution of the QTM, which, through interferometric interlayer tunneling, can amplify even subtle modifications to the electronic band structure of two-dimensional materials. Our findings reveal that strong e-e interactions persist even in symmetric, nonordered graphene states and emphasize the QTMs unique ability to probe spectral functions and their excitations of strongly correlated ground states across a broad range of twisted and untwisted systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence of topological Kondo insulating state in MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) are topologically protected insulating states induced not by single-particle band inversions, but by the Kondo interaction between itinerant electrons and a lattice of local magnetic moments. Although experiments have suggested the emergence of three-dimensional (3D) TKIs in the rare earth compound SmB6, its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart has not been demonstrated to date. Here we report experimental evidence of a TKI in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers, which support a Kondo lattice with topologically nontrivial Kondo interactions. We prepare in a dual-gated device a triangular lattice Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer Kondo-coupled to a half-filled itinerant band in the WSe2 layer. Combined transport and compressibility measurements show that the prepared state supports metallic transport at high temperatures and, at low temperatures, an insulating bulk with conducting helical edge states protected by spin-Sz conservation. The presence of Kondo singlets is further evidenced by their breakdown at high magnetic fields. Such behaviors are in stark contrast to the simple metallic state when the Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer is depleted by gating. Our results open the door for exploring tunable topological Kondo physics in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Quantized Topological States and Parity Anomaly in Intrinsic Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulator MnBi2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When thinned down to just a few atomic layers, the layered magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 offers an exceptional platform for exploring a wide range of topological phenomena. In this work, we overcome longstanding challenges in synthesizing high-purity MnBi2Te4 crystals and report the observation of a myriad of quantized topological states in high-quality five-septuple-layer (5-SL) samples under magnetic fields up to 45 Tesla. We show that the nontrivial topology of 5-SL MnBi2Te4, in the presence of Landau quantization, is governed by a generalized topological index rooted in the parity anomaly of Dirac fermions in (2+1) dimensions. The anomaly manifests as an anomalous Landau level, giving rise to gate-tunable helical edge transport. Our results establish high-quality MnBi2Te4 as a robust platform for exploring emergent topological states and for advancing novel quantum device applications.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Antiferromagnetic Lifting of Spin-Valley Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and control of spin- and valley-polarization in antiferromagnets (AFMs) have garnered increasing attention due to their potential for enabling faster and more stable multifunctional spintronic and valleytronic memory and logic devices. However, the two primary categories of AFMs, altermagnets and TP-symmetric AFMs, either lack intrinsic valley-polarization or net spin-polarization. Here, we propose an effective approach for achieving spontaneous spin-valley polarization in TP-broken layered ferroelectric antiferromagnets (FE-AFMs). The FE-AFMs exhibit lifted spin degeneracy across the entire Brillouin zone, along with uncompensated spin density of states. They combine the benefits of spin-polarization in altermagnets with valley-polarization in TP-symmetric AFMs. Furthermore, the FE-AFMs feature layer-dependent spin-polarization, rooted in their intrinsic ferroelectric property, allowing for the flexible control over spin-valley polarization by interlayer sliding. This tunability facilitates sign-reversible and size-tunable valley Hall and Nernst effects, along with other spin-valley-dependent transport properties. Our findings are demonstrated in a broad class of TP-broken bilayer antiferromagnets such as Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br, I), VX2 (X = S, Se), and VSi2X4 (X = N, P), underscoring the potential of FE-AFMs for advancing next-generation spin- and valley-based information technologies.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field induced exciton spin dynamics in indirect band gap (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exciton recombination and spin dynamics are investigated both experimentally and theoretically in an ensemble of indirect band gap (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots (QDs) with type-I band alignment. The magnetic-field-induced circular polarization of the time-integrated photoluminescence changes sign across the emission spectrum with a width reflecting the QD size. It is negative on the low energy side, i.e. for emission from large QDs, but positive on the high energy side, i.e. for emission from small QDs. However, the exciton g factor, measured by spin-flip Raman scattering, is positive across the whole QD ensemble. The magnetic-field-induced circular polarization of the photoluminescence dynamics is studied as function of the magnetic field strength and direction. The dynamics are non-monotonic over a time range up to milliseconds. The time dependence of the photoluminescence circular polarization degree and sign strongly depends on the emission energy and changes with magnetic field orientation. The observed nonmonotonic behavior is provided by the interplay of bright and dark exciton states, contributing to the emission. The experiment is interpreted using a kinetic theory, which accounts for the dynamics of the spin states in the exciton level quartet in longitudinal and tilted magnetic fields, the radiative recombination processes, and the redistribution of the excitons between these states as result of spin relaxation. The model allows us to evaluate the electron and heavy hole spin relaxation times in QDs with different sizes.</description>

      <title>Enhancing thermoelectric efficiency of multilayer graphene by nanomeshing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanostructuring materials at small scales enables control over their physical properties, revealing behaviors not observed at larger dimensions. This strategy is particularly effective in two-dimensional (2D) materials, where surface effects dominate, and has been applied in the thermoelectric field. Here, we use multilayer graphene (4-6 nm thick) as a test platform to study the effect of nanomeshing on its thermoelectric properties. The nanomesh consists of a hexagonal array of holes, with a measured diameter and neck-width of ~360 nm and ~160 nm, respectively. The multilayer graphene is integrated into field-effect transistor-like devices supported by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), allowing simultaneous electric and thermoelectric measurements, with nanomeshing applied to only part of the material. We use modulated thermoreflectance to investigate thermal transport in equivalent nanomeshed and pristine graphene flakes, extracting key parameters that affect thermoelectric performance. The nanomesh geometry suppresses thermal transport without significantly impacting charge transport, highlighting the different scattering lengths of phonons and electrons while enhancing the thermopower response. We observe a twofold improvement in the device power factor, PF = S^2 sigma (with S the Seebeck coefficient and sigma the electrical conductivity), at room temperature, along with a nearly threefold reduction in thermal conductivity k. The results show that nanomeshing can significantly improve the thermoelectric performance of multilayer graphene, paving the way for novel energy conversion strategies using 2D materials.</description>

      <title>A Molecule with Half-M\"obius Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereoisomers of C13Cl2 exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation. We resolved chiral geometries of the closed-shell singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. The {\pi}-orbital basis of the singlets twists by 90{\deg} in one circulation, which is consistent with a half-M\"obius topology. In such a topology, the {\pi}-orbital basis is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations, corresponding to a quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition, implying a Berry phase of {\pi}/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-M\"obius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet isomer.</description>

      <title>Phonon-enhanced optical spin-conductivity and spin-splitter effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collinear antiferromagnets with nonrelativistic spin-split bands and no net magnetization, called altermagnets, show interesting transport properties due to their unique band structure. We here compute the linear response optical conductivity of thin films of such materials in the presence of phonon scatterings. Using a tight-binding lattice model for altermagnets and the Holstein model for the phonon sector, we find that the electron-phonon scatterings can strongly increase the spin conductivity at finite frequencies. This occurs despite the fact that the self-energy describing the electron-phonon interactions is spin-independent. Interestingly, we show that electron-phonon scattering also enhances the spin-splitter effect at finite frequencies. These results suggest that altermagnets with strong electron-phonon coupling are favorable with regard to AC spin-polarized transport.</description>

      <title>On-chip magnon polaron generation in mode-matched cavity magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of magnon polarons, which are hybridized states resulting from strong magnon-phonon coupling, is a key to enabling coherent manipulation in acoustic and spintronic devices. However, the conventional device configuration, a magnetic thin film on a thick piezoelectric layer, often has difficulty achieving a large magnon-phonon coupling due to a very small spatial mode overlap. Here, we demonstrate generation of magnon polarons by using a mode-matched on-chip magnomechanical system. A configuration with a thin piezoelectric film on a magnetic layer several micrometers thick was found to sustain deeply distributed magnon modes that enable magnetoelastic coupling to phonons over almost the entire mode volume. The enhanced spatial mode overlap generated magnon polarons whose spectra showed distinct avoided crossing. This magnomechanical system will facilitate utilization of coherent magnon-phonon conversion and their hybrid states in functional phononic devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically investigate an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer with two superconducting terminals and a strongly correlated quantum dot in one arm. Through a rigorous derivation, we prove that this double-path interferometer is spectrally equivalent to a simpler system: an interacting quantum dot coupled to a non-interacting side-coupled proximitized mode and a semiconductor lead. This equivalence reveals a simple interpretation of the interferometer's behavior through the competition of a geometric factor $\chi$, a key parameter characterizing the anomalous part of the hybridization function, with the properties of the side-coupled mode. We identify the conditions for the formation of doublet chimney in the phase diagrams in more general setting. Moreover, we show how the obtained Andreev bound state spectra clearly indicate the presence of Josephson diode effect generated by interferometric phenomena.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction textures in twisted bilayer graphene from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments probing the wavefunctions of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we perform large-scale first-principles calculations of tBLG with full atomic relaxation across a wide range of twist angles down to $0.99^\circ$. Focusing on the magic angle, we compute wavefunctions of the low energy bands, resolving atomic-scale details and moir\'e-scale patterns that form triangular, honeycomb, and Kagome lattices. By tuning the interlayer interactions, we illustrate the formation of the flat bands from isolated monolayers and the emergence of the band inversion and fragile topology at a sufficiently large interaction strength. We identify strong indicators of a new topological phase transition with increasing interlayer interaction strength, achievable with external pressure or a decrease in the twist angle. When this transition occurs, the upper and lower flat bands exchange their wavefunction character, which may explain why superconductivity appears with electron doping below the magic angle. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using first-principles wavefunctions to help interpret experimental signatures of topological and correlated phases in tBLG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose schemes for unambiguous direct observation of Anderson orthogonality catastrophe (AOC) effects in a quantum dot coupled to a charge detector, and to estimate the strength of the AOC exponent $\alpha$. We show that certain easy-to-measure observables have a robust dependence on $\alpha$ in the non-equilibrium regimes of source-drain voltage bias or thermal imbalance.

      <title>Thermodynamics of analogue black holes in a non-Hermitian tight-binding model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-Hermitian model with gain/loss and non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor hopping that emulates black-hole physics. The model describes a one-dimensional lattice with a smooth connection between regions with distinct hopping parameters. By mapping the system to an effective Schwarzschild metric in the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand coordinates, we find that the interface is analogue to a black-hole event horizon. We obtain emission rates for particles and antiparticles, the Hawking temperature, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the mass of the analogue black hole as a function of the interface sharpness and the system parameters. An experimental realization of the theoretical model is proposed, thus opening the way to the detection of elusive black-hole features.</description>

      <title>Polariton transport in 2D semiconductors: Phonon-mediated transitions between ballistic, superdiffusive and exciton-limited regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton transport in 2D semiconductors holds promise for room-temperature, ultra-compact optoelectronic devices, but it is limited by short propagation distances. Hybridization of excitons with cavity photons to form exciton-polaritons can enhance the propagation by orders of magnitude, enabling a coherent, ballistic transport. However, a microscopic understanding of the role of phonons is still lacking, particularly regarding their influence on the crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive polariton transport regime. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal polariton dynamics in \ce{MoSe2} monolayers at moderate to high temperatures, explicitly including the phonon-mediated coupling to the intervalley exciton reservoir. We identify three distinct transport regimes: (i) an initial sub-ps ballistic-like regime characterized by a phonon-induced velocity renormalization, (ii) a transient, few-ps superdiffusive regime characterized by strongly enhanced diffusion, and (iii) a slower, exciton-limited diffusion following thermalization. The gained microscopic insights will trigger and guide future experimental studies on the phonon-mediated polariton transport in atomically thin semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Switchable Half-Quantized Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating ferroelectricity, antiferromagnetism, and topological quantum transport within a single material is rare, but crucial for developing next-generation quantum devices. Here, we propose a multiferroic heterostructure consisting of an antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer and an Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film is able to harbor the half-quantized Hall (HQH) effect with a ferroelectrically switchable Hall conductivity of $e^2/2h$. We first show that, in the energetically stable configuration, the antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer opens a gap in the top surface bands of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ through proximity effect, while its bottom surface bands remain gapless; consequently, HQH conductivity of $e^2/2h$ can be sustained clockwise or counterclockwise depending on antiferromagnetic configuration of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Remarkably, when applying interlayer sliding within the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer, its electric polarization direction associated with parity-time reversal symmetry breaking is reversed, accompanied by a reversal of the HQH conductivity. The proposed approach offers a powerful route to control topological quantum transport in antiferromagnetic materials by ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>On-Device Control of Electronic Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friction causes mechanical energy dissipation and material degradation in machinery and devices. While phononic friction is well understood via anharmonic lattice dynamics, the physics of electronic friction remains unclear due to challenges in separating electronic degrees of freedom from phononic ones in experiments and analyzing the non-equilibrium interactions between ionic movement and electronic dynamics in theory. To tackle this problem, we construct a sliding device featuring 2D crystalline interfaces that possess ultra-smooth and minimally interacting surfaces, achieving the state of structural superlubricity with no wear and minimal friction. Using electrical and mechanical controls, we tuned the nature of interfacial electronic coupling and charge densities in materials in an on-device setting, which allows us to disentangle the electron and phonon contributions to friction. Our experimental data and theoretical analysis supported by first-principles calculations demonstrate that electronic friction can well surpass phononic contributions and dominate energy dissipation at structural superlubricity contacts. These findings offer fresh insights into the mechanism of electronic friction and promising opportunities for friction control in device applications.</description>

      <title>Prediction of High-Temperature Half Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in a Semi-magnetic Topological Insulator of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs theorem dictates that a single electron band of a lattice can only harbor an integer quantum Hall conductance as a multiple of e^2/2h, while recent studies have pointed to the emergence of half quantum anomalous Hall (HQAH) effect, though the underlying microscopic mechanisms remain controversial. Here we propose an ideal platform of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$ that allows not only to realize the HQAH effect at much higher temperatures, but also to critically assess the different contributions of the gapped and gapless Dirac bands. We first show that the top surface bands of the Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film become gapped, while the bottom surface bands remain gapless due to proximity coupling with the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ overlayer. Next we show that such a semi-magnetic topological insulator harbors the HQAH effect at ~20 K, with Cr doping enhancing it to as high as 67 K, driven by large magnetic anisotropy and strong magnetic coupling constants that raise the Curie temperature. Our detailed Berry curvature analysis further helps to reveal that, whereas the gapped surface bands can contribute to the Hall conductance when the chemical potential is tuned to overlap with the bands, these bands have no net contribution when the chemical potential is in the gapped region, leaving the gapless bands to be the sole contributor to the HQAH conductance. Counterintuitively, the part of the gapless bands within the gapped region of the top surface bands have no net contribution, thereby ensuring the plateau nature of the Hall conductance.</description>

      <title>Electrons in quantum dots on helium: from charge qubits to synthetic color centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons trapped above the surface of helium provide a means to study many-body physics free from the randomness that comes from defects in other condensed-matter systems. Localizing an electron in an electrostatic quantum dot makes its energy spectrum discrete, with controlled level spacing. The lowest two states can act as charge qubit states. In this paper, we study how the coupling to the quantum field of capillary waves on helium -- ripplons -- affects electron dynamics. As we show, the coupling can be strong. This bounds the parameter range where electron-based charge qubits can be implemented. The constraint is different from the conventional relaxation time constraint. The electron-ripplon system in a dot is similar to a color center formed by an electron defect coupled to phonons in a solid. In contrast to solids, the coupling in the electron on helium system can be varied from strong to weak. This enables a qualitatively new approach to studying color center physics. We analyze the spectroscopy of the pertinent synthetic color centers in a broad range of the coupling strength</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents for the first time the investigation of a novel class of functionalized graphene showing a large Voltage Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy Effect (VCMA) with enhanced Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC), which holds promise for applications in Spintronics devices aimed at ultra-low power memory and logic functionalities. Our study was conducted at the interface of Single Layer chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method-grown graphene (SLG hereafter) grafted with Platinum(II) 5,10,15,30-(tetraphenyl) porphyrin (Pt-Porphyrin hereafter) and NiFe(Py hereafter). The stability of Pt-Porphyrin functionalized SLG at room temperature granted the execution of voltage-dependent Spin Torque Ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements. A substantial VCMA coefficient of 375.6 (fJV-1m-1) was determined at the interface, and the Spin torque efficiency ({\theta}sh) was improved by an order of one in functionalized graphene to compare with pristine SLG</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Enhancement and Hierarchical Scaling in One-Dimensional Quasiperiodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum metric, a key component of quantum geometry, plays a central role in a wide range of physical phenomena and has been extensively studied in periodic crystals and moir\'{e} materials. Here, we systematically investigate quantum geometry in one-dimensional (1D) quasiperiodic systems and uncover novel properties that fundamentally distinguish them from both periodic crystals and disordered media. Our comparative analysis reveals that quasiperiodicity significantly enhances the quantum metric -- despite the absence of translational symmetry -- due to the presence of critical wavefunctions with long-range spatial correlations. In the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, we show that the quantum metric serves as a sensitive probe of localization transitions, exhibiting sharp changes at the critical point and distinct behaviors near mobility edges. In the Fibonacci chain, characterized by a singular continuous spectrum, we discover an anomalous enhancement of the quantum metric when the Fermi level lies within the minimal gaps of the fractal energy spectrum. Using a perturbative renormalization group framework, we trace this enhancement to the hierarchical structure of the spectrum and the bonding-antibonding nature of critical states across narrow gaps. Our findings establish a fundamental connection between wavefunction criticality, spectral fractality, and quantum geometry, suggesting quasiperiodic systems as promising platforms for engineering enhanced quantum geometric properties beyond conventional crystalline paradigms.</description>

      <title>Spin-split magnon bands induce pure spin current in insulating altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets offer a promising platform for dissipationless spin transport by combining zero net magnetization with spontaneous non-relativistic spin splitting. However, their magnonic transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum-kinetic theory for thermally driven magnon currents that cleanly separates Berry-curvature-driven intrinsic contributions from Drude-like scattering-dependent terms. Applying this framework to a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we reveal spin-split magnon bands that support both intrinsic and extrinsic spin Nernst and Seebeck currents. For realistic parameters, we predict a sizable magnon spin-splitting angle (about 3.3 degrees) and a pure transverse spin current capable of exerting a strong spin-splitter torque suitable for magnetization switching.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of tunable periodic structures, formed by launching two obliquely propagating surface acoustic waves on a piezoelectric substrate that supports a two-dimensional quantum material. The resulting acoustoelectric superlattice exhibits two salient features. First, its periodicity is widely tunable, spanning a length scale intermediate between moir\'e superlattices and optical lattices, enabling the formation of narrow, topologically nontrivial energy bands. Second, unlike moir\'e systems, where the superlattice amplitude is set by intrinsic interlayer tunneling and lattice relaxation, the amplitude of the acoustoelectric potential is externally tunable via the surface acoustic wave power. Using massive monolayer graphene as an example, we demonstrate that varying the frequencies and power of the surface acoustic waves enables in-situ control over the band structure of the 2D material, generating flat bands and nontrivial valley Chern numbers, featuring a highly localized Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Coexistent multifractal mesoscopic fluctuations in Integer Quantum Hall Transition and in Orbital Hall Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the integer quantum Hall transition in a disordered nanowire with orbital momentum-space texture connected to four terminals is accompanied by an orbital Hall transition. We applied a multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and found that both conductance fluctuations in the integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) and orbital-conductance fluctuations in the orbital Hall transition (OHT) display multifractal behavior. We argue that this multifractality is primarily related to disorder, which gives rise to the strong fluctuations that are fingerprints of IQHT and OHT, but is also a consequence of the fact that the nanowire has finite size, which causes a weakening of the multifractality in a certain range of values of disorder strength followed by a new regime of increasing multifractality with increasing disorder strength. Furthermore, our findings indicate that OHT can bring novel insights to future IQHT analysis.</description>

      <title>Efficient transport of indirect excitons in a van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton transport is fundamental for understanding transport phenomena in bosonic systems and for embracing excitation energy transfer in materials. Spatially indirect excitons (IXs) are composed of electrons and holes in separated layers. Long IX lifetimes allow them to form quantum bosonic states and travel long distances. In this work, we measured IX transport in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure by time-resolved photoluminescence imaging. These measurements probe the kinetics of IX cloud expansion and reveal the transport characteristics. We found IX transport with anomalously high diffusivity, orders of magnitude higher than for regular diffusive exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures. This efficient IX transport agrees with long-range ballistic transport and is consistent with the Bose-Hubbard theory prediction of superfluid in moire superlattices.</description>

      <title>Quantized conductance in a CVD-grown nanoribbon with hidden Rashba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized conductance in quasi-one-dimensional systems not only provides a hallmark of ballistic transport, but also serves as a gateway for exploring quantum phenomena. Recently, a unique hidden Rashba effect attracts tremendous attention, which arises from the compensation of opposite spin polarizations of a Rashba bilayer in inversion symmetric crystals with dipole fields, such as bismuth oxyselenide ($\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$). However, investigating this effect utilizing conductance quantization is still challenging. Here we report the conductance quantization observed in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown high-mobility $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$ nanoribbon, where quantized conductance plateaus up to $44\cdot 2e^{2}/{h}$ ($e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is the Planck constant, and the factor $2$ results from spin degeneracy) are achieved at zero magnetic field. Due to the hidden Rashba effect, the quantized conductance remains in multiples of $2e^{2}/{h}$ without Zeeman splitting even under magnetic field up to $12$ T. Moreover, within a specific range of magnetic field, the plateau sequence exhibits the Pascal triangle series, namely $(1,3,6,10,15\dots )\cdot 2e^{2}/{h}$, reflecting the interplay of size quantization in two transverse directions. These observations are well captured by an effective hidden Rashba bilayer model. Our results demonstrate $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$ as a compelling platform for spintronics and the investigation of emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Induced Zeeman effect of moir\'e surface states in topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, moir\'e superlattices have been found on the surface of topological insulators due to the rotational misalignment of topmost layers. In this work, we study the effects of moir\'e superlattices on the Landau levels of topological surface states. We find that an extra Zeeman term besides the intrinsic one can be induced by the orbital effect of the magnetic field in moir\'e surface states. As a result, the originally field-independent zeroth Landau level of moir\'e surface states could be tilted by the out-of-plane magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded pi-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials which are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupling in digital alloyed InGaAs quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the spin-orbit coupling in InGaAs quantum wells is desirable for applications involving spintronics and topological quantum computing. Digital alloying is an approach towards growing ternary quantum wells that enables asymmetric interfaces and compositional grading in the quantum well, which can potentially modify the spin-orbit coupling in the quantum well. The spin-orbit coupling of the quantum wells is extracted from beating patterns in the low magnetic field magnetoresistance. Digital alloying is found to modify the spin-orbit coupling by up to 138 meV\textnormal{\AA}. The changes induced in the spin-orbit coupling can be qualitatively understood as being due to modifications in the interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Variability of hole spin qubits in planar Germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hole spin qubits in Ge/GeSi heterostructures benefit from the clean environment of epitaxial interfaces and from the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling that enables efficient electrical control, which makes them promising candidates for quantum computation. However, spin-orbit coupling also enhances the sensitivity to electrical disorder, potentially increasing variability. In this work, we perform numerical simulations in a realistic device geometry to quantify the variability of the charge and spin properties of Ge qubits induced by charge traps at the SiGe/oxide interfaces. We show that while the variability of charge properties remains moderate, spin properties (g-factors and Rabi frequencies) show significant dispersion. We explore the implications of this variability for large-scale architectures, and provide guidelines to minimize variability both in terms of interface quality requirements and optimal operation strategies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe momentum transfer in the ponderomotive potential of near-infrared (NIR) laser pulses in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) experiments with ultrashort extreme ultraviolet probe pulses. Acceleration of photoelectrons in the transient grating provided by an intense laser pulse reflected at a surface leads to delay-dependent oscillations of electric kinetic energies. Photon and electron momenta determine the oscillation frequency. We experimentally observe and theoretically simulate electron yield modulations driven by a novel electron-energy bunching effect. Measurement results are simulated and fitted with high accuracy. Complete reversion of the ponderomotive momentum transfer allows for retrieval of the undisturbed initial state and the transient band structure for overlapping pump and probe pulses.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Induced Chiral Currents in a Mesoscopic Helicoidal Quantum Well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mesoscopic quantum well whose confinement and chirality emerge solely from the intrinsic torsion of a finite helicoidal metric. This purely geometric construction requires no external gates or fields: the metric itself induces both a harmonic radial potential and a torsion-driven Zeeman term that breaks the $m \leftrightarrow -m$ degeneracy. By imposing hard-wall boundary conditions at $z = \pm L/2$, we quantize the axial motion and obtain a genuinely zero-dimensional helicoidal quantum dot. An exact analytic solution reveals an energy spectrum with chiral splitting linear in both the torsion parameter $\Omega$ and the axial quantum number $n_z$. For realistic InAs nanoroll parameters ($L = 100$ nm, $\Omega = 5\times10^{6} \mathrm{m^{-1}}$), this geometric effect results in a measurable splitting of $\sim 0.5$ meV. We propose three viable experimental platforms, ultracold atoms in optical traps, femtosecond-written photonic waveguides, and strain-engineered semiconductor nanorolls, where this torsion-induced phenomenon should be accessible with current technology.</description>

      <title>Topological defect modes in bilayer acoustic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence, which relates topological properties of a material in the bulk to the presence of robust modes localized on the edge, is at the core of the now mature field of topological wave physics. More recently, it was realized that in crystalline structures, certain types of defects can host localized modes, in which case the bulk-boundary correspondence has to be replaced by a bulk-defect correspondence. These defect-localized modes are expected to have robust properties owing to their topological origin. In this work, we show how to obtain topological defect modes in a lattice possessing both mirror and chiral symmetry. The defect is obtained by endowing a plaquette with a non-trivial gauge flux. We show that the bulk-defect correspondence is satisfied by introducing appropriate topological invariants. Moreover, the topological defect modes are shown to be highly robust to the introduction of symmetry-preserving disorder. The model is then realized in an acoustic system made of a network of tubes, and the presence of topological defect mode is experimentally clearly demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Statistical characterization of valley coupling in Si/SiGe quantum dots via $g$-factor measurements near a valley vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of low-energy valley excitations in Si/SiGe heterostructures often causes spin qubits to fail. It is therefore important to develop robust protocols for characterizing the valley coupling. Here, we show that realistically sized samplings of valley energy distributions tend to dramatically overestimate the average valley coupling. But we find that knowledge of the valley phase, in addition to the valley splitting, can significantly improve our estimates. Motivated by this understanding, we propose a novel method to probe the valley phase landscape across the quantum well using simple $g$-factor measurements. An important calibration step in this procedure is to measure $g$ in a loop enclosing a valley vortex, where the valley phase winds by $\pm 2\pi$ around a zero of the valley splitting. This proposal establishes an important new tool for probing spin qubits, and it can be implemented in current experiments.</description>

      <title>Defect-induced displacement of topological surface state in quantum magnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological magnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT), with gapped topological surface state, is an attractive platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall and Axion insulator states. However, the experimentally observed surface state gaps fail to meet theoretical predictions, although the exact mechanism behind the gap suppression has been debated. Recent theoretical studies suggest that intrinsic antisite defects push the topological surface state away from the MBT surface, closing its gap and making it less accessible to scanning probe experiments. Here, we report on the local effect of defects on the MBT surface states and demonstrate that high defect concentrations lead to a displacement of the surface states well into the MBT crystal, validating the theorized mechanism. The local and global influence of antisite defects on the topological surface states are studied with samples of varying defect densities by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), and density functional theory (DFT). Our findings identify a combination of increased defect density and reduced defect spacing as the primary factors underlying the displacement of the surface states and suppression of surface gap, shedding light to further development of topological quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e excitons and exciton-polaritons: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moir\'e excitons provide a fertile territory for realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moir\'e excitons hybridize with photons to form moir\'e exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features.
  In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moir\'e excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moir\'e patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moir\'e polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moir\'e excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.</description>

      <title>Tunable Intraband and Interband Polarizability in three-dimensional nodal line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarizability plays an essential role in characterizing the key phenomena, such as the screening effects, collective excitations, and dielectric functions present in the system. In this study, we investigate the intraband and interband polarizability within the random phase approximation for the three-dimensional nodal line semimetals, specifically for Ca$_3$P$_2$ and ZrSiS. We find both intraband and interband contributions show tunable behavior with the chemical potential, which adds a resonance signature in the behavior of the polarizability. Further, in the long wavelength limit, the results reveal the quadratic dependence on the wave vector by the non-resonant intraband and interband parts of the polarizability. On the other hand, the resonant interband part gives a cubic dependence on the wave vector. In addition, the total polarizability is dominated by the intraband part in the low frequency regime, while in the mid and high frequency regimes, the interband part takes the lead. This study opens avenues for further theoretical and experimental exploration of frequency dependent dielectric properties, paving the way for potential applications in tunable plasmonic devices.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle energies and excitonic effects of {\alpha}-RuCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {\alpha}-phase Ruthenium (III) chloride ({\alpha}-RuCl3) has attracted significant attention because of its potential for realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquid. In this work, we employ first-principles many-body perturbation theory to study its many-electron interactions and excited-state properties. We find enhanced many-electron interactions that dominate quasiparticle energies and optical responses in {\alpha}-RuCl3. Our calculated quasiparticle band gap of bulk structure is about 1.75 eV that agrees well with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, our calculated first and second primary bright excitons are located at 1.23 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively. These excitons show good consistency with the main features observed in the optical absorption spectrum. We extend our investigation to monolayer {\alpha}-RuCl3, examining the zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases. In addition to significant excitonic effects, the optical spectrum of the zigzag AFM phase exhibits anisotropic behavior, while the FM phase demonstrates isotropic characteristics. The different optical response behaviors provide an efficient approach to identify the energy nearly degenerate magnetic states, which can both potentially exist in fabricated samples.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Spike Geometry on the Linear and Nonlinear Plasmonic Properties of Gold Nanourchins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wet-chemistry synthesized Gold nanourchins (Au NUs), characterized by spiky morphologies with spherical cores, exhibit complex and geometry-dependent plasmonic properties distinct from those of symmetrical nanostructures. While plasmon hybridization and mode coupling in branched nanostructures have been broadly studied, the specific optical behavior of Au NUs-particularly regarding spike length distribution and ultrafast dynamics-remains underexplored. This study investigates the steady-state and transient absorption spectra of Au NUs with 50-80 nm cores and 5-20 nm spikes, revealing multiple resonance bands. Transient absorption spectroscopy at various excitation wavelengths confirmed the presence of distinct resonances. Electromagnetic simulations based on TEM tomography-inspired models identified two key extinction bands: a green-wavelength dark mode resonance and a red-nIR spike-induced resonance attributed to the lightning rod effect. Simulations further showed that short, uniformly distributed spikes (aspect ratio &lt;= 1) weakly excite dark resonances, while longer spikes (aspect ratio &gt; 1) induce hybridized longitudinal resonances and significant redshifts. Broad spike length distributions result in multiple coexisting resonances, aligning with experimental extinction spectra. A preliminary surface-enhanced Raman scattering study using 2-naphthalene thiol confirmed stronger enhancement for long-spiked Au NUs under 785 nm excitation, validating the field enhancement potential of the identified resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Seebeck effect, nonlinear conversion of a temperature gradient into an electric current, was observed at room temperature. Based on a second-harmonic lock-in method combined with an a.c. temperature gradient, $\nabla T$, we measured a nonlinear Seebeck voltage in NiFe|Pt bilayers at 300 K, the amplitude of which increases in proportion to $(\nabla T)^2$. We also observed that the nonlinear Seebeck voltage increases as the sample length along the $\nabla T$ direction decreases, showing a characteristic scaling law distinct from the conventional linear Seebeck effect. We developed a phenomenological model for the nonlinear Seebeck effect incorporating the spin-current induced modulation of the Seebeck coefficient, which well reproduces the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Determining the complex second-order optical susceptibility in macroscale van der Waals heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of the second-order susceptibility in MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayers, including their hidden complex phases. To this end, we developed a heterodyne-detection scheme for second-harmonic generation and applied it to macroscale heterobilayer samples prepared using the gold-tape exfoliation method. The heterodyne scheme enabled us to distinguish the relative orientation of the crystal domains, and further, it allowed us to characterize the complex phases of the susceptibility relative to a reference quartz sample. By comparing the results from the monolayer regions and the heterobilayer region over several hundred microns of the sample area, we determined that the contribution of interlayer effects to second-harmonic generation is within the experimental uncertainty arising from the sample inhomogeneity. The results here provide fundamental quantitative information necessary for the precise design of nanophotonic systems based on stacking engineering.</description>

Abstract: In recent decades, the growth of ultrathin epitaxial bismuth (Bi) films on various substrates has garnered interest due to their topological, thermoelectric, and even ferroelectric properties. We report upon the growth and transport properties of epitaxial Bi (0001) films in the thickness range of 5-32 nm deposited directly on GaAs (111) substrates, without a buffer layer. The quality of Bi films are found to depend on conditions for substrate treatment using Ar+ ion-milling and annealing. Substrates milled at low ion beam currents display poor surface reconstruction after annealing, which hinders the growth of high-quality films. In contrast, substrates milled under optimized conditions led to reconstructed surfaces upon annealing, resulting in epitaxial Bi films with predominantly single-domain orientation. Although epitaxial films formed in both cases, transport measurements indicated significantly higher conductivity for films grown on optimally treated substrates. Measurements at low temperatures suggest that the transport properties are dominated by a surface state. Magneto-transport measurements suggest that conductivity and mobility improve progressively with increasing film thickness. Remarkably, our 5 nm Bi film demonstrated resilience to ambient conditions without oxidation, with transport properties similar to those of bilayer Bi films grown by confinement heteroepitaxy in other studies. These results provide a robust methodology for growing high-quality epitaxial Bi films on GaAs (111) and offer insights into their unique transport properties.</description>

      <title>Optimising germanium hole spin qubits with a room-temperature magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germanium spin qubits exhibit strong spin-orbit interaction, which allow for high-fidelity qubit control, but also provide a strong dependence on the magnetic field. Superconducting vector magnets are often used to minimize dephasing due to hyperfine interactions and to maximize spin control, but these compromise the sample space and thus challenge scalability. Here, we explore whether a permanent magnet outside the cryostat can be used as an alternative. Operating in a hybrid mode with an internal and external magnet, we find that we can fine-tune the magnetic field to an in-plane orientation. We obtain a qubit dephasing time T2*=13 microseconds, Hahn-echo times T2H=88 microseconds, and an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity above 99.9%, from which we conclude that room temperature magnets allow for high qubit performance. Furthermore, we probe the qubit resonance frequency using only the external magnet, with the internal superconducting magnet switched off. Our approach may be used to scale semiconductor qubits and use the increased sample space for the integration of cryogenic control circuitry and wiring to advance to large-scale quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Structural and Magnetic Properties of Barium Hexaferrite Nanoplatelets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining unique geometric and magnetic anisotropy in barium hexaferrites has the potential to enhance the performance of advanced technological applications, such as data storage, spintronics, and medicine. Here, we report the synthesis and deposition of barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets, followed by comprehensive structural and magnetic microscopies. The topographic, physical, and morphological properties of individual nanoplatelets, clusters, and aggregates are analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron microscopy, while magnetic properties are analysed using magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Relevant size distributions and nanoparticle configurations for magnetic interactions have been experimentally identified and numerically analyzed. For dense nanoparticle arrangements, direct exchange coupling dominates with parallel magnetisation configuration in overlapping particles. In contrast, separated particles exhibit anti-parallel coupling. Detailed micro-magnetic modelling elucidates the length scales over which these two interaction regimes are dominant, paving the way for macroscopic two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures with tuned magnetic ordering.</description>

      <title>Chirality-dependent terahertz topological resonance and inertial dynamics of magnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the terahertz (THz) optical response of magnetic skyrmions governed by an inertial-modified Thiele equation. By incorporating the inertial mass term, we derive analytical expressions for the THz absorption spectrum of skyrmions, revealing a topological resonance phenomenon tunable via the skyrmion's topological charge $Q$, damping factor $\alpha$, and effective mass $m$. The resonance frequency $\omega_0 \propto Q/m$ emerges from the interplay between gyroscopic coupling and inertial mass, enabling precise control over skyrmion dynamics through circularly polarized THz fields. Our results demonstrate that the helical motion trajectories and velocity components of skyrmions depend on the chirality of light and the topological charge $Q$, with critical damping $\alpha_c$ marking the transition to overdamped regimes. Our findings establish an optical method for designing tunable THz devices, such as topological filters and detectors, by exploiting the interplay between magnetic skyrmion topology and the chirality of THz light coupling.</description>

      <title>High-power readout of a transmon qubit using a nonlinear coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of superconducting qubits is constantly evolving with new circuit designs. However, when it comes to qubit readout, the use of simple transverse linear coupling remains overwhelmingly prevalent. This standard readout scheme has significant drawbacks: in addition to the Purcell effect, it suffers from a limitation on the maximal number of photons in the readout mode, which restricts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) nature of the readout. Here, we explore the high-power regime by engineering a nonlinear coupling between a transmon qubit and its readout mode. Our approach builds upon previous work by Dassonneville et al. [Physical Review X 10, 011045 (2020)], on qubit readout with a non-perturbative cross-Kerr coupling in a transmon molecule. We demonstrate a readout fidelity of 99.21% with 89 photons utilizing a parametric amplifier. At this elevated photon number, the QND nature remains high at 96.7%. Even with up to 300 photons, the QNDness is only reduced by a few percent. This is qualitatively explained by deriving a critical number of photons associated to the nonlinear coupling, yielding a theoretical value of $\bar{n}_r^\text{crit} = 377$ photons for our sample's parameters. These results highlight the promising performance of the transmon molecule in the high-power regime for high-fidelity qubit readout.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum melting of quasiperiodic attractors in driven-dissipative cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear classical mechanics has established countless intriguing and profound phenomena. These include limit tori defined by toroidal attractors that support quasiperiodic motion of at least two incommensurate frequencies. Here we address the question, whether and how such phenomena persist in open quantum systems. We develop a quantum description of limit tori within the Lindblad master-equation formalism for a system of two coupled driven-dissipative Kerr cavities. Using the spectral theory of the Liouvillian and the truncated Wigner approximation, we analyze the system across the quantum-to-classical transition. In the classical limit, we identify two pairs of purely imaginary Liouvillian eigenvalues, corresponding to persistent quasiperiodic modes of the limit torus. Quantum fluctuations induce small negative real parts to these eigenvalues, giving rise to finite lifetimes of these modes. The corresponding Liouvillian gaps vanish algebraically in the classical limit. This behavior signals a genuine continuous dynamical phase transition, marked by the spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry. Analysis of individual quantum trajectories reveals quantum-fluctuation-induced dephasing as the primary mechanism behind this "quantum melting" of the torus. We quantify this dephasing using a circular-variance-based order parameter, revealing universal scaling with both system size and time. These scaling laws are robust and independent of microscopic parameters. Our results establish the quantum melting of limit tori as a distinct non-equilibrium critical phenomenon and provide concrete signatures for experimental observation in trapped ions and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we study the range of keV positive muons $\mu^+$ implanted in Nb$_2$O$_5$($x$ nm)/Nb($y$ nm)/SiO$_2$(300 nm)/Si [$x$ = 3.6 nm, 3.3 nm; $y$ = 42.0 nm, 60.1 nm] thin films using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR). At implantation energies 1.3 keV $\leq E \leq$ 23.3 keV, we compare the measured diamagnetic $\mu^+$ signal fraction $f_{\mathrm{dia.}}$ against predictions derived from implantation profile simulations using the TRIM.SP Monte Carlo code. Treating the implanted $\mu^+$ as light protons, we find that simulations making use of updated stopping cross section data are in good agreement with the LE-$\mu$SR measurements, in contrast to parameterizations found in earlier tabulations. Implications for other studies relying on accurate $\mu^+$ stopping information are discussed.</description>

      <title>Ergotropy of a Photosynthetic Reaction Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the Photosystem II reaction center using a quantum master equation approach, where excitonic and charge-transfer rates are computed at the Redfield and F\"orster levels with realistic spectral densities. The focus is on ergotropy, the maximum work extractable from a quantum state without energy loss. We compute the ergotropy by constructing passive states in the thermodynamic sense. Among the electron transfer pathways, those involving charge separation between $Chl_{D1}$ and $Phe_{D1}$, as well as a route passing through three sequential charge-separated states, yield higher ergotropy, suggesting greater capacity for work extraction, akin to quantum energy capacitors. A third pathway, bypassing the $Chl_{D1},Phe_{D1}$ pair, shows significantly reduced ergotropy. These differences arise from population-induced transitions between active and passive regimes. Our findings highlight how biological systems may exploit non-equilibrium population structures to optimize energy conversion, connecting quantum thermodynamic principles to biological energy harvesting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted van der Waals materials provide a tunable platform for investigating two-dimensional superconductivity and quantum phases. Using spectra-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we study the superconducting states in twisted bilayer graphene and track their evolution from insulating phases. Gate-dependent spectroscopic measurements reveal two distinct regimes: under-doped ({\nu} = -2.3) and optimally doped ({\nu} = -2.6). In the under-doped regime, partial superconductivity arises, forming a network interspersed with non-gapped regions. At optimal doping, the entire unit cell demonstrates superconductivity, with gap size modulation showing an anti-correlation with the local density of states. This gate-dependent transition from an insulating phase to a modulated superconductor uncovers an unexpected spatial hierarchy in pairing behavior and offers direct microscopic insights to constrain theories of superconductivity in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.</description>

      <title>The Ferroelectric Superconducting Field Effect Transistor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ferroelectric field-effect transistor (Fe-FET) is a three-terminal semiconducting device first introduced in the 1950s. Despite its potential, a significant boost in Fe-FET research occurred about ten years ago with the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide. This material has been incorporated into electronic processes since the mid-2000s. Here, we observed ferroelectricity in a superconducting Josephson FET (Fe-JoFET) operating at cryogenic temperatures below 1 Kelvin. The Fe-JoFET was fabricated on the InAsOI platform, which features an InAs epilayer hosted by an electrical insulating substrate, using HfO2 as the gate insulator, making it a promising candidate due to its ferroelectric properties. The Fe-JoFET exhibits significant hysteresis in the switching current and normal-state resistance transfer characteristics, which depend on the range of gate voltages. This phenomenon opens a new research area exploring the interaction between ferroelectricity and superconductivity in hybrid superconducting-semiconducting systems, with potential applications in cryogenic data storage and computation. Supporting this, the Fe-JoFET was operated as a cryogenic superconducting single memory cell, exhibiting both dissipative and non-dissipative states. Its non-volatility was tested over a 24-hour measurement period. We also demonstrated that the Fe-JoFET can retain information at temperatures above the superconductor critical temperature, resulting in a temperature-fault-tolerant memory cell resistant to temperature oscillations or, in the worst case, cryostat faults.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface phonon arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticles and Quantum Dots as Emerging Optical Sensing Platforms for $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ Detection: Recent Approaches and Perspectives</title>

Abstract: Over the preceding years, nickel (Ni) and its compounds have been increasingly employed in various aspects of human social life, metallurgical/industrial manufactures, healthcare, and chemical processes. Although Ni is considered an essential trace element in biological systems, excessive intake or metabolic deficiency of \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) ions may cause detrimental health effects to living organisms. Therefore, a facile and accurate detection of \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\), especially in environmental and biological settings, is of huge significance. As an efficient detection method, assaying \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) using optical (colorimetric and/or fluorogenic) sensors has experienced quite a vigorous growth period, with a large number of excellent research contributions. Nanomaterial-based optical sensors, including metal nanoparticles (MNPs), quantum dots (QDs), and carbon dots (CDs), offer distinct advantages over conventional small-molecule organic and inorganic sensors. This study mainly provides an overview of the recent advancements and challenges related to the design strategies of various optical nanosensors to selectively detect the \(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}\) ion. Emphasis has also been placed on comparing the sensing performance of various nanosensors, along with exploring future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Magnetic force microscopy versus scanning quantum-vortex microscopy: Probing pinning landscape in granular niobium films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the methodology and fundamental principles associated with newly developed experimental technique -- scanning quantum-vortex microscopy [Hovhannisyan et al., Commun. Mater., vol. 6, 42 (2025)]. This approach appears promising for experimental studies of vortex pinning phenomena in superconducting films and nanodevices. In particular, we studied the magnetic properties of magnetron-sputtered niobium (Nb) films by low-temperature magnetic force microscopy. As the temperature approaches the superconducting critical temperature, the pinning potential caused by structural defects weakens; consequently, the attractive interaction between the magnetic tip of the cantilever and a single-quantum vortex begins to dominate. In this scenario the magnetic probe is capable of trapping a vortex during the scanning process. Because the dragged vortex continues interacting with structural defects, it serves as an efficient nano-probe to explore pinning potentials and visualize grain boundaries in granular Nb films, achieving resolutions (30 nm) comparable to the superconducting coherence length.</description>

      <title>Stealthy-Hyperuniform Wave Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Photonic Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform structures are spatial patterns whose fluctuations disappear on long length scales, making them effectively homogeneous when observed from afar. Mathematically, this means that their spectral density, $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, approaches zero for low wavenumber, $|\textbf{k}|$. Crystalline lattices are hyperuniform, as are certain quasicrystals, maximally random jammed packing of spheres, and electrons in the fractional quantum Hall state. Stealthy-hyperuniformity is an even stronger constraint on the spectral density: it requires that $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$ is strictly zero in a finite range of wavevectors around $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}$, called the stealthy regime, or exclusion region. Since the degree of scattering by disorder is, to leading order, proportional to $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, waves propagating through such structures may do so without scattering for sufficiently long wavelengths and short distances. Here, we measure scattering by disorder in photonic crystal slabs with stealthy-hyperuniform disorder by measuring the linewidths of the photonic bands. We observe the transition between the stealthy and non-stealthy regimes, marked by a sharp increase in linewidth. We also observe the effects of multiple scattering in the stealthy regime, which implies diminishing transparency. Moreover, we show that residual single scattering in the stealthy regime arises from an intrinsically non-Hermitian effect: propagating light has a complex effective mass due to radiative loss out of the slab.</description>

Abstract: We perform a systematic study of the signatures of fragile topology in over 50 nonmagnetic two-dimensional materials with formula AB$_2$, belonging to space group $P$-$3m1$. Using group theory analysis in the framework of topological quantum chemistry, we find fragile bands near the Fermi level for all the materials studied. Since stable topological bands are also present in these systems, the interplay of both phases is discussed, showing that corner charges appear in over 80% of the materials and are linked to fragile topology. Using first-principles calculations, we predict fractionally-charged corner charges protected by $C_3$ symmetry. Our work aims to broaden the scope of materials with experimentally accessible fragile bands.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of boundary criticality and exotic topological semimetals in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently found that, going beyond the tendfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and violating the bulk-boundary correspondence of the usual topological phases, PT-invariant systems support a real Chern insulator with the so-called boundary criticality, which forbids the transition between different orders of topological phases accompanied by the closing and reopening of the bulk-band gap. Here, we fnd that the periodic driving can break the boundary criticality of a PT-invariant system. Setting free from the the boundary criticality, diverse first- and second-order topological phases absent in the static case are found in both the zero and Pi/T modes. The application of our result in the three-dimensional PT-invariant system permits us to discover exotic second-order Dirac and nodal-line semimetals with coexisting surface and hinge Fermi arcs. Enriching the family of the topological phases in PT-invariant systems, our result provides us a useful way to explore novel topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laughlin state embodies a universal class of fractional quantum Hall effects arising in two-dimensional electron systems subjected to strong perpendicular magnetic fields. Conventionally described by a single-component wavefunction, the Laughlin state features fractionally charged quasiparticles arising from correlations within one electron species. Here, we explore a novel physical situation by introducing inter-species Coulomb coupling between two intra-species Laughlin states in a quantum Hall graphene bilayer structure. Although quasiparticle excitations typically exhibit charge gaps of tens of Kelvin, we observe that this energy scale is significantly lowered through interlayer excitonic pairing between quasiparticles and quasiholes. Identified via transport measurements, these excitons belong to an unprecedented category of charge-neutral anyons, opening a new avenue for investigating exotic quantum statistics and phases of matter.</description>

Abstract: We present mumax+, an extensible GPU-accelerated micromagnetic simulator with a Python user interface, to address the challenges posed by current magnetism research into systems with complex magnetic ordering and interfaces. It is a general solver for the space- and time-dependent evolution of the magnetization and related vector quantities, using finite difference discretization. Here, we present its application and design and discuss features not available in \mumaxthree{}, such as the modeling of antiferromagnets with magnetoelastic coupling. As an illustration of its capabilities, we use \mumaxp{} to simulate state of the art magnetic systems. Specifically, we demonstrate the current induced domain wall motion in a polycrystalline antiferromagnet, we simulate the working principle of a strain-driven antiferromagnetic racetrack memory and we reproduce experimentally observed domain structures in a non-collinear antiferromagnet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of an orbital angular momentum (OAM) response to a charge current holds promise for technological applications, allowing electrical control of magnetization dynamics. Often, the OAM current is invoked in explaining experimental results for very large orbital transport effects, but this is conceptually challenging as the OAM current is not a conserved quantity. Instead of utilizing the orbital conductivity associated with the non-conserved OAM current, we here use non-equilibrium Green's functions to directly image the OAM density in real space under an applied electric current bias. We find strong spatial variations in OAM density, with the lattice acting as a source and sink of OAM. Moreover, we show that the OAM response depends sensitively on the angle between the charge current and the crystal axis. This enables the generation of a transverse OAM response in one current direction and solely a longitudinal response in another. We refer to this as an orbital splitter effect, analogous to the spin splitter effect in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>High-performance Andreev interferometer-based electronic coolers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an electronic refrigerator based on a ballistic Andreev interferometer that allows to reach a maximum cooling power per channel up to five orders of magnitude larger than that of the conventional normal metal-insulator-superconductor cooler. This effect is achieved by exploiting the destructive interference that occurs when the superconducting phase difference equals $\pi$. This results in a strongly suppressed charge current below the superconducting gap, while still allowing the extraction of excitations above the gap, leading to a cooler with enhanced performance. Interestingly, we find that such a large cooling power per channel enables the achievement of an electronic temperature close to the theoretical lower bound. Additionally, we derive an approximate expression for this bound in the regime of low bath temperatures. Finally, we propose potential implementations of the ballistic Andreev interferometer cooler using semiconductors, graphene, and topological insulators.</description>

Abstract: We develop a microscopic model to investigate current-induced light emission in single-molecule tunnel junctions, where a two-level system interacts with a plasmonic field. Using the quantum master equation, we explore the transition from weak to strong plasmon-molecule coupling, identifying three distinct regimes governed by cooperativity, which quantifies the interplay between interaction strength and losses. Our findings establish a framework to detect strong coupling, unveiling resonance-dependent features in the emission spectrum and photon correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the nonlinear optical response of crystalline systems is fundamentally a quantum geometric property. In this work, we propose two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which measures the nonlinear conductivity as a function of two independent frequencies using two time-delayed light pulses, as a probe of quantum geometry. We show how the two-frequency second-order nonlinear conductivity, which is naturally measured by 2DCS, decomposes into distinct quantum geometric contributions. We identify a term arising from the multi-band quantum connection that does not appear in linear response, and show that it can be measured in isolation by considering specific polarizations and enforcing time-reversal symmetry. We explore this finding via model calculations for transition metal dichalcogenides and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Through these examples, we demonstrate how 2DCS enables study of the quantum connection, providing a way to compare the quantum geometry of different materials. We also show that one can gain rough momentum-resolved knowledge of the quantum geometry by varying the chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed comparative study of two important theoretical approaches: atomistic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding and continuum eight-band $k \cdot p$ methods, for modeling the spin and optical properties of quantum dots (QDs). Our investigation spans key physical observables, including single-particle energy levels, g-factors, exciton radiative lifetimes, and hyperfine-induced Overhauser field fluctuations. We perform our calculations for self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs QD systems as representative case studies. While both methods yield qualitatively consistent trends, quantitative discrepancies arise due to different treatment of atomistic details, strain effects, and confinement. We introduce targeted corrections to the eight-band $k \cdot p$ framework, including a modified deformation potential scheme and adjusted remote-band contributions, to improve agreement with atomistic results, especially for electron g-factors and single-particle energies. Furthermore, we validate the eight-band implementation of hyperfine interactions by benchmarking it against the tight-binding model, showing reasonable convergence for both electrons and holes. Our results establish criteria for selecting the appropriate modeling framework based on the desired physical accuracy and computational efficiency in spin-optical studies of semiconductor QDs.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by fsLP are coupled self-consistently to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. This theory explains how fsLP, of central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a {\em nonequilibrium spintronic mechanism}. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) decodes frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by {\em nonlocal} damping with the LLG equation due to, explicitly included via TDNEGF, electronic bath. The TDNEGF part of the loop is also used to include excitons via mean-field treatment, utilizing off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, of Coulomb interaction binding conduction-band electrons and valence-band holes. Finally, our theory predicts how excited magnons will {\em pump} time-dependent charge currents into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor that will then emit electromagnetic radiation. The windowed FFT of these signals contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent advantages and limitations. In this work, we introduce the hyperfine structure of entanglement, which decomposes entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases, especially topological gapped state and trivial gapped state. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports soft magnon modes. In particular, we show that these soft modes can mediate pairing through inter-band scattering events that are symmetry-forbidden in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, thus providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity fields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological bands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.</description>

      <title>Strongly Magnetically Tuned Coupling Strength and Nonlinearity in CrSBr Exciton-Polaritons</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors CrSBr offer an ideal platform to achieve exciton-polaritons correlated with magnetic orders for developing solid-state quantum, spintronic, and photonic devices. However, for the exciton-polaritons formed by lower-energy excitons (XL = 1.37 eV), the coupling strength and nonlinear optical response are almost inert to the external magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate robust strong coupling between higher-energy excitons (XH = 1.8 eV) and photons that persists up to room temperature, along with giant magnetic-field tunability. The Rabi splitting energy is tuned up to 100 meV within a moderate 0.45 T in-plane magnetic field due to changes in excitonic states during the spin transitions. Besides, we observe significantly enhanced polariton nonlinearity in the intermediate magnetic phase, which exhibits a distinct mode-number dependence and originates from magnon-assisted long-range attractive interactions and coupling strength reduction. These results advance the development of on-demand polariton platforms for spin-correlated quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>The morphology and interface structure of titanium on graphene</title>

Abstract: Titanium (Ti) is an adhesion and contact metal commonly used in nanoelectronics and two-dimensional (2D) materials research. However, when Ti is deposited on graphene (Gr), we obtain dramatically different film morphology depending on the experimental conditions. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio density functional theory calculations, we show that the most critical parameters are the number of Gr layers, the nature of the Gr support, and the deposition temperature. Particularly distinctive is the island morphology and large defect density of Ti on monolayer Gr, compared to bilayer or thicker Gr. We propose that this results from structural and mechanical differences between monolayer and thicker Gr flakes, where monolayer Gr is more flexible, exhibits larger surface roughness and therefore lower Ti diffusivity, and is more easily damaged. Our results highlight the extreme sensitivity of Ti morphology on Gr to processing and substrate conditions, allowing us to propose design rules for controlling Ti-Gr interface properties and morphology and to discuss the implications for other technologically relevant metal deposition processes.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier--phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier--phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the general explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring appropriate hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.</description>

      <title>Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the atomic structure of magnetite-carboxylic acid interfaces is crucial for tailoring nanocomposites involving this interface. We present a Monte Carlo (MC)-based method utilizing iron oxidation state exchange to model magnetite interfaces with tens of thousands of atoms, scales typically inaccessible by electronic structure calculations. Charge neutrality is ensured by the oxidation of Fe ions. The MC approach allows magnetite to adapt to its environment at interfaces without requiring interface-specific rescaling of force-field parameters. This enables a simple, versatile method. By comparing adsorption sites, layer distances, and bond lengths with results from electronic structure calculations and experiments, we validated the accuracy of our method. We found that the oxidation state distribution and, consequently, binding site preference depend on coverage and surface thickness, with a critical thickness signaling the transition from layered to bulk-like oxidation states. The method ensures seamless compatibility with popular biomolecular force fields providing transferability and simplifying the study of magnetite interfaces in general.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Martensites subjected to quasistatic deformation are known to exhibit power law distributed acoustic emission in a broad range of scales, however, the origin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self-organization towards apparent criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure of intermittent fluctuations can be at least partially interpreted as an effect of inertia. We build on the insight that inertial dynamics, evidenced by acoustic emission, can become an important factor if the underlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the possibility of inertia-induced \textit{heavy-tailed} avalanche size distributions using a prototypical example of a discrete chain with bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia in fully realistic two- and three-dimensional continuum models of elastic phase transitions. In particular, we demonstrate that a three-dimensional model can produce not only qualitative but also quantitative agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Shubnikov-de Haas Oscillations in 2D $\text{PtSe}_2$: A fermiological Charge Carrier Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Demonstration of non-Abelian statistics of Majorana bound states (MBS) is crucial for the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Two-dimensional platforms such as planar Josephson junctions require an in-plane magnetic field to generate a pair of MBS at its non-superconducting channel ends; however, the fixed direction of the in-plane magnetic field puts a constraint on the realization of a multi-terminal topological planar junction, and hence its ability to physically move multiple MBS -- which is necessary for performing the fusion and braiding operations. Here we show that in a planar Josephson junction coupled to a skyrmion crystal, which can generate multiple pairs of MBS in the absence of any external magnetic field, the non-trivial fusion and braiding operations can be performed. Our numerical calculations, designed for realistic two-dimensional quantum systems, certify the feasibility of experimental realization of the proposed device schemes. We find that both $s$-wave and $d$-wave superconducting leads can generate the MBS; indicating that the MBS movement operations can be performed at higher temperatures using $d$-wave superconducting leads. Our results establish that the skyrmion crystal-coupled planar Josephson junction is a viable platform for the generation and controlled movement of the MBS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many quantum technologies require a precise electrical current standard that can only be achieved with expensive cryogenics, or through the secondary standards, such as resistance or voltage. Silicon-based charge pumps could provide such a standard in an inherently scalable way, through their compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication methods. However, coherent quantized charge transfer has so far been demonstrated only in nanoscale devices that are custom-fabricated in academic cleanrooms or research technology foundries. Here, we show that a CMOS device manufactured with commercial 22-nm process node can be used to define a quantum current standard in the International System of Units (SI). We measure an accuracy of (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-3 A/A at 50 MHz with reference to SI voltage and resistance standards in a pumped helium system. We then propose a practical monolithic CMOS chip that incorporates one million parallel connected charge pumps along with on-chip control electronics. This chip could be operated as a table-top primary standard that can be easily integrated with CMOS electronics, generating quantum currents of up to microampere levels.</description>

      <title>Magnetic octupole Hall effect in heavy transition metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: d-wave altermagnets have the magnetic octupole as their primary order parameter. A recent study [Han et al. arXiv 2409.14423 (2024)] demonstrated that magnetic octupole current can induce N\'eel vector dynamics. Therefore, identifying materials that can efficiently generate a magnetic octupole current is essential. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic octupole Hall effect in 4d and 5d transition metals. By employing atomic magnetic octupole operators, we calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity using first-principles calculations. We also explore the microscopic origin of the magnetic octupole Hall effect and find that it results from the combined effect of orbital texture and spin-orbit coupling. Additionally, we analyze the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to magnetic octupole Hall conductivity across various materials and identify those that are optimal for observing magnetic octupole physics. We also discuss potential applications arising from the magnetic octupole Hall effect. Our work serves as a valuable reference for identifying materials suitable for studying magnetic octupole physics.</description>
