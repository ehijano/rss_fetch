      <title>Constructing an Investment Fund through Stock Clustering and Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the application of quantitative portfolio management by using integer programming and clustering techniques. Investors seek to gain the highest profits and lowest risk in capital markets. A data-oriented analysis of US stock universe is used to provide portfolio managers a device to track different Exchange Traded Funds. As an example, reconstructing of NASDAQ 100 index fund is presented.</description>

      <title>Market-Adaptive Ratio for Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional risk-adjusted returns, such as the Treynor, Sharpe, Sortino, and Information ratios, have been pivotal in portfolio asset allocation, focusing on minimizing risk while maximizing profit. Nevertheless, these metrics often fail to account for the distinct characteristics of bull and bear markets, leading to sub-optimal investment decisions. This paper introduces a novel approach called the Market-adaptive Ratio, which was designed to adjust risk preferences dynamically in response to market conditions. By integrating the $\rho$ parameter, which differentiates between bull and bear markets, this new ratio enables a more adaptive portfolio management strategy. The $\rho$ parameter is derived from historical data and implemented within a reinforcement learning framework, allowing the method to learn and optimize portfolio allocations based on prevailing market trends. Empirical analysis showed that the Market-adaptive Ratio outperformed the Sharpe Ratio by providing more robust risk-adjusted returns tailored to the specific market environment. This advance enhances portfolio performance by aligning investment strategies with the inherent dynamics of bull and bear markets, optimizing risk and return outcomes.</description>

      <title>Risk Budgeting Allocation for Dynamic Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and develop an approach for risk budgeting allocation - a risk diversification portfolio strategy - where risk is measured using a dynamic time-consistent risk measure. For this, we introduce a notion of dynamic risk contributions that generalise the classical Euler contributions and which allow us to obtain dynamic risk contributions in a recursive manner. We prove that, for the class of coherent dynamic distortion risk measures, the risk allocation problem may be recast as a sequence of strictly convex optimisation problems. Moreover, we show that self-financing dynamic risk budgeting strategies with initial wealth of 1 are scaled versions of the solution of the sequence of convex optimisation problems. Furthermore, we develop an actor-critic approach, leveraging the elicitability of dynamic risk measures, to solve for risk budgeting strategies using deep learning.</description>
