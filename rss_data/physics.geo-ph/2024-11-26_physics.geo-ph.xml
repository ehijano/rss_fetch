      <title>On extracting coherent seismic wavefield using variational symmetric autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the variational formulation of the Symmetric Autoencoder (SymAE) and its role in achieving disentanglement within the latent space to extract coherent information from a collection of seismic waveforms. Disentanglement involves separating the latent space into components for coherent information shared by all waveforms and components for waveform-specific nuisance information. SymAE employs a generative model that independently generates waveforms based on coherent and nuisance components, and an inference model that estimates these components from observed wavefield. By assuming the independence of waveforms conditioned on coherent information, the model effectively accumulates this information across multiple waveforms. After training, a metric based on Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to evaluate the informativeness of individual waveforms, enabling latent-space optimization and the generation of synthetic seismograms with enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, we applied it to a data set of teleseismic displacement waveforms of the P wave from deep-focus earthquakes. By training the SymAE model on high-magnitude events, we successfully identified seismograms that contained robust source information. Furthermore, we generated high-resolution virtual seismograms enriched with relevant coherent source information and less influenced by scattering noise, allowing a deeper understanding of the characteristics of the earthquake source. Importantly, our method extracts coherent source information without relying on deconvolution, which is often used in traditional source imaging. This enables the analysis of complex earthquakes with multiple rupture episodes, a capability that is not easily achievable with conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian set-up for 4-layer density stratified Euler fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of the Hamiltonian approach to two-dimensional wave motions in heterogeneous fluids proposed by Benjamin, we derive a natural Hamiltonian structure for ideal fluids, density stratified in four homogenous layers, constrained in a channel of fixed total height and infinite lateral length. We derive the Hamiltonian and the equations of motion in the dispersionless long-wave limit, restricting ourselves to the so-called Boussinesq approximation. The existence of special symmetric solutions, which generalize to the four-layer case the ones obtained in the paper for the three-layer case, is examined.</description>

      <title>Developing Global Aerosol Models based on the Analysis of 30-Year Ground Measurements by AERONET (AEROEX models) and Implication on Satellite based Aerosol Retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET), established in 1993 with limited global sites, has grown to over 900 locations, providing three decades of continuous aerosol data. While earlier studies based on shorter time periods (10-12 years) and fewer sites (approximately 250) made significant contributions to aerosol research, the vast AERONET dataset (1993-2023) calls for a comprehensive reevaluation to refine global aerosol models and improve satellite retrievals. This is particularly important in light of major environmental changes such as industrialization, land use shifts, and natural events like wildfires and dust storms. In this study, a set of fine and coarse aerosol models called AERONET-Extended (AEROEX) models are developed based on cluster analysis of 30-years AERONET data, analyzing over 202,000 samples using Gaussian Mixture Models to classify aerosol types by season and region. Aerosols are categorized into spherical, spheroidal, and mixed types using particle linear depolarization ratio and fine mode fraction. Four fine-mode aerosol models were derived based on differences in scattering and absorption properties, revealing regional/seasonal variations, particularly in North America, Europe and Asia. Additionally, two coarse-mode aerosol models were identified, separated by their absorbing properties in dust-prone and polluted regions. We performed simulation analysis showing that the new models significantly improve satellite-based aerosol optical depth retrievals compared to widely used dark target aerosol models. A global aerosol model map, generated at 1x1 degree resolution for each season using Random Forest and expert refinement, provides valuable insights for climate and atmospheric studies, improving satellite-based aerosol retrievals at global scale.</description>

      <title>Global spatio-temporal downscaling of ERA5 precipitation through generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation has a significant impact on human lives by determining freshwater resources and agricultural yield, but also rainfall-driven hazards like flooding or landslides. While the ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides consistent long-term global precipitation information that allows investigations of these impacts, it lacks the resolution to capture the high spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. ERA5 misses intense local rainfall events that are crucial drivers of devastating flooding - a critical limitation since extreme weather events become increasingly frequent. Here, we introduce spateGAN-ERA5, the first deep learning based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global scale. SpateGAN-ERA5 uses a conditional generative adversarial neural network (cGAN) that enhances the resolution of ERA5 precipitation data from 24 km and 1 hour to 2 km and 10 minutes, delivering high-resolution rainfall fields with realistic spatio-temporal patterns and accurate rain rate distribution including extremes. Its computational efficiency enables the generation of a large ensemble of solutions, addressing uncertainties inherent to the challenges of downscaling. Trained solely on data from Germany and validated in the US and Australia considering diverse climate zones, spateGAN-ERA5 demonstrates strong generalization indicating a robust global applicability. SpateGAN-ERA5 fulfils a critical need for high-resolution precipitation data in hydrological and meteorological research, offering new capabilities for flood risk assessment, AI-enhanced weather forecasting, and impact modelling to address climate-driven challenges worldwide.</description>

      <title>A rotational ellipsoid model for solid Earth tide with high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid Earth tide represents the response of solid Earth to the lunar (solar) gravitational force. The yielding solid Earth due to the force has been thought to be a prolate ellipsoid since the time of Lord Kelvin, yet the ellipsoid's geometry such as major semi-axis's length, minor semi-axis's length, and flattening remains unresolved. Additionally, the tidal displacement of reference point is conventionally resolved through a combination of expanded potential equations and given Earth model. Here we present a geometric model in which both the ellipsoid's geometry and the tidal displacement of reference point can be resolved through a rotating ellipse with respect to the Moon (Sun). We test the geometric model using 23-year gravity data from 22 superconducting gravimeter (SG) stations and compare it with the current model recommended by the IERS (International Earth Rotation System) conventions (2010), the average Root Mean Square (RMS) deviation of the gravity change yielded by the geometric model against observation is 6.47 \mu Gal (equivalent to 2.07 cm), while that yielded by the current model is 30.77 \mu Gal (equivalent to 9.85 cm). The geometric model will greatly contribute to many application fields such as geodesy, geophysics, astronomy, and oceanography.</description>
