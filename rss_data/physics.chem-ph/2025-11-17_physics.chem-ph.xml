      <title>Enhanced sensitivity to variations of fundamental constants in highly charged molecules from analytic perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-forbidden electronic transitions in atoms and quasi-degenerate vibronic transitions in molecules serve as powerful probes of hypothetical temporal variations of fundamental constants. Computation of the sensitivity of a transition to a variation of the fine-structure constant is conventionally performed by numerical variation of the speed of light in sophisticated electronic structure calculations, and therewith several individual calculations have to be performed. An approach is presented herein that obtains sensitivity coefficients as first order perturbation to the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian and allows their computation as expectation values of the relativistic kinetic energy and rest-mass operators. These are available in essentially all \emph{ab initio} relativistic electronic structure codes. Additionally, the corresponding operators for two-component Hamiltonians are derived, explicitly for the zeroth order regular approximation Hamiltonian. The approach is applied to demonstrate great sensitivity of highly charged polar molecules that were recently proposed for high-precision spectroscopy in [Z\"ulch \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2203.10333[physics.chem-ph]]. In particular, a high sensitivity of a wealth of quasi-degenerate vibronic transitions in PaF$^{3+}$ and CeF$^{2+}$ to temporal variations of the fine-structure constant and the electron-proton mass ratio is shown.</description>

      <title>Van-der-Waals exchange-correlation functionals and their high pressure and warm dense matter applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate basic hydrogen quantities like the molecular bond length, the molecular dissociation energy and the van-der-Waals interaction in idealized situations in an effort to discern a suitable exchange-correlation functional for the molecular to metal transition in warm dense hydrogen. The best reproduction of bond length and dissociation energy is given by the r2SCAN functional, several vdW functionals and also HSE06 fair qualitatively and quantitatively no better than PBE or worse. In addition we investigate quantities like the static and dynamic ion structure factor, and the electronic DOS to determine differences between exchange-correlation functionals with and without van-der-Waals corrections in the transition region from the molecular to the metallic regime of hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Correlated Purification for Restoring $N$-Representability in Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography offers a scalable route to estimating properties of quantum states, but the resulting reduced density matrices (RDMs) often violate constraints that ensure they represent $N$-electron states -- known as $N$-representability conditions -- because of statistical and hardware noise. We present a correlated purification framework based on semidefinite programming to restore accuracy to these noisy, unphysical two-electron RDMs. The method performs a bi-objective optimization that minimizes both the many-electron energy and the nuclear norm of the change in the measured 2-RDM. The nuclear norm, often employed in matrix completion, promotes low-rank, physically meaningful corrections to the 2-RDM, while the energy term acts as a regularization term that can improve the purity of the ground state. While the method is particularly effective for the ground state, it can also be applied to excited and non-stationary states by decreasing the weight of the energy relative to the error norm. In an application to fermionic shadow tomography of large hydrogen chains, correlated purification yields substantial reductions in both energy and 2-RDM error, achieving chemical accuracy across dissociation curves. This framework provides a robust strategy for tomography in many-body quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>SCULPT: An Interactive Machine Learning Platform for Analyzing Multi-Particle Coincidence Data from Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SCULPT (Supervised Clustering and Uncovering Latent Patterns with Training), a comprehensive software platform for analyzing tabulated high-dimensional multi-particle coincidence data from Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) experiments. The software addresses critical challenges in modern momentum spectroscopy by integrating advanced machine learning techniques with physics-informed analysis in an interactive web-based environment. SCULPT implements Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for non-linear dimensionality reduction to reveal correlations in highly dimensional data. We also discuss potential extensions to deep autoencoders for feature learning, and genetic programming for automated discovery of physically meaningful observables. A novel adaptive confidence scoring system provides quantitative reliability assessments by evaluating user-selected clustering quality metrics with predefined weights that reflect each metric's robustness. The platform features configurable molecular profiles for different experimental systems, interactive visualization with selection tools, and comprehensive data filtering capabilities. Utilizing a subset of SCULPT's capabilities, we analyze photo double ionization data measured using the COLTRIMS method for 3-body dissociation of the D2O molecule, revealing distinct fragmentation channels and their correlations with physics parameters. The software's modular architecture and web-based implementation make it accessible to the broader atomic and molecular physics community, significantly reducing the time required for complex multi-dimensional analyses. This opens the door to finding and isolating rare events exhibiting non-linear correlations on the fly during experimental measurements, which can help steer exploration and improve the efficiency of experiments.</description>

      <title>Counterintuitive Potential-Barrier Affinity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron accumulation in interatomic regions is a fundamental quantum phenomenon dictating chemical bonding and material properties, yet its origin remains elusive across disciplines. Here, we report a counterintuitive quantum effect -- potential-barrier affinity (PBA) -- revealed by solving the Schr\"odinger equation for a crystalline potential. PBA effect drives significant interatomic electron accumulation when electron energy exceeds the barrier maximum. This effect essentially determines interatomic electron density patterns, governing microstructures and properties of condensed matters. Our theory overturns the traditional wisdom that the interstitial electron localization in electride requires potential-well constraints or hybrid orbitals, and it serves the fundamental mechanism underlying the formation of conventional chemical bonds. This work delivers a paradigm shift in understanding electron distribution and establishes a theoretical foundation for the microscopic design of material properties.</description>

      <title>Real-fluid behavior in rapid compression machines: Does it matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid compression machines (RCMs) have been extensively used to quantify fuel autoignition chemistry and validate chemical kinetic models. Historically, the analyses of experimental and modeling RCM autoignition data have been conducted based on the adiabatic core hypothesis where real-fluid behavior has been completely overlooked, though this might be significant at common RCM test conditions. This work presents a first-of-its-kind study that addresses two significant questions for autoignition studies within RCMs in the fundamental combustion community: (i) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs affect interpretation and analysis of RCM experimental data? and (ii) can real-fluid behavior in RCMs affect RCM autoignition modeling and the validation of chemical kinetic models? To this end, theories for real-fluid isentropic change are newly proposed and derived based on high-order Virial EoS, and are further incorporated into an effective-volume real-fluid autoignition modeling framework newly developed for RCMs. With detailed analyses, the strong real-fluid behavior in common RCM tests is confirmed, which can greatly influence the interpretation of RCM autoignition experiments, particularly the determination of end-of-compression temperature and evolution of the adiabatic core in the reaction chamber. Furthermore, real-fluid RCM modeling results reveal that considerable error can be introduced into simulating RCM autoignition experiments when assuming ideal-gas behavior, leading to contradictory validation results of chemical kinetic models. Therefore, we recommend the community adopt frameworks with real-fluid behavior fully accounted for to analyze and simulate past and future RCM experiments, so as to avoid misinterpretation of RCM autoignition experiments and eliminate the errors that can be introduced into the simulation results with the existing RCM modeling frameworks.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Relativistic Coupled Cluster and Equation of Motion Coupled Cluster Quadratic Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation of relativistic coupled cluster quadratic response theory (QR-CC), following our development of relativistic equation of motion coupled cluster quadratic response theory (QR-EOMCC) [X. Yuan et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2023, 19, 9248]. These codes, which can be used in combination with relativistic (2- and 4-component based) as well as non-relativistic Hamiltonians, are capable of treating both static and dynamic perturbations for electric and magnetic operators. We have employed this new implementation to revisit the calculation of static and frequency-dependent first hyperpolarizabilities of hydrogen halides (HX, X=F-Ts) and the Verdet constant of heavy noble gas atoms (Xe, Rn, Og) and of selected hydrogen halides (HF to HI), in order to investigate the differences and similarities of QR-CC and the more approximate QR-EOMCC. Furthermore, we have determined the relative importance of scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit coupling to these properties, through a comparison of different Hamiltonians, and extended our calculations to superheavy element species (HTs for hyperpolarizabilities, Og for the Verdet constant). Our results show that as one moves towards the bottom of the periodic table, QR-EOMCC can yield rather different results (hyperpolarizabilities) or perform rather similarly (Verdet constant) to QR-CC. These results underscore the importance of further characterizing the performance of QR-EOMCC for heavy element systems.</description>

      <title>Information encoding in spherical DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spherical density functional theory (DFT) is a reformulation of the classic theorems of DFT, in which the role of the total density of a many-electron system is replaced by a set of sphericalized densities, constructed by spherically-averaging the total electron density about each atomic nucleus. In Hohenberg-Kohn DFT and its constrained-search generalization, the electron density suffices to reconstruct the spatial locations and atomic numbers of the constituent atoms, and thus the external potential. However, the original proofs of spherical DFT require knowledge of the atomic locations at which each sphericalized density originates, in addition to the set of sphericalized densities themselves. In the present work, we utilize formal results from geometric algebra -- in particular, the subfield of distance geometry -- to show that for Coulombic systems this spatial information is encoded within the ensemble of sphericalized densities themselves, and does not require independent specification. Consequently, the set of sphericalized densities uniquely determines the total external potential of the system, exactly as in Hohenberg-Kohn DFT. This theoretical result is illustrated through numerical examples for LiF and for glycine, the simplest amino acid. In addition to establishing a sound practical foundation for spherical DFT as applied to Coulombic systems, the extended theorem provides a rationale for the use of sphericalized atomic basis densities -- rather than orientation-dependent basis functions -- when designing classical or machine-learned potentials for atomistic simulation.</description>

      <title>Insights into Symmetry and Substitution Patterns Governing Singlet-Triplet Energy Gap in the Chemical Space of Azaphenalenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecules that violate Hund's rule by exhibiting an inverted singlet-triplet gap (STG), where the first excited singlet (S$_1$) lies below the triplet (T$_1$), are rare but hold great promise as efficient fifth-generation light emitters. Azaphenalenes (APs) represent one of the few known molecular classes capable of such inversion of the S$_1$/T$_1$ energy ordering, yet a systematic exploration of all unique APs is lacking. Here, we investigate 104 distinct APs and classify them based on their adherence to or deviation from Hund's rule using S$_1$-T$_1$ gaps computed with the Laplace-transformed second-order coupled-cluster method (L-CC2). To capture substitution-dependent pseudo-Jahn-Teller distortions that are inadequately described by MP2 and DFT methods, we employ an extrapolative geometry scheme to estimate equilibrium structures at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level. We find three APs to undergo $D_{\rm 3h} \rightarrow C_{\rm 3h}$ and ten to show $C_{\rm 2v}\rightarrow C_{\rm s}$ symmetry lowering, leading to a total of 117 configurations of 104 unique APs. Our study identifies top candidates with inverted STGs, revealing how substitution and symmetry-lowering modulate these gaps to uncover new stable AP cores that provide promising targets for designing molecular light-emitters.</description>

      <title>The advent of fully variational quantum eigensolvers using a hybrid multiresolution approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In electronic structure theory, variational methods offer a valuable paradigm for approximating electronic ground states. However, for historical reasons, this principle is mostly restricted to model chemistries in pre-defined fixed basis sets. Especially in quantum computation, these model chemistries are far from an accurate description of the initial electronic Hamiltonian. This work demonstrates a \textit{fully} variational approach to the electronic structure problem by optimizing the orbitals that represent the second-quantized Hamiltonian, alongside a quantum circuit that generates the many-electron wavefunction. To this end, the orbitals are represented within an adaptive multi-wavelet format, guaranteeing numerical precision. We then present explicit numerical protocols and highlight the quantum circuit's role in determining the optimal orbital basis.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Dust-Catalyzed Molecular Hydrogen Formation Enabled by Nuclear Quantum Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) plays a critical role in astrophysical processes from galaxy evolution to the formation of planets. While the dominant formation channel in the interstellar medium is considered as dust-catalyzed H$_2$ formation, this process could become inefficient at low temperatures suppressed by the Boltzmann factor. This work demonstrates that quantum tunneling can dominate the formation of H$_2$, resolving the long-standing problem of formation efficiency. Path integral Monte Carlo simulations reveals that the quantum tunneling of hydrogen atoms maintains stable reaction rates at temperatures below 50 K on both graphitic and silicate grain surfaces. Kinetic Monte Carlo calculations further indicate that the actual H$_2$ formation efficiency is governed not by atomic diffusion, but rather by the energy barriers associated with chemisorption, desorption, and the association of two hydrogen atoms. These findings establish a robust physical basis for dust-catalyzed H$_2$ formation, offer quantitative reaction rates for refining astrophysical models, and provide a framework for interpreting observations of interstellar molecular materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the manuscript of my "Habilitation \`a diriger des recherches", where I present the research work that I have done after my PhD, defended in 2009. The manuscript is divided in two parts. The first one is dedicated to atomic-structure calculations with neutral and trivalent lanthanides, in the contexts of ultracold gases and rare-earth doped solids. The second part deals with long-range interactions in ultracold gases of alkali-metal atoms and diatomic molecules, as well as lanthanide atoms. The detailed description of long-range interactions serves to characterize ultralow-temperature phenomena, like photoassociation and collisional shielding.</description>
