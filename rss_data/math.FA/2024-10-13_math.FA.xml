      <title>The Hahn-Banach theorem in spaces of nonlinear generalized functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a suitable version of the Hahn-Banach theorem within the framework of Colombeau spaces, a class of spaces used to model generalized functions. Our approach addresses the case where maps are defined $\varepsilon$-wise, which simplifies the framework and makes the extension of linear functionals more manageable. As an application of our main result, we demonstrate the separation of convex sets in Colombeau spaces.</description>

      <title>Stability of shifts, interpolation, and crystalline measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V^p_\Gamma(\mathcal{G}),1\leq p\leq\infty,$ be the quasi shift-invariant space generated by $\Gamma$-shifts of a function $\mathcal{G}$, where $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}$ is a separated set. For several large families of generators $\mathcal{G}$, we present necessary and sufficient conditions on $\Gamma$ that imply that the $\Gamma$-shifts of $\mathcal{G}$ form an unconditional basis for $V^p_\Gamma(\mathcal{G})$. The connection between this property, interpolation, universal interpolation, and crystalline measures is discussed.</description>

      <title>Weyl type theorems for hypercyclic/supercyclic operators and Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study property $(UW_E)$ for hypercyclic and supercyclic operators. Further, we study the stability of variant of Weyl type theorems under compact perturbation for Toeplitz operators on Bergman space. Also, we give some examples of Toeplitz operators satisfying Weyl type theorems on Bergman space and harmonic Bergman space.</description>

      <title>On the limiting Horn inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Horn inequalities characterise the possible spectra of triples of $n$-by-$n$ Hermitian matrices $A+B=C$. We study integral inequalities that arise as limits of Horn inequalities as $n \to \infty$. These inequalities are parametrised by the points of an infinite-dimensional convex body, the asymptotic Horn system $\mathscr{H}$, which can be regarded as a topological closure of the countable set of Horn inequalities for all finite $n$.
  We prove three main results. The first shows that arbitrary points of $\mathscr{H}$ can be well approximated by specific sets of finite-dimensional Horn inequalities. The second is a quantitative result on the redundancy of the Horn inequalities in an infinite-dimensional setting. Concretely, the Horn inequalities for finite $n$ are indexed by certain sets $T^n_r$ with $1 \le r \le n-1$; we show that if $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ and $(r_k)_{k \ge 1}$ are any sequences such that $(r_k / n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ is a dense subset of $(0,1)$, then the Horn inequalities indexed by the sets $T^{n_k}_{r_k}$ are sufficient to imply all of the others.
  Our third main result shows that $\mathscr{H}$ has a remarkable self-characterisation property. Namely, membership in $\mathscr{H}$ is determined by the very inequalities corresponding to the points of $\mathscr{H}$ itself. To illuminate this phenomenon, we sketch a general theory of sets that characterise themselves in the sense that they parametrise their own membership criteria, and we consider the question of what further information would be needed in order for this self-characterisation property to determine the Horn inequalities uniquely.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds for Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces for Orbits of an Iterated Function System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key problems in learning theory is to compute a function $f$ that closely approximates the relationship between some input $x$ and corresponding output $y$, such that $y\approx f(x)$. This approximation is based on sample points $(x_t,y_t)_{t=1}^{m}$, where the function $f$ can be approximated within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces using various learning algorithms. In the context of learning theory, it is usually customary to assume that the sample points are drawn independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from an unknown underlying distribution. However, we relax this i.i.d. assumption by considering an input sequence $(x_t)_{t\in {\mathbb N}}$ as a trajectory generated by an iterated function system, which forms a particular Markov chain, with $(y_t)_{t\in {\mathbb N}}$ corresponding to an observation sequence when the model is in the corresponding state $x_t$. For such a process, we approximate the function $f$ using the Markov chain stochastic gradient algorithm and estimate the error by deriving upper bounds within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Characterization of weakly porous sets via dyadic coverings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the class of weakly porous sets in Euclidean spaces. As our main goal, we give a precise characterization in terms of dyadic covering of these sets. Also, we obtain the Carleson embedding inequality for porous sets.</description>

      <title>Operator-Valued Kernels, Machine Learning, and Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of kernel optimization, we prove a result that yields new factorizations and realizations. Our initial context is that of general positive operator-valued kernels. We further present implications for Hilbert space-valued Gaussian processes, as they arise in applications to dynamics and to machine learning. Further applications are given in non-commutative probability theory, including a new non-commutative Radon--Nikodym theorem.</description>

      <title>Measures in the dual of $BV$: perimeter bounds and relations with divergence-measure fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze some properties of the measures in the dual of the space $BV$, by considering (signed) Radon measures satisfying a perimeter bound condition, which means that the absolute value of the measure of a set is controlled by the perimeter of the set itself, and whose total variations also belong to the dual of $BV$. We exploit and refine the results of [25](Phuc, Torres 2017), in particular exploring the relation with divergence-measure fields and proving the stability of the perimeter bound from sets to $BV$ functions under a suitable approximation of the given measure. As an important tool, we obtain a refinement of Anzellotti-Giaquinta approximation for $BV$ functions, which is of separate interest in itself and, in the context of Anzellotti's pairing theory for divergence-measure fields, implies a new way of approximating $\lambda$-pairings, as well as new bounds for their total variation. These results are also relevant due to their application in the study of weak solutions to the non-parametric prescribed mean curvature equation with measure data, which is explored in a subsequent work.</description>
