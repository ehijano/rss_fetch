      <title>Sparse modeling study to extract spectral functions from lattice QCD data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectral functions extracted from Euclidean-time correlation functions by using sparse modeling. Sparse modeling is a method that solves inverse problems by considering only the sparseness of the solution we seek. To check applicability of the method, we firstly test it with mock data which imitate charmonium correlation functions on a fine lattice. We show that the method can reconstruct the resonance peaks in the spectral functions. Then, we extract charmonium spectral functions from correlation functions obtained from lattice QCD at temperatures below and above the critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$. We show that this method yields results like those obtained with MEM and other methods.</description>

      <title>Utility of a hybrid approach to the hadronic vacuum polarisation contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate calculation of the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarisation (LOHVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_\mu$) is key to determining whether a discrepancy, suggesting new physics, exists between the Standard Model and experimental results. This calculation can be expressed as an integral over Euclidean time of a current-current correlator $G(t)$, where $G(t)$ can be calculated using lattice QCD or, with dispersion relations, from experimental data for $e^+e^-\to\mbox{hadrons}$. The BMW/DMZ collaboration recently presented a hybrid approach in which $G(t)$ is calculated using lattice QCD for most of the contributing $t$ range, but using experimental data for the largest $t$ (lowest energy) region. Here we study the advantages of varying the position $t=t_1$ separating lattice QCD from data-driven contributions. The total LOHVP contribution should be independent of $t_1$, providing both a test of the experimental input and the robustness of the hybrid approach. We use this criterion and a correlated fit to show that Fermilab/HPQCD/MILC lattice QCD results from 2019 strongly favour the CMD-3 cross-section data for $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ over a combination of earlier experimental results for this channel. Further, the resulting total LOHVP contribution obtained is consistent with the result obtained by BMW/DMZ, and supports the scenario in which there is no significant discrepancy between the experimental value for $a_\mu$ and that expected in the Standard Model. We then discuss how improved lattice results in this hybrid approach could provide a more accurate total LOHVP across a wider range of $t_1$ values with an uncertainty that is smaller than that from either lattice QCD or data-driven approaches on their own.</description>

      <title>Progress on Holographic Vacuum Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarise highlights from an ongoing research programme that aims, in the long run, at the ambitious goal of building a realistic, complete holographic composite-Higgs model. This contribution focuses on vacuum misalignment, by showing how to unify its description, as a phenomenon arising from weak coupling considerations, in the holographic description of a strongly coupled field theory in terms of a dual gravity theory. This is achieved by a non-trivial treatment of boundary-localised terms in the gravity action. The gravity backgrounds considered are completely regular and smooth. We provide numerical examples showing that the mass spectrum of particles in the four-dimensional theory is free of pathologies, and that a small hierarchy arises naturally, between the light states that, in this simplified set up, are analogous to the standard-model particles, and all the other, new composite states emerging in the strongly coupled theory.</description>

      <title>Precise prediction of the decay rate for $\eta_b\to \gamma \gamma$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the decay rate for $\eta_b \to \gamma \gamma$ in lattice QCD for the first time, providing a precise prediction for the Belle II experiment. Our calculation includes $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks in the sea, using gluon field configurations generated by the MILC collaboration, at three values of the lattice spacing from $0.06\;\mathrm{fm}$ to $0.03\;\mathrm{fm}$. All quarks are treated in the Highly Improved Staggered Quark formalism, which enables us to reach the $b$ quark mass for our valence quarks on these fine lattices. By working at additional heavy quark masses between those of $c$ and $b$ we also map out the behaviour of the ratio $f_{\eta_h}/(M_{\eta_h}^2F_{\eta_h}(0,0))$, where $f$ is the decay constant, $M$, the mass and $F(0,0)$, the form factor for decay to two on-shell photons for the pseudoscalar heavyonium meson, $\eta_h$. This ratio takes the approximate value 0.5 in leading-order non-relativistic QCD but we are able to give a much more accurate analysis than this. Focussing on the $b$ quark mass, we find a ratio of $0.468(11)$, giving $\Gamma (\eta_b \to \gamma \gamma) = 0.557(32)_{\text{fit}}(1)_{\text{syst}} \: \mathrm{keV}$. Combined with a value for the branching fraction from potential nonrelativistic QCD, our result can be used to determine the total width of the $\eta_b$ with a $7\%$ uncertainty.</description>

      <title>From data to the analytic S-matrix: A Bootstrap fit of the pion scattering amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to fit experimental data using a UV complete amplitude ansatz satisfying the constraints of Analyticity, Crossing, and Unitarity. We focus on $\pi\pi$ scattering combining both experimental and lattice data. The fit strategy requires using S-matrix Bootstrap methods and non-convex Particle Swarm Optimization techniques. Using this procedure, we numerically construct a full-fledged scattering amplitude that fits the data and contains the known QCD spectrum that couples to $\pi \pi$ states below $1.4$ GeV. The amplitude constructed agrees below the two-particle threshold with the two-loop $\chi$PT prediction. Moreover, we correctly predict the $D_2$ phase shift, the appearance of a spin three state, and the behavior of the high-energy total cross-section. Finally, we find a genuine tetraquark resonance around 2 GeV, which we argue might be detected by looking into the decays of B mesons.</description>

      <title>The chiral transition and meson melting within improved holographic soft wall models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the chiral transition for the quark condensate and the melting of scalar and vector mesons in two-flavor holographic QCD. This is done by extending the improved holographic soft wall models proposed in [1] to finite temperature, by means of introducing an asymptotically AdS black brane. We find that the chiral transition is second order in the chiral limit and a crossover for physical quark masses, as expected in two-flavor QCD. We investigate the melting of vector and scalar mesons in the deconfined plasma through the calculation of hadronic spectral functions. Fixing the model parameters by the meson spectrum at zero temperature, we find that the mesons melt at temperatures between $90$ and $110$ MeV and the chiral transition occurs around $129$ MeV. We also provide a prediction for the hydrodynamic diffusion constant associated with a flavor current in the deconfined plasma.</description>

      <title>Evaluating matrix power series with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cayley-Hamilton theorem is used to implement an iterative process for the efficient numerical computation of matrix power series and their differentials. In addition to straight-forward applications in lattice gauge theory simulations e.g. to reduce the computational cost of smearing, the method can also be used to simplify the evaluation of SU(N) one-link integrals or the computation of SU(N) matrix logarithms.</description>
